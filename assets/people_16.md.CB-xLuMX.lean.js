Clements has been dubbed the Father of Hillbilly Jazz, an improvisational style that blends and borrows from swing, hot jazz, and bluegrass along with roots also in country and other musical traditions. Biography Clements was born in Kinard, Florida,Vassar Clements at answers.com but grew up in Kissimmee. He taught himself to play the fiddle at age 7, learning \\"There's an Old Spinning Wheel in the Parlor\\" as his first song. Soon, he joined with two first cousins, Red and Gerald, to form a local string band. In his early teens Clements met Bill Monroe and the Blue Grass Boys when they came to Florida to visit Clements' stepfather, a friend of fiddler Chubby Wise. Clements was impressed with his playing. In late 1949 Wise left Monroe's group, and the 21 year-old Clements traveled by bus to ask for an audition. When told he would have to return the next day, Clements was crestfallen, lacking the money for either a hotel room or return bus trip. Monroe gave him some money to a night's lodging, and the next day Clements auditioned and was hired. He remained with Monroe for seven years, recording with the band in 1950 and 1951. He soon became one of the most distinctive, inventive, and popular fiddlers in bluegrass music. His virtuosity and ability to blend several different genres, including swing and hot jazz, made him a pioneer in country music and much sought-after session musician. Between 1957 and 1962, he was a member of the bluegrass band Jim and Jesse & the Virginia Boys. He also gained recognition joining with the popular bluegrass duo of Flatt and Scruggs on the popular theme to the hit television sitcom The Beverly Hillbillies. Earl Scruggs' path-breaking banjo style had premiered with Bill Monroe in the late 1940s, and thereafter gained widespread renown with Lester Flatt and the Foggy Mountain Boys. Stardom was within his grasp. By the mid-1960s, however, his struggles with alcohol left him making his living in blue-collar trades, being employed briefly at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida as a plumber, in a Georgia paper mill, and as switchman for Atlantic Coast Line Railroad. He even sold insurance and once operated a convenience store while owning a potato chip franchise in Huntsville, Alabama. Sobering up, he returned to Nashville in 1967, where he became a much sought- after studio musician. After a brief touring stint with Faron Young he joined John Hartford's Dobrolic Plectral Society in 1971 when he met guitarist Norman Blake and Dobro player Tut Taylor, and recorded Aereo-Plain, a widely acclaimed \\"newgrass\\" album that helped broaden the bluegrass market and sound. After less than a year he joined up with Earl Scruggs. His 1972 work with the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band on their album Will the Circle be Unbroken earned even wider acclaim, and he later worked on the Grateful Dead's Wake of the Flood and Jimmy Buffett's A White Sport Coat and a Pink Crustacean. Within the next two years, Clements would cut his first solo album. In 1973 he joined and toured with the bluegrass supergroup Old & In the Way with Jerry Garcia, David Grisman, Peter Rowan, and John Kahn; their self-titled live album Old & In the Way was released in 1975. Clements in 1974 In 1974 he lent his talents to Highway Call, a solo album by former Allman Brothers Band guitarist Dickey Betts. He was considered by many to be an outstanding fiddle virtuoso and he described his talent saying, In his 50-year career he played with artists ranging from Woody Herman and the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band to the Grateful Dead, Linda Ronstadt, and Paul McCartney, and earned at least five Grammy Award nominations and numerous professional accolades. He once recorded with the pop group the Monkees by happenstance, when he stayed behind after an earlier recording session. He also appeared in Robert Altman's 1975 film Nashville and Alan Rudolph's 1976 film, Welcome to L.A.. He made a duet album with Stéphane Grappelli Together at Last in 1987. In 2004 he performed in concert with jazz quartet Third Stream – in which a video documentary of the concert was done with Jim Easton (guitar), Tom Strohman (sax), Jim Miller (bass), and John Peifer (drums). http://www.vassarclements.com/tourdates_2004.html Though he played numerous instruments, Clements indicated that he chose the fiddle over guitar recalling that, \\"I picked up a guitar and fiddle and tried them both out. The guitar was pretty easy, but I couldn't get nothing out of the fiddle. So every time I'd see those instruments sitting side by side, I'd grab that fiddle.\\" Big band and swing music were considerable influences upon his style and musical development, and he said that, \\"Bands like Glenn Miller, Les Brown, Tommy Dorsey, Harry James and Artie Shaw were very popular when I was a kid. I always loved rhythm, so I guess in the back of my mind the swing and jazz subconsciously comes out when I play, because when I was learning I was always trying to emulate the big-band sounds I heard on my fiddle.\\" Vassar Clements played on over 200 albums, including nearly 40 on which he starred or was featured. His albums often featured newgrass style music and what Clements called \\"Hillbilly Jazz\\". His last album, Livin' With the Blues, released in 2004, was his only blues recording; it featured guest appearances by Elvin Bishop, Norton Buffalo, Maria Muldaur, and others. His 2005 Grammy Award for Best Country Instrumental Performance was for \\"Earl's Breakdown,\\" by the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, and featured Clements, Earl Scruggs, Randy Scruggs, and Jerry Douglas. Clements, whose last performance was February 4, 2005 in Jamestown, N.Y., died on August 16, 2005 at age 77 of lung cancer.

The barometer question is an example of an incorrectly designed examination question demonstrating functional fixedness that causes a moral dilemma for the examiner. In its classic form, popularized by American test designer professor Alexander Calandra (1911–2006), the question asked the student to \\"show how it is possible to determine the height of a tall building with the aid of a barometer.\\" The examiner was confident that there was one, and only one, correct answer, which is by calculating the difference in pressure at the top and bottom of the building. Contrary to the examiner's expectations, the student responded with a series of completely different answers. These answers were also correct, yet none of them proved the student's competence in the specific academic field being tested. The barometer question achieved the status of an urban legend; according to an internet meme, the question was asked at the University of Copenhagen and the student was Niels Bohr.http://naturelovesmath-en.blogspot.in/2011/06/niels- bohr-barometer-question-myth.html The Kaplan, Inc. ACT preparation textbook describes it as an \\"MIT legend\\",Kaplan, p. 52. and an early form is found in a 1958 American humor book.Reader's Digest Treasury of Wit & Humor, p. 303 However, Calandra presented the incident as a real-life, first-person experience that occurred during the Sputnik crisis.Calandra, Alexander, \\"Angels on a Pin\\".

Calandra's account  A colleague of Calandra posed the barometer question to a student, expecting the correct answer: \\"the height of the building can be estimated in proportion to the difference between the barometer readings at the bottom and at the top of the building\\".A classic in-depth discussion of the subject was presented in 1823 by Rev. Baden Powell in Measurement of Heights by the Barometer, published in volume 22, numbers I through V, of the Annals of Philosophy. For a modern presentation of the same subject, see Silverman, pp. 40-48. The particular formula sought by Calandra's examiner is marked with index 2.12 on page 41. The student provided a different, and also correct answer: \\"Take the barometer to the top of the building. Attach a long rope to it, lower the barometer to the street, then bring it up, measuring the length of the rope. The length of the rope is the height of the building.\\"Calandra, Alexander, \\"Angels on a Pin\\". Reproduced in Barnes et al., pp. 228-229. p. 228. The examiner and Calandra, who was called to advise on the case, faced a moral dilemma. According to the format of the exam, a correct answer deserved a full credit. But issuing a full credit would have violated academic standards by rewarding a student who had not demonstrated competence in the academic field that had been tested (physics). Neither of two available options (pass or fail) was morally acceptable. Calandra asked the student the same question, and received a wealth of different answers including dropping the barometer from the top of the building and timing its fall with a stopwatch; trading the barometer to the building's superintendent in return for the information wanted; creating two small pendulums and measuring the variation of g from the ground to the top of the building; creating a pendulum as high as the building and measuring its period; and comparing the length of the shadows of the building and the barometer. The student admitted that he knew the expected \\"correct\\" answer, but was fed up with the professor's \\"teaching him how to think ... rather than teaching him the structure of the subject.\\"  Internet meme  According to Snopes.com, more recent (1999 and 1988) versions identify the problem as a question in \\"a physics degree exam at the University of Copenhagen\\" and the student was Niels Bohr, and includes the following answers:snopes.com: The Barometer Problem * Tying a piece of string to the barometer, lowering the barometer from the roof to the ground, and measuring the length of the string and barometer. * Dropping the barometer off the roof, measuring the time it takes to hit the ground, and calculating the building's height assuming constant acceleration under gravity. * When the sun is shining, standing the barometer up, measuring the height of the barometer and the lengths of the shadows of both barometer and building, and finding the building's height using similar triangles. * Tying a piece of string to the barometer, and swinging it like a pendulum both on the ground and on the roof, and from the known pendulum length and swing period, calculate the gravitational field for the two cases. Use Newton's law of gravitation to calculate the radial altitude of both the ground and the roof. The difference will be the height of the building. * Tying a piece of string to the barometer, which is as long as the height of the building, and swinging it like a pendulum, and from the swing period, calculate the pendulum length. * Marking off the number of barometer lengths vertically along the emergency staircase, and multiplying this with the length of the barometer. * Trading the barometer for the correct information with the building's janitor or superintendent. * Measuring the pressure difference between ground and roof and calculating the height difference (the expected answer).  Interpretations  Professor of physics Mark Silverman used what he called \\"The Barometer-Story formula\\" precisely for explaining the subject of pressure and recommended it to physics teachers. Silverman called Calandra's story \\"a delightful essay that I habitually read to my class whenever we study fluids ... the essay is short, hilarious and satisfying (at least to me and my class).\\"Silverman, p. 40. Financial advisor Robert G. Allen presented Calandra's essay to illustrate the process and role of creativity in finance. \\"Creativity is born when you have a problem to solve. And as you can see from this story [\\"Angels on a Pin\\"] there are many ways of solving a problem. Creativity is the art of looking for solutions that are out of the ordinary, different, unorthodox.\\"Allen, p. 13. O'Meara used the barometer question to illustrate the art of steering students' activities to a desired outcome: \\"if the question is not aligned [with the desired learning outcome] then the problem becomes an exercise of problem solving for its own value.\\"O'Meara, p. 108. The teacher can steer the students either through careful design of the questions (this rules out barometer questions), or through guiding the students to the desired choices. In case of the original barometer question, the examiner may explicitly say that the problem has more than one solution, insist on applying the laws of physics, or give them the \\"ending point\\" of the solution: \\"How did I discover that the building was 410 feet in height with only a barometer?\\" Herson used the Calandra account as an illustration of the difference between academic tests and assessment in education. Tests, even the ones designed for reliability and validity, are useful, but they are not sufficient in real-world education.Herson, pp. 20-21. Sanders interpreted Calandra's story as a conflict between perfection and optimal solutions: \\"We struggle to determine a 'best' answer, when a simple call to a building superintendent (the resource man) would quickly provide adequate information.\\"Sanders, p. 197.

Designed by architects Christian S. Michaelsen and Sigurd A. Rognstad, the building was built for the On Leong Merchants Association and opened in 1928. The Association used it as an immigrant assistance center, and the building was informally referred to as Chinatown's \\"city hall\\". In 1988, the FBI and Chicago Police raided the building as part of a racketeering investigation. The US federal government seized the building that same year. The building was purchased by the Chinese Christian Union Church (CCUC) for $1.4 million and renamed the Pui Tak Center in 1993. That same year, the On Leong Merchants Association Building was designated a Chicago landmark by the Commission on Chicago Landmarks. The CCUC spent $1 million raised from community donations to renovate and update the building's neglected interior. The newly named Pai Tak Center now hosts various religious, community, and educational programs, such as English-as-a- Second-Language courses (ESL). In 2007, the Pui Tak Center won a $100,000 grant from the Partners in Preservation, a program sponsored by American Express and the National Trust for Historic Preservation. In preparation for the restoration work, the structural and architectural engineering firm Wiss, Janney, Elstner Associates completed an evaluation of the building's eastern and southern facades, focusing on its terra cotta portions. Restoration work began in spring 2009 and is scheduled for completion in early 2010. Fully restoring the building's exterior terra cotta pieces and clay roof tiles is the first step in a long-range $2 million repair plan. History A building was first constructed for the On Leong Chinese Merchants Association along Cermak Avenue in 1912. In 1912, Chinese businesses began relocating from the Loop to Chicago's South Side.Chun 2005, p. 56. Starting this trend, the On Leong Chinese Merchants Association appealed to deed-holder and former Illinois State's Attorney Jacob J. Kern to hire architect H. J. Swanson to design a building large enough to house 15 stores, 30 apartments and office space on the 200 block of West 22nd Street (now Cermak Road). Built in 1912 for $200,000, the building's design was typical of the period; however, it featured white tile trim adorned with Chinese dragons and a third floor balcony. The Association relocated to the building's third floor by 1914. In the 1920s, Chinese community leaders secured approximately 50 ten-year leases on properties in the newly developing Chinatown. Jim Moy, director of the Association, then decided that a Chinese-style building should be constructed as a strong visual announcement of the Chinese community's new presence in the area.Ho 2005, p. 58. With no Chinese-born architects in Chicago at the time, Chicago-born Norse architects Christian S. Michaelsen and Sigurd A. Rognstad were asked to design the On Leong Merchants Association Building in the spring of 1926. Moy decided to employ the pair again after Michaelsen and Rognstad's firm built Moy's Peacock Inn in Uptown in 1920. After studying texts on Chinese architecture, Michaelsen and Rognstad's final design was an example of Orientalism, a Western architect's interpretation of Chinese architectural forms. A good substitute for the liu li glazed ceramic found in traditional Chinese architecture, Rognstad designed exterior Teco sculptural accents, a type of terra cotta produced by Crystal Lake, Illinois's American Terra Cotta Company.Sinkevitch 2004, p. 371. When the building plans were announced in the Chicago Tribune on July 4, 1926, the building was called, \\"One of the most expensive and elaborate buildings ever erected in America by the Chinese\\". Construction began in 1926 and was completed a year later for the cost of $1 million. When the building opened in 1928, the On Leong Merchants Association used it as an immigrant assistance center that housed various meeting halls, a school, a shrine, and the Association's offices. It was often informally referred to as Chinatown's \\"city hall\\". In 1941, the On Leong Association offered Reverend John T.S. Mao space in the building to open St. Therese Chinese Catholic School, a Catholic grade school. By the 1950s, the school had become overcrowded, but it remained in the building until construction of a new, devoted school building was completed in 1961. =Seizure and sale= The building features exterior terra cotta accents, mimicking glazed ceramic found in traditional Chinese architecture. In the mid-1960s, prosecutors began claiming the building was a national headquarters for a multimillion-dollar racketeering operation. On April 20, 1988, the FBI and Chicago police Internal Affairs Division investigators raided the On Leong Merchants Association Building, confiscated gambling paraphernalia from a casino hidden on the building's second floor and seized $350,000 from a vault. Assistant U.S. Attorney John J. Scully asserted that the Association had collected $6 million in illegal gambling profits between 1966 and 1988. The building was seized by the US federal government two months later under federal racketeering statutes. Other than several first-floor shops, the building sat empty for almost five years. Rooms on the upper floors fell into disrepair, with paint peeling and faded ornamentation in pieces on the floor. After a unanimous voice vote by a City Council committee, the Commission on Chicago Landmarks designated the On Leong Merchants Association Building as a Chicago Landmark on December 1, 1993, the only such landmark in Chinatown. It has been described as Chicago’s \\"most significant symbol of the cultural heritage of the Chinese\\". That same year, the Chinese Christian Union Church (CCUC) bought the building from the government for $1.4 million. The CCUC now uses the newly named Pui Tak Center to host religious, community, and educational programs such as family literacy classes, music programs, computer courses, and youth activities, with English-as-a-Second-Language courses (ESL) being the Center's largest program. Recent Chinese immigrants can also visit the Center for assistance with everyday needs. Serving approximately 2,500 new immigrants annually, the Center's annual $1.5 million operating budget is partially funded by state and local government grants and private donations. Renovation and restoration Scaffolding was erected along the building's eastern facade during restoration work in 2009. After purchasing the building in 1993, the Chinese Christian Union Church spent $1 million raised from community donations to make extensive alterations to the building's interior, which suffered from peeling paint, falling plaster, and poor lighting. The On Leong Merchants Association's former vault was converted into a closet, and the building's heating and water systems underwent major renovations and replacement. Renovations were completed in 1995, and the CCUC opened the building in November. In November 2007, the Pui Tak Center won a $100,000 grant from the Partners in Preservation, a program sponsored by American Express and the National Trust for Historic Preservation. Spreading the word via e-mail, Facebook, and church sermons, the building led the five-week-long online contest from the start and ultimately received 14% of the vote. It received more votes than any of the other 24 historic Chicago sites participating in the contest, including the Robie House, the Chicago Cultural Center, and Unity Temple. In preparation for the restoration work, the structural and architectural engineering firm Wiss, Janney, Elstner Associates completed an evaluation of the building's eastern and southern facades, focusing on its terra cotta portions. By using ultrasonic testing, engineers were able to evaluate the state of the terra cotta without further damaging the pieces. Severely cracked or damaged pieces were partially removed and a report was written from these findings. This report provided recommendations for the masonry facade and terra cotta repair work. Restoration work began in spring 2009 and is scheduled for completion in early 2010. All of the damaged terra cotta elements have been replaced on the south tower and parapet, and scaffolding has been erected on building's eastern facade in preparation for further restoration work. Fully restoring the building's exterior terra cotta pieces and clay roof tiles is the first step in a long-range $2 million repair plan.

The was most likely a basking shark corpse caught by the Japanese fishing trawler off the coast of New Zealand in 1977. The carcass's peculiar appearance led to speculation that it might be the remains of a sea serpent or prehistoric plesiosaur. Although several scientists insisted it was \\"not a fish, whale, or any other mammal\\", analysis later indicated it was most likely the carcass of a basking shark by comparing the number of sets of amino acids in the muscle tissue. Decomposing basking shark carcasses lose most of the lower head area and the dorsal and caudal fins first, making them resemble a plesiosaur.  Discovery  On April 25, 1977, the Japanese trawler Zuiyō Maru, sailing east of Christchurch, New Zealand, caught a strange, unknown creature in the trawl. The crew was convinced it was an unidentified animal,Bord, Janet and Colin (1990), in Varelser från det okända (Det oförklarliga), Bokorama. but despite the potential biological significance of the curious discovery, the captain, Akira Tanaka, decided to dump the carcass into the ocean again so not to risk spoiling the caught fish. However, before that, some photos and sketches were taken of the creature, nicknamed \\"Nessie\\" by the crew, measurements were taken and some samples of skeleton, skin and fins were collected for further analysis by experts in Japan. The discovery resulted in immense commotion and a \\"plesiosaur-craze\\" in Japan, and the shipping company ordered all its boats to try to relocate the dumped corpse, but with no apparent success.Sjögren, Bengt, Berömda vidunder, Settern, 1980, (Swedish)  Description  The foul- smelling, decomposing corpse reportedly weighed 1,800 kg and was about 10 m long. According to the crew, the creature had a 1.5-m-long neck, four large, reddish fins, and a tail about 2.0 m long. It lacked a dorsal fin. No internal organs remained, but flesh and fat were somewhat intact.Welfare & Fairley, 1981  Proposed explanations  Plesiosaur = Professor Tokio Shikama from Yokohama National University was convinced the remains were of a supposedly extinct plesiosaur. Dr. Fujiro Yasuda from Tokyo University of Marine Science and Technology agreed with Shikama, \\"the photographs show the remains of a prehistoric animal\\". Dr. Fujiro Yasuda summarizes his observations in newsreel from the time of the discoveryZuiyo Maru Sea Monster Carcass 1977 newsreel.. Yasuda and Taki, icthyologists, disputed that the cryptid could be a shark which would necessitate Michihiko Yano was mistaken when he claimed to observe two dorsal finsYasuda, F. and Y. Taki. 1978. Comparison of the unidentified animal with fishes. In Collected Papers on the Carcass. July, 1978. LaSociete Franco-Japonaise D’oceanographie (Tokyo), pp. 61–62.. However, other scientists were more skeptical. According to Bengt Sjögren, Swedish paleontologist Hans-Christian Bjerring was soon interviewed by Swedish news agency Tidningarnas Telegrambyrå, and said: > \\"If it's true that the Japanese collected samples of fins and skin, it would > be possible to conclude from a microscope what it is. If it would be shown > to be a hitherto unknown animal from the sea, it is as big of a sensation as > the discovery of the coelacanth in 1938… but there is reason to be > suspicious of the claims of plesiosaurs, for example, as the marine > environment and fauna changed drastically since the age of the plesiosaurs > on earth.\\" Another Swedish scientist, Ove Persson, was also critical of the plesiosaur interpretation. He recalled other discoveries of similar dead marine creatures resembling plesiosaurs that on closer inspection revealed them to be just decomposed, unusually large sharks. He also added, \\"The discovery of the coelacanth was not as strange as if a plesiosaur would be discovered. The plesiosaur is much bigger and breathes with lungs. It seems incredible that it would manage to remain hidden.\\" = Basking shark = A team of Japanese scientists, Tadayoshi Sasaki and Shigeru Kimura from the Tokyo University of Marine Science and Technology, Ikuo Obata from the National Museum of Nature and Science, and Toshio Ikuya from the Atmosphere and Ocean Research Institute at the University of Tokyo, jointly concluded, while the identity of the carcass could not be determined with certainty, the carcass was most likely that of a large shark. On July 28, 1977, the Zuiyō Maru carcass was commented upon in the international science magazine New Scientist. A scientist from the Natural History Museum in London had the same opinion as Bjerring and Persson, that the remains were not from a plesiosaur. The decomposition pattern of a basking shark, whose spine and brain case is relatively highly calcified for a cartilaginous fish, can be expected to produce a similar shape to a plesiosaur; the first parts that fall off during decomposition are the lower jaw, the gill area, and the dorsal and caudal fins. Of the view that the carcass was explained as a plesiosaur, Sjögren concluded, \\"it was the infamous old 'Stronsay Beast' that once again haunted like on innumerable other occasions. The scholars in Japan went into the same easy trap as the Scottish naturalists did in the 19th century.\\"  In popular culture  * The creature is referenced in Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah, but acknowledged as a plesiosaur. * The carcass is also mentioned in the credits of the 2014 film Godzilla. * The plesiosaur argument is used as the basis of Lost Tapes \\"Monster of Monterey\\" episode, in which the creature lives in the Monterey Canyon off the coast of California and is suggested as being responsible for a number of deaths.

They achieved a status of a cult band, especially in North Macedonia and across the former Yugoslavian countries. The group is notable for its first self-titled album, as it was the first popular music album in the former Yugoslavian countries in Macedonian language. The album was a major success and it is listed among the top ten rock albums ever released in former Yugoslavian countries. Mizar was formed in 1981 in the then Socialist Republic of Macedonia. Because of the band's avant- garde sound and image, its Christian leanings and support for Macedonian self- determination, they were viewed with certain degree of suspicion by the former authorities. Still, the group received great media attention including numerous appearances on the national television. The 2014 documentary Mizar: The Star of Hope details the band's origins.  Name  The band got its name after Mizar which is a guiding star for orientation of travelers in the deserts. The name was given by Panta Džambazoski.  Mizar music  Mizar's musical style is post-punk, darkwave and gothic rock. Beside influences such as Joy Division for instance, Mizar also uses elements of traditional Macedonian folklore and Byzantine music. Another main part of their music is Tanevski and Trajkoski's vocals, which are based on Christian church chants.  Story of the Mizar  In their long history, Mizar has had 5 Revelations, all of them with different singers. = The First Revelation (Risto Vrtev) = Mizar were formed in 1981 in Skopje as an instrumental trio of Gorazd Čapovski on guitar, Valentin Zabjakin on bass and Panta Dzambazoski on drums. In late 1981, Zabjakin left the band and was replaced with Ilija Stojanovski. Risto Vrtev joined on vocals soon after. In 1982, the group recorded a demo tape for Radio Skopje. They then sent this tape to Jugoslovenski Rock Moment (also known as YURM), who wrote a short but glowing review of the tape. During 1983, the band then had to break up shortly after due to the members' mandatory army commitments. = The Second Revelation (Goran Tanevski) = In 1985, when the members of Mizar returned from the army, Čapovski attempted to form a band called Inola-X with Vrtev, but it didn't work out. Mizar then reformed with Goran Tanevski in place of Vrtev and a new keyboardist, Slobodan Stojkov. They started to use elements of the traditional Macedonian folklore and Byzantine music blended with post-punk, darkwave and gothic rock. This phase of Mizar is known as ' (Mizar - The Second Revelation). Vrtev later founded Arhangel (Archangel) which was awarded as the best rock act in Macedonia during the 1990s. Arhangel inherited certain features of Mizar but with a more conventional rock approach which is why Arhangel was sometimes referred as the Rock Mizar. In 1986, the band filmed a music video for the song \\"Stoj\\". In 1986, the band played the Druga Godba festival in Ljubljana, but altercations within the band caused Dzambazoski and Stojkov to leave the group. They were replaced by Vencislav Smakjoski and Goran Trajkovski respectively. This lineup played at Festival Omladina, with Vladimir Kaevski on keyboards, and contributed two live tracks to the festival's compilation. These tracks are the first appearance of Mizar on record. Trajkovski would later be replaced by Sašo Krstevski, while Stojkov was replaced by Katerina Veljanovska. In 1986 they recorded a few demos and were a support act for Laibach and Disciplina Kičme on their Yugoslav tour. In 1987 they were awarded for their unique sound at the most significant rock music festival which was held in Subotica. They released their first, self-titled album, in 1988 with the following line-up: *Goran Tanevski (vocal) *Gorazd Čapovski (guitar) *Boris Georgiev (drums) (ex. Badmingtons) *Sašo Krstevski (bass) *Katerina Veljanovska (keyboards) The producer was Goran Lisica-Fox. Beside their own songs, the album also included a cover version of the notable Macedonian folk song Zajdi, Zajdi under the title ' (Golden Sun). One of the best known songs from the album is ' (Girl made of bronze). By 1989, the lineup had stabilised to the following: * Goran Tanevski - vocals * Gorazd Čapovski - guitar * Ilija Stojanovski - bass * Žarko Serafimovski - drums * Vladimir Kaevski - keyboards This lineup's first appearance on record was the Demoskop 1 compilation in late 1990, where they contributed two tracks, \\"Veligden\\" and \\"Glas\\". Between October and December 1990, the band recorded their second album, Svjat Dreams, releasing it on 7 September 1991, the day before Macedonia split from Yugoslavia. The title of the record is inspired by the song Sweet Dreams by Eurythmics. On this album they covered the traditional song 1762 and a song written by Vrtev, the first singer of Mizar titled ' (Home). After the release of the band's second album Tanevski left the group and was replaced by the vocalist Nora, but soon by the end of the 1991 the band split. Tanevski got involved in organising concerts, Kaevski restored his old band Kiborg, while Čapovski left for Australia. There he formed Kismet in 1993 which is considered a sort of continuation of Mizar's work because the musical style was similar. In 1999, Serafimovski and Tanevski reissued Mizar on CD under the title Svedožba, with bonus demo and live tracks, including a never-before-heard darker version of the song \\"Svjat Dreams\\" recorded in 1989 with Tanevski on all instruments and two unreleased live tracks, \\"Čifte Čamče\\" and \\"Samo eden mig\\". Also included were a live version of the Svjat Dreams album track \\"Veligden\\" and three tracks from Svjat Dreams 1762-1991. The live tracks were recorded at a concert at Kuršumli An in 1990. In 1999, Čapovski returned to Macedonia and contributed two tracks to a tribute album dedicated to Mizar, which was released in 2001. In 2002, Kismet released an album called \\"Dreaming\\". The band broke up in that year. = The Third Revelation (Goran Trajkoski) = In 2001 a tribute album named Tribute to Mizar was released. It was a collection of Mizar cover versions by some of the most notable groups in Macedonia incl. Majakovski, the black death metal band Syniac and others. Two years later the first two albums of Mizar were re- released on CD solely for the Macedonian market, but the record quickly spread across the countries of former Yugoslavia. Beside the albums, the CD also contained demos and live recordings. Mizar was reunited in early 2003 with their former member Goran Trajkoski as a vocalist, with whom, first they released the single ' (Gun Salute). That summer they played at the Exit festival in Novi Sad and in the alternative club Močvara in Zagreb. The entrance tickets included give-away records featuring the new single. The following year a new album titled Terrible Beauty (is born) came out. During 2005 Mizar toured ex-Yugoslavia, August 2005 Mizar toured Croatia together with Croatian gothic band from Zagreb - Phantasmagoria (Croatian band), with its leader Tomi Edvard Sega. That was Jadran Tour - Pula (Viva La Pola! festival), Zadar (Maya Pub), Split (O'Hara Club), Dubrovnik (Lazareti) and in the beginning of November they visited Serbia and Montenegro playing in Pančevo, Belgrade and Kragujevac. = After Trajkoski = During the summer of 2006 the former Mizar vocalist Goran Tanevski replaced Goran Trajkoski. In the beginning of November that year Mizar played in Belgrade and announced their new album featuring Tanevski as a vocalist. The album Pogled na cvetnata gradina was completed and released in 2007. = The Fourth Revelation (Harmosini) = In 2010, Tanevski left Mizar again and was replaced by the Byzantine choir Harmosini. The album Deteto i beloto more was released in 2010. The album contains a re-recording of \\"Hoden že\\" from Mizar's debut album. In 2014, they were selected as the support band for Simple Minds' concert at the Kale hall in Skopje. Their new album, Šarena Krava (Coloured Cow) was announced at that concert. Šarena Krava returns the band to its punk rock roots, removing all traditional Macedonian instruments and patriotic lyrical themes. Harmosini have been replaced with Jana Burčeska, the second female singer in the history of Mizar since Nora Stojanovic's brief tenure with the band in 1991. One song from the album, \\"Nebo\\", was released on the Balkan Under the Radar vol. 2 compilation in 2014. = The Fifth Revelation (Viktorija Ivanovska) = On 26 June 2015, the documentary Mizar: The Star of Hope was released, featuring interviews with members of early Mizar lineups and discussing a hitherto-unknown period in the life of the band: its beginnings in 1981 until 1986. Before the documentary, it was believed Mizar formed in 1983. To this day, Čapovski has remained the only constant member of Mizar since its formation in 1981.

Heath formerly served as head coach at the University of South Florida, the University of Arkansas and Kent State University, the latter of whom he led to the Elite Eight of the 2002 NCAA Basketball Tournament. He led all three programs to at least one NCAA Tournament. Background Stan Heath graduated from Detroit Catholic Central High School in 1983. He was an all-state guard during his time there. He went on to earn his bachelor's in social science from Eastern Michigan University in 1988 and his master's in sports administration from Wayne State University in 1993. Heath redshirted during his first year at Eastern Michigan before lettering his final three years (1985–1987). Heath is married to the former Ramona Webb (whom he met during his junior year at Eastern Michigan) and they have two sons, Jordan and Joshua. Coaching careerAssistant & Division II Coaching= Stan Heath began his collegiate career at Hillsdale College in 1989 as an assistant. After one season, he moved to Albion College where he was an assistant and the junior varsity head coach for two years. He worked at Wayne State University in Detroit the following three years, including serving as associate head coach in 1994 when WSU set a school record for victories (25–5), helping the Tartars win two Great Lakes Intercollegiate Athletic Conference titles with a trip to the NCAA Division II Final Four in 1993. After two seasons as an assistant at Bowling Green State University, he joined Tom Izzo at Michigan State University where he was an assistant for five years. He helped the Spartans advance to the Final Four three straight years (1999, 2000, 2001), win the 2000 national title, make another appearance in the Sweet 16 and go a combined 132–37. The Spartans posted records of 17–12 in 1997, 22–8 in 1998, 33–5 in 1999, 32–7 in 2000 and 28–5 in 2001. In addition to the three trips to the Final Four, MSU also reached the Sweet 16 in 1998 and the second round of the NIT in 1997. On March 19, 2001, Sports Illustrated featured \\"five college coaches waiting in the wings.\\" Heath was on that list, along with assistant Leonard Perry of Iowa State, Florida assistant John Pelphrey, head coach Jeff Ruland of Iona and Hofstra head coach Jay Wright. A month after that, he was named the head coach at Kent State. =Kent State= Heath got his first collegiate head coach job at Kent State in 2002. Under his guidance, the Golden Flashes finished with a 30–6 record that year and won the Mid-American Conference regular-season and tournament titles. They then came within a victory of reaching the Final Four before falling to Indiana at the South Regional finals of the NCAA Tournament. Along the way, Kent set school and MAC records for wins (30), breaking the record of 29 set by Ball State in 1989; became the first MAC team to reach the Elite Eight since Ohio University in 1964; recorded a league-record 21-game winning streak, including a 17–1 mark in conference play; beat three ranked teams in the NCAA Tournament, including No. 20 Oklahoma State, 69–61, No. 8 University of Alabama, 71–58, and No. 9 University of Pittsburgh, 78–73 in overtime; went 12–0 at home with an average attendance of 4,928, Kent's best since 1970; led the MAC in scoring defense (64.0 ppg), scoring margin (+11.9 ppg), field goal percentage defense (.418), rebounding margin (+5.0 rpg) and assist-to-turnover ratio (1.24) while also ranking second in three-point field goal percentage defense (.326) and turnover margin (+2.78); and suffered its five regular season losses by a total of 15 points. Individually, Heath's 30 wins ties for the third-most by a first-year head coach in NCAA Division I history with John Warren of Oregon (1945). Only Bill Guthridge of North Carolina (34 in 1998) and Bill Hodges of Indiana State (33 in 1979) won more. The Detroit native was also voted the MAC Coach of the Year and named the national Rookie Coach of the Year by both CBSSportsline.com and CollegeInsider.com. =Arkansas= After his successful first season at Kent State, Heath then moved on to the head coaching position at the University of Arkansas. He was hired on March 28, 2002 to replace Nolan Richardson who had been fired that year after claiming he was being mistreated because he was African American and challenging athletic director Frank Broyles to buy out his contract. The 2003 season (2002–2003), Heath's first as Razorback head coach, was a difficult one. With key players having left the team, as well as the normal adjustments to a new system, the team struggled to a 9–19 record. The 2004 season (2003–2004) saw some improvement to key areas, as well as the addition of key freshmen Parade All-American Ronnie Brewer and McDonald's All-American Olu Famutimi, who contributed to a 12–16 record. The team was the 8th youngest in the NCAA. The 2005 season (2004–2005) showed marked improvement in almost every area, most notably in the front court, with the addition of Steven Hill, Darian Townes, and Charles Thomas. The jewel of the recruiting class, Al Jefferson, never made it to Arkansas as he was selected in the NBA Draft by the Boston Celtics. At the conclusion of the 2005 season, Heath spoke for the team in announcing they would not accept an invitation to the NIT end of year basketball tournament. This followed an end of year slide which resulted in the loss of 5 of the last 6 games. The team finished with an 18–12 overall record. The 2006 season (2005–2006) began with a key win over University of Kansas, and respectable losses to national powers Connecticut and Maryland. The end of conference play brought on wins over ranked opponents Florida and Tennessee, five straight wins, and a winning regular season conference record for the first time for Heath at Arkansas. The Razorbacks received an NCAA tournament bid for the first time under Heath, but lost in the first round to Bucknell. At the end of the 2005–2006 season as coach, Arkansas had improved (winning percentage, post season play, conference record) in each of the four full seasons he has coached. The 2007 season (2006–2007) began by winning the Old Spice Classic inaugural tournament with wins over Southern Illinois, Marist, and West Virginia. The team made it to the SEC Championship Game with victories over South Carolina, Mississippi State, and Vanderbilt. The Razorbacks would lose to Florida in the championship game 77–56 but still received an at large bid to the 2007 NCAA Tournament for the second year in a row. The Razorbacks received a 12th seed but lost in the first round against 5th seeded Southern California with the final score of 77–60. On March 26, 2007, Heath's coaching career at Arkansas ended; he believed that lackluster ticket sales played a role.Despite 20 wins this season, Arkansas fires Heath - Men's College Basketball - ESPN It was reported that Heath would get a settlement of $900,000 dollars over the next three years after being fired. Heath had been earning $772,943 (including media contract, endorsements, etc.) plus an additional $71,000 tax deferred annuity and UA retirement account. =South Florida= Shortly after being fired from Arkansas, Heath agreed to a five-year contract with the South Florida Bulls on April 2, 2007 replacing Robert McCullum.NCAA College Basketball News, Videos, Scores, Standings, Stats, Teams - FOX Sports on MSN The Bulls, coming off a 12–16 season the year before, lost their first 3 games of the season before rebounding with a win over in-state rival Florida State. During the 2009-10 season, Heath led the Bulls to their first postseason tournament appearance since 2002. The team won 20 games (with a 9–9 Big East record) and earned a spot in the NIT but lost in the first round to North Carolina State. Heath's most successful season came in his fifth year with the Bulls, when he led them to 22 victories, and tied for fourth in the Big East league standings. It was good enough to garner a 12 seed in the NCAA Tournament, where USF defeated California in a play-in game and then knocked off fifth-seeded Temple in the round of 64 before losing to Ohio in the round of 32, 62-56. Heath and the Bulls parted ways after the team lost in the first round of the 2014 conference tournament. He spent one season as a college basketball analyst for ESPN. =Back to assistant ranks= On June 30, 2015, Heath and Jim Christian were reunited as Boston College announced Heath would join Christian's coaching staff.http://www.bceagles.com/sports/m-baskbl/spec- rel/063015aaa.html =Lakeland Magic= In August of 2017, Heath was announced as the new head coach of the NBA G-League team the Lakeland Magichttp://www.tampabay.com/stan-heath-lands-new-coaching-gig-in- lakeland/2333075, which are the affiliate team of the NBA's Orlando Magic.

As a representative of the Munster inter-provincial team for twelve years, Keane won seven Railway Cup medals during that period. At club level he won eight championship medals with Mount Sion. Keane's retirement came following the conclusion of the 1951 championship. In retirement from playing, Keane became involved in team management and coaching. As trainer of the Waterford senior team in 1959, he guided them to Munster and All-Ireland victory. He was also heavily involved with training various Mount Sion teams. Keane is widely regarded as one of the greatest hurlers in the history of the game. He has been repeatedly voted onto teams made up of the sport's greats, including at centre-back on the Hurling Team of the Century in 1984 and the Hurling Team of the Millennium in 2000. Early life John Keane was born in Waterford, on 18 February 1917, into a family that was steeped in the traditions of Gaelic Ireland. His childhood years were spent among like-minded neighbours in the city's Barrack Street. Keane was educated at Mount Sion School, a great hurling nursery and a cradle of all things Gaelic and nationalist where he became the star hurler – going on to represent the Munster colleges team for three successive years. Playing careerClub= Keane played his club hurling with the famous Mount Sion club in Waterford city and enjoyed much success. He won his first senior county title in 1938, the first senior title won by Mount Sion. Keane captained the club to further county titles in 1939, 1940, 1943, 1945, 1948, 1949 and 1951. On his retirement from hurling in 1951 he was the only man in his club who had played on every championship winning team. He continued playing football for his club until 1955, winning two county senior medals. =Inter-county= Keane made his inter-county debut with Waterford in a Munster quarter-final defeat of Cork on 15 May 1932. His four-year tenure with the minor team was largely unsuccessful, apart from one Munster final appearance in 1934. In 1934 Keane was just seventeen when he became a central figure on the Waterford junior hurling team that reached the provincial decider. A huge 7–10 to 5–2 defeat of Cork gave him a Munster medal in that grade. London provided the opposition on the subsequent All-Ireland decider. A close game developed, however, Waterford triumphed by 3–5 to 3–3, giving Keane an All-Ireland Junior Hurling Championship medal. Keane's performances in the minor and junior grades brought him to the attention of the senior selectors. He made his senior debut in a National Hurling League game against Cork on 10 February 1935. In 1938 Keane was a dominant force in defence as Waterford defeated Cork to reach the Munster decider. Clare provided the opposition, however, a narrow 3–5 to 2–5 victory gave Waterford their first ever provincial crown. Keane later lined out in his first All- Ireland final on 4 September 1938, with Dublin standing in the way of a first championship. After battling hard for the hour, a more experienced Dublin secured a narrow 2–5 to 1–6 victory. A decade in the doldrums followed Waterford's breakthrough season and, apart from a Munster final defeat in 1943, Keane enjoyed little success. In 1948 Waterford made the breakthrough once again by reaching the provincial decider. Cork, a team aiming for a sixth All-Ireland title in nine championships seasons, provided the opposition. After falling behind by five points early in the game, Waterford fought back to lead by a point at the interval. Goalkeeper Charlie Ware made some great saves while Johnny O'Connor stymied Cork's chief scorer Christy Ring to secure a 4–7 to 3–9 victory. It was Keane's second Munster medal. The subsequent All- Ireland final on 5 September 1948 pitted Waterford against Dublin. \\"The Decies\\" started well and took a commanding 2–5 to 0–2 lead at the interval, with Keane scoring one of the Waterford goals. Dublin rallied in the second half, however, Waterford quickly regained the upper-hand and powered to a 6–7 to 4–2 victory. Playing at centre-forward Keane gave a masterclass, scoring three goals and two points and made most of the other scores. The victory also gave him an All-Ireland medal. Keane retired from inter-county hurling without any further success following Waterford's exit from the 1951 championship. Post-playing career Blue Heritage plaque on the house where John Keane was born in Barrack St., Waterford. In retirement from playing Keane became heavily involved in training both club and county teams. He trained his own Mount Sion club to many county victories in the 1950s and 1960s including a record-equalling nine Waterford senior hurling titles in succession. In the eighteen years between 1948 and 1965 the Mount Sion club won fifteen county senior hurling titles and John was associated as player or coach with every success. As the trainer of the Waterford county senior hurling team he enjoyed a run of success when the county won three Munster titles, one All-Ireland, one National League and one Oireachtas title. Keane's side won the Munster title in 1957 but Waterford later lost the All-Ireland final by just one point to Kilkenny. After losing the Munster final in 1958 Keane's side bounced back in 1959 to win another Munster medal. That year the Decies faced Kilkenny in the All-Ireland final once again and, after a drawn game, Waterford overwhelmed Kilkenny in the replay to claim a second-ever All-Ireland title. In 1962 Keane guided Waterford to an Oireachtas title and the following year to National Hurling League and Munster honours. However Waterford fell to Kilkenny in an exciting All-Ireland final. In his final years Keane, who smoked cigarettes through most of his life, suffered from ill health. A heart condition and circulation problems reduced the mobility of one of Ireland's greatest-ever hurlers. He knew that his time on earth was limited so, shortly before his death, Keane embarked on a tour of the country to visit many of his former hurling opponents. It was an heroic journey that also proved to be his last. First he travelled to Kilkenny to visit his great friend and opponent Jim Langton. Then back to Waterford where he spent a restless night tossing and turning with the pain. On the following day he travelled to Kinsale where he called on Jack Barrett, an old hurling colleague from his Munster Railway Cup days. After visiting Jackie Power in Tralee Keane was travelling to Limerick when he died on the side of the road near Tarbert, Co. Kerry, on 1 October 1975.David Smith, \\"The Unconquerable Keane\\" p. 227. He was just fifty- eight years old. The following day his remains were brought back to Waterford and Mount Sion where the thousands waited silently in the wind and the rain to say a last farewell to the man who had made them all feel so proud and on the following day he was buried in the cemetery overlooking the broad sands of Tramore. Keane was posthumously honoured by being named on the Hurling Team of the Century in 1984 and the Hurling Team of the Millennium in 2000. He was picked for the centre-back position on both teams, marking him out as the greatest number six in the history of the game. In 2009 the Waterford City Trust erected a blue heritage plaque on the house where John was born in Barrack street, Waterford and in 2010 a long overdue biography of John was published – THE UNCONQUERABLE KEANE: John Keane and the rise of Waterford hurling by David Smith. GAA Administration All through his life John was heavily involved in the administrative side of the GAA with both club and county. At various times in his career as a player with his club, he was chairman, selector, coach and captain. With the county he filled the role of team selector, team coach and, for two years, county treasurer.

It has its roots in the Scheduled Castes Federation led by B. R. Ambedkar. The 'Training School for Entrance to Politics' was established by Ambedkar in 1956 which was to serve as an entry point to the Republican Party of India (RPI). The first batch of the school consisted of 15 students. Its first batch turned out to be last batch as the school was closed after Ambedkar's death in 1956.  Origins  Independent Labour Party = The Independent Labour Party (ILP) was a political organisation formed under the leadership of B. R. Ambedkar on 15 August 1936. It opposed the brahmanical and capitalist structures in India, supported the Indian working class and sought to dismantle the caste system. The formation of the ILP was not welcomed or supported by the communist leaders, who argued that it would lead to a split in the working-class votes. Ambedkar replied that communist leaders were working for the rights for the worker but not for the human rights of Dalit workers. In his work Annihilation of Caste, Ambedkar put forth the idea that caste is not merely the 'division of labour' but 'division of labourers' based upon graded inequality. In the 1937 Provincial elections, the ILP secured 14 of the 17 seats in which they contested. This included 11 of the 13 contested seats that were reserved for traditionally oppressed communities. In 1938, the ILP, with the support of the Congress Socialist Party, organised a march of 20,000 tenants from the Konkan region to Bombay, marked the largest pre-independence peasant mobilisation in the region. In the same year, it also joined with Communists to organise Bombay textile labourers in opposition to a bill intended to control strike actions by the labourers. ILP opposed the bill in the Bombay Legislative Assembly. = Scheduled Castes Federation = Annai Meenambal (L), Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar (C) and Rao Bahadur N. Sivaraj (R) during \\"The All India SCF women's conference\\" held at Bombay, on May 6th, 1945 Scheduled Castes Federation (SCF) was an organisation in India founded by B. R. Ambedkar in 1942 to campaign for the rights of the Dalit community. An executive body of All India SCF was elected in the convention. N. Sivaraj from Madras State was elected as President and P. N. Rajbhoj from Bombay State was elected as general secretary. Ambedkar had founded the Depressed Classes Federation (DCF) in 1930 and the Independent Labour Party (ILP) in 1935. Sources vary regarding which of these two bodies was succeeded by the SCF. SCF later evolved into the Republican Party of India. There was also a party called Scheduled Caste Federation in Pakistan after Partition. Ramnarayan Rawat stated that the SCF \\"created the space for an alternative to Congress-type 'nationalist' politics in post- 1947 Uttar Pradesh\\". = Republican Party of India = On 30 September 1956, B. R. Ambedkar had announced the establishment of the \\"Republican Party of India\\" by dismissing the \\"Scheduled Castes Federation\\", but before the formation of the party, he died on 6 December 1956. After that, his followers and activists planned to form this party. A meeting of the Presidency was held at Nagpur on 1 October, 1957 to establish the party. At this meeting, N. Sivaraj, Yashwant Ambedkar, P. T. Borale, A. G. Pawar, Datta Katti, D. A. Rupavate were present. The Republican Party of India was formed on 3 October 1957. N. Sivaraj was elected as the President of the party. Factionism During the recent years RPI suffered severe internal strife. Several distinct parties claim the name of RPI. There are more than 50 factions of RPI. In 2009, all factions of RPI except Prakash Ambedkar's Bharipa Bahujan Mahasangh reunited to form a united \\"Republican Party of India (United)\\". Later, Republican Party of India (Gavai) and Republican Party of India (A) led by Ramdas Athawale split again from the united party. Splinter groups of RPI include: *Republican Party of India (A) of Ramdas Athawale *Republican Party of India (United) *Republican Party of India (Gavai) of R. S. Gavai and Rajendra Gavai *Bharipa Bahujan Mahasangh of Prakash Ambedkar *Rashtriya Republican Party of Annasaheb Katare *Bahujan Samaj Party founder Kanshi Ram worked with RPI for eight years.

Hannay had previously appeared in The Thirty Nine Steps (1915), his most famous adventure in which he battles German spies across England and Scotland, and two books about his activities during the First World War, Greenmantle (1916) and Mr Standfast (1919).  Plot introduction After the War, Hannay is married to Mary and living peacefully in the Cotswolds, when he receives a request to help solve the mysterious kidnapping of the children of three prominent people. Given nothing to go on but a few mysterious clues, Hannay, assisted by friends like Sandy Arbuthnot, must track down the dastardly villains behind the plot before it's too late... Plot summary It is some time after the war, and Sir Richard Hannay is living in rural tranquility, having bought Fosse Manor and married Mary Lamington (both featured in Mr Standfast); they have a small son, named Peter John. Hannay's new friend, local doctor Tom Greenslade, a well-travelled and learned man, talks ominously one night of psychology, the subconscious, thrillers and post-war society. Later, Dick reads a letter from his old boss Sir Walter Bullivant, warning him that he will soon be asked to undertake another job for the country. = The three hostages = Next day, Julius Victor visits Hannay and tells him his daughter Adela has been kidnapped and held hostage, asking Hannay to help find her. Later that day, MacGillivray visits and tells Hannay of a sinister criminal organisation, controlling the mass of disturbed and disordered minds left over from the Great War, and tracked by the police forces of the world. Faced with capture, some allies of the gang leaders had taken three hostages, Victor's daughter, an aristocratic student and a young boy, sending each of their families a mysterious poem to prove the kidnappings were linked. He also explains that they have only until June to round up the gang, and that the hostages must be safe by then. Hannay is adamant that he cannot help, but his third visitor that day, Sir Arthur Warcliff, tells him about his missing son, and Hannay is drawn into the chase. That night, he lies awake pondering the lines of doggerel sent to the families, and connects them to something Greenslade had said recently. Next day he tells Greenslade all, and bids him remember where he drew his phrases, two of which, concerning a blind woman spinning and a barn in Norway, matched verses from the poem, while the third in Greenslade's speech referred to a curiosity shop run by an elderly Jew, which seems to bear no correspondence to the poem's reference to the \\"Fields of Eden\\". Greenslade is baffled, but Hannay recalls a hymn mentioning the Fields of Eden, which Greenslade connects with his vague memories. Another day's pondering gets them no closer, until Hannay breaks his pipe. Suddenly Greenslade remembers an evening in a country pub, where a man named Medina had broken his pipe as he hummed the tune, and at the same meeting mentioned the ideas echoed in the poem. = The mysterious Mr Medina = Hannay heads to London to meet Macgillivray, and briefly runs into his old friend Sandy Arbuthnot. Macgillivray briefs him on their enemies, and soon after Hannay meets with Medina, a handsome and accomplished man who Hannay finds he likes a lot, but doesn't yet take into his confidence. He sees Sandy again, who is suspicious of Medina, and the three attend a meeting of an elite dining club, where something Medina says affects Sandy extremely – he becomes rude and angry, and tries to drag Hannay away, but Hannay refuses and walks home with Medina. They stop at Medina's house for a pipe, and there Hannay has a strange dreamlike experience of which he remembers little, only later realising that Medina attempted to hypnotise him and that he somehow resisted. He wakes next day feeling ill, and visits a Doctor Newhover, whose name was planted in his head and who refers him on to a masseuse named Madame Breda, in whose house he also sees a strange young girl. He is again hypnotised, by unseen hands and a strange voice, and again resists. He later reports his experiences to Sandy, who urges him to watch Medina closely and makes plans to investigate the house of the masseuse, and then to take his researches to Europe. For some time Hannay hangs around Medina, one day attending a secret dance-hall with his friend Archie Roylance, where he sees a beautiful girl with dead eyes led away by Medina's suspicious butler, but learns little. He visits Newhover again, and learns that he plans to head to Norway. At last, visiting Medina, he is taken to the library where he was first hypnotised, and introduced to Medina's mother, a striking, frightening, blind old woman. He is again hypnotised, and made to do demeaning tasks, until they are sure he is under their control. He hears of Medina's plans to meet with one Kharama, and learns the gang plans to break up by midsummer, before he faints from exhaustion. = The farm in Norway = Hannay arranges with his friend Archie Roylance to be flown home from Norway when the time comes, and is taken to meet Kharama, an impressive but sinister Indian who discusses hypnotism with Medina. Later, he gets a note from Sandy, arranging a meeting. Telling Medina he is ill and needs a week's rest, he fixes a rendezvous with Roylance and heads home to Fosse, where he sets up a pretence of being in his sickbed. He meets Sandy and they share what they have found, and then slips onto the boat taking Dr Newhover to Norway. Arriving there, he sees Newhover head off by boat, and follows at a discreet distance. Knowing Newhover's heading, he leaves his boat at the village before, bidding the pilot to await his return, and heads overland to Merdal. There, not wishing to be seen at the inn by Newhover, he approaches some locals to find lodging, and is amazed to meet Herr Gaudian, a German engineer he met during the events of Greenmantle. Gaudian reveals he knows Newhover, in truth a former German agent, and agrees to help Hannay. Hannay takes lodgings alongside Gaudian, and learns of a farm in the hills leased to an Englishman ; next day they watch Newhover travel up there, and the man he replaces head down to the village. They spy out the place, but learn little until the second night, when Hannay, heading to the farm, sees Newhover hurrying anxiously down the hill ; he heads into the scrub to avoid being seen, and comes across someone scrambling through the bushes. The man falls into a stream, and Hannay rescues him, and recognises Lord Mercot, one of the hostages. They feed and bathe him, and hear his broken story of hypnotised abduction, but then must persuade him to return to his captors, until such time as the other hostages can be found, promising Gaudian will be keeping an eye. The brave boy heads back to his prison, and Hannay heads for his rendezvous with Archie Roylance. Despite the weather, he makes it safe back to England, and returns to London and Medina. = The Fields of Eden = Richard Hannay spends some days with Medina, including another meeting with Kharama, to little avail, but on hearing the hymn mentioned by Greenslade at the start of his quest he is inspired to investigate London for a place suggesting the \\"Fields of Eden\\", calling in his old boss Bullivant, an expert on old London, to help. They find mention of a pleasure-resort of that name, and Hannay travels to where it stood and finds an antique shop, clearly a front. He arranges a housebreaking expert to let him in by night, and explores, finding the shop backs on to a larger and newer house; he sees a man there he recognises from his time under hypnosis at Medina's, and following the sound of music finds himself in a room overlooking the dance club where he saw Odell, Medina's butler. To his shock, he sees his old friend Turpin there, dancing with his own wife Mary. He meets Mary later at her aunts' house, and learns she has been working for Sandy, who also knows about the Fields of Eden; they have found the missing girl, Adela Victor, disguised as one of the dancers at the club, but are no closer to finding the little boy. Hannay is invited to stay at Medina's house, but before he moves there he hears from Mary that Archie Roylance has been to the club, been upset by Odell's treatment of the girl and revealed Turpin's identity. Hannay visits Roylance in hospital, where he was recovering from having been beaten by Odell, but Turpin has disappeared – Hannay later learns he was taken, part-hypnotised by Kharama, to a strange house; there Turpin shakes off his paralysis, sees his girl in the house, and plays quiet for a time. Hannay moves in with Medina, whose cool facade has weakened somewhat, and hears that Sandy has been spotted in London. For a week he stays at the house, under close scrutiny, but learns little until he gets a telegram from Gaudian, saying Mercot and his captors have fought and Gaudian has had to lock them all up, bringing Mercot home himself. Tom Greenslade visits, with a message from Mary saying Turpin and Adela Victor are safe. Hannay discovers that Medina's plans to liquidate his gang have been brought forward, and manages to warn Mary. = The round-up = We learn in an aside of a dowdy but somehow elegant district visitor coming to the house of Madame Breda in Palmyra Square, befriending the maid but being warned off by her mistress. Hannay continues to cling to Medina, until at last Greenslade visits again, and instructs Hannay to come to the dance club the following night, leaving a door to Medina's unlocked, while Mercot travels home by train and Turpin, having awakened Adela from her trance, is held in the mysterious house while she sets off once more for the club, and around Britain, Europe and the world the police close in on a variety of people and places. Sandy briefly drops in on Hannay and Medina at a dinner of the Thursday Club, from where Hannay goes to the dance club and sees the staff rounded up and Turpin soundly beat Odell; Mary visits Madame Breda once more, leaving with a bundle in her arms and police swarming the house behind her; Hannay returns to Medina's house, and reveals he knows all, pleading with Medina to hand over the boy. Despite the upset to his plans, Medina is cool, but shaken somewhat when Kharama enters and reveals himself as none other than Sandy Arbuthnot, who has looked after Turpin and Adela at Medina's request, and now threatens to expose him if he refuses to heal the child. Lavater, an old friend of Sandy long lost to Medina, is discovered to be Medina's private secretary, and to hold many secrets, but still Medina holds out. Mary enters with the strange little girl from Madame Breda's house; she has become a powerful figure of wrath, and threatens to disfigure vain Medina if he does not cure the child; he gives in, restores the boy's mind, and they return him to his joyous father. Later, Hannay and Mary join Adela, Turpin, Mercot, and Gaudian in celebration. = The showdown = After a restful spell in the country, Sandy warns Hannay that Medina, never accused of any crimes, may be out for revenge, and advises him to head to Scotland for a spell. Soon he, Mary, their son and Doctor Greenslade are in the Scottish Highlands for the deerstalking season. Soon Archie arrives with news that Medina is at a neighbouring lodge, and Hannay prepares for a showdown. After a long and complex stalk through the crags, Hannay, with no bullets, climbs a dangerous chimney, only to have his hand shot by Medina; he struggles to the top, and Medina follows, but takes a bad turn and gets stuck. He loses his gun, and Hannay lowers a rope to him, but the exhausted Medina is too much for one-handed Hannay to raise up, and lowering him wears through the rope until it breaks, dropping Medina to his death. Hannay falls back exhausted, but is found alive and safe next day.

His wife and the wife of Nagai Tatsuo were sisters. Early life Kume was born in Ueda city, Nagano prefecture. His father was the principal of the local elementary school, and committed suicide in 1897 to take responsibility for a fire which destroyed a portion of the school where a portrait of Emperor Meiji had been displayed. Kume moved with his mother to her home in Kōriyama city, Fukushima prefecture, where he was raised. Literary career Kume exhibited a talent for haiku poetry even in elementary school. After graduating from Tokyo Imperial University Department of Literature under Natsume Sōseki (together with classmates Ryūnosuke Akutagawa and Kan Kikuchi), he joined a literary group that published a literary magazine called . Kume's debut as a playwright came with Gyunyuya no Kyōdai (\\"Milkman’s Siblings\\"), which was staged in 1914 and proved to be very popular. By 1916, he had published his first novel Chichi no Shi (\\"My Father's Death\\") and a play Abukuma Shinju (\\"Love Suicides at Abukuma\\"). In 1918 he founded the Kokumin Bungeikai (\\"People's Arts Movement\\") with Kaoru Osanai and Mantarō Kubota. His fame as a novelist grew when he wrote a series of stories, including Hotaru Gusa (\\"Firefly Weeds\\"), Hasen (\\"Shipwreck\\"), and Bosan (\\"Visit to a Grave\\"), about his unrequited love for Natsume Sōseki's eldest daughter (he proposed to her via her parents, as was the practice at the time, but she surprised everyone by announcing her love for Kume's classmate and close friend Yuzuru Matsuoka instead). In 1925, Kume write an essay, Shishōsetsu to Shinkyō shōsetsu (\\"The I-Novel and the Mental State Novel\\"), which became a classic in defining those two literary forms. In 1933, he wrote a melodramatic novel Tsuki yori no shisha (\\"Messenger from the Moon\\"), which was a major best-seller. Kume was arrested in Kamakura in 1933, along with fellow literati Matsutarō Kawaguchi and Ton Satomi for illegal card gambling. Life in Kamakura Kume relocated from Tokyo to Kamakura, Kanagawa prefecture due to the Great Kantō earthquake of 1923, residing there until his death in 1952 at the age of 60. He was a prominent figure in Kamakura literary circles, helping to establish the Kamakura P.E.N. Club, the Kamakura Carnival, and running the Kamakura Bunko lending library. Kume suffered from high blood pressure much of his life, and died of a cerebral hemorrhage. His grave is at the temple of Zuisen-ji in Kamakura. After Kume's death, his house was physically relocated from the Nikaido district of Kamakura to Kōriyama in Fukushima prefecture, where it now houses the Kōriyama Bunkagu no Mori Museum. There is a bronze statue of Kume in the grounds of Hase-dera in Kamakura.  See also  * Japanese literature * List of Japanese authors  References  * Mack, Edward.

The weapon used by this task force is an urban assault vehicle that masquerades as a Dodge Viper RT/10 roadster and coupe (later, the Viper GTS). The series takes place in \\"the near future\\". The primary brand of vehicles driven in the show were Chrysler or subsidiary companies. The series ran on NBC for one season in 1994 before being revived two years later for three more seasons of first-run syndication. Reruns of the series have appeared on Sci-Fi Channel and USA Network. The Viper Defender \\"star car\\" was designed by Chrysler Corporation engineers unlike most Hollywood film/television cars that are usually customized by film picture designers. The exterior design of the car was produced by Chrysler stylist Steve Ferrerio. NBC run The original series began filming in Los Angeles Area in early 1993 and was planned to debut on CBS in Fall 1993. However, it was first delayed when Stephen J. Cannell also named his new TV show Viper. After a lawsuit by Chrysler Corporation, Cannell renamed his show to Cobra. After that, the premiere was delayed further when CBS deemed the series to be too violent and decided to bury it. However, due to Chrysler's backing, the show proceeded on, and was picked up by NBC. The series originally aired on NBC during the 1993–1994 season, debuting on January 2, 1994 with a two-hour pilot movie, as a mid-season replacement for Against the Grain in NBC's Friday Night 8PM slot. After falling ratings, the series was canceled in April 1994. The music for the pilot and opening theme for season 1 was composed by Eddie Jobson. Jay Ferguson took over music composition for the rest of the seasons. He composed a remixed theme of the original season-1 opening and the brand new season-4 opening theme. The Dodge Viper RT/10 Roadsters used in seasons 1–3 were actually not production models. Instead, Chrysler supplied various leftover engineering mules and prototypes of the Viper (still visually the same). Many other cars in season 1 were leftover prototypes, as well. For example, in the pilot movie, the Eagle Premier sedans with yellow vinyl stripes were drivetrain engineering mules for the LH cars (Dodge Intrepid/Chrysler Concorde). The special effect \\"hex snakeskin\\" transformation for the pilot and the first season was done by Metrolight Studios. Tim Claycomb and Tim Eilers took over the transformation sequence after the first season. Sources indicate that it cost $50,000 for each transformation scene in the NBC season. First-run syndication version After NBC canceled the series, production company Paramount Television decided to rework Viper for first-run syndication. With the company's syndication unit as distributor, Viper began airing on weekends in September 1996. The only actor to return for season 2 was Joe Nipote in his role as Frankie \\"X\\" Waters, and he would remain until the end of the series. James McCaffrey, who played Joe Astor, the Viper's driver in season 1, returned in season 4. Heather Medway, who played Det. Cameron Westlake, was the only new cast member from the show's revival to stay on the entire three syndicated seasons (from 1996 to 1999). Season 2 was filmed predominantly in Calgary, Alberta. The series was then moved for filming in Vancouver, British Columbia, during seasons 3 and 4. The Cobalt Blue Metallic color on the Viper GTS in season 4 was not an optional color for the production Viper GTS; it was specifically for the show only. Viper came to an end in May 1999. OverviewSeason 1 (1994)= Metro City was under siege from the crime wave that was begun by \\"the Outfit\\", a crime group led in the pilot by a man known only as Mr. Townsend (played by William Russ), and later led by Lane Cassidy (played by Richard Burgi). The Metro City Police Department, or MetroPol, was unable to get a handle on the situation. This led to the creation of the Viper Project, a special top-secret task force created by the federal government to fight the wave of violence sweeping Metro City. This task force used a modified 1994 Flame Red Dodge Viper RT/10 Roadster sports car that could, at the flip of a secret switch, transform from a muscle car into an armored machine known as \\"Defender\\". The \\"Defender\\" was an invention of technological specialist Julian Wilkes (played by Dorian Harewood), who was paralyzed during a shootout between police and criminals. The project was delayed by numerous setbacks, mainly because regular drivers were unable to handle this deadly machine. A precision driver was needed for this car. Michael Payton (played by James McCaffrey), a top driver for the Outfit, was leading his team from their latest heist when he got caught in an accident and was injured. Captured, Payton's memory was erased and he was reborn as Joe Astor, an officer for Metropol. Astor proves to be the only one capable of handling the Defender. Since the Viper Project successfully made a dent in the profits made by the Outfit, they kidnap Astor and demand that he steal the Defender. He agrees to do so, but changes his mind. In retaliation, the Outfit murders his girlfriend, Elizabeth Houston. As for the Viper Project itself, the Outfit bribes Councilman Strand (played by Jon Polito), the man who approved the Viper Project and orchestrated the erasure of Payton's memory, to help them discredit the project, leading to its cancellation. However, Astor and Wilkes, with the help of mechanic Franklin Waters (played by Joe Nipote), steal the Viper and gain access to Payton's bank account, using both in a private war against crime. Astor runs the operation for several months before he is sent to Europe to handle deep cover operations for the U.S. government, leading to the end of the Viper Team's war on crime. =Season 2 (1996–1997)= Shortly after Astor's departure, Metro City was hit by a second crime wave, this time in the form of a team of renegade ex- commandos led by Col. Hanson Dekker (played by Tim Thomerson), a former U.S. Army Special Forces officer, who served combat tours in Iraq, Bosnia, and Cuba. Against this backdrop, Thomas Cole (played by Jeff Kaake), a CIA agent with evasive driving experience, was selected to head a new Viper Team. He was delivering the new Viper to Metro City when he was pulled over for speeding by two MetroPol officers, Cameron Westlake (played by Heather Medway) and her partner, an officer named Carpenter (played by Roger R. Cross). During this traffic stop, Dekker and his commandos hit the Metro City Bank. Upon hearing of the bank heist on their radio, Carpenter and Westlake left Cole behind to join their fellow officers at the bank to confront Dekker and his commandos. Officer Carpenter saved Westlake's life by knocking her to the ground when the International Transtar 4300 tractor Dekker was driving smashed through the Metropol roadblock, only to die when he was shot by Dekker's second-in- command, Lee Cyrus (played by Dean Wray). Because of the bank heist, the Viper Project was reborn, with a Metropol liaison to ride shotgun. For this assignment, Westlake's superior, Capt. Harold Benning (played by Mike Genovese), promoted her to detective and sent her to the meeting place, where she found herself meeting Thomas Cole, the very man Carpenter and she pulled over for speeding. She also met Waters, the original mechanic from the first Viper Project, and Allie Farrow (played by Dawn Stern), Viper's systems specialist. Despite a systems glitch and the kidnapping of Waters by Dekker and his men, the Viper Team defeated them and rescued Waters. Dekker was killed when his Transtar 4300 was blown up by the team to keep it from crashing into Metro Hospital. After this victory, the Viper Team carried on its crusade against evil, overcoming such obstacles as interference by Special Agent Sherman Catlett (played by J. Downing), a by-the-book bureaucrat from the FBI, to the team being discredited again, this time by Lee Cyrus, the man who murdered Westlake's partner, Officer Carpenter. Cyrus' scheme to discredit the team involved a replica of the Viper in the Defender configuration, which his men and he used to commit vicious crimes, including a murder. This led Cole's superior, the Administrator (played by Bruce A. Young), to shut down the team. In defiance of orders to stand down, the team cleared their name and Westlake avenged Carpenter's death. =Season 3 (1997–1998)= After serving as the team's systems specialist for several months, Allie Farrow was reassigned to another post, which left Waters to take care of the Defender's systems and mechanical needs by himself. During this period, the team had to contend with new enemies, including Lena Weisinger (played by Stephanie Niznik), a former Stasi agent turned freelance mercenary, who had a personal vendetta against Westlake for killing her lover, Emil Rurik (played by Mike Dopud), during a shootout. However, after years of successful operation, the team suffered a tragic loss ... not of one of their people, but the car. A notorious criminal named Giles Seaton (played by Peter Wingfield) concocted a plot to steal the Defender by using a criminal named Terry Hawkes (Jeff Kaake in a dual role), who was turned into a Thomas Cole look-alike with plastic surgery. As Cole, Hawkes successfully penetrated the team's headquarters, and despite being exposed by the real Cole, made off with the Viper. To prevent Hawkes from escaping, the team blew up the Viper, keeping its secrets from falling into enemy hands. =Season 4 (1998–1999)= In the aftermath of the Viper's destruction, Cole was permanently reassigned to undercover work on other fronts. With the team gone, Metro City was again gripped by an enormous crime wave, forcing the feds to restart the Viper Team a third time. This time, the car they used was a 1996 Cobalt Blue Metallic Dodge Viper GTS Coupe, which, due to Wilkes, had the equipment of the original Defender, along with some new equipment, most notably the hovercraft mode. Since Cole had been reassigned, Joe Astor, the original driver, was called back to service. However, Astor was haunted by his old Payton identity once more.

Members of this superorder are called ostariophysians. This diverse group contains 10,758 species, about 28% of known fish species in the world and 68% of freshwater species, and are present on all continents except Antarctica. They have a number of common characteristics such as an alarm substance and a Weberian apparatus. Members of this group include fish important to people for food, sport, the aquarium industry, and research.  Taxonomy  The superorder is divided into two series, Anotophysi and Otophysi. However, in older literature, Ostariophysi was restricted only to the fish that are currently classified under Otophysi. Otophysi was coined in 1970 by Rosen and Greenwood to separate the traditional Ostariophysians from the added Gonorynchiformes. The superorder is classified below: *Series Anotophysi ** Gonorynchiformes, about 37 species *Series Otophysi (Euostariophysi) ** Cypriniformes (minnows and allies), about 4,501 species (contains Cyprinidae, largest family of freshwater fishes) ** Characiformes (characins and allies), about 2,168 species ** Siluriformes (catfishes), about 3,813 species ** Gymnotiformes (electric eels, American knifefishes), about 239 species (sometimes grouped under Siluriformes) The monophyly of Ostariophysi has come into question with molecular evidence. Gonorynchiformes is more closely related to Clupeiformes than Otophysi. It is possible that the Gonorynchiformes and Clupeiformes form a monophyletic group. There is evidence for a sister group relationship between Ostariophysi and Clupeomorpha (the taxon Ostarioclupeomorpha, also known as Otocephala, was coined to describe this possibly monophyletic group). Evolution Ostariophysian fossils, both anotophysan and otophysian, are known from the early Cretaceous. Ostariophysian fossils are known from every continent except Australia. Ostariophysians are currently distributed worldwide on all continents except Antarctica. The common ancestor of this group entered fresh water about coincident with the global decrease in oxygen levels in marine waters.Nakatani M, Miya M, Mabuchi K, Saitoh K, Nishida M (2011) Evolutionary history of Otophysi (Teleostei), a major clade of the modern freshwater fishes: Pangaean origin and Mesozoic radiation. BMC Evol Biol 11(1):177 The Otophysi originated in freshwaters during the Jurassic (c. 200-145 Ma) before the breakup of the super continent Pangea. The division of the Otophysi into the four extant clades closely follows the breakup of Pangea. The separation of Laurasia in the north from Gondwana in the south isolated the lineages which gave rise to the modern Cyprinoformes and Characiphysi. The Characiphysi then was itself divided into the diurnal (day- active) Characiformes and the nocturnal (night-active) Siluriphysi, including Siluriformes and Gymnotiformes. Modern Characiformes are present in both South America and Africa, and have relatively recently extended their range to North America. The Siluriphysi are characterized by many derived traits, including notably, electroreception. The Siluriphysi originated before the breakup of Gondwana into South America and Africa in the Aptian (c. 110 Ma) but the presence of several basal Siluriphysan taxa in modern South America (Gymnotiformes, Diplomystidae, Loricaridea) suggest that the Siluriphysi may have originated on the western portion of Gondwana. Alternatively, these basal taxa have subsequently become extinct in Africa. The modern distribution of Siluriformes is cosmopolitan due to subsequent dispersal. Diversity Ostariophysi is the second largest teleost superorder. It includes five major lineages and is a very diverse group. As of 2006 (Nelson), the five orders contain 1,075 genera in 64 families and about 7,931 species, which is about 28% of all known fish species. The four largest families in this group (Cyprinidae, Characidae, Loricariidae, and Balitoridae) include 4,656 species, over half (59%) of ostariophysian species. Cyprinidae itself is the largest fresh water fish family and the largest family of vertebrates after Gobiidae. Ostariophysians account for about 68% of all freshwater species; in fact, there are only about 123 marine species (Chanidae, Gonorynchidae, most Ariidae, about half of Plotosidae). They are present on all continents and major land masses except Antarctica, Greenland, and New Zealand. This group includes a wide variety of different fishes. It contains one of the largest freshwater fish ever caught, the Mekong giant catfish, which can weigh up to about 300 kg. It also contains the smallest species of freshwater fish, Danionella translucida at only 12 mm in length. Some of these fish are able to breathe atmospheric oxygen (Clariidae) or even live out of water (Phreatobius cisternarum). Some Ostariphysans have the ability to produce electricity (Malapteruridae, Gymnotiformes). Physical characteristics Most species possess a swim bladder (except in Gonorynchus). The swim bladder is usually divided into two chambers. A smaller anterior chamber is partially or completely covered by a silvery peritoneal tunic. A larger posterior chamber may be reduced or absent in some groups. Minute, unicellular, horny projections known as \\"unculi\\" are commonly present on various body parts and are only known from ostariophysians. Many ostariophysians have the characteristic of an alarm substance that is part of a fright reaction. This is a pheromone produced in epidermal club cells, and is similar or identical in all ostariophysians. When the fish is injured, this pheromone is released; other fish of the same species or similar species can smell this pheromone, causing a fright reaction. However, some fish possess the alarm substance without the fright reaction or lack both the alarm substance and the fright reaction to the alarm substance. =Weberian apparatus= In otophysians, one of the main characteristics is the Weberian apparatus. Apart from this structure, there is no other trait that could explain the success of otophysians. It is made up of a set of bones known as Weberian ossicles, a chain of small bones that connect the auditory system to the gas bladder of fishes. The ossicles connect the gas bladder wall with Y-shaped lymph sinus that abuts the lymph-filled transverse canal joining the sacculi of the right and left ears. This allows the transmission of vibrations to the inner ear. In anotophysians, the three first vertebrae are specialized and associated with one or more cephalic ribs (a primitive Weberian apparatus). In the otophysians, a distinct modification of the anterior four or five first vertebrae is found, as well as the Weberian ossicles. The fully functioning Weberian apparatus consists of the swim bladder, the Weberian ossicles, a portion of the anterior vertebral column, and some muscles and ligaments.

The game engine was written from scratch in C++ as a mostly independent component, and includes support for features such as Python scripting and OpenAL 3D sound. History Erwin Coumans and Gino van den Bergen developed the Blender Game Engine in 2000. The goal was to create a marketable commercial product to easily create games and other interactive content, in an artist-friendly way. These games could run either as stand- alone applications, or embedded in a webpage using a special plugin that was eventually discontinued, as the inability to sandbox Python aroused security concerns, though there was a later effort to revive it (an updated alpha version for Internet Explorer, and Firefox and COLLADA support was considered). Another plugin has surfaced named Burster, which enables secure embedded gameplay on websites, with sandboxing and encryption support. Key code in the physics library (SUMO) did not become open-source when the rest of Blender did, which prevented the game engine from functioning until version 2.37a. Blender 2.41 showcased a version that was almost entirely devoted to the game engine; audio was supported. Version 2.42 showed several significant new features, including integration of the Bullet rigid-body dynamics library. A new system for integration of GLSL shaders and soft-body physics was added in the 2.48 release to help bring the game engine back in line with modern game engines. Like Blender, it uses OpenGL, a cross-platform graphics layer, to communicate with graphics hardware. During the 2010 Google Summer of Code, the open-source navigation mesh construction and pathfinding libraries Recast and Detour were integrated; the work was merged to trunk in 2011. Audaspace was coded as well to provide a Python handle for sound control. This library uses OpenAL or SDL as a backend. Features The Blender Game Engine uses a system of graphical \\"logic bricks\\" (a combination of \\"sensors\\", \\"controllers\\" and \\"actuators\\") to control the movement and display of objects. The game engine can also be extended via a set of Python bindings. * Graphical logic editor for defining interactive behavior without programming * Collision detection and dynamics simulation now support Bullet Physics Library. Bullet is an open-source collision detection and rigid body dynamics library developed for PlayStation 3 * Shape types: Convex polyhedron, box, sphere, cone, cylinder, capsule, compound, and static triangle mesh with auto deactivation mode * Discrete collision detection for rigid body simulation * Support for in-game activation of dynamic constraints * Full support for vehicle dynamics, including spring reactions, stiffness, damping, tire friction etc. * Python scripting API for sophisticated control and AI, fully defined advanced game logic * Support all OpenGL lighting modes, including transparencies, Animated and reflection-mapped textures * Support for multimaterials, multitexture and texture blending modes, per-pixel lighting, dynamic lighting, mapping modes, GLSL Vertex Paint texture blending, toon shading, animated materials, support for normal and parallax mapping * Playback of games and interactive 3D content without compiling or preprocessing * Audio, using the SDL toolkit * Multi-layering of Scenes for overlay interfaces. Future roadmap Ton Roosendaal has stated that the future of the Blender Game Engine will integrate the system into Blender as an \\"Interaction Mode\\" for game prototypes, architectural walkthroughs and scientific simulators. Blender developer Martijn Berger stated that \\"The sequencer and game engine are in serious danger of removal, if we cannot come up with a good solution during the 2.8 project.\\" On the 16th of April 2018 Blender Game Engine was removed from Blender ahead of 2.8's launch. Blender is working to have a good support for external game engines like Godot, Armory3D and Blend4Web. UPBGE UPBGE (Uchronia Project Blender Game Engine) is a fork of Blender created by Tristan Porteries and some friends in September 2015. It is an independent branch with the aim of cleaning up and improving the official Blender Game Engine code, experimenting with new features, and implementing forgotten features that currently exist but have not been merged with the official Blender trunk. UPBGE Blender builds can be downloaded from the upbge.org website. As of late 2017, the UPBGE team is integrating their code with the unreleased 2.8 version of Blender and the team's intention is to make use of the new real-time physically based renderer in Blender 2.8 which is called Eevee. There are ongoing discussions about the UPBGE code becoming part of a future official Blender release.

The tumors take the form of cartilage-capped bony projections or outgrowth on the surface of bones exostoses. It is characterized as a type of overgrowth that can occur in any bone where cartilage forms bone. Tumors most commonly affect long bones about the knee and in the forearm. Additionally, flat bones such as the pelvis and scapula (shoulder blade) may be affected. Hereditary multiple exostoses usually present during childhood. Yet, the vast majority of affected individuals become clinically manifest by the time they reach adolescence. Osteochondromas occur in 3% of the general population and represent 35% of all benign tumors and 8% of all bone tumors. The majority of these tumors are solitary non-hereditary lesions and approximately 15% of osteochondromas occur as hereditary multiple exostoses preferably known as hereditary multiple osteochondromas (HMOs). Osteochondromas do not result from injury and the exact cause remains unknown. Recent research has indicated that multiple osteochondromas is an autosomal dominant inherited disease. Germ line mutations in EXT1 and EXT2 genes located on chromosomes 8 and 11 have been associated with the cause of the disease. The treatment choice for osteochondroma is surgical removal of solitary lesion or partial excision of the outgrowth, when symptoms cause motion limitations or nerve and blood vessel impingements. In hereditary multiple exostoses the indications of surgery are based upon multiple factors that are taken collectively, namely: patient's age, tumor location and number, accompanying symptomatology, esthetic concerns, family history and underlying gene mutation. A variety of surgical procedures have been employed to remedy hereditary multiple exostoses such as osteochondroma excision, bone lengthening, corrective osteotomy and hemiepiphysiodesis. Sometimes a combination of the previous procedures is used. The indicators of surgical success in regard to disease and patient characteristics are greatly disputable. Because most studies of hereditary multiple exostoses are retrospective and of limited sample size with missing data, the best evidence for each of the currently practiced surgical procedures is lacking.  Signs and symptoms  Limited normal functions and movements are caused by osteochondromas growing slowly and inwardly. The majority of osteochondromas are symptomless and are found incidentally. Each individual with osteochondroma may experience symptoms differently and most of the time individuals will experience no symptoms at all. Some of the most common symptoms are a hard immobile painless palpable mass, adjacent muscle soreness, and pressure or irritation with heavy exercising. Major symptoms arise when complications such as fractures, bone deformity or mechanical joint problems occur. If the occurrence of an osteochondroma is near a nerve or a blood vessel, the affected limb can experience numbness, weakness, loss of pulse or color change. Periodic changes in the blood flow can also take place. Approximately 20% of patients experiencing nerve compression commonly acknowledge vascular compression, arterial thrombosis, aneurysm, and pseudoaneurysm. Formation of pseudoaneurysm and venous thrombosis lead to claudication, pain, acute ischemia, and symptoms of phlebitis. If the tumor is found under a tendon, it can cause pain during movement causing restriction of joint motion. Pain can also occur due to bursal inflammation, swelling or fracture at the base of the tumor stalk. Some of the clinical signs and symptoms of malignant osteochondroma are pain, swelling, and mass enlargement.  Mechanism  Osteochondromas are long and slender, pedunculated on a stalk often taking the shape of a cauliflower. The cartilage cap is covered by fibrous perichondrium and continues with the periosteum of the underlying bone. The cartilage cap is less than 2 cm thick and the thickness decreases with age. A cap more than 2 cm thick, indicates malignant transformation of a tumor. The cartilage cap merges with the epiphyseal area of the long bones called spongiosa. In the spongiosa, the chondrocytes are arranged in accordance with the epiphyseal growth plate. The spongiosa of the stalk continues with the underlying cancellous bone. Fractures within the stalk causes fibroblastic proliferation and formation of a new bone. Development of bursa takes place over the osteochondroma, which is attached to the perichondrium of the cap. Inflammation of the bone is indicated by the bursal wall lined by the synovium. As a result, patients may have swelling for years related to the location and site of the lesion indicative of mechanical obstruction, nerve impingement, pseudoaneurysm of the overlying vessel, fracture at the stalk of the lesion, or formation of bursa over the osteochondroma. Heparan sulphate (HS) are glycosaminoglycans which are involved in the formation of proteoglycans. The biosynthesis of HS takes place in the Golgi apparatus and endoplasmic reticulum, where glycosaminoglycans chains are maintained by type II glycosyltransferases encoded by EXOSTOSIN genes EXT1 and EXT2. Decreased levels of HS leads to mutations in EXT1 or EXT2 causing skeletal abnormality. The underlying mechanism for solitary and multiple osteochondromas have been associated with genetic alterations in EXT1 or EXT2 genes located on chromosomes 8 and 11. Approximately 65% of osteochondromas arise in the EXT1 gene loci on chromosome 8 and 35% arise in EXT2 gene loci on chromosome 11. About 70–75% of multiple osteochondromas are caused by point mutations, often involving deletion of single or multiple axons as found in 10% of all hereditary cases. In about 10–15% of all cases no genomic alterations are detected. The mechanism behind the formation of multiple osteochondroma is large genomic deletions of EXT1 and EXT2 genes. The identified mechanism behind solitary osteochondromas is the homozygous deletions of the EXT1 gene. However, the exact cause of osteochondroma is unknown. Additionally, the molecular basis of genetics and clinical variability of multiple osteochondroma as well as the underlying causes for the malignant transformation and the onset of osteochondroma in EXT negative patients is also currently unknown.  Diagnosis  Osteochondromas are often asymptomatic and may not cause any kind of discomfort. They are often found accidentally when an X-ray is done for an unrelated reason. * X-rays are the first tests performed that characterize a lesion. They show a clear picture of dense structures of bones, and will also indicate bone growth pertaining to osteochondroma. * Computed tomography (CT) scan can identify the bony lesion in great details and show the presence of calcification. These tests also provide great details, especially in soft tissues with the aide of cross- sectional images. * Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the most accurate method for detecting bone masses in symptomatic cases to depict precise morphology of a tumor. It is used to verify if the palpable mass is continuous with the cortex of the affected bone and to differentiate an osteochondroma from other lesions on the surface of the bone. MRI can also be used to look for cartilage on the surface of tumor and can depict any vascular complications caused by the tumor. An MRI can identify tumors of the spinal column and is often used to diagnose low grade osteosarcoma. * Ultrasound is done if aneurysms or pseudoaneurysms and venous or arterial thrombosis is suspected. Ultrasound is an accurate method for examining the cartilaginous cap of the osteochondroma. It is also a way of pinpointing bursitis. However, it cannot be used to predict if the growth of tumor is inward in regards to the cap. * Angiography is used to detect vascular lesions caused by osteochondroma due to ossified cartilaginous cap. It is also used to characterize malignant transformation lesions through neovascularity. * Clinical testing such as sequence analysis can be done of the entire coding regions of both EXT1 and EXT2 to detect mutations. * A biopsy of the tissue sample of the tumor can also be taken to check for cancer. Tests for osteochondroma can also identify diseases such as secondary peripheral chondrosarcoma and multiple osteochondromatosis. In large, secondary chondrosarcoma arises at the site of osteochondroma due to increased thickness of the cartilage cap indicating potential malignant transformation. The symptoms of multiple osteochondromatosis are similar to solitary osteochondroma, but they are often more severe. Painless bumps can arise at the site of tumor and pain and other discomforts can also take place if pressure is put on the soft tissues, nerves, or blood vessels. Dysplasia Epiphysealis Hemimelica (DEH) or Trevor's disease and metachondromatosis (MC) are considered differential diagnosis of both solitary and hereditary osteochondromas. DEH is described as a type of over growth at one or more epiphyses. Similar to osteochondroma, DEH is diagnosed prior to 15 years of age and the growth of lesions end at puberty, when the growth plates close. Metachondromatosis is a rare disorder that exhibit symptoms of both multiple osteochondromas and enchondromas in children and is also inherited in autosomal dominant mode. A type that contains fat is known as an osteolipochondroma (osteo, bone, lipos, fat, + chondros, cartilage, oma, tumor).  Treatment  Surgical extraction of osteochondromas is sometimes beneficial. Shown is an osteochondroma surgically extracted from a ten-year- old patient. The bone is the cylindrical stalk at the bottom, about 1/2 inch long, the two diagonal growths are cartilage. This morphology is typical of a tibial bone spur. Osteochondromas are benign lesions and do not affect life expectancy. Complete excision of osteochondroma is curative and the reoccurrences take place when the removal of tumor is incomplete. Multiple reoccurrences in a well-excised lesion indicate that it may be malignant. The risk of malignant transformation takes place in 1–5% of individuals. If any symptoms of cancerous tumor takes place, then the patient should be evaluated by a bone specialist. No treatment is necessary for Solitary osteochondromas that are asymptomatic. Treatments for solitary osteochondroma are careful observation over time and taking regular x-rays to monitor any changes in the tumor. If the lesion is causing pain with activity, nerve or vessel impingement, or if the bone growth has fully matured and the presence of a large cartilage cap is prominent, then it is advised that the tumor be surgically removed. Osteochondromas have a low rate of malignancy (<1%) and resection of the tumor is suggested if symptoms such as pain, limitation of movement, or impingement on nerves or vessels occur. Resection of the tumor also takes place when the tumor increases in size and progresses towards malignancy. During surgical resection, the entire lesion along with the cartilaginous cap should be removed to minimize any chances of reoccurrences. Surgical treatment becomes the sole treatment of choice if common complications such as fractures, symptoms of peripheral nerves such as paresthesia, paraplegia, peroneal neuropathy, and upper limb neuropathy take place. A prophylactic resection is suggested if the lesion lies next to a vessel. Depending on the size and location of the tumor, the time it takes to return to normal daily activities varies between individuals. Limitation on some activities is advised if pain or discomfort persists after surgical excision.  Research  Research done using Zebrafish dackel (dak) have shown that in EXT2-/- Zebrafish, chondrocytes fail to undergo terminal differentiation and bone formation fails to progress from pre-osteoblasts stage to osteoblasts. Instead, abnormal lipid deposition and premature adipocyte differentiation takes place. The expression of xbp1, master regulator of osterix gets reduced, suggesting that unfolded proteins responses may play a role in pathogenesis of multiple osteochondroma. The research concludes that heparan sulphates are required for terminal differentiation and formation of scaffold that is needed for bone development. At least one copy of EXT2 gene is needed for proper bone development and to maintain the balance between bone and fat cell lineages. Due to homozygous loss of EXT2 function, leads to imbalance between cartilage, bone, and fat cell lineages. These observations in null zebrafish points toward the musculoskeletal defects observed in patients with multiple osteochondroma. Due to the findings of bone-fat imbalance in Zebra fish model, future studies should address status of lipid composition in patients with multiple osteochondroma. Research conducted using sequencing methods has identified a novel frame shift mutation at the glycosyltransferase domain (c.1457insG) located at codon 486 of exon 6 of the EXT1 gene, that causes multiple osteochondromas. This study was conducted in two multiple osteochondroma (MO) patients from the Chinese descent (same family) and the results were validated with four other members of the same MO family and 200 unrelated healthy subjects. The results of the mutations were validated using two different sequencing methods (Exome and Sanger). The results of immunohistochemistry and multiple sequence alignment supports the cause of MO being a mutation in EXT1 gene. However, the exact molecular mechanism of multiple osteochondroma remains unclear. The EXT1 gene encodes the endoplasmic reticulum-resident type II transmembrane glycosyltransferase, which catalyzes polymerization of heparin sulfate chain at the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus. Heparin sulfate regulates signal transduction during chondrocyte differentiation, ossification, and apoptosis. Malfunction in heparin sulfate synthesis causes chondrocytes to rapidly differentiate. Based on these results future studies should elucidate the underlying molecular mechanism of the glycosyltransferase domain of the EXT1 and its involvement in the development of multiple osteochondromas. Osteochondromas are associated with secondary peripheral chondrosarcomas, but the pathogenesis of the malignant bone tumor remains unknown. Research has demonstrated that chondrocytes with dysfunctional EXT1 is present in solitary osteochondromas, but the EXT1 is functional in sporadic (solitary) secondary peripheral chondrosarcomas. Research indicates that osteochondromas creates a special niche in which wild type cells are mixed in with EXT functional cells. Then these EXT functional cells undergo other mutations, that give rise to secondary peripheral chondrosarcoma, indicating the involvement of an alternative mechanism for the pathogenesis of secondary peripheral chondrosarcoma. Future studies should address the contributing gene that causes the formation of peripheral chondrosarcoma. It should also illustrate what causes chondrocytes functional with EXT1 and EXT2 within the osteochondroma to become more susceptible to mutations leading to malignancy.

In a marked–unmarked relation, one term of an opposition is the broader, dominant one. The dominant default or minimum-effort form is known as unmarked; the other, secondary one is marked. In other words, markedness involves the characterization of a \\"normal\\" linguistic unit against one or more of its possible \\"irregular\\" forms. In linguistics, markedness can apply to, among others, phonological, grammatical, and semantic oppositions, defining them in terms of marked and unmarked oppositions, such as honest (unmarked) vs. dishonest (marked). Marking may be purely semantic, or may be realized as extra morphology. The term derives from the marking of a grammatical role with a suffix or another element, and has been extended to situations where there is no morphological distinction. In social sciences more broadly, markedness is, among other things, used to distinguish two meanings of the same term, where one is common usage (unmarked sense) and the other is specialized to a certain cultural context (marked sense). In psychology, the social science concept of markedness is quantified as a measure of how much one variable is marked as a predictor or possible cause of another, and is also known as (deltaP) in simple two-choice cases. See confusion matrix for more details.  Marked and unmarked word pairs  In terms of lexical opposites, a marked form is a non-basic one, often one with inflectional or derivational endings. Thus, a morphologically negative word form is marked as opposed to a positive one: happy/unhappy, honest/dishonest, fair/unfair, clean/unclean, and so forth. Similarly, unaffixed masculine or singular forms are taken to be unmarked in contrast to affixed feminine or plural forms: lion/lioness, host/hostess, automobile/automobiles, child/children. An unmarked form is also a default form. For example, the unmarked lion can refer to a male or female, while lioness is marked because it can refer only to females. The default nature allows unmarked lexical forms to be identified even when the opposites are not morphologically related. In the pairs old/young, big/little, happy/sad, clean/dirty, the first term of each pair is taken as unmarked because it occurs generally in questions. For example, English speakers typically ask how old someone is; use of the marked term (how young are you?) would presuppose youth.  Background in Prague School  While the idea of linguistic asymmetry predated the actual coining of the terms 'marked' and 'unmarked', the modern concept of markedness originated in the Prague School structuralism of Roman Jakobson and Nikolai Trubetzkoy as a means of characterizing binary oppositions.Andersen, Henning (1989). \\"Markedness—The First 150 Years\\". In Markedness in Synchrony and Diachrony. Berlin: Mouton de Gruyter. Both sound and meaning were analyzed into systems of binary distinctive features. Edwin Battistella wrote: \\"Binarism suggests symmetry and equivalence in linguistic analysis; markedness adds the idea of hierarchy.\\"Battistella, Edwin (1990). Markedness: The Evaluative Superstructure of Language. State University of New York Press. Trubetzkoy and Jakobson analyzed phonological oppositions such as nasal versus non-nasal as defined as the presence versus the absence of nasality; the presence of the feature, nasality, was marked; its absence, non-nasality, was unmarked. For Jakobson and Trubetzkoy, binary phonological features formed part of a universal feature alphabet applicable to all languages. In his 1932 article \\"Structure of the Russian Verb\\", Jakobson extended the concept to grammatical meanings in which the marked element \\"announces the existence of [some meaning] A\\" while the unmarked element \\"does not announce the existence of A, i.e., does not state whether A is present or not\\".Jakobson, R. (1932). \\"The Structure of the Russian Verb\\". Reprinted in Russian and Slavic Grammar Studies, 1931–1981. Mouton, 1984. Forty years later, Jakobson described language by saying that \\"every single constituent of a linguistic system is built on an opposition of two logical contradictories: the presence of an attribute ('markedness') in contraposition to its absence ('unmarkedness').\\"Jakobson, R. (1972). \\"Verbal Communication\\". Scientific American 227: 72–80. In his 1941 Child Language, Aphasia, and Universals of Language, Jakobson suggested that phonological markedness played a role in language acquisition and loss. Drawing on existing studies of acquisition and aphasia, Jakobson suggested a mirror-image relationship determined by a universal feature hierarchy of marked and unmarked oppositions. Today many still see Jakobson's theory of phonological acquisition as identifying useful tendencies.Battistella, Edwin (1996). The Logic of Markedness. New York: Oxford University Press.  Jakobsonian tradition  The work of Cornelius van Schooneveld, Edna Andrews, Rodney Sangster, Yishai Tobin and others on 'semantic invariance' (different general meanings reflected in the contextual specific meanings of features) has further developed the semantic analysis of grammatical items in terms of marked and unmarked features. Other semiotically-oriented work has investigated the isomorphism of form and meaning with less emphasis on invariance, including the efforts of Henning Andersen, Michael Shapiro, and Edwin Battistella. Shapiro and Andrews have especially made connections between the semiotic of C. S. Peirce and markedness, treating it \\"as species of interpretant\\" in Peirce's sign-object- interpretant triad. Functional linguists such as Talmy Givón have suggested that markedness is related to cognitive complexity—\\"in terms of attention, mental effort or processing time\\".Givón, T. Syntax: A Functional-Typological Introduction, vol. 2, Amsterdam: John Benjamins, 1990. Linguistic 'naturalists' view markedness relations in terms of the ways in which extralinguistic principles of perceptibility and psychological efficiency determine what is natural in language. Willi Mayerthaler, another linguist, for example, defines unmarked categories as those \\"in agreement with the typical attributes of the speaker\\".Mayerthaler Willi Morphological Naturalness. Ann Arbor: Karoma, 1988.  Cultural markedness and informedness  Since a main component of markedness is the information content and information value of an element,Battistella, Markedness, 1990. some studies have taken markedness as an encoding of that which is unusual or informative, and this is reflected in formal probabilistic definitions of Markedness and Informedness as chance-correct unidirectional components of the Matthews Correlation Coefficient corresponding to Δp and Δp'. Conceptual familiarity with cultural norms provided by familiar categories creates a ground against which marked categories provide a figure, opening the way for markedness to be applied to cultural and social categorization. As early as the 1930s Jakobson had already suggested applying markedness to all oppositions, explicitly mentioning such pairs as life/death, liberty/bondage, sin/virtue, and holiday/working day. Linda Waugh extended this to oppositions like male/female, white/black, sighted/blind, hearing/deaf, heterosexual/homosexual, right/left, fertility/barrenness, clothed/nude, and spoken language/written language.Waugh, Linda \\"Marked and Unmarked: A Choice Between Unequals in Semiotic Structure\\". Semiotica; 38: 299–318, 1982 Battistella expanded this with the demonstration of how cultures align markedness values to create cohesive symbol systems, illustrating with examples based on Rodney Needham's work.Battistella, Edwin Markedness, 1990, pp. 188–189. Other work has applied markedness to stylistics, music, and myth.Myers-Scotton, Carol (ed.) Codes and Consequences: Choosing Linguistic Varieties. Oxford, 1998Hatten, Robert Musical Meaning in Beethoven: Markedness, Correlation, and Interpretation. Indiana University Press, 1994Liszka, James J. The Semiotic of Myth. Indiana University Press, 1989  Local markedness and markedness reversals  Markedness depends on context. What is more marked in some general contexts may be less marked in other local contexts. Thus, \\"ant\\" is less marked than \\"ants\\" on the morphological level, but on the semantic (and frequency) levels it may be more marked since ants are more often encountered many at once than one at a time. Often a more general markedness relation may be reversed in a particular context. Thus, voicelessness of consonants is typically unmarked. But between vowels or in the neighborhood of voiced consonants, voicing may be the expected or unmarked value. Reversal is reflected in certain West Frisian words' plural and singular forms:Tiersma, Peter. \\"Local and General Markedness\\", Language, 1982. In West Frisian, nouns with irregular singular-plural stem variations are undergoing regularization. Usually this means that the plural is reformed to be a regular form of the singular: * Old paradigm: \\"koal\\" (coal), \\"kwallen\\" (coals) → regularized forms: \\"Koal\\" (coal), \\"Koalen\\" (coals). However, a number of words instead reform the singular by extending the form of the plural: * Old paradigm: \\"earm\\" (arm), \\"jermen\\" (arms) → regularized forms: \\"jerm\\" (arm), \\"jermen\\" (arms) The common feature of the nouns that regularize the singular to match the plural is that they occur more often in pairs or groups than singly; they are said to be semantically (but not morphologically) locally unmarked in the plural.  Universals and frequency  Joseph Greenberg's 1966 book Language Universals was an influential application of markedness to typological linguistics and a break from the tradition of Jakobson and Trubetzkoy. Greenberg took frequency to be the primary determining factor of markedness in grammar and suggested that unmarked categories could be determined by \\"the frequency of association of things in the real world\\". Greenberg also applied frequency cross-linguistically, suggesting that unmarked categories would be those that are unmarked in a wide number of languages. However, critics have argued that frequency is problematic because categories that are cross-linguistically infrequent may have a high distribution in a particular language.Battistella, Edwin The Logic of Markedness, 1996, p. 51. More recently the insights related to frequency have been formalized as chance-corrected conditional probabilities, with Informedness (Δp') and Markedness (Δp) corresponding to the different directions of prediction in human association research (binary associations or distinctions) and more generally (including features with more than two distinctions). Universals have also been connected to implicational laws. This entails that a category is taken as marked if every language that has the marked category also has the unmarked one but not vice versa.  Diagnostics  Markedness has been extended and reshaped over the past century and reflects a range of loosely connected theoretical approaches. From emerging in the analysis of binary oppositions, it has become a global semiotic principle, a means of encoding naturalness and language universals, and a terminology for studying defaults and preferences in language acquisition. What connects various approaches is a concern for the evaluation of linguistic structure, though the details of how markedness is determined and what its implications and diagnostics are varies widely. Other approaches to universal markedness relations focus on functional economic and iconic motivations, tying recurring symmetries to properties of communication channels and communication events. Croft (1990), for example, notes that asymmetries among linguistic elements may be explainable in terms economy of form, in terms of iconism between the structure of language and conceptualization of the world.  In generative grammar  Markedness entered generative linguistic theory through Noam Chomsky and Morris Halle's The Sound Pattern of English. For Chomsky and Halle, phonological features went beyond a universal phonetic vocabulary to encompass an 'evaluation metric', a means of selecting the most highly valued adequate grammar. In The Sound Pattern of English, the value of a grammar was the inverse of the number of features required in that grammar. However, Chomsky and Halle realized that their initial approach to phonological features made implausible rules and segment inventories as highly valued as natural ones. The unmarked value of a feature was cost-free with respect to the evaluation metric, while the marked feature values were counted by the metric. Segment inventories could also be evaluated according to the number of marked features. However, the use of phonological markedness as part of the evaluation metric was never able to fully account for the fact that some features are more likely than others or for the fact that phonological systems must have a certain minimal complexity and symmetry.Kean, Mary-Louise (1980). The Theory of Markedness in Generative Grammar. Bloomington: Indiana University Linguistics Club. In generative syntax, markedness as feature- evaluation did not receive the same attention that it did in phonology. Chomsky came to view unmarked properties as an innate preference structure based first in constraints and later in parameters of universal grammar. In their 1977 article \\"Filters and Control\\", Chomsky and Howard Lasnik extended this to view markedness as part of a theory of 'core grammar': A few years later, Chomsky describes it thus: Some generative researchers have applied markedness to second-language acquisition theory, treating it as an inherent learning hierarchy which reflects the sequence in which constructions are acquired, the difficulty of acquiring certain constructions, and the transferability of rules across languages.Eckman, F. R. (1991). \\"The Structural Conformity Hypothesis and the Acquisition of Consonantal Clusters in the Interlanguage of Learners\\". Studies in Second Language Acquisition 13(1), 23–41. More recently, optimality theory approaches emerging in the 1990s have incorporated markedness in the ranking of constraints.Archangeli 1997.

Early life and law career  He was born in High Bluff, Manitoba, the son of Henry Wilton and Jean Barron, and was educated in Morden and at Manitoba University. Wilton taught school for five years before coming to Winnipeg in 1901. He studied law, was called to the Manitoba bar in 1906 and practised law in Winnipeg. In 1905, Wilton married Lily L. Hobkirk. He was also president of the National Loan & Investment Corporation and vice-president of the Central Canada Investment Corporation. His sister Winifred Wilton Wilson was the first woman called to the Manitoba bar and one of the first two women to practice law in the province. Political career Wilton served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1915 to 1920, as a member of the Liberal Party. He first ran for the Manitoba legislature in the 1914 provincial election, and finished second against Conservative John Thomas Haig in the Winnipeg-area constituency of Assiniboia. He ran again in the 1915 campaign, and defeated Labour candidate William Bayley by fifty-five votes (Haig finished third). The Liberals won a landslide victory in this election, and Wilton served as a backbench supporter of Tobias Norris's government for the next five years. Wilton introduced the Workers Compensation Act and the Soldiers' Taxation Relief Act into the legislature. He appears to have left the Liberal Party just before the 1920 provincial election: campaigning for re-election as an independent, he lost to William Bayley by 103 seats. Military career In 1916, Wilton joined the Canadian forces as a private. He served overseas and later reached the rank of captain.  Later life  Wilton died in Winnipeg at the age of 63 after suffering a heart attack.  References  Category:1879 births Category:Manitoba Liberal Party MLAs Category:1942 deaths ","title":"John W.

The screenplay was written by Jackson and Randall Frakes. The film was directed by Jackson and R. J. Kizer, and stars professional wrestler Roddy Piper as well as Sandahl Bergman, Cec Verrell, William Smith and Rory Calhoun. Plot This film is set in a post- apocalyptic wasteland where few fertile men and women exist due to atomic fallout. As a result, the government places a high priority on those that can still breed. Shortly before the movie opens, a group of mutant amphibians (who have been exiled to the desert by humans) capture a group of fertile women and are using them as sex slaves. Sam Hell (Piper) is a nomadic traveler who wanders the countryside. He is eventually captured by an organization of warrior-nurses, the closest thing to a government in his region of the world, who reveal that they located him by tracking the trail of pregnant women left in his wake. Their original plan was to use him as breeding stock with their collection of fertile women, but this was the group captured by the mutants. With their own attempts to capture the women failing, the group presses Hell into service as a mercenary; he is to infiltrate the mutant city (derogatorily referred to as \\"Frogtown\\") and rescue the women. To make sure that the rebellious Hell follows his orders, he is forced to wear an electronic protective codpiece that will explode if he disobeys or tries to abort his mission. Having already taken numerous samples of reproductive material from him, he is now deemed far more expendable than the women themselves. To aid him in his mission (and make sure he follows the plan), he is paired with one of the nurses, Spangle (Bergman), and an aggressive guard named Centinella (Verrell). During their journey to Frogtown, Hell tries numerous times to escape but quickly learns that a device Spangle carries will shock his genitals if used or if he gets too far away from it. Despite their rocky start and Spangle's initial cold demeanor, the pair grow closer during the journey and eventually fall in love. When they reach Frogtown, everyone involved is captured. The frogs' second-in-command, Bull (Nicholas Worth), tortures Hell and attempts to remove the codpiece for its technology. Meanwhile, a slightly drugged Spangle is forced to work as a slave and dance for the frogs' Commander Toty (Brian Frank) in the notable \\"Dance of the Three Snakes\\" sequence. Proving more successful than she had wished, the nurse soon finds herself at the mercy of the aroused commander. However, with the codpiece now removed (Bull finally removed it with a chainsaw, but it blew up and killed him), the escaped Hell rescues her along with the group of fertile women (Ellen Crocker, Kim Hewson, Ilana Ishaki, Annie McKinon and Janie Thorson) held captive.  Cast  Roddy Piper portrayed Sam Hell in the film. Sandahl Bergman on Count Gore De Vol *Roddy Piper, as Sam Hell, a man who lost his daughter in the nuclear war that precedes this movie and hooks up with woman very frequently after the disaster.https://prowrestlingstories.com/pro- wrestling-stories/roddy-piper-acting-career/ He is the main protagonist in this film and is tasked with saving a group of girls from the frog leader Toty (Brian Franks). He changes a lot throughout the film, starting off as an immature man who wants to just keep hooking up with women, to finally a man who finds a true love who will have to be okay with him impregnating several other girls for the good of the world. *Sandahl Bergman as Spangle, a government scientist that is tasked with taking care of and making sure that Sam successfully rescues the girls and does his job of impregnating them to repopulate the world.https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/15/movies/fighting- fantasy-in-conan-the-barbarian.html To do this she has the controls to a device on Sam's groin area that lets her inflict pain in that area whenever she chooses with her earrings. *Cec Verrell as Centinella, a quiet but fierce military guard escort to Spangle (Sandahl Bergman) and Sam (Roddy Piper). She mainly wields a light machine gun from the top of the car they are traveling in, however, she proves to be versatile in her arms when she uses other weapons. Centinella is one of the first women we see attempting to seduce Sam, finding out if the \\"rumors\\" are true however is cut short by Spangle exiting the tent and getting angry at them. *William Smith as Captain Devlin/Count Sodom is also a military personnel, he first runs into Sam when they capture him and we see Devlin interrogating him about sleeping with his daughter to which he hears from another lady she became pregnant from Sam. He plays a big role in the beginning and end of the movie when we learn that he is dealing arms to the frog people under the disguise as Count Sodom. His plan is to use all the nuclear energy to help in his master plan of ridding all the female leaders/power which he believes is becoming a problem in the world. *Rory Calhoun as Looney Tunes, a crazy old miner whom Sam knew had known before. Looney first makes his appearance in a bar in Frogtown where he tells Sam his reason for being there which is to mine uranium to eventually sell to the frog people. He helps play a part in saving Sam from the frog people by distracting them with flares however, we don't ever see what happens to him once Sam's group leaves and we are left to assume he either lives or dies. *Nicholas Worth as Bull, is a frogtown chief. He is power hungry and inflicts whatever pain he wants on people. Bull shows that side of himself well when he begins his plot to torture Sam. This is cut short when he decides to cut into the government device around Sam's groin and bull is then blown up. *Kristi Somers as Arabella, a female frog mutant and ally of Sam. *Brian Frank as Commander Toty, the Frogtown chief. His goal in the movie is to have a group of girls that can make his \\"three snakes\\" rise. *Julius LeFlore as Squidlips, is a character seen at the very beginning of the movie shooting a man as they rummage for valuables. *Eyde Byrde plays Patton, a woman that works in the hospital that treats Sam and puts on the government device. Patton ultimately messes over Sam by having him sign away his rights. *Lee Garlington as Briefing Officer, is the one tasked with briefing Sam on what he is now to deal with throughout the rest of the movie. Reception Critical reception for Hell Comes to Frogtown has been mixed to positive. TV Guide awarded the film two out of five stars, calling it \\"Another of those futuristic, postapocalyptic science fiction dramas\\". DVD Talk gave the film three out of five stars, writing, \\"Rowdy Roddy Piper has to save the world by diddling beautiful babes and squashing six-foot mutant toads with crummy attitudes. What's not to like?\\" Jason Cook from The Spinning Image rated the film a score of six out of ten stars, writing, \\"Cheap and cheerful its narrative lulls and directorial shortcomings are glossed over by a winning central performance and a smattering of witty dialogue. Its no cinematic masterpiece, but were there any talking mutant frogs in Citizen Kane?\\" Though not received well by critics, producer Randall Frakes says he was glad the fans seemed to like it and \\"...Get all the jokes as intended.\\"https://www.slashfilm.com/hell-comes- to-frogtown/3/ Legacy Hell Comes to Frogtown inspired the title of the \\"Hell Comes to Quahog\\" (2006) episode of animated television series Family Guy.

March 10, 933Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 278.Academia Sinica Chinese-Western Calendar Converter.), possibly né Tuoba Renfu (拓拔仁福), formally the Prince of Guo (虢王), was an ethnic Dangxiang (Tangut) warlord during the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms Period, ruling Dingnan Circuit (定難, headquartered in modern Yulin, Shaanxi) from 909 or 910 to his death in 933, as its military governor (Jiedushi) in de facto independence.  Background  Li Renfu was said to be from the same Tuoba clan as the late-Tang Dynasty warlord Li Sigong (né Tuoba Sigong), the first Dangxiang military governor of Dingnan,Old History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 132. and therefore was ethnically Dangxiang.See New Book of Tang, vol. 221, part 1. His relationship to Li Sigong was not clear from the traditional Chinese sources—the Old History of the Five Dynasties indicated that he also took the Tang Dynasty imperial clan surname of Li when Li Sigong was granted that surname for his contribution in Tang's defeat of the major agrarian rebel Huang Chao, but did not otherwise specify their relationship; the New History of the Five Dynasties indicated a lack of knowledge, on the part of its editors, as to their relationship;New History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 40. while the Zizhi Tongjian indicated that he was a cousin of Li Yichang,Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 267. who succeeded Li Sigong's younger brother and successor Li Sijian, but whose relationship to Li Sigong was somewhat uncertain as well as different sources differed as to their relationship.History of Song, vol. 485. (The description in the History of Song of Li Renfu as being one generation below Li Yichang appeared to be clearly erroneous given that Li Renfu's sons also used the generational character of \\"Yi\\" in their names.) In any case, Li Renfu served as an officer at Dingnan, and as of the time of Li Yichang's rule of the circuit was serving as the commander of both the Han and non-Han soldiers at the circuit. In 910 (according to the Zizhi Tongjian) or 909 (according to the Old History of the Five Dynasties and the New History of the Five Dynasties) Li Yichang was assassinated by his officer Gao Zongyi (). The Dingnan officers killed Gao and supported Li Renfu to succeed Li Yichang. When Li Renfu reported this to Zhu Quanzhong, the emperor of Tang's successor state Later Liang, Zhu gave Li Renfu the title of military governor of Dingnan.  Rule as military governor  During Later Liang = Later in 910, Li Maozhen the Prince of Qi—one of the rival states to Later Liang—as well as two military governors under him, Li Jihui the military governor of Jingnan Circuit (靜難, headquartered in modern Xianyang, Shaanxi) and Liu Zhijun the military governor of Zhangyi Circuit (彰義, headquartered in modern Pingliang, Gansu)—sent emissaries to Li Cunxu, the Prince of Jin (another rival state to Later Liang), suggesting that they attack Dingnan together. Li Cunxu sent his general Zhou Dewei to join the Qi forces. The two armies put Dingnan's capital Xia Prefecture (夏州, in modern Yulin, Shaanxi) under siege. Li Renfu sought aid from the Later Liang imperial government, and Zhu Quanzhong sent the generals Li Yu () and Liu Wan () to aid Li Renfu. When Li and Liu reached Xia, the Qi and Jin forces lifted their siege and withdrew. For his holding out against Qi and Jin, Zhu bestowed on Li Renfu the titles of acting Taibao () and honorary chancellor (同中書門下平章事, Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi). = During Later Tang = Eventually, Later Liang was destroyed by Li Cunxu, who claimed imperial title as emperor of a new Later Tang. It was said that by the time of Li Cunxu's reign as emperor, Li Renfu had received, accumulatively, from Zhu Quanzhong's son and successor Zhu Zhen and Li Cunxu, the titles of acting Taishi (), the greater honorary chancellor title Zhongshu Ling (), and Prince of Shuofang. It was said that throughout the years, it became perceived at the Later Tang court that Li Renfu was in secret communications with Later Tang's northern rival Khitan Empire. (However, after Li Renfu's death, it was reported by some persons who claimed to know Li Renfu's thinking process that Li Renfu was merely creating such rumors to discourage the Later Tang court from considering moving him to another circuit.) Li Renfu died in 933, and was posthumously created the Prince of Guo by Li Cunxu's adoptive brother and successor Li Siyuan. Li Siyuan subsequently, believing the rumors of Li Renfu's secret communications with Khitan Empire, tried to move Li Renfu's son and successor Li Yichao to nearby Zhangwu Circuit (彰武, headquartered in modern Yan'an, Shaanxi) while moving Zhangwu's military governor An Congjin to Dingnan. The attempt failed, and Li Renfu's family would become entrenched at Dingnan for the rest of the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms Period.

During the Weichselian glaciation, almost all of Scandinavia was buried beneath a thick permanent ice cover and the Stone Age came rather late to this region. As the climate slowly warmed up at the end of the ice age, nomadic hunters from central Europe sporadically visited the region, but it was not until around 12,000 BCE before permanent, but nomadic, habitation took root. Late Upper Paleolithic Reindeer in tundra landscape As the ice receded, reindeer grazed the emerging tundra plains of Denmark and southernmost Sweden. This was the era of the Hamburg culture, tribes who hunted over territories 100,000 km² vast and lived as nomads in teepees, following the reindeer seasonal migrations across the barren tundra. On this land there was little plant cover, except for occasional arctic white birch and rowan. Slowly a taiga forest appeared. Around 11,400 BCE, the Bromme culture emerged in Southern Scandinavia. This was a more rapidly warming era providing opportunity for other substantial hunting game animals than the ubiquitous reindeer. As former hunter-gather cultures, the Bromme culture was still largely dependent on reindeer and lived a nomadic life, but their camps diversified significantly and they were the first people to settle Southern Scandinavia (and the Southern Baltic area) on a permanent, yet still nomadic, basis. Local climate changes around 10,500 BCE, initiated both cultural changes and the first settling of the northern parts of Scandinavia. Initially, a thousand year long climate cooldown replaced the taiga with the former tundra and the local culture reverted to former times focus on the reindeer hunt. This culture is now referred to as the Ahrensburg culture. Around 9,500 BCE, the local climate warmed yet again, as the pre-Boreal era emerged, and this triggered the Ahrensburg to settle the emerging tundra of northern Scandinavia. For the next two thousand years, the climatic phase known as the Boreal reigned in the Scandinavian region. Mesolithic In the 7th millennium BCE, the climate in Scandinavia was warming as it transitioned from the former Boreal age to the Atlantic period. Reindeer and their hunters had already migrated and inhabited the lands of northern Scandinavia, and forests had established. A culture called the Maglemosian culture lived in the areas of Denmark and southern Sweden. To the north, in Norway and along the coast of western Sweden, the Fosna-Hensbacka culture was living mostly in changing seasonal camps along the shores and close to the now thriving forests. Utilizing fire, boats and stone tools, these Stone Age tribal cultures managed to survive in northern Europe. The northern hunter-gatherers followed the herds and the salmon runs, moving south during the winters, moving north again during the summers. These early peoples followed cultural traditions similar to those practiced throughout other regions in the far north - areas including modern Finland, Russia, and across the Bering Strait into the northernmost strip of North America (comprising portions of today's Alaska and Canada). During the 6th millennium BCE, the climate of Scandinavia was generally warmer and more humid than today and the southern regions were clad in lush temperate broadleaf and mixed forests. Large animals like aurochs, wisent, moose and red deer roamed freely in the forests and were game for tribes of what we now call the Kongemose culture. Like their predecessors, the Kongemose tribes also hunted marine animals such as seals and fished in the rich shallow waters. North of the Kongemose people, lived other hunter-gatherers in most of southern Norway and Sweden, now dubbed the Nøstvet and Lihult cultures, descendants of the Fosna and Hensbacka cultures. By the end of the 6th millennium BCE, as the sea levels rose gradually, these northerly tribal cultures continued their way of life, while the Kongemose culture was replaced by the Ertebølle culture, adapting to the climatic changes affecting their low lying southern regions more severely.See Doggerland as an extreme example of the consequence of the rising sea levels.

Soon, they too started to cultivate the land and, ca 4000 BCE, they became part of the megalithic Funnelbeaker culture. During the 4th millennium BCE, these Funnelbeaker tribes expanded into Sweden up to Uppland. The Nøstvet and Lihult tribes learned new technology from the advancing farmers, but not agriculture, and became the Pitted Ware cultures, towards the end of the 4th millennium BCE. These Pitted Ware tribes halted the advance of the farmers and pushed them south into south-western Sweden, but some say that the farmers were not killed or chased away, but that they voluntarily joined the Pitted Ware culture and became part of them. At least one settlement appears to be mixed, the Alvastra pile- dwelling. It is not known what language these early Scandinavians spoke, but towards the end of the 3rd millennium BCE, they were overrun by new tribes who many scholars think spoke Proto-Indo-European (or more exactly, the \\"Pre- Germanic Indo-European\\" dialect), the Corded Ware culture (earlier known as the Battle-Axe culture). The genetic history of Europe connects the people carrying the language with the Yamnaya culture emanating from present day Ukraine, using Haplogroup R1a as an important genetic marker.https://www.svt.se/nyheter/vetenskap/ny-dna-forskning-visar-att- svenskar-framforallt-harstammar-fran-ukraina This new people advanced up to Uppland and the Oslofjord, and they probably provided the language that was the ancestor of the modern Scandinavian languages. These new tribes had the battle axe as a status symbol and were cattle herders and with them most of southern Scandinavia entered the Neolithic. Ultimately, the Bronze Age would usher in a time of cultural advance in Scandinavia.

His role as the press liaison between the Vatican and the world press corps gave him perhaps the highest visibility of any one person in the Vatican during the long reign of Pope John Paul II, with the exception of the Pope himself. He resigned his post July 11, 2006 and was replaced by Father Federico Lombardi. On January 20, 2007, he was named president of the board of advisers of the Biomedical University of Rome, an office he occupied until his death. Background and education Navarro-Valls studied at the Deutsche Schule in Cartagena, and then studied medicine at the Universities of Granada and Barcelona, as well as journalism at the Faculty of Sciences of Communication at the University of Navarra in Pamplona, Spain. He also took post-graduate studies at Harvard University in the United States. He graduated summa cum laude in Medicine and Surgery in 1961 and took courses for a doctorate in Psychiatry in \\"Psychiatric disorders in cranial traumas\\" (Trastornos psiquiátricos en los traumas craneales). In addition, he taught at the Faculty of Medicine. In 1968, received a degree in journalism and in the science of communication in 1980. He was fluent in Spanish, English, French, German and Italian. Navarro-Valls died in Rome on July 5, 2017 at the age of 80. Professional career Navarro-Valls was a foreign correspondent for both Nuestro Tiempo and the Spanish daily newspaper ABC. Esteemed by his colleagues, he was elected a member of the Board of Directors (1979) and later President of the Foreign Press Association, Italy (1983 and 1984). From 1996 until 2001, he served as President of the Administration Board of the “Maruzza Lefebvre d’Ovidio” Foundation for terminally ill cancer patients. Liaison of the Vatican Navarro-Valls' work with the Holy See enabled him to be a member of the Holy See Delegation to international conferences of the United Nations in Cairo (1994), Copenhagen (1995), Beijing (1995), and Istanbul (1996). His continued work in medicine and journalism allowed him to participate in national and international conferences on psychiatry and/or communication as a guest speaker. From 1996 he was a visiting professor at the Faculty of Institutional Social Communications of the Pontifical University of the Holy Cross in Rome.Dr. Joaquín Navarro-Valls - Official Web Site Navarro-Valls was particularly important as a press liaison during the last few years of the reign of Pope John Paul II (reigned 1978–2005). This was especially true during the final six months of Pope John Paul's reign, during which time Navarro-Valls' expertise as a physician was important in communicating the pope's health to the press. He was apparently instrumental in bringing a high level of candor to the bulletins which daily informed the world concerning the aged pope's declining health. His own emotional closeness to the pope was apparent as the end drew near. With the election of Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger as Pope Benedict XVI -- and with the new pope's approval -- Navarro-Valls continued in his post for almost two years. Navarro-Valls was a member of the Catholic prelature Opus Dei (The Work of God), dating back to 1970, when he lived in the central headquarters with St Josemaría Escrivá, the founder of Opus Dei. As a numerary of Opus Dei, he committed himself to celibacy, although as a lay person and not a religious this was not a formal vow. When asked about this, he told one reporter: \\"Celibacy is a vow taken by religious. In my case, instead, was the choice of a way of life and behavior. In any case...it was not difficult. Every choice in life necessarily involves leaving something else behind. Those who want to have everything end up without ever truly marrying one idea, and so do not generate children, in the analogical sense; that is, to give birth to other new ideas.\\"\\"The Holy See to the Rhythm of the Tango: The Pope's Spokesman in His Own Words\\" -- interview with Joaquín Navarro-Valls by Stefania Rossini (from L'Espresso no. 27, July 8–14, 2005) In 1988, he received the Ischia International Journalism Award.

It tells the story of the famous hetaera Thaïs, who was one of Alexander the Great's contemporaries and companions on his conquest of the oikoumene or the known world. The book combines the life of the historical and a fictional Tais. It follows such actual events as the burning of Persepolis by Tais and her becoming Ptolemy's Egyptian queen, but also speculates on a love affair with Alexander and Tais's initiation in some of the obscure religions of the ancient world. In the novel, the very young (only 17 years old) and already famous Athenian hetaera Tais meets the exiled heir to the Macedonian throne and his childhood friends Hephaestion, Nearchus and Ptolemy. She then travels to Sparta and Crete with the Macedonians, visits Egypt and Mesopotamia, where she becomes an initiate in the temple of Ashtoreth (Astarte) and eventually follows Alexander to Persepolis, which she requests be set on fire. After Alexander's death, Tais marries Ptolemy and becomes the queen of Memphis. Her travels are an interesting and entertaining look into the lives and customs of people in Hellenistic times, as well as an excellent source of basic information on the geography and history of the age and Alexander the Great.

It was perhaps the first major political blog, started in 1998. The style is by turns earnest and sarcastic. Somerby criticizes what he considers the media's frequently biased or lazy coverage. In his view, the media frequently latch on to a generally agreed \\"script\\" with little regard for facts that contradict the script. For instance, in the runup to the U.S. 2000 election it was frequently said or assumed that Al Gore was untruthful, but Somerby shows that much of what supposedly underlay that script was in fact untrue, misrepresented or greatly exaggerated. He also argues that the media frequently ignore substantive issues and concentrate on trivial ones instead (in the 2000 presidential election, for example, professing bewilderment in response to the candidates' budget proposals while writing repeatedly and at length about irrelevant issues such as Gore's choice of clothes, or in 2006 writing articles about Barack Obama's middle name.) Despite professing to be left of center in his politics, Somerby also critiques liberals in the U.S. mainstream media who he feels do poor journalism, such as Rachel Maddow and Keith Olbermann, both of MSNBC. The Daily Howler critiques education writing, often by analyzing badly reported data on scholastic achievement in low income or minority populations. For example, Somerby dissected a 2005 PBS \\"feel good\\" documentary Making Schools Work that touted the achievements in a low-income school district. Somerby showed that the showcased test score gains were neither remarkable (they were similar to average statewide score increases) nor indicative of large achievement (as evidenced by NAEP national tests). and (scroll down to the Special Reports). On the other hand, journalist Robert Samuelson supported a claim that public schools have made minimal progress since 1970 by using aggregated and cherry-picked NAEP statistics. Somerby showed that Samuelson had hid the spectacular multiple grade-level increases in the achievement levels of African American students. Similarly, a Washington Post article turned Maryland's twelfth-in-the-nation average eighth-grade math score into \\"last among the 50 states\\" by looking at differences rather than absolute numbers. Among other frequent education themes, Somerby criticizes reporting on Teach For America (scroll down to the Special Report). and what he calls \\"high-minded\\" punditry.. In January 2010, Somerby started a companion blog How He Got There where he is posting a book on the 2000 U.S. presidential election piece-by-piece as he writes it. Bob Somerby is also a professional stand up comic. He has appeared on Larry King Live, with Bill Maher, Bill O'Reilly and with Brian Lamb on C-SPAN. In college at Harvard, he was roommates with the actor Tommy Lee Jones and former Vice President Al Gore. After college he taught for twelve years in Baltimore public elementary schools.

A is a term used for any one of several traditional Japanese hats.Kasa hat Retrieved 03-19-2016 These include amigasa and jingasa.  Grammar  Kasa is the correct way to pronounce the word when it stands alone. Note that rendaku causes kasa to change to gasa when it is preceded by another word specifying the type of hat: thus, jingasa. Kasa shares its etymology with the Japanese word for \\"umbrella\\" (which is also pronounced \\"kasa\\", but written ).  Styles  There are several different styles of kasa. Almost all hats were painted. Mostly, this color was black. It was used for low ranking samurai. Jingasa almost always had mon marks on them. An amigasa is a straw hat of the type traditionally worn in some Japanese folk dances. Another kind of kasa, the woven rice-straw takuhatsugasa worn by mendicant Buddhist monks, is made overlarge and in a bowl or mushroom shape. Unlike an Asian conical hat, it does not come to a point, nor does it ride high on the head like a samurai's traveling hat. It is simply a big hat that covers the upper half to two thirds of the face, thereby helping to mask the identity of the monk and allowing him to travel undistracted by sights around him on his journey. The samurai class in feudal Japan, as well as their retainers and ashigaru \\"footsoldiers\\", used several types of jingasa made from iron, copper, wood, paper, bamboo, or leather. Types Antique Japanese samurai leather jingasa (war hat) in the nirayama style.Some types of kasa include: * Ajirogasa (a wickerwork kasa made of shaven bamboo or wood) * Amigasa (a wickerwork kasa) * Fukaamigasa (a deep wickerwork kasa) * Jingasa (\\"war hat\\", a type of kasa commonly worn by samurai and ashigaru) * Roningasa (typically a conical amigasa with a flat top, often worn by ronin) * Sandogasa (a kasa for traveling) * Sugegasa (see Asian conical hat) * Takuhatsugasa (a Buddhist mendicant kasa) * Tengai (see Komusō Monk) * Torioigasa (a folded kasa, famous for Awa Dance Festival) * Yagyūgasa (the family crest of Yagyū clan, not a kind of actual kasa) Gallery Image:Japanese buddhist monk hat by Arashiyama cut.jpgA Buddhist monk wearing a takuhatsugasa (also an ajirogasa).

They are characterized by interruption of the blood supply of a bone, in particular to the epiphysis, followed by localized bony necrosis, and later, regrowth of the bone. This disorder is defined as a focal disturbance of endochondral ossification and is regarded as having a multifactorial cause, so no one thing accounts for all aspects of this disease. Signs and symptoms These conditions nearly all present with an insidious onset of pain referred to the location of the bony damage. Some, notably Kienbock's disease of the wrist, may involve considerable swelling, and Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease of the hip causes the victim to limp. The spinal form, Scheuermann's disease, may cause bending, or kyphosis of the upper spine, giving a \\"hunch-back\\" appearance. Cause The ultimate cause for these conditions is unknown, but the most commonly cited cause factors are rapid growth, heredity, trauma (or overuse), anatomic conformation, and dietary imbalances; however, only anatomic conformation and heredity are well supported by scientific literature. The way that the disease is initiated has been debated. Although failure of chondrocyte differentiation, formation of a fragile cartilage, failure of blood supply to the growth cartilage, and subchondral bone necrosis all have been proposed as the starting point in the pathogenesis, recent literature strongly supports failure of blood supply to growth cartilage as most likely. DiagnosisClassification= In humans, these conditions may be classified into three groups: # Spinal: Scheuermann's disease (of the interspinal joints) which is a curve in the thoracic spine. # Articular: Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease (or, avascular necrosis of the femoral head in the hip), Köhler's disease (of the tarsal navicular bone of the foot), Panner's disease (of the capitulum of the elbow), and Freiberg's infraction (of the second or third metatarsal of the foot and less frequently the first or fourth; sometimes called Freiberg's Infraction or Freiberg's disease) # Non-articular: This group includes Sever's disease (of the calcaneus, or heel), and Kienbock's disease of the hand, and other conditions not completely characteristic of the osteochondrosis, such as Osgood-Schlatter's disease (of the tibial tubercle) and Osteochondritis dissecans. Prognosis The term osteochondrosis has been used to describe a wide range of lesions among different species. There are different types of the prognosis: latens, which is a lesion restricted to epiphyseal cartilage, manifesta, a lesion paired with a delay in endochondral ossification, and dissecans which is a cleft formation in the articular cartilage. The prognosis for these conditions is very variable, and depends both on the anatomic site and on the time at which it is detected. In some cases of osteochondrosis, such as Sever's disease and Freiberg's infraction, the involved bone may heal in a relatively normal shape and leave the patient asymptomatic. On the contrary, Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease frequently results in a deformed femoral head that leads to arthritis and the need for joint replacement.

In this episode, Angel calls on the Watchers' Council for help in tracking down a psychotic vampire slayer named Dana, who was tortured by a serial killer as a child. Plot At Wolfram & Hart, Harmony tells Angel that there was a mix-up with a girl named Dana's medication at a psychiatric hospital, and no longer sedated, she broke down her door, killed several people, and escaped. At the hospital, Dr. Rabinaw tells Angel and Spike that Dana had been kidnapped and tortured for months when she was 10, by the man who killed her family. Recently, she gained incredible strength. Angel realizes Dana — like Buffy — is a vampire slayer, activated by the events in the Buffy series finale. Wesley asks Giles to send “his top guy” to take care of Dana, who turns out to be Andrew Wells. He updates the group on how Willow activated every potential \\"Slayer of the Vampyrs\\"; when Wesley wonders how the Slayers will be trained now that the Watcher’s Council is gone, Andrew explains that Giles and some “Sunnydale alum” have been taking care of it. As Spike heads off to look for Dana, Angel follows Lorne's suggestion to visit Dana's childhood home with a psychic. The psychic flashes back to Dana’s abduction and her family’s murder; the smell of molasses and a basement is “where her pain lives,” he says. Meanwhile, Dana goes to the basement of the building where she was held captive, flashing back to her torturer injecting her with various drugs. When she looks up at his face, he is Spike. Andrew catches up with Spike, and updates him on the Scoobies’ activities - Xander is in Africa, Willow and Kennedy are in Brazil, Buffy and Dawn are in Rome, and everyone else is in England. Andrew guesses that Buffy does not know Spike is alive and wonders why he did not tell her. When Spike follows the scent of blood into Dana's trap, Andrew tries unsuccessfully to shoot Dana with a tranquilizer gun. Spike chases Dana to the basement, where she starts repeating what her torturer once said to her. Dana, channeling Nikki, recognizes Spike as William the Bloody. Before he can explain that she is dreaming of other slayers, she injects him with a sedative. At Wolfram and Hart, Fred and the team realize the smell of molasses indicates Dana was held in a distillery, and they send a tactical team to search abandoned distilleries. Back in the basement, Spike awakens to discover that Dana has cut off his hands. She tells Spike he cannot hurt her anymore, but when he insists she is thinking of someone else, she finally remembers who her torturer really was. Angel arrives, tells Dana her real torturer is dead, and knocks her out with a tranquilizer dart. Spike is taken to the hospital to have his hands reattached. Later, Andrew tells Angel because Dana is a slayer, she belongs in the care of the new council. This goes against Angel's intentions to have her treated in his own W&H; facilities. Andrew says none of the Scoobies—implicitly emphasizing Buffy, whom he points out, gives him his orders—trust Angel now that he works at Wolfram and Hart. “Don’t fool yourself… we’re not on the same side.” When Angel presses the issue, a group of slayers comes out of hiding and Andrew makes it clear that they will take Dana by force, if necessary. In the end, Dana is taken away with Andrew. Angel visits Spike at the hospital, where Spike admits he has never thought much about what being evil means, he only ever killed for the rush and enjoyment of the act, and he then states that he never once looked his victims in the eye. At this, Angel replies that Angelus could never stop staring into his victims; for him, it was always about the evil of the act. Spike says Dana is like them; someone turned her into a monster. Angel says Dana was an innocent victim and Spike notes that they were innocent victims once, too.

Synopsis In this adventure, based on a famous Korean folk tale, a daughter sacrifices herself to restore her blind father's eyesight. Production As a personal project, Shin spent eight years getting the project off the ground, including three and a half years of pre-production. The film was co-produced in North Korea by the Chosun April 26th Children Film Studio (also known as SEK), and the score was also recorded in the North by the Pyongyang Film and Broadcasting Orchestra. In a move unusual for the Korean film industry, the character voices were recorded in both the South and the North due to differences in dialect.

He was previously a Liberal member of the Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick for Fredericton-Fort Nashwaak, and Minister of Social Development in the New Brunswick cabinet before opening Lamrock's Law in Fredericton. Before politics Kelly Lamrock was born in Saskatchewan on February 5, 1970. He moved with his family to British Columbia and lived there until his family relocated permanently to Fredericton, New Brunswick when he was eight years old. As a child Lamrock attended Garden Creek Elementary School and Albert Street Middle School. As a teenager he attended Fredericton High School. While there he competed in the World High School Public Speaking Championship, where he placed second, and was the winner of several national debating competitions. He attended St. Thomas University, where he earned a Bachelor of Arts, and the University of New Brunswick, where he earned a Bachelor of Laws. He was president of the student unions at both institutions, the first and so far the only student to have occupied both posts. He was also involved in national student politics; he served as president of the Canadian Federation of Students and then was a leader in the split within that organization that led to the creation of the Canadian Alliance of Student Associations (CASA). He was the founding president of the New Brunswick Student Alliance, a provincial wing of CASA, during which time he authored \\"Open Doors, Open Minds\\" and \\"No More Smoke and Mirrors\\", two reports which led to his appearing before committees of the House of Commons of Canada and Senate of Canada, and led to a tuition freeze in New Brunswick. Following graduation from university, Lamrock briefly ran his own law practice before becoming the Director of Policy and Communications for the New Brunswick Healthcare Association in 1998. In 1998 Kelly married Karen Lee, whom he met in university. The two were married at the Wilmot United Church in downtown Fredericton. In 2001, he became Director of Student Affairs at St. Thomas University. Political career Though he had often been associated with the New Brunswick New Democratic Party and helped write that party's platform for the 1999 provincial election, he soon became active in the New Brunswick Liberal Party. Lamrock chaired the party's policy renewal process in 2001 and was nominated as candidate for Fredericton-Fort Nashwaak under the Liberal banner in 2002. He was elected to the Legislature in the 2003 election and joined the shadow cabinet as co-critic for Education and critic for Post-Secondary Education. In November, following the resignation of veteran Liberal legislator Bernard Richard, Lamrock was given the high-profile role of Opposition House Leader. Throughout the remainder of the legislative session, Lamrock became one of the most high-profile members of the Liberal caucus and carried several high-profile critic portfolios in addition to his House Leader duties. In 2006, he delivered the opposition reply to the budget due to the absence of the finance critic for a family emergency. Lamrock was re-elected in a largely redistributed district, though still named Fredericton-Fort Nashwaak, in the 2006 election. Following the election he was named to the cabinet as Minister of Education and was also given responsibilities for the Advisory Council on Youth and the Provincial Capital Commission. In June 2009, Premier Graham shuffled his cabinet, moving Lamrock to the Social Development portfolio. In January 2010, Lamrock was named Attorney General of New Brunswick. On September 27, 2010, Lamrock was defeated in the 2010 New Brunswick Provincial election, losing his seat to Progressive Conservative candidate Pam Lynch. =MLA for Fredericton-Fort Nashwaak= During the 2006 provincial election Kelly made a number of campaign promises to the constituents of Fredericton - Fort Nashwaak. Many of these promises related to issues that had been largely ignored by both Conservative and Liberal governments for years and, in some cases, decades. The Marysville Bypass The construction of a bypass system that would direct traffic around the community of Marysville had been a major issue of contention for nearly 30 years. The bypass issue first emerged decades ago as the federal government began removing railway corridors that connected Fredericton and southwestern New Brunswick with central and northern regions of the province. In the absence of rail connections, automobile traffic increased along New Brunswick Route 8; much of that increase was transport trucks. Speed limits along Route 8 decrease quickly as the highway runs through the community of Marysville, serving as its Main Street. Many motorists and truckers do not adjust their speed limits and this has led to a number of serious accidents which compromised the safety of local residents. Over the years, members of the community had organized to place pressure on the provincial government to build a bypass that would merge Route 8 with the old Trans-Canada highway alignment thereby redirecting traffic around the community and not through it. Despite community pressure on both Conservative and Liberal governments the Marysville bypass issue continued to be put on the back burner. During the 2006 election campaign, Lamrock promised his constituents that the long sought after Marysville bypass would be constructed if he were elected to a Liberal government under Shawn Graham. On July 23, 2008, the first bucketful of soil was turned by an excavator, marking the beginning of the construction project and the end of the community's long fight to have it constructed. The Marysville bypass project is funded through a federal-provincial partnership and enjoyed the support of all MLAs (Liberal and Conservative) whose ridings share Route 8 to northern New Brunswick. The entire project, which is part of a much larger infrastructure improvement project in New Brunswick, was slated to be completed by 2015. Fredericton Community College During his time in Opposition Lamrock took up the fight for the construction of a new community college in Fredericton. Once in power he continued to lobby his own government to construct a new campus to support the city's local tradespeople. Ultimately he was successful in his campaign to see the project realized, as Minister of Finance Greg Byrne announced in the 2009 budget released December 1 that construction would begin in January 2010 on a new community college campus in the city. \\"The $15-million facility, to be located on the University of New Brunswick campus, will cover 4,840 square metres (52,115 square feet) and accommodate programs in health, business administration, information technology, engineering technology and social services.\\"Work Beginning on new NBCC Fredericton campus and expansion of NBCC Saint John (10/01/18) Cliffe Street Ramp When constructed in 1981, the Westmorland Street bridge was built without a ramp on to Devonshire Drive. The \\"missing ramp\\", as it became known locally, remained a local irritant for citizens and the municipal government for years as it had been promised but continuously put off. In the 2006 campaign Lamrock campaigned on a promise to get the Cliffe Street ramp constructed. In March 2007 the Graham government announced funding for the project. The project is now completed and includes an off-ramp onto Devonshire Drive that connects to Cliffe Street and Union Street. Major upgrades were made to the intersections at Cliffe Street and Union Street as well as to the intersection at Union Street and St. Mary's Street. St. Mary's Street has been made a provincially designated truck route, in an effort to minimize truck traffic in nearby residential neighbourhoods west of St. Mary's Street and along Main Street.Road Work Will Improve Traffic Flow in North Side Neighbourhood, City of Fredericton, 2007 Investments in North Side recreation facilities In 2007 Lamrock announced funding had been approved for the construction of playgrounds in Pepper Creek and Noonan. These communities have seen significant growth, particularly among young families. These two communities had originally asked the provincial government for playgrounds in 1999, but the Bernard Lord government did not move forward on the projects. The Willie O'Ree hockey rink has been open since 2008, and the Royals Field has been refurbished as well. Princess Margaret Bridge repairs Lamrock successfully lobbied his government and Minister of Transportation Denis Landry for repairs to the Princess Margaret Bridge. The project began in 2009 after a 10 kilogram piece of concrete fell from the structure onto the roadway beneath. On January 12, 2010 the Department of Transportation announced that $30 million would be spent on upgrading and repairing the 52-year-old iconic structure in 2010-2011. =Minister of Education= Lamrock was named Minister of Education by Premier Shawn Graham in October 2006 after winning the Provincial General Election on September 27, 2006. He served as Minister of Education until Premier Graham's first major cabinet shuffle in June 2009. As Minister of Education, Lamrock instituted a number of policies aimed at re-orienting New Brunswick's educational system towards the realities of the globalized information economy. \\"When Kids Come First\\" \\"When Kids Come First\\" was Lamrock's five-year plan to accomplish what he saw as the necessary challenges facing the New Brunswick education system. Lamrock's vision was adopted by the Graham government as an integral part of the Liberal government's self-sufficiency agenda. \\"When Kids Come First\\" laid out three primary objectives: # Every child will arrive at kindergarten ready to learn. # Every child will leave Grade 5 having mastered the tools to learn - reading, writing and numeracy. # Every child will graduate from high school having had the opportunity to discover his or her personal strengths and to find something he or she loves doing.When Kids Come First, Department of Education, Government of New Brunswick, Fredericton, NB, pg. 9. Behind these objectives was an implicit logic that recognized that the world continues to become smaller, and that while globalization was a fuzzy concept a decade ago, today certain aspects of it are solidifying into a new global reality. Lamrock explained the logic behind this plan in his introductory message: > \\"In the future, companies will be able to move quickly to where the best > trained employees are. If our kids don't read, write or do math well enough > to learn new skills in a world of constant change, the jobs will move > somewhere else - somewhere that did a better job of teaching them. > One of the skills most in demand will be the ability to solve problems. > Following instructions will be work done in low wage economies, or by > machines. The people who control their economic future will be the kids who > went through school solving problems and challenging themselves, not just > following orders\\".When Kids Come First, pg. 5 \\"When Kids Come First\\" recognized that the educational system in New Brunswick was built on a pedagogical structure that was being challenged by the realities and demands of a globalized economy. Without question Lamrock's plan created some controversy as he began to implement his vision. Literacy rates Lamrock inherited an educational system that faced some of the most daunting challenges in the nation. In 2000, out of the 10 Canadian provinces, New Brunswick had the lowest literacy rates with only marginal improvement between 2000 and 2006 when Lamrock became Minister of Education.\\"Profile of New Brunswick High School Students: Their Reading Skills - Research Program on Post-Secondary Education and Training Opportunities in New Brunswick, Report #2\\" Department of Post-Secondary Education, Training and Labour, 2007, pg. 1 As Minister of Education Lamrock oversaw an increase in per-student spending from $6,740\\"2005-2006 Annual Report - Department of Education\\", Education, Government of New Brunswick, Fredericton, NB, 2006, pg. iii as of the 2005-2006 school year to $8,573 during the 2008-2009 school year.\\"2008-2009 Annual Report - Department of Education\\", Government of New Brunswick, Fredericton, NB, 2009, pg. ii Increasing funding per student surpassed its desired results in 2009 when the Department of Education announced that 20% of Grade Two students could read at an exceptional level and 90% of students could read at an appropriate level for their age group.Provincial Assessments: Report on Achievement 2008-2009\\" Overall between Anglophones and Francophones, student literacy rates in New Brunswick had increased by 11% since he had taken office in 2006. In September 2009, Minister of Education Roland Hache recognized the accomplishments made by Lamrock during his time as education minister, stating, \\"the education system has undergone some very significant, yet very necessary, changes in the past few years. The knowledge and skills that students need to succeed in the workforce of tomorrow are very different from previous generations. It was essential that the education system be adapted to ensure that today's students have the tools they need.\\"http://www.gnb.ca/cnb/news/edu/2009e1261ed.htm Communications New Brunswick. \\"Feature Article - Education Minister prepares to lead New Brunswick into a new school year, 09-09-02 Innovative Learning Fund In addition to increased investment in students Lamrock's vision also called for an investment in teachers. The Innovative Learning Fund was established to \\"encourage, facilitate, recognize and reward innovative and creative instructional approaches that will increase student learning and academic performance, and enhance teaching practices.\\"Innovative Learning Fund Under this program teachers, schools and school boards could apply for grants to fund projects aimed at creating innovative curriculum and teaching models. To date the Innovative Learning Fund has distributed six million dollars to 612 projects in the Anglophone sectorLearning Fund - Anglophone Sector and just under six million dollars to 584 projects in the Francophone sector.Fonds d'innovation en apprentissage (secteur francophone) also see Teachers received $4.6 million for 395 Innovative Learning Fund projects (08/05/06) French immersion On March 14, 2008, Lamrock announced the elimination of all public school French Second Language training prior to Grade 5 in New Brunswick, including the popular Early French Immersion program which started in Grade 1. Instead all students would have five months of \\"intensive\\" French in Grade 5, and there would be an optional Late French Immersion program starting in Grade 6. The logic behind the legislation was to allow Anglophone students to learn the basics of reading, spelling, and arithmetic in their mother tongue before introducing the French language into their studies. A number of studies argued that Early French Immersion hindered the ability of many Anglophone youth to grasp the elemental building blocks of their education as they had to learn a new language while simultaneously learning the basics of math and grammar. It also put non-bilingual parents at a disadvantage as they were often unable to assist their children with their homework. Introducing French Immersion in Grade 6 would allow Anglophone children the ability to grasp the necessary fundamentals of education while still providing enough time to become functionally bilingual by graduation. Despite the best of intentions public reaction was highly critical of the move, and groups called for Lamrock's resignation over the matter. On June 11, 2008, Justice Hugh McLellan of the Court of Queen's Bench of New Brunswick overturned Lamrock's decision of March 14, calling it unfair and unreasonable because he had not allowed enough time for debate before making his decision. In response, Lamrock announced a new consultation with a deadline of July 25, 2008 and stated that he would make a final decision on August 5. Electronic submissions to this new consultation were posted on the Government of New Brunswick's website. On June 18, 2008, former leader of the New Brunswick Liberal Party, Bernard Richard, who now held the position of provincial Ombudsman and Child and Youth Advocate, spoke out against Lamrock's plan. In his Report of the Ombudsman into the Minister of Education’s decision to modify the French Second Language Curriculum, Richard recommended that the government defer the consultation announced by Lamrock and delay implementation of the elimination of early French immersion until September 2009, citing: *Unfairness stemming from a lack of consultation *Unfairness due to insufficient notice prior to implementation *Decision premised upon a mistake of fact arising from errors in statistical analysis and other factual errors *Failure to consider all the evidence before the Commissioners and before the Minister *Bias arising from an alleged predetermination of the consultation outcomes *Determination of FSL policy on the basis of irrelevant grounds or considerations, or for an improper purpose *Failure to consider commitments of citizen engagement in the government response to the Commission on Legislative Democracy On August 5, 2008, Lamrock and Premier Shawn Graham announced a revised plan for French Second Language Education, subsequent to the public consultation. In this new plan early immersion had been cut and middle immersion would be offered in Grade 3 as of 2010, following an introduction to French language and culture for all students starting in kindergarten, to be implemented in 2009. Students who were not in the immersion program would begin intensive French in Grade 5 as of September 2008, and a greater variety of options were planned for the higher grades. In September 2009, Education Minister Roland Hache released statistics which were claimed to validate the reforms undertaken by Lamrock and Premier Shawn Graham. \\"Last year's reforms [2008] to French second-language programming have also had positive results, with 58% of Grade 5 Intensive French students now hitting the provincial target, as compared to only 2% under the previous Core French program.\\"http://www.gnb.ca/cnb/news/edu/2009e1261ed.htm Communications New Brunswick, \\"Feature Article - Education minister prepares to lead New Brunswick into a new school year, 09-09-02. However, the education reforms had also resulted in a drop of 6 percentage points in Grade 5 math scores as well as declines in French Immersion reading and writing scores. =Minister of Social Development= In June 2009 Lamrock was moved to the Social Development portfolio in a cabinet shuffle. Poverty reduction As Minister of Social Development, Lamrock inherited a public engagement initiative, launched by Premier Shawn Graham, tasked with the job of studying poverty in New Brunswick and recommending measures to combat it. The government engaged the public through a number of public forums held throughout the province between October 2008 and March 2009. The forums were organized to bring together government officials, business leaders, non-profit organizations, and individuals living in poverty to discuss what poverty means, what causes it, and what can be done to reduce it. The public forums painted a very clear picture of the state of poverty in New Brunswick. While a number of themes emerged, the single most consistent opinion communicated was that the social assistance system, as it was constructed, further exacerbated poverty in the province. Rather than assisting people to regain their self-reliance, social assistance trapped people in poverty.Department of Social Development, \\"A Choir of Voices: The 'What Was Said' Report: Developing A Poverty Reduction Plan for New Brunswick\\", June 2009, http://www.gnb.ca/0017/promos/0001/WhatWasSaid-e.asp On October 7, 2009, in a speech to a group of Saint John business leaders, Lamrock openly challenged his own government, proposing to reform the social assistance program and raise rates that had been frozen in the Spring. Lamrock argued, \\"We can't ask people to live on less than $300.00 a month and wonder why they don't focus on work. It's because they focus on surviving... And I want to be really clear on this one, if we want people to be self-reliant, we can't have a myriad of complex rules that make people feel if they take one wrong step, they lose their cheques.\\" Lamrock's comments signaled a significant shift in the way the Department of Social Development would be run under his watch. He criticized the social assistance system, stating that its programs had functioned exclusively to \\"save money, not to help the poor. A new mandate comes down from Finance and we figure out which are the least vulnerable people who can be squeezed off the system... that's what's driven social assistance reform for 20 years and it has to stop.\\" On November 12 and 13, 2009, the final forum of the task force was held in Saint John. The participants agreed to the first poverty reduction strategy in New Brunswick in the report \\"Overcoming Poverty Together: The New Brunswick Economic and Social Inclusion Plan\\". Among its recommendations the Poverty Reduction Plan suggested that three reforms needed to take place immediately: #The elimination of the interim social assistance rate program (single employable people) #Extend health card for persons exiting social assistance for up to 3 years until prescription drug program is introduced #The household income policy will only be applied to social assistance recipients who are in spousal relationships (making it permissible for people on social assistance to have a roommate)Department of Social Development, \\"Overcoming Poverty Together: The New Brunswick Economic and Social Inclusion Plan\\" Fredericton, NB, 2009, http://www.gnb.ca/0017/Promos/0001/pdf/Plan-e.pdf The Poverty Reduction Plan has been well received by groups who advocate on behalf of New Brunswick's poor. Brian Duplessis, the Executive Director of Fredericton Homeless Shelters, was encouraged by the steps Lamrock has taken, but argued that more needed to be done to address issues of deep poverty in New Brunswick. Brian Duplessis; Brenda Murphy, coordinator for the Urban Core Support Network in Saint John; and Wendy McDermott, coordinator of Vibrant Communities Saint John, all agreed that while there is much work to be done, the steps undertaken by Lamrock were reforms that anti-poverty advocates have been lobbying the province to make for years. Premier Shawn Graham stated, \\"What has been agreed is exceptional, and it will put us on the right path to achieving our poverty-reduction goals and helping thousands of New Brunswickers be more self-sufficient.\\"Department of Social Development, Overcoming Poverty Together, http://www.gnb.ca/0017/promos/0001/index-e.asp Extending health card benefits On December 9, 2009, Lamrock announced the extension of the health card benefits up to three years for those exiting social assistance and entering the workforce. This extension was proposed by the poverty reduction task force as an interim solution to provide health and dental benefits until the province completed its prescription drug plan set to begin in April 2012. Extending health card benefits recognizes that many people on social assistance enter the workforce in minimum wage jobs that do not offer health and dental benefits. Disability supplement reforms On January 13, 2010, Lamrock rose in the New Brunswick Legislature to announce that reforms had been made to the provincial disability supplement program to ensure that those who exceeded the income threshold would not lose this vital supplement. Effective January 1, 2010 the disability supplement would eliminate income cutoffs and replace them with a declining scale system so that if a person was $6 over the threshold, he would not lose the entire supplement of $1000, but rather the supplement would decrease by $6 and the person would receive $994. Increasing social assistance rates On January 18, 2010, Lamrock rose in the New Brunswick Legislature to announce that reforms had also been made to the social assistance rates, increasing them by 82%. The rates which were under $300 had been increased to $536. Eliminating the economic unit policy On February 18, 2010, Lamrock rose in the New Brunswick Legislature to announce that the economic unit policy which prevented those receiving social assistance from having a roommate had been eliminated. All New Brunswickers receiving social assistance prior to January 1, 2010 would immediately benefit from this program. By June 30, 2011 the program would be extended to all recipients of social assistance who began receiving benefits after the January 1, 2010 cut off date. Lamrock explained why the program was being rolled out in this way in the Legislature on February 18, 2010: > \\"I want to inform the House of the three steps that will be taken to change > this policy forever. In the covenant for poverty reduction, there was an > agreement that the government would excuse all those on social assistance > today from the economic unit policy, except for spouses, who have an > obligation to look after each other. That means that all those who are > social assistance clients as of January 1 can now—and in the future—take on > roommates or move in with a brother. A parent can move in with their adult > child who can help look after them in tough times. That can happen. When we > looked at it, we also decided that was not enough. We want to make sure that > we are cementing this policy once and for all. > Second, I want to let the House know that the department has begun the > delicate work of redrafting the policy altogether. Certainly, no one in this > House wants to see an 18-year-old be able to graduate from high school and > go on social assistance while living with their parents. No one wants to > excuse spouses from their obligation to look after each other for richer or > for poorer. While being consistent with the charter and not discriminating, > we want to make absolutely sure that we draft a policy that makes sense. We > have committed, and we have ordered the department today, that that work is > to be done by June 30, 2011, so that not only are we excusing the clients > whom we are excusing today, but we are also going to fix it for everybody. > Third, we also understand that while that important drafting work is being > undertaken, there will be new applicants—those who may fall upon hard times > and those who may be looking to share expenses or have a little bit of help. > I am also pleased to inform the House that we have allowed the Minister of > Social Development to make exemptions for new applicants. We will also set > up a committee to advise the minister. It will be made up of the people > living in poverty, the front line poverty advocates, and the community > leaders who were part of the poverty reduction strategy in the first place. > This will allow the minister to help all those who come looking for help, > and who do not have anyone who should be expected to look after them, to be > exempt from the economic unit policy. I also want to make it clear that the > ministerial discretion is there to protect people. I will soon be making > public a mandate letter to the committee with the principles that we intend > to use.\\" The Opposition offered criticism to Lamrock's actions on the economic unit policy, which is part of a much larger Poverty Reduction Strategy, which the Conservative Party leader David Alward signed and lent his party's support to in Saint John in November 2009. =Attorney General of New Brunswick= On January 4, 2010, Premier Shawn Graham appointed Lamrock Attorney General of New Brunswick after his predecessor, Michael B. Murphy, resigned his seat in the legislature to spend time with his family. Civil Forfeiture Act As Attorney General of New Brunswick, Lamrock introduced the Civil Forfeiture Act to the legislature in mid-February 2010. Although this particular legislation had been promised by his predecessor, Lamrock followed through with its introduction. Lamrock expressed his support for the Civil Forfeiture Act on his website kellylamrock.com. > \\"This legislation closes an important loophole. Many drug houses and child > pornography operations happen in rental properties with no clear tenant, but > where dozens of people have access. We have properties laden with violence > at night and discarded needles by morning where there is no reasonable doubt > there is a crime. We have computers full of horrible videos of kids being > tortured where by the sheer number of people with access, none can be > convicted. When an item can be proven to be aiding an ongoing activity, and > it can be proven the removal of the item will stop the crime, I think that > is acceptable.\\" Kelly continued to explain his support for the legislation by stating, > \\"While I am a critic of the fed's \\"lock 'em up\\" approach, I see nothing > progressive in leaving families in poor neighbourhoods like Doone Street (a > struggling neighbourhood in Devon on Fredericton’s north side) to see crime > and violence normalized for their kids when the crime is proven but the > individuals are not.\\" Lamrock was quick to point out that this Legislation does not give police in New Brunswick the ability to violate civil liberties: > \\"Any legislation, including this one, is subject to Charter scrutiny and the > Canadian Charter of Rights trumps the Bill. In other words, protected > rights, such as the right against unreasonable search and seizure under > Section 8, cannot be subverted.\\" > \\"More directly the bill does not change the need for warrants, due process, > limits on searches or evidentiary admissibility. The Civil Forfeiture Act > allows the Crown, if it can prove property was used in the commission of a > crime, to seize it. But to seize the property, the Crown still has to prove > that in court with a right to legal defence. In proving that the property > was used in commission of a crime they still follow the same procedures used > in proving an individual committed a crime — no search without a warrant, no > unreasonable searches, etc.\\" =Acting Minister of Justice and Consumer Affairs= Lamrock was named Acting Minister of Justice and Consumer Affairs by Premier Shawn Graham on February 10, 2010 after the resignation of his predecessor Bernad LeBlanc. Judicature Act On February 18, 2010, Lamrock introduced the Judicature Act to the New Brunswick Legislature. The purpose of this act is to amend the Judicature Act which will provide sufficient authority to implement some of the recommendations made by the Family Justice Task Force. The act also creates a Master to divide the labour of the court in order to ensure the appropriate services are provided to those who need them and to help increase access to the Family Justice system.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCqWROB1SE0 Insurance Act On February 24, 2010, Lamrock introduced the Insurance Act to the New Brunswick Legislature for first reading. The act would prevent insurance companies from using credit scores in determining the rates they charge New Brunswickers for home, car, and life insurance. This legislation puts New Brunswick ahead of the curve on this matter. Currently Alberta and Ontario prevent insurance companies from using individual financial history for automobile insurance; the proposed legislation before the New Brunswick Assembly would go further to prevent financial history from being used for home and life insurance as well. \\"If powerful companies can take advantage of consumers then the little guy can get hurt,\\" Lamrock told reporters outside the house. \\"Government has to maintain the ability to step in and make sure that companies aren't using information that has nothing to do with your risk as a driver or homeowner in order to determine the price of your insurance.\\" \\"This will provide us with the ability to stop the practice of jacking up insurance rates based on irrelevant questions,\\" Lamrock, the MLA for Fredericton-Fort Nashwaak said, adding that 40 years ago insurance companies asked race-based questions to identify risk. People's insurance premiums should be determined solely by the risk they pose to the insurer for claims.\\"http://telegraphjournal.canadaeast.com/front/article/965426 =Minister responsible for the New Brunswick Provincial Capital Commission= Lamrock was made the minister responsible for the New Brunswick Provincial Capital Commission by Premier Shawn Graham in 2006. The idea for the agency existed only as an idea which originated from a 2003 report commissioned by the previous Conservative government. On March 1, 2007 Lamrock and Premier Graham announced the creation of the non-partisan, arm's-length agency. The creation of the Provincial Capital Commission also saw the creation of the Capital Region, a geographic space the includes nine electoral districts with its centre being the Legislative Assembly in downtown Fredericton, New Brunswick. The Provincial Capital Commission is responsible for protecting and celebrating the history and cultural diversity of New Brunswick. I Walked with My Premier and MLA Since its creation in 2007 the Provincial Capital Commission has begun a number of successful initiatives including \\"I Walked with My Premier and MLA\\" in the early fall of 2008 that saw more than 2000 students from across the province travel to Fredericton for a walk around the city with the premier and all the members of the Legislative Assembly. Capital Encounters The Capital Encounters program has been a wildly successful initiative that subsidizes travel expenses for schools who visit Fredericton. During the trip students tour the capital city, meet with their local MLA, and when the legislature is in session they sit in the public gallery and are formally introduced in the chamber to the speaker and the other members of the assembly. Host communities for New Brunswick Day In 2007 the Provincial Capital Commission instituted a host community for the traditional August 1 civil holiday New Brunswick Day. In 2007 the inaugural host community was the premier's hometown of Rexton, New Brunswick. In 2008 the host community was Shediac, New Brunswick; in 2009 it was McAdam, New Brunswick; and in 2010 Rexton once again played host to the celebrations. =Minister responsible for housing= Lamrock became the minister responsible for Housing in the cabinet shuffle on June 22, 2009. In this capacity he was responsible for issues related to low-income housing and seniors' housing within the province. =2010 election= In the 2010 provincial election, Lamrock lost his seat to Conservative challenger Pam Lynch. Following the election, Graham resigned as Liberal leader and Lamrock was rumoured as a potential leadership candidate. On February 29, 2012, Lamrock announced through social media and his campaign website that he was entering the leadership race, but on May 17, he released a statement on his official blog announcing that he would not be seeking the leadership. =2013 switch to NDP= In February 2013, Lamrock switched to the NDP, under Dominic Cardy. He ran in the 2014 general election as an NDP candidate but lost to Green Party leader David Coon, coming in fourth place with 19.7% of the vote. Lamrock was appointed acting executive director of the party in 2016.http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/nb-ndp-leader-dominic-cardy- resigns-1.3918114 Lamrock's post-political career has seen him act as legal counsel on a number of high-profile legal cases, representing groups such as parents fighting school closures and massage therapists appealing mass suspensions by their professional associations. He co-founded Mostly The Moment Theatre Company in Fredericton. In 2016 Lamrock worked as a Parliamentary Affairs Consultant to the new elected parliament in Tunisia.

He served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1915 to 1920, as a member of the Liberal Party. Wood was born in Veira, Orkney, Scotland, the son of William Wood and Margaret Robertson, and came to Canada in 1887. He was educated in Scotland and at Port Elgin High School, at Toronto University and at Knox College in Toronto, graduating in 1904. In the same year, he married Margaret Workman. Ordained as a Presbyterian minister, he served in Dunbarton, Ontario from 1904 to 1908, in Claremont, Ontario from 1908 to 1913, and in Franklin, Manitoba after 1913.

Produced by the BBC and shown on A&E; in the U.S., the film features the voices of numerous British actors and uses CGI technology to enhance footage of actual lions and other animals. Jim Henson's Creature Shop provided the digital effects and animatronics for the film. It was shot in Tanzania's Serengeti National Park. Plot Suki, her cowardly brother Linus, and their conceited cousin Fleck are all lion cubs. When two rogue lions called Dark and Harry known as \\"The Wanderers\\" attack and while the lionesses help, they kill Fleck's mother leaving him an orphan. Suki and Linus decide to go exploring and find out how the Wanderers got across the river. Their mother Macheeba thought it impossible for the Wanderers to get across as there are Nile crocodiles in the river. Suki and Linus find a dead tree making a bridge, which is probably how the Wanderers got across. Elephants destroy the bridge leaving the cubs (and the Wanderers) trapped. When they meet Dark, he saves them from a pack of spotted hyenas, and Suki develops a crush on him. She and Linus have no choice but to swim across the river, and they successfully do. As the cubs become teenagers, Suki and Linus are being taught to hunt. Suki does not want to hunt and becomes a vegetarian. Fleck thinks that Suki and Linus do not like him because he is an orphan. Often in the film, Linus tries to practice hunting but is humiliated twice (being urinated on by an olive baboon, and trying to hunt a banded mongoose, but is chased up a tree by a herd of cape buffalo). When Suki, Fleck and Linus are adults, Suki refuses to hunt/contribute to the pride as she sees it as cruelty to kill animals, therefore rendering her useless or another mouth to feed to the other lions, and, seeing as she does not see that she fits in, leaves the pride and becomes a Wanderer. After a year with the Wanderers, Suki now has Dark's cubs but still refuses to hunt. One night Harry, who killed Fleck's mother, eats all but one of Suki's cubs, Rory. Harry claims they went missing and threatens for her last cub to \\"go missing\\" if she does not contribute. That night Suki overhears Harry talking to Dark about striking another attack on the pride saying they will kill them all. Outraged, Suki goes back to warn her pride about the impending attack. On her way back, Suki meets Lush, a lion who left the pride to see the rest of the world. Suki asks him to help her find some food and help fight the Wanderers. She hunts for the first time to provide food for the pride as they had not eaten for a while. Since the pride will not accept Fleck, he decides to join the Wanderers. Soon a fight erupts on the mountain top containing Harry and Linus where Harry dies by falling off the cliff side after Dark refuses to help him because Dark had just found out what Harry did to his cubs. Both Fleck and Dark leave after the battle, with Fleck threatening his revenge, claiming he will come back with an entire group of \\"highly-trained lions.\\" Suki mates with Lush and has his cubs as Linus decides to leave to see the rest of the world and vows to come back when he is needed.

The Wizard was played by Joe Knezevich in the first season of the television series Stargirl for DC Universe and The CW network. Publication history The Wizard first appeared in All Star Comics #34 (April–May 1947) in the story titled \\"The Wiles of The Wizard\\" written by Gardner Fox with art by Irwin Hasen. In October 1947, the Wizard was one of the six original members of the Injustice Society, who began battling the Justice Society of America in All Star Comics #37 (Oct 1947). Fictional character biography Born approximately 1913, William Asmodeus Zard grew up living a life of crime. As a gun man for various crime bosses, he ultimately ended up in jail. With the passage of time, he formulated a strategy to become a specialized kingpin. In order to accomplish this task, he moved to Tibet and trained under a proficient lama in the mystic arts of illusion and deception. Upon completion of his training, he proceeded to slay his master. Returning to the United States, he embarked on a career as a criminal magician. Believing that the Justice Society of America was merely a cover for a criminal organization, he first offered a reward of $1,000,000 to them in the paper under the alias W. I. Zard, later asking to join them. To prove to himself that they were not really criminals, the Wizard attempted several criminal acts which were thwarted one by one by members of the Society. Realizing his misconception, he tried to destroy them with his illusions, but was stopped by Doctor Mid-Nite's blackout bomb.All Star Comics #34. DC Comics. The Wizard helped to form the Injustice Society with Per Degaton, Vandal Savage, the Thinker, the Gambler, and Brainwave, which engineered five jailbreaks. Each member proceeded to steal some key item from the U.S. government while leading an army of prison escapees, taking control of a portion of the American midwest, and collectively they captured their heroic counterparts, with the Wizard capturing Wonder Woman and Johnny Thunder. However, Green Lantern was able to outwit Brainwave who believed him to be dead after he fell into a ravine, though his power ring saved him at the last moment, and free the rest by impersonating the Thinker who he had captured, who was acting as a judge in the 'trial' of the JSA, where the Wizard was acting as prosecutor. The Wizard's escape was circumvented by some junior fans of the JSA.All Star Comics #37. DC Comics. The Wizard proceeded to escape prison once more and reformed his gang with new members the Icicle, the Fiddler, the Sportsmaster, the Huntress, and the Harlequin. Each member would try and commit a 'patriotic crime,' steal a historical item, and the leader would be voted for by the American people. The Harlequin, as it turned out, was actually not a criminal at heart...she merely kept up the pretense in order to attract the attention of Green Lantern. The JSA were captured after being knocked out by the Sportsmaster's bomb and having their memories removed. Along with aspiring Justice Society member the Black Canary, the Harlequin soon freed the heroes and restored their memories with her hypnotic glasses. However, a subliminal message had been left to restore the members to their mindless state when they heard fingers snapping, allowing the Injustice Society to recapture them when they attempted to stop the crimes. The Wizard, during the crimes, stole the Freedom Train. The JSA were placed in a chamber in which they would soon be killed. However, their memories were restored again, by the Black Canary, and they captured their foes.All Star Comics #41 In the late 1940s, the Wizard was contacted by Colonel Future to help get revenge on the Pre-Crisis Earth-Two's Superman by removing him from existence and given the Glastonbury Wand, which had once belonged to Merlin and had been stolen by Future's henchmen. Unfortunately, the Wizard accidentally eliminated only his memory of being Superman, but his Clark Kent identity remained. In 1950, Clark married Lois Lane; Lois realized he was Superman after seeing evidence of his invulnerability. Lois found the Wizard, who was now homeless and unable to perform acts of magic due to his shattered confidence at not being believed that he was responsible for Superman's disappearance. She convinced him to restore Superman's memory, after which the Wizard was happy to be sent to jail because he was now publicly known to have successfully removed Superman for a \\"couple of years\\".Action Comics #484. DC Comics. The Wizard soon escaped and visited the Black Canary, exacting revenge on her for interfering with his second Injustice Society by granting the powers of a sonic scream to their baby daughter also named Dinah Lance. This girl eventually grew up to become the second Black Canary.Justice League of America #219–220 The Wizard proceeded to form a new villainous organization known as the Crime Champions, which teamed up with their counterparts on Earth-1 to battle the Society and Justice League of America. The villains used a vibration device accidentally discovered by the Fiddler to escape to the other Earth after committing robberies. The Wizard escaped Green Lantern and Black Canary during a million- dollar robbery. He disguised himself as Doctor Alchemy using his magic and the rest of the Earth-2 criminals disguised themselves as the Earth-1 Crime Champions. He battled Superman and Green Arrow, and helped trap the J.L.A. in their headquarters with magic. On Earth-1 he battled Hawkman and Black Canary and was beaten again, before being finally defeated by Aquaman, Wonder Woman, and the Earth-2 Flash. Years later, he again reformed the Injustice Society which were temporarily victorious, enlisting the aid of extra-dimensional writer Cary Bates in killing several members of the J.S.A prior to their being revived.Justice League of America #123–124. DC Comics. By the 1970s, Zard and the other Injustice Society members invaded the Justice Society headquarters, severely injured Hourman and staged a crime spree that spanned the globe. They were later apprehended. Soon, he and the Injustice Society members went to Earth-1 to recruit younger villains to fight the Justice Society. The Wizard went there with the Fiddler, but once on Earth-1 he unexpectedly found that his sorcerer's powers began to weaken. Apparently, the travel from Earth-2 to Earth-1 caused the effect; the reverse happened with the Phantom Lady, who gained intangibility power when she traveled from Earth-X to Earth-1 in Freedom Fighters #1. On Earth-1, the Wizard was recruited into Darkseid's Secret Society of Super Villains, which he later took over with other villains who revolted. The Wizard was later apprehended and sent to jail, where his powers largely faded. After escaping from prison, the Wizard reformed the Secret Society and tricked them into obtaining four magical relics: the Cloak of Invisibility, the Power Glove, the Power Stone, and the Dragon Box. Unable to control the Dragon Box, the members of the Society were captured. But the Wizard incorporated the remaining three items into his new costume. The Wizard led the Secret Society back to Earth-2 in a plot to capture the JSA, which was a success when they captured the Atom, Doctor Mid-Nite, and Mr. Terrific. The JSA were alerted and defeated them.Secret Society of Super-Villains #7–15. DC Comics. The Wizard was responsible for a coup in which his Secret Society, consisting of himself, Professor Zoom the Reverse-Flash, the Floronic Man, the Blockbuster, and Star Sapphire, switched bodies with members of the JLA. This happened in Justice League of America #166–168, a storyline that was revisited in Identity Crisis (2004), where it was revealed that Zatanna wiped the heroes' secret identities from the villains' minds following their defeat. The Wizard later returned to Earth-2, once again reassembling the Crime Champions with the help of Johnny Thunder of Earth-1, but was once more defeated by the combined might of the JSA and JLA.Justice League of America #219–220. DC Comics. He later appeared briefly during the JSA's trial before congress for allegations of misconduct during World War II, but was quickly defeated by Doctor Fate.America versus the Justice Society #2.(DC Comics Sometime later, he moved to Canada and joined with the Fiddler and the Shade as well as new villains the Icicle II, Artemis Crock (later called the Tigress), the Harlequin III, and Hazard, to form the group Injustice Unlimited, the second incarnation of the Injustice Society, where they fought Infinity, Inc. and the Global Guardians. The Wizard was presumably killed by the second generation Hourman, Zard still had the trick of faking his death.Infinity Inc. #34–36. DC Comics. Of course, this too was an illusion, and he had transported himself to the land of Faeries where he could recoup his power base. Once more, he was defeated by an assemblage of heroes and by his own ego.Infinity Inc. #50. DC Comics. The Wizard appeared in the JSA All-Stars miniseries in which he disguised himself as the villain Legacy and captured the elder members of the Justice Society. He was then \\"killed\\" by the Spectre. Shortly after Identity Crisis, Despero gave the surviving Secret Society members their memories back. In the JLA story, \\"Crisis of Conscience\\", the Wizard appeared as part of a reformed Secret Society of Super Villains looking to avenge themselves against the forced erasure of their memories. Aided by Felix Faust, they attacked the Daily Planet, and were stopped once again by the Justice League. After defeating Despero at Wayne Manor, the League was disbanded and Zatanna re- wiped the memories of all six Society members. He has since appeared in JSA: Classified as part of a new Injustice Society that includes the Icicle, the Tigress, Solomon Grundy, the Gentleman Ghost, the Rag Doll, and Johnny Sorrow and gained possession of the key to the Ghost Zone. During the Infinite Crisis, the Wizard was again seen in the Secret Society of Super Villains.Villains United #2. DC Comics. He showed up again fighting under the command of Johnny Sorrow as part of the Injustice Society.JSA All Stars #2. Powers and abilities The Wizard originally only knew the secrets of illusion, hypnosis and astral projection; in later times, he is a skilled magic user capable of performing various effects. Maybe his highest power degree was when he possessed the Wand of Glastonbury. He came into possession of the key to the Ghost Zone allowing him access to another dimension and teleportation through it.

In the final battle with Master, Wizard appeared and managed to merge with Master changing them back into Robby Reed.Superboy Vol. 2 #49 (January 1984). DC Comics. In other mediaTelevision= * In Justice League, a character based on Wizard named Sir Swami appears in the episode \\"Legends\\", voiced by Jeffrey Jones. He is a member of the Injustice Guild. * Wizard appears in the Young Justice episode \\"Misplaced\\", voiced by Corey Burton. He alongside Felix Faust, Blackbriar Thorn, and Wotan are summoned to Roanoke Island by Klarion the Witch Boy in a plot to use a powerful spell to separate the world into two dimensions: one for the children and one for the adults. * A version of Wizard named William Zarick appears in Stargirl, portrayed by Joe Knezevich. This version is depicted as a member of the Injustice Society. As seen in the pilot episode, ten years prior to the series, Wizard partook in the Injustice Society's attack on the Justice Society of America's headquarters, taking out Hourman while he was fighting Tigress. In his civilian identity, Zarick works as a Blue Valley councilman as well as executive and financial supporter of a prominent business called The American Dream, which is run by other former members of the Injustice Society. He is also the father of aspiring magician Joey Zarick and the husband of Denise Zarick. Having grown weary of his obligations to the Society and wanting a normal life with his family, he rebuffs his former ally Icicle when he comes to seek help against JSA leader Starman's successor, Stargirl. After Joey is killed in an accident that Icicle caused, Wizard goes to avenge his son, only to be frozen to death. After the media reports that he died of a heart attack and Icicle used his company to name a theater in his honor shortly after his death, Denise became suspicious and realized that her husband and son were murdered by members of Blue Valley's elite. She tries to leave Blue Valley after warning Pat Dugan, though he later discovers her car's remains in a junkyard. After getting Icicle's approval, Injustice Society member Dragon King obtained Wizard's body. =Film= An unrelated character called \\"The Wizard\\" was the main villain in the 1949 Batman and Robin movie serial played by actor Leonard Penn. This Wizard had no magical powers, but was instead a mad scientist and masked mystery villain who was revealed to be Carter Hammill, the twin brother of Professor Hammill.

His brother Michael is also a former professional footballer. He had an excellent early career with Manchester City, winning the FA Youth Cup in 1986 and helping the club to win promotion out of the Second Division in 1988–89. However a ruptured Anterior cruciate ligament in September 1990 would lead to several seasons struggling with knee injuries, and he would only play four further games from that point before announcing his retirement in January 1996. Despite his career effectively ending at the age of 21 he was later inducted into the Manchester City Hall of Fame, and was seen as a player who would have been a key first team player for many years had it not been for his injury problems. Paul went on to spend ten years as a physiotherapist in the game, working with Macclesfield Town FC and Bolton Wanderers FC. In 2008 he was recruited by Manchester City FC as its 'City in the Community' Ambassador, helping to forge links with local charities. In 2013, Paul joined the Premier League as a Club Support Manager, liaising with various football academies across the north of England. He also works as a match day co-commentator for BBC Radio Manchester. Early life Paul was born on 28 October 1968, five minutes before his twin sister Tracey, to Sheila McGinty (housewife) and Ted Lake (asphalt technician). He grew up in Haughton Green, though both his parents came from Ardwick. The twins were the younger siblings of Susan (born 1962), David (1964), and Michael (born 1966). He spent all of his free time during childhood playing football. He grew up supporting Manchester City, as he was taken to games at Maine Road by the local milkman. His great-uncle George was on the books of Manchester City prior to the First World War. Club career At the age of eight he played for the Denton Youth under-12 side. He won the 1980 Smiths Crisps Six-a-Side Championship with his school, St Mary's RC Primary (Denton), and scored the winning goal in the Wembley final against St Cuthbert's School (Sunderland). He was spotted by Manchester City scout Ted Davies playing for Denton Boys under-13s, who got him a place alongside Andy Hinchcliffe on Blue Star, a feeder team to Manchester City. Ian Brightwell later joined the team, though by then the club had changed its name to Midas, and later Pegasus. Lake became an associated schoolboy at City in July 1983, and signed a contract to become a Youth Training Scheme apprentice in July 1985. He won a treble in the 1985–86 season, as the reserve team won the Central League, the 'A' team won the Lancashire league title, and the youth team beat Manchester United in the FA Youth Cup final. He signed professional forms with the club on his 18th birthday. Following an injury to David White, Lake was given his first-team debut by manager Jimmy Frizzell on 24 January 1987 in a 0–0 draw with Wimbledon at Plough Lane. He scored on his home debut on 21 February in a 1–1 draw with Luton Town. New manager Mel Machin gave him more of a run in the first team early in the 1987–88 season after centre-half Kenny Clements picked up an injury. On 7 November he featured in City's 10–1 victory over Huddersfield Town. He became a regular first team player, but missed the last three games of the season with a knee injury he picked up against Bradford City. On 11 March 1989, he came close to death when he was knocked unconscious during a match against Leicester City and subsequently suffered with a blocked airway whilst lying on the ground. It had taken some minutes for the City doctor to make his way from the director's box to the pitch and as a result of the incident the Football Association changed their rules to ensure that club doctors must remain at pitch-side during games. He played in every outfield position throughout the 1988–89 campaign as City secured promotion out of the Second Division with a second-place finish. Despite beating rivals Manchester United 5–1, the 1989–90 season saw City initially struggle to adapt to life back in the First Division after two seasons away. Machin was sacked in November 1989, and Lake later said that his replacement, Howard Kendall, was \\"the best boss I ever had\\". City ended the season in 14th place, five points above the relegation zone. He was appointed as club captain for the 1990–91 season and was given a new five-year contract. However three games into his captaincy he picked up an injury against Aston Villa. An initial X-ray showed no broken bones and he was told it would take six weeks for the injury to heal. However, he broke down after initial straight line running work stepped up to include twisting and turning. An arthroscopy revealed a ruptured Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), and he underwent pioneering surgery to reconstruct the ligament using tissue taken from the patella tendon of the same knee; he was initially given a six-month recovery time which could have seen him back in the team at the end of that season. However, when the time again came to train with a football his knee gave way once again. He was declared fit to play again in June 1991 following months of recovery time at Lilleshall Hall. He re-ruptured his ligaments during pre-season training and had to undergo the knee operation for a second time, despite the fact the initial operation did not appear to have worked as expected. He spent the 1991–92 season back at Lilleshall, and by the end of his time there he had spent more time at the medical centre there than any other footballer. He returned for pre-season training in June 1992, and he played in a number of pre-season friendlies without incident, though his knee still required a lengthy period of rest after matches. Manager Peter Reid stated that \\"it's like being handed a new £3 million player\\". He started the opening Premier League game of the 1992–93 season on 17 August, a 1–1 draw with Queens Park Rangers, but was substituted 60 minutes in after feeling pressure in his knee. Despite still feeling that his knee needed rest he went on to play against Middlesbrough at Ayresome Park two days later. Ten minutes into the game his ligament snapped for the third time and he was substituted off. Six weeks later he travelled to Los Angeles to see Dr Sisto, an expert on cruciate ligament injuries. Before going on the trip he told The Sunday People that the club and chairman Peter Swales had not handled his injury in the correct manner and left him feeling like \\"a piece of meat\\" as players at other clubs received specialist treatment straight away and received appearance and bonus pay during long-term absences. Despite Lake being alone in America, the club refused to pay for his girlfriend to fly out to LA to be with him during his recovery from surgery, and so Niall Quinn and Peter Reid organised a whip- round to pay for her flight tickets. The lack of leg room on the economy flight back to the UK also damaged his knee, though the club had flown the fully fit club physio back to England in business class. He made brief reserve team appearances in early 1994, but was unable to participate beyond the spring as he was fitted with a knee brace to aid with his recovery. With the likelihood of a return to fitness seeming remote he resorted to trying holy water, acupuncture and faith healing, all to no effect. As the injury saga continued he began to suffer from depression, and he was put on a course of anti-depressants for a number of years. After years of operations his knee had numerous screws inserted and he needed surgery to re-straighten his leg; he remained on a lifelong prescription for anti-inflammatory painkillers. He retired from football in January 1996, after a struggle against injury which went on for more than five years, and was granted a testimonial game against Manchester United in October 1997. He was inducted into the Manchester City Hall of Fame in 2004. International career Lake made his debut for the England under-21 side against Denmark in September 1988. He also featured in a 2–1 win over Albania on 7 March 1989, and a 2–1 victory over Poland; both of which were qualifying games for the 1990 UEFA European Under-21 Championship. However coach Lawrie McMenemy stated that Lake \\"always seemed to be injured at the time of important under-21 call-ups\\". In January 1990 England manager Bobby Robson named him in his 30-man provisional squad for the 1990 FIFA World Cup. He won a cap for the England B team against Ireland B in March 1990, playing in an unfamiliar role of wide-left in a 4–1 defeat. He was angered by manager Dave Sexton's decision to play him as a winger, feeling the game did not give a good chance to make a case for his inclusion in Robson's final World Cup squad. He did not make it into the World Cup squad and never won a senior cap. Post-retirement Following his retirement from playing football, Lake used his experience on the treatment table to train to become a physiotherapist. He began working on the Manchester City medical team in 1997, and helped Richard Edghill to recover from the same injury that had claimed his own career. The following year he was appointed first team physio at Burnley. He went on to work as the physio at non-league club Altrincham, where he balanced the club's medical expenses on a tight budget. Like his previous positions, he remained at Altrincham for just one season, before moving on to Oldham Athletic. In 2003, he switched clubs to Macclesfield Town. He graduated with a degree in physiotherapy at Salford University in May 2003. In November 2007 he joined the medical staff at Bolton Wanderers. He left Bolton in 2008 and ran his own physiotherapy practice in Greater Manchester until March 2010, when he was appointed Ambassador for Manchester City in the Community. In June 2013, he stepped down as City's ambassador to take up a similar role with the Premier League. Personal life He married Lisa Johnson in Denton in May 1995. The marriage was brief, but they welcomed a son, Zachary, in 1997. In 2001 he married Joanne Parker in Prestbury village, and in June 2003 the couple had a son, Edward, followed three years later by a daughter, Hannah. Paul's father, Ted, died in Tameside Hospital in 1997. His acclaimed autobiography, \\"I'm Not Really Here\\", was published by Century in 2011. The book, co-written with his wife Joanne, became a Sunday Times best seller and was nominated for Football Book of the Year at the 2011 British Sports Book Awards. Lake is patron of Jump Space, a Stockport-based charity that provides specialist trampolining and rebound therapy to disabled children and young people.

It is made up of one layer of endothelial cells and is supported by an internal elastic lamina. The endothelial cells are in direct contact with the blood flow. The three layers of a blood vessel are an inner layer (the tunica intima), a middle layer (the tunica media), and an outer layer (the tunica externa). In dissection, the inner coat (tunica intima) can be separated from the middle (tunica media) by a little maceration, or it may be stripped off in small pieces; but, because of its friability, it cannot be separated as a complete membrane. It is a fine, transparent, colorless structure which is highly elastic, and, after death, is commonly corrugated into longitudinal wrinkles. Structure The structure of the tunica intima depends on the blood vessel type. Elastic arteries – A single layer of epithelial cells and a supporting layer of elastin-rich collagen. The layer also contains fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells called 'myointimal cells' Muscular arteries – Endothelial cells Arterioles – A single layer of epithelial cells Veins – Endothelial cells The inner coat consists of: # A layer of pavement endothelium, the cells of which are polygonal, oval, or fusiform, and have very distinct round or oval nuclei. This endothelium is brought into view most distinctly by staining with silver nitrate. # A subendothelial layer, consisting of delicate connective tissue with branched cells lying in the interspaces of the tissue; in arteries of less than 2 mm in diameter the subendothelial layer consists of a single stratum of stellate cells, and the connective tissue is only largely developed in vessels of a considerable size. # An elastic or fenestrated layer, which consists of a membrane containing a network of elastic fibers, having principally a longitudinal direction, and in which, under the microscope, small elongated apertures or perforations may be seen, giving it a fenestrated appearance. It was therefore called by Henle the fenestrated membrane. This membrane forms the chief thickness of the inner coat, and can be separated into several layers, some of which present the appearance of a network of longitudinal elastic fibers, and others a more membranous character, marked by pale lines having a longitudinal direction. In minute arteries the fenestrated membrane is a very thin layer; but in the larger arteries, and especially in the aorta, it has a considerable thickness.

It lived in the Lake Orcadie of northern Scotland. Osteolepis was about long, and covered with large, square scales. The scales and plates on its head were covered in a thin layer of spongy, bony material called cosmine. This layer contained canals which were connected to sensory cells deeper in the skin. These canals ended in pores on the surface, and were probably for sensing vibrations in the water. Osteolepis was a rhipidistian, having a number of features in common with the tetrapods (land-dwelling vertebrates and their descendants), and was probably close to the base of the tetrapod family tree.

It is bordered with the municipalities of Ares and Fene. Climate Due to its proximity to the Atlantic Ocean, Mugardos does not enjoy extreme oscillation in its weather conditions between winter and summer. The summers tend to be a bit drier than the winters, but the weather is mild all year round unlike most other parts of the Iberian Peninsula. Like the rest of Galicia, it is rainy and green.  Description and history  The municipality comprises the main township of Mugardos, and several smaller villages. It is part of the historical comarca of Ferrolterra, and is situated near the metropolitan outskirts of the city of Ferrol. The municipality is subdivided into four parroquias (\\"parishes\\"): Santiago de Franza, San Vicente de Meá, San Xulián de Mugardos and San Xoán de Piñeiro. During the 1960s and 1970s Mugardos was much larger than it is now, it included a movie theatre and was regarded as a summer visiting place for many Spaniards in the surrounding areas. Recently, however, it has undergone drastic changes. It is now very small and with the recent oil spills the coastal fishing industry consisting mainly of cockle pickers has temporarily declined, even though a rise in tourism is expected soon, especially with the creation of several new lodgings. One (unverified, and probably apocryphal) account of the origin of the locality's name comes from the Spanish adjective mojado/a, meaning \\"soaked, wet\\", and apparently applied due to the frequent return of the village's fishermen to port drenched in the storms of the area. This is supposed to have morphed over time into the form \\"Mugardos\\". One of the most historic places in Mugardos is \\"El Castillo de la Palma\\" (The Palm Castle) which is a castle standing on the southern shore of \\"La Ria de Ferrol\\" (the ferrol estuary). The castle was built in 1597 with its original name being \\"Nuestra Señora de la Palma\\" (Our Lady of the Palm) and later reformed in 1869. When it was built, the castle was merely used as a \\"watch tower\\" but later when it was reformed and became a crucial part of the defensive system of the estuary of Ferrol. Facing the castle is \\"El Castillo de San Felipe\\" (The Castle of San Felipe) which forms the other part of the defensive system. These two castles are adjoined by a large and sturdy chain that was used to prevent the entrance of enemy ships. Later, the castle was also used as a military prison where the most famous prisoner, Antonio Tejero, was held captive. Tejero was responsible for the attempted coup de etat in 1981. Recently, the Palm Castle has been bought by a hotel chain and is pending restoration.

On this day Octopus stew is prepared using a recipe that Mugardos is famous for, \\"Pulpo a la Mugardesa\\" and many tourists and town241x241pxLocal sea food. folk join in the festivities from morning until night with musical groups and flea markets. * Dia de San Julian: Saint Julian's day, is the Patron saint of the town. * La Feria Pirata: The pirate festival has various merchants come to town and sell artisan goods like food and jewelry. Musicians and other attractions are also invited to perform. There are many attractions for small children like a few rides, interactive games and face-painting. The people who attend also dress up as pirates or in medieval inspired clothing.  Economy  Mugardos is a predominantly rural borough, though important industries like shipyards, foundries, and workshops are to be found in nearby Ferrol. Fishing, farming, agriculture and services are the main local industries. Due to the economic crisis that has stricken the country and town's economy for the past few years, more than 60 shops in the town started accepting in 2011 the obsolete Spanish currency of peseta, accepting it alongside its replacement, the 2002-introduced euro.

It is located in Imbabura Province of Ecuador. According to the 2010 census, the town has 39,354 inhabitants\\"Otovalo (Ecuador\\" https://www.citypopulation.de/php/ecuador.php?cityid=100450 and has an elevation of .Google Earth It is surrounded by the peaks of Imbabura (), Cotacachi (), and Mojanda volcanoes.

The Saturday market in Otavalo, showing the colourful fabrics An Otavaleña in traditional dress works with a customer in the open-air market in Otavalo Tawa Jewelry and other handcrafts at the Otavalo Artisan Market Hand painted crafts at the Otavalo Artisan Market .  The market  The indigenous Otavalo people are famous for weaving textiles, usually made of wool, which are sold at the famous Saturday market. Although the largest market is on Saturday, there is a very wide range of wares available throughout the week in the Plaza de los Ponchos, and the many local shops. The shops sell textiles such as handmade blankets, tablecloths, and much more. The Otavalo market consists of mushroom-shaped concrete umbrellas with benches. The market was designed and built in 1970 by Dutch architect Tonny Zwollo. During the market's peak, almost one third of the town becomes full of stalls selling textiles, tagua nut jewelry, musical instruments, dream catchers, leather goods, fake shrunken heads, indigenous costumes, hand-painted platters and trays, purses, clothing, spices, raw foods and spools of wool. As the city has become more of a tourist attraction, many of the goods sold in the markets are mass-produced in nearby factories and sold in the market by middle-men. More artisan products can be purchased in neighboring communities or at the Museo Viviente Otavalango. Otavalo was an area made up principally of farming communities due to the rich volcanic soils in this area, but with the growth of tourism, the town has begun to focus more on the making of handicrafts which have made the Saturday market a popular stop with visitors to Ecuador. Tourism has become the town's main industry and as a result there are many more hotels, hostels, and tour operators than other similarly sized Ecuadorian towns, such as nearby Cayambe. Further, Otavaleño (people from Otavalo) have had notable success selling their goods abroad. As Otavalo is famous for its textiles, many of the nearby villages and towns are famous for their own particular crafts. Cotacachi, for example, is the center of Ecuador's leather industry. In San Antonio, where the local specialty is wood carving, the main street prominently displays carved statues, picture frames, and furniture.  Attractions  Many people come to Otavalo to visit the market, but the city and surrounding area is also home to the Peguche Waterfall, Lagos de Mojanda, and Museo Viviente Otavalango. The museum is located in the \\"antigua fabrica San Pedro,\\" where indigenous Otavaleños worked in sweatshop style labor for generations under brutal conditions. After the factory was shut down, a group of locals purchased the land and have since reclaimed the factory and its grounds as a living museum and community space for the indigenous community. The museum shows aspects of Otavaleño life both historically and in present day, and allows visitors to interact with the indigenous craftspeople making textiles and farming. The museum also serves as a community space, with concerts, weddings, and community meetings held in buildings on the grounds. In addition, a short taxi ride or hike from town you will find Parque Condor, a bird rescue centre and educational facility. Aiming to educate locals and tourists about the conservation of wild birds, they offer a daily flight display to view some of the birds in flight.  Traditional clothing  Otavaleña women traditionally wear distinctive white embroidered blouses, with flared lace sleeves, and black or dark over skirts, with cream or white under skirts. Long hair is tied back with a 30 cm band of woven multi coloured material, often matching the band which is wound several times round their waists. They usually have many strings of gold beads around their necks, with the number of strands and thickness of beads representing their age and wisdom, and matching tightly wound long strings of coral beads around each wrist. Men wear white trousers, and dark blue ponchos.  Music  Otavalo is also known for its traditional music and musicians. Every summer the music of Otavalo, and the surrounding areas, plays a primary role in the indigenous festival for the summer solstice, called Inti Raymi. There are many musical groups currently traveling around the world promoting their music (sometimes known as Andean New Age). This style of music has had notable commercial success worldwide.

Formed in 1979 artist/muralist Willie Herrón (keyboards, vocals), civil rights activist Jesus \\"Xiuy\\" Velo (bass), drummer Bill Reyes, and guitarist brothers Manuel and Antonio \\"Tony\\" Valdez (who also perform with their Mariachi parents & relatives). They were one of the early framers of U.S. Roc en Espanol in the early 1980s. The Smithsonian Institution exhibition, American Sabor, called Los Illegals \\"one of the most important East L.A. bands of the 1980s\\".  Background  Released in 1981, the song \\"El Lay\\" featured Herron singing about his stepfather's arrest for washing dishes in L.A. The song became a Raza Anthem and brought the group's rising notoriety to Europe and Japan. Its cover art was meant to evoke the danger of the punk rock movement and the cultural roots of the group. The group was the first of the Club Vex groups to sign with a major label releasing Internal Exile produced by David Bowie's Mick Ronson on A&M; records in 1983. The song \\"El Lay\\" was included in the album. But the relationship soon soured after the label rejected their next LP (Burning Youth) and partnership with UK's Stiff Record's producer Wally Brill (999, Elvis Costello) for its experimentation with Mexican instrumentation coupled with the band's unwillingness to use stereotypical icons (velvet Elvis paintings etc.) for publicity. Tied to a label unwilling to release it, and in debt for the LP's recording costs, they then illegally distributed it on cassette only in Mexico—for free. The band struck a deal with the Franciscan nuns to open and run the legendary Club Vex at Self Help Graphics, Catholic Youth Organization building in East Los Angeles. There, they booked and introduced Eastside to Westside groups (such as The Brat, X, Bad Religion, and Thee Undertakers) to open up new horizons and enable themselves and others to play and tour with other major 1980s groups including The Clash, Bauhaus, The Motels, and Berlin. A visit to the club by Los Lobos (then an acoustic traditionalist Mexican folk group) convinced the band to rethink itself, return electric, and follow the path set by Club Vex. They were contemporaries of The Plugz from Texas and The Zeros of San Diego. The venue's street credibility kickstarted a music and art renaissance crossing cultural and geographical boundaries. For this, the LA Weekly named them among the ten best bands from East L.A. In the early 1980s they were one of the first Chicano bands touring into Mexico playing alongside and meeting pioneer rockeros like El Tri and Tijuana No, Jaguares and Maldita Vecindad gaining respect on both sides of the border despite the original hostility displayed against them. They were actually being pelted on stage in both the U.S. (being called \\"wetbacks\\") and Mexico (this time being called \\"Pochos\\"- not truly Mexican). They shared experiences and knowledge with the fledgling scene winning the first \\"Outstanding Roc En Espanol Artist\\" California Music Award (BAMMY) from the Critics and Readers polls of the BAM/Rocket and Tower Pulse magazines. Outspoken diplomatically and politically, the band has finally been receiving its long overdue accolades and is featured in various prominent music history and university textbooks. Most notable are Barrio Rhythm, and Land of 1,000 dances: The History of Chicanos in Rock & Roll. In film, its Agnès Varda's French Masterpiece \\"Mur Murs\\", the Soundtrack for Stand and Deliver, and with Chuck D. of Public Enemy, Laurie Anderson and Cassandra Wilson in the D.A. Penebaker documentary and soundtrack: Searching for Jimi Hendrix (Capital). Also appearing alongside Santana, War, & Los Lobos on the historical compilation Ay Califas! History of Raza Rock of the 70's & 80's. In the face of anti-illegal immigrant legislation they are on the move again this time as \\"cultural collaborators\\": beginning with the highly praised CD, Concrete Blonde y Los Illegals on Miles Copeland's ARK-21/Virgin label. The vocals were primarily in Spanish. They accompanied the release of their CD with a performance with Concrete Blonde at the House of Blues on May 5, 1997. In that show, the band changed the refrain for \\"Still in Hollywood\\" to \\"Still in the Barrio\\", and featured covers of Led Zeppelin's \\"Immigrant Song\\" and Jimi Hendrix's \\"Little Wing\\". MTV credited Los Illegals for \\"not only sav[ing] the show from the depths of sentimentality but also [giving] it meaning and resonance beyond that night.\\" The album, however, seemed to have been less well-received.Los Angeles Times reviewer Enrique Lopetegui rated the album 2-½ out of 4 stars, opining that \\"there are plenty of good moments here\\" but \\"very few strong songs\\"; he singled out the \\"Chicano rap\\" record \\"Ode to Rosa Lopez\\", about a witness in the O. J. Simpson murder case, for praise as the \\"riskiest\\" track on the album. Jae-Ha Kim of the Chicago Sun-Times rated it 1-½ out of 4 stars, finding a lack of cohesion and a failure to showcase Napolitano's distinctive voice.. Thom Owens of AllMusic's rating was 2-½ out of 5 stars, finding the project to be \\"a stylistic departure that reads better than it plays\\" due to weak songwriting. They also collaborated with Tijuana punk legends \\"Mercado Negro\\" for the Rockefeller US/Mexico Culture Fund sponsored compilation CD, MexAmerica produced by Rubén Guevara for Angelino Records, later with Emmy winning journalist Ruben Martinez and Rock en Espanol stars \\"Maldita Vecindad\\" for the theater piece \\"Border Ballad\\" (the companion to his Book \\"Crossing Over: Tales From the New Frontier\\"), also writing, and performing with new talent (i.e. the EMI soundtrack of the Showtime series \\"Resurrection Boulevard\\" as their alter egos \\"The Chizmosos\\"). Lately they co- produced a series of racially diverse SRO \\"no coffee or bongos\\" electronica/noise poetry theater performances (\\"The Spine of Califas\\") with of San Diego's legendary Taco Shop Poets and several other performers/artists to which a college tour, book, CD and short film are in the offering and planning stages. The group is the subject of two documentaries of their history as Pachuco punks one entitled \\"Destined to fuck up\\" and the other a National PBS documentary special on Chicano Rock & Roll for airing in 2006. It has been said about the group that in this era of disposable pop culture where \\"commitment and consciousness\\" are words passed around and marketed all too casually, \\"Los Illegals have a history of actively and physically proving the power of music to unite people.\\" Discography *Albums **Internal Exile -1983 **Concrete Blonde y Los Illegals -1997 *Singles **Ellay – 1981 See also * Chicano music ReferencesExternal links * * Category:Hardcore punk groups from California Category:Musical groups from Los Angeles Category:Chicano rock groups Category:Musical groups established in 1979 Category:1979 establishments in California ","title":"Los Illegals"},{"id":"2477464","text":"Stephen Emmett Clement (October 14, 1867 - December 31, 1947) was a politician in Manitoba, Canada.

Cross-registration gives students access to a wider variety of subject matter at a certain logistical cost: travel time, inconsistent academic calendars, etc. It is governed by the home institution's regulations, which typically require that a similar course not be offered by the home institution, that the student not take too many outside courses, that certain basic types of courses be taken at the home institution, etc. Among institutions, cross-registration is governed by agreements - bilateral or regional (often consortia). Money may or may not flow between the institutions to compensate for the difference between inbound and outbound cross- registrants. Cross-registration allows universities in a region to focus on their area of specialization at the cost of not having direct control of their students' academic experience.

It lies between the tunica intima on the inside and the tunica externa on the outside. Artery Tunica media is made up of smooth muscle cells, elastic tissue and collagen. It lies between the tunica intima on the inside and the tunica externa on the outside. The middle coat (tunica media) is distinguished from the inner (tunica intima) by its color and by the transverse arrangement of its fibers. * In the smaller arteries it consists principally of smooth muscle fibers in fine bundles, arranged in lamellæ and disposed circularly around the vessel. These lamellæ vary in number according to the size of the vessel; the smallest arteries having only a single layer, and those slightly larger three or four layers - up to a maximum of six layers. It is to this coat that the thickness of the wall of the artery is mainly due. * In the larger arteries, as the iliac, femoral, and carotid, elastic fibers and collagen unite to form lamellæ which alternate with the layers of smooth muscular fibers; these lamellæ are united to one another by elastic fibers which pass between the smooth muscular bundles, and are connected with the fenestrated membrane of the inner coat. * In the largest arteries, as the aorta \\\\- \\"Aorta\\" and brachiocephalic, the amount of elastic tissue is considerable; in these vessels a few bundles of white connective tissue also have been found in the middle coat. The muscle fiber cells are arranged in 5 to 7 layers of circular and longitudinal smooth muscle with about 50μ in length and contain well-marked, rod-shaped nuclei, which are often slightly curved. Vein The middle coat is composed of a thick layer of connective tissue with elastic fibers, intermixed, in some veins, with a transverse layer of muscular tissue.

As of 2007, the village has a population of 750 people. Overview Cacao Market The village is four blocks in size, with narrow streets. Local commercial outlets include restaurants, grocery and bread stores. There are two primary schools, but no secondary education facilities. Public buildings include an insect museum, a library, a church, and gendarmerie. There is also a Sunday morning market at which Hmong weaving, embroidery and food can be purchased. The main hotel in Cacao is L'Auberge des Orpailleurs. Tourist activities include jungle tours, canoeing and kayaking.

This distinguishes such a station from an affiliate, which is independently owned and carries network programming by contract. The concept of an O&O; is clearly defined in the United States and Canada (and to some extent, several other countries such as the United Kingdom, Australia, Brazil, Argentina, Chile and Japan), where network-owned stations had historically been the exception rather than the rule. In such places, broadcasting licenses are generally issued on a local (rather than national) basis, and there is (or was) some sort of regulatory mechanism in place to prevent any company (including a broadcasting network) from owning stations in every market in the country. In other parts of the world, many television networks were given national broadcasting licenses at launch; as such, they have traditionally been mostly (or entirely) composed of owned-and-operated stations, rendering a separate notion for such a concept redundant. Usage of the term in the United States In the broadcasting industry, the term \\"owned-and-operated station\\" refers exclusively to stations that are owned by television and radio networks. On the other hand, the term affiliate only applies to stations that are not owned by networks, but instead are contracted to air programming from one of the major networks. While in fact there may be an affiliation agreement between a network and an owned-and- operated station (as suggested under \\"Ownership Info\\" on the FCC TV Query search for WABC-TV), this is not necessarily required, and may simply be a legal technicality formalizing the relationship of separate entities under the same parent company. In any event, this does not prevent a network from effectively dictating an owned-and-operated station's practices outside the scope of a normal affiliation agreement; for instance, network programming is very rarely preempted by O&Os; except in cases of major breaking news of interest to the O&O;'s viewing area, despite individual affiliates' rights to do so. The term \\"station\\" correctly applies to the ownership of the station. For example, a station that is owned and operated by the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) is referred to as an \\"ABC station\\" or an \\"ABC O&O;,\\" but normally should not be referred to as an affiliate. Likewise, a station not owned by ABC but contracted to air the network's programming is correctly referred to as an \\"ABC affiliate\\"; that is, the station is affiliated with ABC. However, informally or for promotional purposes, affiliated stations (or non-O&Os;) are sometimes referred to as a network station, as in \\"WFAA is an ABC station\\" even though that ABC affiliate, in the Dallas-Fort Worth market, is owned by Tegna, Inc. A correct formal phrasing could be, \\"ABC affiliate WFAA is a Tegna station.\\" Similarly, one may informally refer to \\"ABC affiliates\\" in regards to all stations (including O&Os;) that air ABC programming, or to \\"the ABC affiliation\\" in regards to the transfer of rights to ABC programming from an affiliate to an O&O.; Some stations that are owned by companies that operate a network, but air another network's programming are referred to as an affiliate of the network that they carry. For example, WBFS- TV in Miami is owned by the CBS network's parent company ViacomCBS, but airs programming from MyNetworkTV; it is a MyNetworkTV affiliate. Prior to the September 2006 shutdown of the CBS-owned UPN television network, WBFS aired that network's programming; therefore, WBFS was a UPN O&O.; The stations carrying The WB Television Network were another exception. The controlling shares in the network were held by Time Warner, with minority interests from the Tribune Company and, for a portion of network's existence, the now-defunct ACME Communications. While Tribune-owned stations such as WGN-TV in Chicago, WPIX in New York City and KTLA in Los Angeles (along with most of the ACME stations) aired programming from The WB, they did not fit the standard definition of an owned-and-operated station. A similar exception existed when UPN launched in January 1995 by co-owners Chris-Craft and Viacom. Each of the companies owned a number of stations that aired the network. However, the stations were also not considered O&Os; under the initial standard definition. This ambiguity ended with Viacom's buyout of Chris-Craft's share of the network in 2000, which came not long after its merger with the previous CBS Corporation. The stations were referred to informally as UPN O&Os; (Chris- Craft later sold its stations to Fox Television Stations, the subsidiary of the then News Corporation that primarily operates Fox's O&Os;, in 2000). Following the shutdowns of UPN and The WB, CBS Corporation (former owner of UPN) and Warner Bros. Entertainment became co-owners of the new CW Television Network, which largely merged the programming from both networks onto the scheduling model used by The WB. The network launched in September 2006 on 11 UPN stations owned by CBS Corporation, and 15 WB affiliates owned by Tribune (which exchanged its ownership stake in The WB for affiliation agreements on most of its stations with the new CW network). Certain UPN and WB affiliates in markets where Tribune and CBS both owned stations carrying those networks either picked up a MyNetworkTV affiliation or became independent stations. The standard definition of an O&O; again does not apply to The CW (in this case, CBS Corporation owns some of the core CW outlets, while Time Warner does not own a CW station or any station beyond one), but the CBS-owned stations that carry the network may be referred to as \\"CW O&Os;\\". Some O&Os; choose to refer to themselves as \\"network-owned stations\\" instead, reflecting the fact that while they may be owned by a national network, much of the actual operation is usually left to the discretion of the local station. DistributionAsia- Pacific= facilities in Melbourne. Australia In Australia, Seven Network, Nine Network and Network Ten each own and operate stations in the five largest metropolitan areas (Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth and Adelaide). These television markets together account for two thirds of the country's population. In addition, Seven also owns and operates its local station in regional Queensland, and Nine owns and operates its station in Darwin. Nine also owns and operates NBN Television, based in Newcastle. The two national public broadcasters, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) and Special Broadcasting Service (SBS), own and operate all of their local stations. Japan In Japan, commercial terrestrial television is focused on five organizations, known alternatively by either the name of their flagship Tokyo station or a network name (usually branded as a \\"news network\\" although all of these organizations provide more than just news programming). The four largest of these – Nippon TV (NNN/NNS), Tokyo Broadcasting System (JNN), Fuji TV (FNN/FNS), and TV Asahi (ANN), two of four of them owned by major newspapers (Nippon TV by The Yomiuri Shimbun Holdings and TV Asahi by The Asahi Shimbun Company) and Tokyo Broadcasting System being highly affiliated with The Mainichi Newspapers Company, Ltd. despite the Mainichi's lack of ownership – each own and operate stations in the Tokyo, Keihanshin, Chukyo and Fukuoka metropolitan areas. These four television markets together account for more than half of the country's population. In addition, these four networks also own and operate some stations in other television markets. Most of the Japanese television stations outside the four flagship media markets have affiliates with one of those networks, therefore, they are not owned-and-operated stations. However, in the strict North American definition of \\"owned by the network\\", nearly all of those network affiliates would have been classified as owned-and-operated stations, since the networks (or in the case of Nippon TV, Tokyo Broadcasting System and TV Asahi, the newspapers who own/affiliated with them) has controlling shares in those stations. The smaller TV Tokyo (TXN) clearly owns and operates all of its local stations. The public broadcaster NHK operates two terrestrial channels, NHK General TV and NHK Educational TV. Both of these channels have some regional stations, all of which are owned and operated by NHK. Philippines In the Philippines, networks such as the former ABS-CBN, GMA Network, and 5 own and operate almost all their local television stations, although a few affiliates also exist. As regional stations simulcast/relay almost the entire programming lineup of their parent network's flagship station (usually based in Metro Manila), the terms \\"network\\", \\"station\\" and \\"channel\\" can in practice be used interchangeably to refer to either one. Even when a network's local station features programmes that deviate from the flagship station, viewers there may be able to see the flagship station through pay-TV operators. In addition, networks are often informally referred to using their flagship stations' terrestrial channel numbers. For example, ABS-CBN is referred to as \\"Channel 2\\" or \\"Dos\\", which corresponds to the assigned channel number of its Manila O&O; DWWX-TV. This is applicable even if a viewer receives the network on a different channel number (either because the viewer resides in a different viewing area or receives the channel through cable or satellite). =Europe=Germany ARD, one of Germany's public broadcasters, is actually an umbrella organisation made up of the different regional public broadcasters. This effectively renders ARD a case of where the regional stations own the network. One of ARD's channels, Das Erste, has exactly the same output across the country but each of the regional broadcasters contributes content to it. Meanwhile, each ARD-member broadcaster uses channel 3 to show its own output and lineup in the viewing areas they serve (although a common time exists for regional news bulletins at 19.30 and a simulcast of the national newscast Tagesschau at 20.00 Central European time). Within some regional broadcasters, further variations exist for the regional news bulletins. Viewers across Germany are able to view the different regional variations of channel 3 through free-to-air satellite, pay-TV subscription, or through the ARD media library available on ARD's website and mobile app. United Kingdom The ITV network is jointly owned by the owners of the local \\"Channel 3\\" stations throughout the United Kingdom, which since 2016 have been consolidated into two companies: ITV plc and STV Group plc. This means that officially, the stations own the network, rather than the network owning stations as is the case in most of the other countries listed here. However, since the 2004 creation of ITV plc, which since 2016 has owned and operated all of the Channel 3 licences serving England, Wales, southern Scotland, Northern Ireland and the Channel Islands, most of the operations of the network have been absorbed into that entity. Moreover, the separately owned station serving northern and central Scotland (STV) and the ITV plc-owned UTV often deviate significantly from the schedule of the ITV channel as programmed by ITV plc. As a result of this restructuring and other changes in the relationship between ITV and STV, the Channel 3 franchises owned by ITV plc could now be considered ITV owned-and-operated stations, with STV being comparable to an affiliate. From 1982 to 2010, a somewhat comparable situation existed for the fourth channel allocation, with Channel 4 broadcasting in England, Scotland, and Northern Ireland, and S4C, operated by a separate public authority, broadcasting in Wales. Until the digital switchover in Wales in 2010, S4C's analogue service broadcast primarily Welsh-language programming, along with English-language programming from Channel 4, often on delay. In this sense, S4C could be considered a Channel 4 affiliate, with Channel 4's operations in the rest of the UK being similar to an O&O.; Since the digital switchover, S4C has been a fully Welsh-language service, with Channel 4 available in Wales at all times on a separate digital channel. However, S4C has some ties to the BBC even as the latter does not own the former. The licence fee, which is primarily used to fund the BBC, also partly goes to S4C. S4C's main newscast, Newyddion, is broadcast from BBC Wales' studios. Some other BBC personalities like Huw Edwards also appear regularly on S4C. S4C is also available on the BBC's iPlayer for everyone in the UK. While BBC One has regional output, the BBC produces all such regional programmes itself, and in this sense all BBC \\"stations\\" are owned-and-operated; however, as with the ITV network, there are regional variations in scheduling on this channel between the component countries of the UK. BBC Two used to have a version for Scotland but on 17 February 2019, this variation was discontinued to make way for a new television channel entitled BBC Scotland (Scotland viewers now get the same version of BBC Two seen in England). Channel 4 offers regional advertising (as did Channel 5 until 2015), but otherwise there are currently no regional programming variations on those channels or on any other UK-wide television channels. Local Television Limited owns and operates several stations across major metro areas in the UK and is seen on Freeview channel 8. Compared to other established services, each of the owned and operated stations has more hours of content that caters to the viewing areas of such. Unlike in the US, O&Os; intended for a certain viewing area are viewable anywhere in the UK. O&Os; from other viewing areas are available on Sky and Freesat and the BBC's iPlayer allows users to select the region/viewing area they are interested in and will thus give them the corresponding BBC One feed. BBC Scotland and BBC Alba are available across the UK through the iPlayer. UTV, the ITV O&O; for Northern Ireland is available across the UK but users need to add this channel manually to their Sky or Freesat lineup. =Latin America=Argentina Argentina's public broadcaster Canal 7 owns and operates all of its stations. However, commercial broadcasters like Telefe and Canal 13 have private affiliates outside Buenos Aires. Brazil In Brazil, government regulations limit the amount of stations a television network can own. As a result, the five major television networks (Rede Globo, RecordTV, SBT, Rede Bandeirantes and RedeTV!) tend to have O&Os; only in the country's two largest cities, Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo, and rely heavily on affiliates to distribute the networks' programming to other areas of the country. Some markets (such as Brasilia, Belo Horizonte, Manaus, and Recife) also have O&Os; from one or more networks; for instance, Globo and RedeTV own and operate their stations in Recife, while SBT, RecordTV, and Rede Bandeirantes do not. Smaller television networks, including TV Cultura and TV Gazeta, typically only have one owned-and-operated station. Chile The major Chilean television networks currently own and operate all of their stations. Canal 13 had an affiliate in northern Chile, Telenorte, until it disaffiliated from the network in 1989. Mexico Due to the lack of an ownership cap in Mexico, some Mexican television networks own and operate all of their stations; a few media companies, such as Grupo Televisa and Azteca own multiple stations in several markets that each carry programming from the various networks that it also owns (or in the case of Televisa, shoehorn programs cherrypicked from its various networks onto one station). However, there are privately owned local stations that still exist, which broadcast programming originating from the stations located in Mexico City. Peru In 1974, Telecentro was created as a division of ENRAD (Empresa Nacional de Radiodifusión), a state controlled company used to operate all of the country's radio and television stations. However, private broadcasters still owned the broadcast stations. When satellite transmission links were introduced in Peru in 1989, many affiliates had become repeaters of the main stations based in Lima. =North America=Canada In Canada, due to the population being concentrated to fewer urban centres (compared to the United States), as well as more lenient policies regarding media ownership (for example, an ownership cap on television stations does not exist, except for within one media market), many television stations have become (or began operation as) O&Os.; For instance, CTV and Global currently own and operate an overwhelming majority of their local stations (most of which are located in major urban centres); the few affiliates are located in smaller regional markets like Lloydminster and Thunder Bay. CBC Television, with its role as the publicly funded broadcaster, has at least one O&O; in every single province, as well as CBC North serving the three territories as well as northern Quebec. While the majority of Canadians are served by CBC owned-and-operated stations, the CBC also has some privately owned affiliates, though the number has decreased over the years, particularly since the early 2000s. As of January 2017, no private CBC affiliates remain (the last such station disaffiliated in September 2016), and stations that have left the network since the mid-2000s have generally not been replaced. Indeed, the public broadcaster shut down most of its own TV rebroadcast transmitters in 2012, and now relies instead on cable and satellite carriage of its O&Os; in regions outside the largest markets. The CBC's main French-language network, Ici Radio-Canada Télé, is the only French- language network in Canada that has O&Os; located outside Quebec. The network maintains an O&O; in each province except in Atlantic Canada, where CBAFT (based in Moncton, New Brunswick) previously served the entire region via relay transmitters (and remains available on cable/satellite). The territories likewise now receive programming through cable/satellite carriage of out-of- province O&Os;, usually CBFT Montreal. The other two French-language networks – Noovo and TVA – only have O&Os; (and, for that matter, affiliates) within Quebec (privately owned Radio-Canada affiliates are only found within Quebec as well). Along with the major networks, some media conglomerates also run second-tier television systems (e.g., Rogers Media's Omni Television and Bell Media's CTV 2). These systems share the same parent companies as most of their local stations, and such stations can be considered O&Os; as well. For example, all of CTV Two's local stations are owned by Bell Media. On the other hand, Canwest's E! added a few private affiliates not owned by Canwest in Western Canada prior to its demise in 2009; those affiliates have since joined Rogers' Citytv network. United States In the United States, unlike Canada's O&O-heavy; geography, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) currently mandates that the total number of television stations owned by any company (including a television network) can only reach a maximum market coverage of 39% of the country. Given this restriction, television networks only have O&Os; in a fraction of the 210 designated market areas around the country (the remainder of the markets are served by affiliates that are owned by other media companies). Periodically, networks may sell O&Os; to comply with this FCC restriction. O&Os; tend to be found in large urban centers such as New York City, Los Angeles, and Chicago, and other markets that are typically among the 10 largest in the U.S. (such as the San Francisco Bay Area, Dallas–Fort Worth, Philadelphia, and Houston), although they have also been found in markets as small as Green Bay, Wisconsin (DMA #69, 2006–07) and Toledo, Ohio (DMA #76, 1995–2011) in the past. Some networks (such as Ion Television) and non-commercial religious television networks (such as the Trinity Broadcasting Network and Daystar) own the vast majority of their stations, with only a few privately owned outlets carrying their programming (in the case of TBN and Daystar, both networks own their stations directly and through subsidiary licensees, such as Community Educational Television for TBN and Word of God Fellowship for Daystar). Owned-and-operated stations used to be common in the days of network radio, however beginning in the 1980s, these radio networks began to be broken up. For all intents and purposes, NBC no longer exists as a radio network, beyond brand licensing and distribution agreements with Dial Global for NBC Sports Radio content. ABC was previously non-existent as well, until 2015 when it relaunched an in-house radio network after Cumulus Media Networks, the then-owners and distributors of the ABC News Radio brand, replaced the ABC News brand with Westwood One News (via CNN). CBS's radio stations are now a separate company (CBS Radio) from its broadcast service. In the late 1990s, the original CBS Radio Network was reassigned to then-corporate sibling Westwood One via a series of complicated transactions, absorbing the former Mutual and the original NBC Radio (which General Electric spun off in 1987 after its merger with RCA) in the process. Westwood One was spun off in 2007 and merged into Dial Global in 2011, with the new company taking on the Westwood One name. Today, CBS maintains separate distribution agreements between Westwood One (for CBS Radio News and its sports play-by- play packages, most notably the NFL and the NCAA) and Cumulus Media (for CBS Sports Radio). However, new radio networks have cropped up with their own owned-and-operated networks. iHeartMedia owns many stations in the top 100 U.S. markets, and in turn feeds them with programming, either from corporate subsidiary Premiere Radio Networks or via internal distribution; in particular, this is done with their talk radio station portfolio. Voicetracking purposes are handled either by internal methods or through their Premium Choice format menus, the latter of which is geared towards small and medium-market stations with air talent selected from stations in larger markets. Cumulus Media often does the same with its own stations and broadcast service known as Cumulus Media Networks. The Walt Disney Company, which sold off ABC Radio in 2007 to Citadel Broadcasting (which was merged into Cumulus in 2011) still owns two networks, ESPN Radio and Radio Disney. ESPN has only a few owned-and-operated stations in mostly major markets, but almost all of Radio Disney's outlets were owned by Disney itself prior to its transition to a mainly digitally distributed service in 2014 (leaving Los Angeles flagship KDIS as the network's only remaining O&O; until 2017, when it became affiliated with spin-off network Radio Disney Country). Most religious radio networks, such as Salem Communications, Moody Radio, the Bible Broadcasting Network, and Air 1/K-Love, own and operate all of their stations. The Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) is not allowed to own or operate any of its stations by way of its ownership model, as its individual member stations own the network instead. Branding WABC-TV's news vehicle. The circle 7 logo seen here is also used on other ABC O&Os; broadcasting on channel 7. A network's O&Os; often share similar branding elements among themselves, reinforcing their common identity as stations owned by the same network; for example, a common shared element among O&O; stations involves identifying themselves by combining the name of their parent network with the station's channel number (such as \\"CBS 2,\\" which is uniformally used by CBS O&Os; KCBS- TV in Los Angeles, WCBS-TV in New York City and WBBM-TV in Chicago), which started to become a normal mode of branding in the mid-1990s (beforehand, O&Os; of certain networks – such as CBS and NBC – incorporated the network's logo into their own while verbally being referred under a more genericized channel branding). This kind of sharing may also present some savings to the parent network (i.e., the owner), as its O&Os; can use the same graphics and music rather than to have each station commission their own individual branding package. Examples include the circle 7 logo (originally designed in 1962 for ABC's aforementioned O&Os;, all of which at the time had broadcast on VHF channel 7) and the \\"I Love Chicago (Chicago My Home)\\" musical signature for local newscasts (originally used by WBBM-TV, and later spread to other CBS O&Os;). Fox also has a set of branding guidelines for both its O&Os; and affiliates. Supposedly, NBC and ABC also have branding guidelines for its affiliates, but not as extreme as CBS or Fox; since the 2013–14 season, however, when ABC unveiled an updated version of its logo, all of the network's affiliates are now required to use the ABC circle logo as a part of the station's own logo, which must additionally be approved by the network for use. Networks in Canada took corporate branding to its logical conclusion; references to local call signs and channel numbers have almost completely been eliminated from the O&Os; except during station sign-on and sign-off sequences (although some O&Os; may occasionally refer to their channel numbers in passing). In the UK, the similar O&O; branding elements are prevalent in the continuity sequences, especially when a national BBC News bulletin on BBC One is introduced. In here the regional announcer tells viewers \\"This is BBC One [name of region]\\", as well who will present the national and regional news bulletin. The fonts and graphics styles used in the national news bulletins are mirrored in the regional news bulletins. The format and order of segments of the regional bulletins are almost exactly the same as each other. This is also applicable to the weather segments. In Sweden where Sveriges Television (SVT) owns and operates all its stations, the regional news programme segments have identical graphics elements to each other and to the main national programmes they are either part of (e.g. Morgonstudion) or follow (e.g. Rapport and Aktuellt). For instance, during Morgonstudion, rather than a in- studio presenter stepping in to present the regional news, that segment is a montage of the top regional news reports. Currently, other television station groups (such as Hearst Television) also implement common branding practices among its stations (even when affiliated with different networks). Some of the branding elements are now used by stations that are not O&Os; or even affiliates of a certain network (such as Sunbeam Television's WHDH in Boston and WSVN in Miami using a variation of the circle 7 logo, and ABC affiliate KCRG-TV in Cedar Rapids, Iowa using CBS' \\"I Love Chicago\\" motif). Likewise, network affiliates may also license graphics packages for use on their newscasts and imaging from their networks to reduce the costs of licensing imaging from other parties; though it has been reduced in usage than in the past, many affiliate stations also license the network's imaging for their entertainment program and news promotions. Nonetheless, such practices and elements can still be traced back to the O&Os;, which represented the earliest television station groups under common ownership, before the emergence and proliferation of national station ownership groups in the subsequent decades. Ties to the networks and sister O&Os; 9 Channel Nine Court, home to both CTV's network operations and Toronto O&O; CFTO-DT. Positions at network O&Os; are frequently sought after by those who wish to eventually work for a television network. Indeed, many O&Os; have served as a stepping stone for television personalities at their parent networks. For example, former Today and NBC Nightly News presenter Tom Brokaw used to work for NBC's Los Angeles O&O;, KNBC, before moving to the network while Matt Lauer and Al Roker worked for NBC's flagship O&O; in New York City, WNBC-TV, before becoming hosts on Today. Additionally, Roker had begun his career with NBC at former O&O; WKYC- TV in Cleveland, known as a \\"farm station\\" which developed talent for the larger O&O; stations and network (although, until after it ended following Multimedia's purchase of controlling interest in the station in 1990, this strategy left WKYC as a longtime also-ran in the Cleveland market due to heavy staff turnover). Another example is BBC London News presenter Emily Maitlis, who joined BBC News 24 and BBC Two's Newsnight in 2006. Although working at an O&O; does not guarantee a network job down the line, the on-air presenter or correspondent does potentially receive additional exposure to the network and often a larger audience given that O&Os; are often found in the largest media markets. Presenters and other staff at the O&Os; also occasionally take on duties at the network level, alongside their existing capacities at the local level. For example, several local anchors at CTV's O&Os; have filled in for Lloyd Robertson in the past on the network's national newscast CTV National News; and weathercasters from CTV's Toronto and Vancouver O&Os; (CFTO-DT and CIVT-DT, respectively) present the weather segments on CTV News Channel. A number of personalities at New York City radio and television stations have also done assignments for both a station and a parent network at the same time, due to their proximity to network studios and offices. Likewise, presenters from the network appear on some of their O&O; stations' local news bulletins. For instance in the UK, the ITV Lunchtime News presenter also presents the ITV News London bulletin that immediately follows. Another example is BBC's Breakfast, which broadcasts from Media City Salford Quays, the home of BBC North West (serving greater Manchester and Liverpool); BBC North West Tonight Presenter Roger Johnson presents some Sunday editions of Breakfast. Parts of a network's operations may also be co-located with one or more of its O&Os.; For example, production of Global's national newscast Global National is controlled from its Vancouver O&O; CHAN-DT, while CTV's network headquarters are co-located with CFTO at 9 Channel Nine Court in Scarborough, Ontario (the address refers to CFTO's over-the-air channel number). NBC's national network operations in both New York City and Los Angeles are housed in the same facilities as their local stations in the respective cities, WNBC and KNBC, and both of these O&Os; are considered flagship stations of the network (conversely, NBC's affiliate news service NBC News Channel is based out of the studios of WCNC-TV in Charlotte, North Carolina, which the network maintains an affiliation with but has never owned). Moreover, NBC's Washington O&O;, WRC-TV, also houses the network's Washington bureau from which Meet the Press and some MSNBC programmes originate from. In the UK, some BBC regional offices (e.g. BBC Bristol, BBC Wales/Cymru, BBC Scotland) are credited for producing some BBC programmes like Dr Who, Question Time, and Bargain Hunt and BBC's flagship morning programme Breakfast shares the same studio as BBC's Northwest Tonight, the BBC's newscast for the region encompassing Manchester, Liverpool, and surrounding areas. In Germany, some programmes that air on ARD's national channel Das Erste are produced by regional stations that are members of the ARD network. The co-location of network facilities at O&Os; may also facilitate the production of promo shoots that feature both an O&O; show and a network show. For instance, the lead presenters of an O&O;'s late-night news show may shoot a promo in the same studio with the host of the parent network's late-night talk show. Similarly, a network's offices may thus also show along the corridors promotional posters/billboards for the programmes of the O&O; station co-located with it. In the US, during the early stages of breaking news in an O&O;'s market that may be of potential national interest, its sister O&Os; elsewhere may rely on a correspondent working for the former to provide on-air updates. In addition, the news websites of major networks have local news sections and rely on their O&Os; for that. Likewise, the ABC News app on Apple TV has a local news section with video reports prepared by its different O&Os.; In connection, the O&Os; share their content on each other's website (e.g. content originating from KABC-TV Los Angeles are occasionally posted on WABC-TV New York). Ownership and network changes In general, an O&O; is very unlikely to experience changes in its ownership, since it is often a significant source of revenue for its owner; and since its owner is also its parent network, the chances for an O&O; to ever switch networks are also rather low – unless the station is, on the rare chance, sold to another network. However, in instances where the network finds an O&O; to be no longer financially viable, it may choose to sell the station to a new owner or, in severe cases, simply close the station. Even profitable O&Os; might be sold off, often as a result (or in anticipation) of mergers and corporate deals, especially ones which put the network over the ownership limit in its local jurisdiction (e.g., the aforementioned 39% ownership cap in the United States imposed by the FCC). In addition, a network might decide to sell some of its O&Os; and use the money raised to (at least temporarily) alleviate financial problems. Depending on the new owner, the station might continue to carry programming from the same network, affiliate with another network, or even become another network's O&O.; The following are examples of transactions involving O&Os;: =Australia= * STW-9 in Perth and QTQ-9 in Brisbane became O&Os; of the Nine Network in 1987, when the parent company of both stations, Bond Media (headed by Alan Bond), purchased the network. After that company's collapse, STW-9 was sold to Sunraysia Television and remained a Nine Network affiliate; it later came under the ownership of WIN Television until Nine Entertainment Co. bought the station in 2013, and turned STW-9 into a Nine O&O; once again. QTQ-9, meanwhile, always remained a Nine O&O; during that time. * NEW-10 in Perth signed on the air in 1988 as a Network Ten O&O.; However, the station was sold off the next year as the network faced financial problems. The network – under CanWest Global ownership – re-acquired the station in 1995, and NEW-10 has remained a Ten O&O; ever since. =Canada= \\"We can get rid of this baby!\\" CKVU-TV's Joe Leary takes the Global mike flag off his microphone on the station's last day as a Global O&O.; * CKVU-TV in Vancouver was purchased by CanWest Global in 1988, subsequently becoming part of that company's CanWest Global System (renamed the Global Television Network in 1997, as part of a national expansion of that brand outside what became the new network's Paris, Ontario flagship CIII-TV). However, in 2000, CanWest purchased the television stations of Western International Communications (WIC), which included CHAN-TV in Vancouver and CHEK-TV in Victoria. The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) does not allow any single company to own more than two stations serving the same market that broadcast in the same language; as a result, Global had to sell one of the stations. It opted to keep CHAN as that station had much higher ratings than CKVU, as well as a network of rebroadcasters that reach 97% of British Columbia. CKVU was eventually sold to CHUM Limited, and became part of the Citytv television system (now simply known as City, which has since been re- classified as a television network). * After purchasing the WIC stations, Canwest started a parallel system, first known as CH, and later as E!, for the WIC stations in areas overlapping existing Global stations (such as the aforementioned CHEK). However, in the midst of financial difficulties, Canwest stated in 2009 that \\"a second conventional TV network [was] no longer key to the long-term success\\" of the company, and the five E! O&Os; subsequently faced various outcomes: CHCH-TV in Hamilton and CJNT-TV in Montreal were sold to Channel Zero and were converted into independent stations; CHBC-TV in Kelowna became a Global owned-and-operated station; CHCA-TV in Red Deer closed down on August 31, 2009; and CHEK-TV in Victoria was sold to a consortium of station employees and local investors for $2, and now operates as an independent station. * Shortly after purchasing the Global network following Canwest's bankruptcy in 2010, Shaw Communications realigned a small station it already owned, CTV affiliate CJBN-TV in Kenora, with Global. However, the station retained its local branding and continued to be managed by Shaw's Kenora cable operation. When Shaw sold its Shaw Media arm to Corus Entertainment in 2016, CJBN was not included in the sale. (See Appendix in Doc1 - Cover Letter, which does not list CJBN as one of the licences being transferred) CJBN thus transitioned from a Global O&O; to an affiliate; however, both Shaw and Corus are controlled by the family of JR Shaw, which means that CJBN was thereafter considered a de facto Global O&O.; Shaw ultimately decided to close CJBN entirely later in 2016. =United States= * In December 1993, the National Football League awarded Fox the broadcast contract to televise games from the National Football Conference. As a result, it agreed to purchase a 20% stake in New World Communications. Many of the television stations that were owned by New World were located in major NFC markets, and switched to Fox between September 1994 and September 1996 (including two – WGHP in Greensboro, North Carolina and WBRC in Birmingham, Alabama – that ended up being turned over to a blind trust before they were acquired by Fox directly, due to ownership conflicts caused by New World's concurrent purchases of stations owned by Citicasters and Argyle Communications). New World Communications would be acquired by Fox in July 1996, making them owned-and-operated stations when the merger was finalized in January 1997. * In July 1994, Westinghouse Broadcasting (also known as Group W), the broadcasting division of Westinghouse, announced a deal to affiliate three of its stations with CBS. While WBZ-TV in Boston and WJZ-TV in Baltimore switched to CBS (from NBC and ABC, respectively) on January 2, 1995, the affiliation swap involving KYW-TV was delayed in Philadelphia when it was discovered that a cash sale of WCAU to NBC would have resulted in huge taxes that were required to be paid on top of it. NBC traded ownership of KCNC-TV in Denver, Colorado, KUTV in Salt Lake City, Utah and the VHF channel 4 allocation in Miami to Group W to solve the problem, with the two O&O; swaps and the Miami channel swap taking place on September 10 of that year. Westinghouse merged with CBS in August 1995, resulting in these stations becoming owned-and-operated by CBS, with Group W becoming CBS Corporation by early 1997 (KUTV would later be sold to Four Points Media Group in 2008). As a result of the merger, CBS was required to sell former ABC affiliate WPRI in Providence, Rhode Island (which was sold to CBS in the spring of 1995 and swapped affiliations with WLNE-TV on the day the affiliation swap was completed) due to a significant signal overlap with WBZ-TV. ** In December 2015, NBC announced it would not renew its affiliation with Sunbeam Television-owned affiliate WHDH (which gained its affiliation as part of the aforementioned Group W/CBS affiliation deal in an affiliation swap with WBZ- TV) once its affiliation contract with the network expired on December 31, 2016. Initially, NBCUniversal wanted to transfer NBC network programming to WNEU-TV, which had a decent signal that covered the New Hampshire portion of the market, but was only receivable over-the-air in the northern areas of Boston. Sunbeam's owner, Ed Ansin, told the Boston Globe that \\"No network has elected to give up such a strong station and go to a startup station,\\" after having disclosed that he had rejected a $200 million offer to sell WHDH to NBC in September 2015, leading the network to threaten to shift its programming to WNEU; however, he still predicted that NBC would remain on channel 7. NBCUniversal later announced that it would acquire Telemundo affiliate WTMU-LD (which would change its callsign to WBTS-LD) in August 2016 after its attempt to purchase Ion O&O; WBPX-TV failed; the sale of WTMU would be completed in November of that year. On October 18, 2017, NBC agreed to purchase WYCN-CD, a Nashua, New Hampshire-based Class A station that had also sold its frequency rights as part of the spectrum auction. Previous owner OTA Broadcasting then entered into a channel sharing agreement with the WGBH Educational Foundation to carry WYCN-CD's signal over WGBX-TV to serve as the full market simulcast for WBTS-LD once NBC acquired WYCN's license. The sale of WYCN-CD to NBC was completed on January 18, 2018; On August 8, 2019, WBTS and WYCN swapped call signs, with channel 8 becoming WYCN-LD and channel 15 changing to WBTS- CD.WBTS-CD Call Sign HistoryWYCN-LD Call Sign History On August 31, 2019, WYCN-LD shut down its RF channel 46 transmitter; that October, it moved to channel 36, relocated its transmitter to Norton, Massachusetts, switched from NBC to Telemundo, and changed its city of license to Providence, leaving WBTS- CD as Boston's sole NBC station.

Bennett.[http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/whi/fullRecord.asp?id=8119 WHS Image ID 8119] Henry Hamilton Bennett (January 15, 1843 – January 1, 1908) was a photographer famous for his pictures of the Dells of the Wisconsin River and surrounding region taken between 1865 and 1908. The popularity of his photographs helped turn the city of Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin into a major tourist destination. Early life H. H. Bennett was born in Farnham, Lower Canada, but was raised in Brattleboro, Vermont. In 1857, at the age of 14, Bennett moved with his father and uncle to Wisconsin. The group settled in Kilbourn City, today known as Wisconsin Dells, and Henry worked as a carpenter in the town. After the outbreak of the American Civil War, Bennett joined the army and fought in the Battle of Vicksburg before being severely wounded by the accidental discharge of his own gun. After the war, the wound prevented Bennett from returning to carpentry, so in 1865 he bought the Kilbourn City photography studio operated by Leroy Gates and began a career as a photographer. Shortly afterward, in 1866, he married Francis Douty, and the couple eventually had three children. Later, after Francis died (in 1884), he remarried Evaline Marshall in 1890. Due to the low demand for portraits in the area, Bennett set his sights on landscape photography. His training as a carpenter served him well. Bennett made all of his own equipment except for the glass lenses in his cameras. He built himself a portable darkroom, and then towed it, his camera, and other necessary equipment with him across the local countryside taking pictures. He didn't have to go far to find impressive scenery, for the Wisconsin River Dells, a gorge with numerous sandstone formations, was just outside Kilbourn City. Bennett loaded a boat with his photographic equipment and took many pictures of the Dells. Realizing that the three-dimensional aspect of the rock formations would be lost in two- dimensional photographs, he began creating stereoscopic images that allowed viewers to see the Dells in three dimensions. Bennett made his first stereoscopic photo in 1868, and they soon became very popular, being sold in cities across the United States. Innovations in photography Image showing Bennett's son, Ashley, leaping across Stand Rock in Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin. The image was used as proof that Bennett's advanced shutter technology worked. As people across the country saw more and more of Bennett's photographs of the Wisconsin Dells, they began to flock to Kilbourn City to see the rock formations in person. The area quickly became a destination for sightseers eager to leave behind the bustle of the city. Bennett capitalized on this, building the H. H. Bennett Studio in 1875 and using it to sell postcards and souvenir portraits to travelers. In the meantime, he continued to innovate in the field of photography by inventing a stop action shutter which allowed him to take photographs of instantaneous events. Previously, it took several minutes for a camera to take a picture, and any movement of the subject being photographed over this time caused the picture to become blurry. After Bennett created the new shutter, he was able to take clear pictures of moving subjects. The best known photograph taken by Bennett with this device was an 1886 image of his son Ashley jumping between two rock formations in the Dells. Boston audiences of 1890 gasped when this photograph was projected as a magic lantern slide. Bennett also introduced narrative concepts, as noted by his great-granddaughter, Betsy Reese Grant, in The Bennett Story: :From 1832 until 1890, every spring saw raftsmen riding their lumber to market down the Wisconsin River. Bennett had always been interested in taking a series of pictures of their activities. In 1886 dry plates had finally become reliable enough that he did not need his portable darkroom. Henry and his son Ashley made a 100-mile, week-long trip on a lumber raft. Between Kilbourn and Boscobel, Wisconsin, he took 30 pictures of the raftsmen's different activities. He then combined these with other pictures taken near Kilbourn and called the series, The Story of Raftsmen's Life on the Wisconsin. This was the first time a photographer wrote a \\"story\\" with pictures. Photo journalism was born.*Reese, Betsy. The Bennett Story: The Life and Work of Henry Hamilton Bennett. H.H. Bennett Studio Foundation, Inc., 1991. Bennett also innovated in the way he printed pictures, building a revolving solar printing house that is now housed at the Smithsonian Institution. In addition, because early cameras were unable to accurately capture details of the sky or reflections in water after being adjusted for the light of a typical land photograph, Bennett wove together negatives from multiple photographs of land, sky and water before creating a final print. Bennett received much attention for his advanced techniques, and was commissioned by the Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul Railroad to photograph the landscape along the company's track in Wisconsin. Bennett also took pictures outside the state, photographing an ice palace in St. Paul, Minnesota and the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, Illinois. Finally, Bennett photographed the huge circular paintings known as cycloramas, publishing sets of stereoviews on the Civil War cycloramas of the Battles of Shiloh, Gettysburg and Missionary Ridge, the engagement between the Monitor and the Virginia, as well as the Crucifixion. Bennett's studio As portable film cameras became widespread in the 1890s, Bennett's career declined somewhat because tourists coming to see the Dells were able to take their own souvenir photos and no longer needed Bennett's postcards or portraits. Nevertheless, Bennett pressed on in his profession, selling gift shop type items from his studio to attract more customers and continuing as a professional landscape photographer until his death in 1908. Following his death, Bennett's family took over the photography studio, remodeling it in 1917. His descendants continued to operate the studio until 1999, when the building was restored to its 1908 appearance and became a historic site operated by the Wisconsin Historical Society.

Written by Ben Edlund and directed by Vern Gillum, it was originally broadcast on April 28, 2004 on the WB network. In \\"Time Bomb\\", Illyria rescues Gunn from the hell dimension he entered in penance for his role in Fred's death. While Angel negotiates a contract between a group of demons and a pregnant woman whose unborn child the demons believe to be their Messiah, Illyria begins uncontrollably looping through time, until Wesley shunts her excess power into another dimension. This is a crucial episode in the Illyria arc, because Team Angel are able to diminish her powers until she can only help them and can no longer destroy the Earth. Plot The episode opens with Gunn still being tortured by a demon in a hell dimension, when he is suddenly rescued by Illyria, who uses her ability to shift between dimensions to return them both to Wolfram & Hart. Gunn enters Wesley's office, and both have so much emotional baggage, they are uncertain how to behave. Wesley acknowledges that he should apologize for stabbing him earlier but is unsure how as he feels it would just be awkward. Gunn replies he isn't looking for an apology and he probably wouldn't accept one anyway, adding that his torture in the hell dimension was much worse. Meanwhile, Angel grows suspicious of Illyria's continued presence at the Firm, and concludes that she is staying not out of loyalty, but because of an attraction to the Firm's power. He orders Lorne to shadow her, and then turns his attention to a legal case involving a ceremonial demon pact. A pregnant woman named Amanda has agreed to allow a demonic cult called \\"the Fell Brethren\\" to adopt her baby, and Angel and Gunn start to advise her until they learn, to their outrage, that their client isn't the innocent woman, but rather the seemingly benevolent demons who are secretly taking advantage of her and planning to sacrifice the child on the eve of its 13th birthday. Meanwhile, Illyria enjoys sparring with Spike in the training room, perhaps because he does not kowtow to her, and is even learning to adapt to her fighting techniques, but she begins to act oddly even by her standards, and Wesley theorizes that she is growing emotionally and molecularly unstable as a result of her interdimensional travels. He realizes that if her energy excess continues to go unchecked, it will result in a catastrophic explosion. As Angel, Gunn, and Hamilton argue over how to handle the Fell Brethren case, Illyria grows increasingly disoriented and paranoid, culminating in a confrontation in which she effortlessly kills Angel, Lorne, Spike, and Wesley in a matter of seconds. At this point, the narrative switches to her point of view, and it is revealed that Illyria's disorientation has been caused by the fact that her excessive mystical energy has been sending her uncontrollably back and forth in time. Illyria again goes back in time to a point before she had killed the other characters, and she inadvertently begins taking Angel with her on her trips through time. Angel learns of the deaths of his friends and is horrified. After Illyria gives him advice about power, she explodes and likely decimates the continental shelf, but the explosion is so powerful it blasts Angel back in time to before Illyria killed everyone. This time, thanks to what Illyria told him, Angel is able to disrupt Illyria's attack and avoid the massacre. Illyria accuses Angel and Wesley of plotting to kill her with Wesley's massive ray gun, but Wes reveals that the gun is not meant to kill her, but rather to disperse her excessive energy and thus prevent the fatal explosion. Spike briefly holds his own fighting Illyria until she uses her time control powers on him, giving Wesley the chance to activate the ray in time. Illyria is left emotionally devastated by the resulting loss of some of her super powers. Angel returns his attention to the Fell Brethren case, and shocks Gunn by agreeing to represent the demons rather than the blithely naïve pregnant woman, having apparently taken Illyria's advice about power. Acting The role of Amanda was played by Jaime Bergman, David Boreanaz's wife. Of the experience, Boreanaz says, \\"[it was] great to have her come on to the show, and have our son look at that, and see the two of us actually play opposite one another for a brief moment.\\" He adds, \\"We had fun with it. It was nothing too serious, it was just a small little role, a laugh.\\" Production details J. Sherman compares the scene in which Illyria descends into hell to rescue Gunn as a \\"riff on the Orpheus theme\\". =Arc significance= Illyria's statement to Angel about how to win a war helps Angel to form his plan against Wolfram & Hart. It begins in the final scene, where he appears to forfeit the unborn child, but is not fully revealed until \\"Power Play\\". His plan ends in \\"Not Fade Away\\" when Angel and his team go up against the Circle of the Black Thorn. Critical response Writing for The A.V. Club, Noel Murray writes that he finds two important issues for this episode: first, \\"Illyria's worldview sounds so persuasive: Raw self-interest is so much easier than trying to adhere to some kind of impossibly complicated code of behavior,\\" and, second, \\"its structure\\": ReferencesExternal links * * Category:Angel (season 5) episodes Category:2004 American television episodes Category:Television episodes about time travel Category:Television episodes about multiple time paths ","title":"Time Bomb (Angel)"},{"id":"2477501","text":"Jean Doré (12 December 1944 – 15 June 2015) was a Canadian politician and mayor of the City of Montreal, Quebec. Background Doré studied law at the Université de Montréal, where he was president of the student union from 1967 to 1968. He received a Master's Degree of Political Science from McGill University. In the early seventies Doré became a founding member of the progressive Montreal Citizens' Movement (MCM), also known as Rassemblement des citoyens et citoyennes de Montréal (RCM) in French, where he started as treasurer and eventually became party leader in 1982. From 1972 to 1975, Doré was director of the Fédération des associations d'économie familiale. He hosted a consumer affairs show on the Radio-Quebec public television network. He was briefly a press attaché for René Lévesque who would later become Premier of Quebec. Prior to his mayoral tenure, Doré worked as a lawyer for the Confédération des syndicats nationaux (CSN) - the Confederation of National Trade Unions (CNTU). Leader of the Opposition In 1982 Doré was selected as the MCM candidate for Mayor of Montreal. He finished second with 36% of the vote, against incumbent Jean Drapeau (48%), giving Drapeau his stiffest competition in years. Fifteen candidates of the MCM were elected to City Hall. Doré won a by-election in 1984 and became city councillor for the district of Saint-Jean-Baptiste, as well as Leader of the Opposition. Mayor of Montreal Drapeau retired in 1986. By this time, Drapeau's Civic Party was increasingly seen as tired and unfocused after a quarter-century in power. The MCM took control of the city in a landslide victory. Doré won the mayoral race in a rout with 68% of the vote, while 55 MCM candidates out of 58 were elected to council. He was re-elected in 1990 with 59% of the vote. City Councillor Marvin Rotrand said the Doré era was most notable for a more democratic manner of administration than that of Drapeau. As mayor, he oversaw the renewal of the Old Port and the parks and beaches of Île Ste-Hélène. He also inaugurated Place Émilie-Gamelin (known informally as Berri Square), Place Charles de Gaulle and the archaeology museum at Pointe-à-Callière. Under Doré, 150 kilometres of bike paths were constructed, as well as several parks and public beaches, including on Île-Notre-Dame the Plage Jean-Doré. During his administration, the first public commissions of city council were established and the city's first master urban plan was adopted. However, Doré was also criticized for an ineffective style of government, including lax policies toward city employees, as well as an unwillingness to pay down the massive debt from Drapeau's megaprojects. As well, some left-wing members of the MCM, including councillors Sam Boskey and Marvin Rotrand, quit his party after the Overdale scandal to form the Democratic Coalition of Montreal (DCM), also known as Coalition démocratique de Montréal (CDM) in French. First political retirement In 1994 Doré received only 32% of the vote and was defeated by Vision Montreal candidate Pierre Bourque (47%). He could have taken a seat on the city council after winning his election in the district of Plateau-Mont- Royal with 46% of the ballots, but retired in favor of running mate Thérèse Daviau. Attempt at a comeback Doré tried to make a political comeback in 1998. He founded Équipe Montréal (Team Montreal), a new party, and ran for mayor. However, he gathered only 10% of the vote and finished fourth. Two candidates of TM were elected to the city council, but they eventually sat as Independents, and the party ceased to exist shortly before the 2001 election.Une opposition divisée, Radio-Canada, 6 January 2000 Post politics Doré left public life and became senior director of business development for the central Caisse Desjardins.

It is the district capital of the Otjiwarongo electoral constituency and also the capital of Otjozondjupa. Otjiwarongo is situated in central-north Namibia on the TransNamib railway. It is the biggest business centre for Otjozondjupa Region. Otjiwarongo is located on the B1 road and its links between Windhoek, the Golden Triangle of Otavi, Tsumeb and Grootfontein, and Etosha National Park. It is one of Namibia's fast-growing towns, with a neat and peaceful quality environment, and many excellent facilities including supermarkets, banks, lodges and hotels. Some of Namibia's best-known private game farms and nature reserves are located in and around the town. Otjiwarongo is one of Namibia's towns with a large population of German-speaking people. German influence is also evident in its Germanic buildings. The school \\"Donatus School Otjiwarongo\\" (D.S.O.) was once known as \\"Deutsche Schule Otjiwarongo\\". History The San and Damaras where the first settlers of the area, the Damaras from the /Geio-Daman clan lived in the area from as early as 1390. The Damaras also named the city #kanubes. German Namibians first settled in Otjiwarongo in 1900. A bloody war was fought in the area between the Hereros and the Germans in 1904 where many of the Herero people died. This happened sometime before Otjiwarongo was established as an administration point for the Germans and officially became a town. A narrow-gauge railway was built from Swakopmund on the coast, to the Otavi copper mine which helped Otjiwarongo become a prosperous agricultural centre. The three tribes where separated like in many of Namibia's towns, where each lived in a separate neighborhood: Ovambo Location, Damara Location and Herero Location respectively. The three locations together made up the suburb of Orwetoveni. Economy and infrastructureTransport= Class Hd Locomotive no. 41 plinthed at Otjiwarongo railway station Otjiwarongo has a well-developed road network. It is situated at the junction of the national road B1 that passes north-south through all of Namibia, the C38 to Outjo and further into Kunene Region in Namibia's north-west, and the C33 to Karibib, connecting the coastal towns of Swakopmund and Walvis Bay. Roads in town are likewise well-maintained, making Otjiwarongo one of the few Namibian towns that has tarred roads even in the townships.

Overview  The two most populous groups are: * Highland (or Sierra) Otomí, living in the mountains of La Huasteca. They usually self-identify as Ñuhu or Ñuhmu, depending on the dialect they speak. * Mezquital Otomí, living in the Mezquital Valley in the eastern part of the state of Hidalgo, and in the state of Querétaro. They self-identify as Hñähñu ().See Wright Carr (2005). Otomi woman selling traditional Otomi embroidered cloths in Tequisquiapan Smaller Otomi populations exist in the states of Puebla, Mexico, Tlaxcala, Michoacán and Guanajuato.Lastra (2006) The Otomi language belonging to the Oto-Pamean branch of the Oto-Manguean language family is spoken in many different varieties, some of which are not mutually intelligible. One of the early complex cultures of Mesoamerica, the Otomi were likely the original inhabitants of the central Mexican Altiplano before the arrival of Nahuatl speakers around CE, who replaced and marginalized them. However, the Otomi's nomadic lifestyle allowed them to easily adapt to different environments, avoid enemies and defend traditional lands and villages. In the early colonial New Spain period, Yųhmų Otomi of Tlaxcala helped the Spanish conquistadors as mercenaries and allies, allowing them to extend into territories such as Querétaro and Guanajuato, previously inhabited by semi-nomadic Chichimecs. The Otomi traditionally worshipped the moon as their highest deity. Even in modern times, many Otomi populations practice shamanism and hold prehispanic beliefs such as Nagualism. Like most sedentary Mesoamerican peoples, Otomis traditionally subsisted on maize, beans and squash, but the maguey (century plant) was also an important cultigen used for production of alcohol (pulque) and fiber (henequen). Although the Otomi Indians rarely eat what Westerners would consider a balanced diet, they maintain reasonably good health by eating tortillas, drinking pulque, and eating most fruits available around them. In 1943 to 1944, a report about a nutritional study about the Otomi villages located in the Mezquital Valley of Mexico, recorded that despite the arid climate and land unfit for agriculture without irrigation, the Otomi people chiefly depended on the production of maguey. Maguey (century plant) is used to produce weaving fibers and “pulque”, a fermented unfiltered juice that played an important part in the Otomi’s economy and nutrition. However, this practice has begun to decline due to its new large-scale production. The maguey plant was so heavily depended on that huts were constructed out of the plant's leaves. During this time, most of the region was vastly underdeveloped and most agriculture was low-yielding. Often densely settled areas would be confused as locations devoid of habitation, as dispersed dwellings are built low and concealed. The Otomi were blacksmiths and traded valuable metal items with other indigenous confederations, including the Aztec Triple Alliance. Their metal crafts included ornaments and weaponry, although metal weaponry was not as useful as obsidian weaponry (obsidian being sharper than a modern-day razor, abundant, and light in weight).  History  Some historians believe that the Otomi were the first inhabitants of the Valley of Mexico, nevertheless they were later expelled from the valley by the Tepanec in 1418. The Otomi were one of various ethnic groups present within the city of Teotihuacán; one of the largest and most important cities of ancient Mexico. Around the year 1100 AD, Otomi-speaking peoples formed their capital city-state, Xaltocan. Xaltocan soon acquired power--enough power to demand tribute from nearby communities up until its subjugation. Thereafter, the Otomi kingdom was conquered during the 14th century by the Mexica and its alliances. The Otomi people then were subject to pay a tribute to the Triple-Alliance as their empire grew; subsequently, Otomi people resettled in lands to the east and south of their former territory. While some Otomi resettled elsewhere, other Otomi still resided near current- day Mexico City, but most settled in areas near the Mezquital Valley in Hidalgo, the highlands of Puebla, areas between Tetzcoco and Tulancingo, and as far as Colima and Jalisco. A sizable portion of the Otomi resided in the state of Tlaxcala. Although there are reports that Spanish Conquistador Hernán Cortés originally attacked and \\"annihilated the Otomis at Tecoac, who were destroyed completely\\", they eventually joined forces with him when he fought the Aztec Triple-Alliance, eventually defeating it. This allowed the ixtenco Otomi or (Yųhmų) to once again expand. They founded the City of Querétaro and settled in many towns in the state now known as Guanajuato. The Hñähñu Otomi of Mezquital maintained a state of war upon the Spanish and their ixtenco otomi allies with records indicating that the hñähñu resisted assimilation and maintained nomadic raiding parties that attacked any Spanish settlement within hidalgo maintaining a state of war that lasted until the first silver mines were opened The ixtenco otomi allegiance with the Spanish led to many converting to Roman Catholicism, but they also held onto their ancient customs. While being colonized, the ixtenco Otomi language was dispersed to various other states such as Guanajuato, Querétaro,that included the states of Puebla, Veracruz, with Michoacán and Tlaxcala, where most remained farmers. In the Mezquital Valley a traditional homeland to the Otomi , the terrain was so not well equipped for farming as the land was dry, so many Otomi people hired each other as laborers and relied heavily on the maguey-based drink, pulque. Originally, the Spanish banned the drink but soon attempted to manage a business through its production which led to the Otomi people solely using the drink for their own consumption. During Mexico’s War of Independence, the Otomi sided with the rebellion as they wanted their land back that was taken from them under the encomienda system. Around 1940-50, government agencies had promised to assist the indigenous people by helping them gain access to better education and economic advancements but failed to do so. In turn, the people continued to farm and work as laborers within their minor subsistence economy within a larger capitalistic economy where the indigenous people was able to be exploited by those who are in control of the economy. Since gaining independence, the Mexican government has adopted an adoring attitude towards the pre-Hispanic history and works of the Aztecs and Mayans; meanwhile, it has disregarded the living indigenous people, such as the Otomi who are depicted without the same prestige. Until recently, the Otomi culture and people were not given much attention or focus until recent anthropologist began investigating their ancient way of life. As a result, the Mexican government has gone as far declaring themselves a pluricultural nation that serves to help many of its indigenous populations, like the Otomi. However, this has not been the case with scarce evidence proving that anything is done to truly help them. Although many of the current descendants of the Otomi have begun to immigrate to other region, there is still a hint of their ancient culture present today. In certain parts of Mexico, such as Guanajuato and Hidalgo, prayer songs in Otomi are heard and elders share tales the youth who understand their native language. Despite this, very little attention has been placed on the Otomi culture, especially through education means where very little is discussed about any indigenous groups. Because of this, many Otomi descendants know very little about their own cultures history. Etymology The name Otomi is an exonym and comes from the Nahuatl otomitl, which is possibly derived from an older word totomitl \\"shooter of birds\\".Lastra, Los Otomies, pp. 56–58. However, the Otomi refer to themselves as Hñähñú, Hñähño, Hñotho, Hñähü, Hñätho, Yųhų, Yųhmų, Ñųhų, Ñǫthǫ or Ñañhų, depending on which dialect of Otomi they speak.Wright Carr, \\"Precisiones sobre el término 'otomí\\".See the individual articles for the terms in each dialect. Most of the variant forms have two morphemes, meaning \\"speak\\" and \\"well\\" respectively.Hekking & Bakker, \\"The Case of Otomí\\", p. 436. The word Otomi entered Spanish through Nahuatl and is used to describe the larger Otomi macroethnic group and the dialect continuum. From Spanish, the word Otomi has become entrenched in linguistic and anthropological literature. Among linguists, the suggestion has been made to change the academic designation from Otomi to Hñähñú, the endonym used by the Otomi of the Mezquital Valley, but no common endonym exists for all dialects of the language.Palancar, \\"Emergence of Active/Stative alignment in Otomi\\", p. 357. Language Otomi- speaking areas in Mexico Otomi is in the Oto-Pamean languages family (which also includes Chichimeca Jonaz, Mazahua, Pame, Ocuilteco, and Matlatzinca). The family in turn belongs to the Oto-Manguean languages (with Amuzgoan, Chinantecan, Mixtecan, Otopamean, Popolocan, Tlapanecan, and Zapotec language families).

In 1996, they released their second album Garibaldi Guard on Alive Records. The next year, they put out an EP called Nevermind the Opened Minds...Here's the U.S. Bombs. In 1997, due to touring commitments, the rhythm section of the band was replaced with Wade Walston on bass and Chip Hanna on drums. That year, the band released a 10\\" picture disc on Outsider Records. Next they moved to Tim Armstrong's Hellcat Records for a 4-record deal. The first album on Hellcat was War Birth. Before the band's fourth full- length, The World, guitarist Chuck Briggs died. Briggs was replaced by Jonny \\"Two Bags\\" Wickersham. The World was released in 1999.

They recorded Back at the Laundromat, their fifth full length. The band appeared on Premium Blend as the stage band during Jim Breuer's hosting stint, and contributed the song \\"Yer Country\\" to the soundtrack for Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4.

It originally aired on Fox on January 17, 2002. In the episode, Brian is sentenced to community service and must look after a cranky, elderly woman. He at first dislikes her, but after seeing a documentary revealing her remarkable singing ability, they become friends. Meanwhile, Peter decides to grow a beard, which soon becomes the home for a family of endangered birds. \\"Brian Wallows and Peter's Swallows\\" was written by Allison Adler and directed by Dan Povenmire. It featured guest performances from A. J. Benza, Gary Cole, Adria Firestone, Melora Hardin, Butch Hartman, Phil LaMarr, Jane Lynch, Nicole Sullivan and Wally Wingert. The episode received generally positive reviews from critics, and earned an Emmy Award for the musical number \\"You've Got a Lot to See\\". Plot Deciding to go on a date with a hot but dumb blonde, Brian soon discovers he is dating \\"an idiot.\\" Brian returns home depressed, and Lois tells him that he's too picky when it comes to the women he dates. Lois suggests that Brian go with Peter, Quagmire and Cleveland to a laser rock concert, but while there, Brian begins looking around the theater at all of the loving couples and becomes even more depressed, eventually deciding to begin drinking. On the drive home with the guys, he is soon pulled over by Joe and arrested for driving under the influence. One month later, Brian is sentenced to 100 hours of community service in the \\"Outreach to the Elderly\\" program, and assigned to an elderly woman named Pearl Burton, who has not left her house for 30 years. Appearing at her home the next day, he quickly becomes angered by her constant nagging, eventually losing his temper and telling her to \\"drop dead.\\" Later that day, however, Brian soon discovers Pearl was actually a brilliant opera singer during the 1940s and '60s, who was shamed into hiding once she faced demands to sing her more popular radio jingles. Deciding to visit Pearl later that night, he discovers her about to hang herself, but saves her at the last second. Brian manages to convince Pearl that her voice is amazing and she is touched. The two quickly bond over Pearl's singing, and become close friends. Suggesting they go out for dinner, Brian leads Pearl out of her house, where she is immediately run over by a truck. At the hospital, Pearl is left in a serious condition and Brian feels guilty about taking her outside her house. Spending their last seconds together in virtual reality, which Brian had bought while at the rock concert, Pearl soon dies from her injuries, leaving Brian alone once more. Meanwhile, after watching an episode of Grizzly Adams on television, Peter decides to grow a beard, despite Lois' disapproval. After his beard is fully grown, the Griffin family decide to go out for dinner, but are soon pestered by a white- rumped swallow, who eventually settles in Peter's facial hair. Unaware that the bird is actually an endangered species, Peter attempts to remove the bird, but is soon threatened with jailtime if he does so. Left with no other choice but to let the bird live within his hair, Peter attempts to continue life as normally as possible, until he can no longer take the bird's constant squawking, and decides to shoot the bird. Stopped at the last second by Lois, Peter accidentally shoots a nearby window, causing the bird to fly out. Thankful that the bird is finally gone, the two soon hear peeping coming from inside his facial hair, and discover three small baby birds. Won over by their resemblance to his own children, he decides to keep the baby birds, and take the place of its mother. As time goes on, he becomes reluctant to release the birds once they have become fully grown, but is ultimately convinced by Lois to release them back into the wilderness once they attempt to fly out of their bedroom window. He does release them, and then he shaves the beard. Later in the Drunken Clam, Brian and Peter drink to each other's experiences and, as Brian sees an attractive blonde at the bar and Peter is getting looks from a large female bird, agree they aren't ready to move on. Production Dan Povenmire directed the episode. As her first and only episode for the series, the show was written by future Chuck writer Allison Adler, and directed by series regular Dan Povenmire before the conclusion of the third production season. Initially, the \\"tearjerker\\" ending was not planned, and series creator Seth MacFarlane had intended to close the episode with a series of gags, similar to many other episodes. Voice actress and staff writer Alex Borstein, along with Allison Adler, convinced MacFarlane that the episode would be far more effective if it were to end on a down note, eventually calling it the only episode to have \\"real human emotion\\". Following the terror attacks on September 11, 2001, 20th Century Fox decided to edit the musical number \\"You've Got a Lot to See\\" in syndicated airings by digitally removing the World Trade Center towers, as well as replacing the likeness of former President George W. Bush with a beer bong on a tarot card with a tarot card featuring trash talk-show host Jerry Springer during the animation sequence between Pearl and Brian. \\"Brian Wallows and Peter's Swallows\\" won an Emmy Award for Best Song. Creator Seth MacFarlane, the recipient of the award, noted that the episode's director, Dan Povenmire, deserved to have received the award for the contribution the visuals made to the episode's win. Povenmire jokingly responded \\"That's a nice sentiment and all, but did he offer to give me his (Emmy Award)? No! And it's not like he doesn't already have two (Emmy Awards) of his own just sitting in his house!\\" In addition to the regular cast, gossip columnist and television host A. J. Benza, actor Gary Cole, opera singer Adria Firestone, actress Melora Hardin, writer and animator Butch Hartman, voice actor Phil LaMarr, actress Jane Lynch, actress Nicole Sullivan and voice actor Wally Wingert guest starred in the episode. Recurring guest voice actors Lori Alan and writer Mike Barker also made minor appearances.

In spite of being born of the Teli or oil- men's caste, which ranks low in the Hindu social hierarchy, he rose to be one of the important persons of his age.Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition, a publication now in the public domain. Early life Son of Ishwar Chandra Pal, he received an English education at the Oriental Seminary and the Hindu Metropolitan College, and at an early age devoted himself to journalism. A student of D. L. Richardson, he acquired an admirable proficiency in English. In 1861, he was appointed assistant secretary (and afterwards secretary) to the British Indian Association, a board of Bengal landlords, which numbered among its members some of the most cultured men of the day. At about the same time he became editor of the Hindu Patriot, originally started in 1853 and conducted with ability and zeal by Harish Chandra Mukherjee until his death in 1861. This journal having been transferred by a trust deed to some members of the British Indian Association, it henceforth became to some extent an organ of that body. Thus Kristo Das Pal had rare opportunities for proving his abilities and independence during an eventful career of twenty-two years. Later life In 1863, he was appointed justice of the peace and municipal commissioner of Calcutta. In 1872, he was made a member of the Bengal legislative council, where his practical good sense and moderation were much appreciated by successive lieutenant governors. His opposition, however, to the Calcutta Municipal Bill of 1876, which first recognized the elective system, was attributed to his prejudice in favour of the classes against the masses. In 1878, he received the decoration of C.I.E. In 1883 he was appointed a member of the viceroys legislative council. In the discussions on, the Rent Bill, which came up for consideration before the council, Kristo Das Pal, as secretary to the British Indian Association, necessarily took the side of the landlords. He was given title of Rai Bahadur in 1877 and was therefore also called as Rai Kristo Das Pal Bahadur. He was one of the patrons of Hindu Mela, page 151. He died on 24 July 1884 from diabetes. Speaking after his death, Lord Ripon said: \\"By this melancholy event we have lost from among us a colleague of distinguished ability, from whom we had on all occasions received assistance, of which I readily acknowledge the value. . . . Mr. Kristo Das Pal owed the honourable position to which he had attained to his own exertions. His intellectual attainments were of a high order, his rhetorical gifts were acknowledged by all who heard him, and were enhanced when addressing this council by his thorough mastery over the English language.\\" A full length statue of him was unveiled by Lord Elgin at Calcutta in 1894.

He is best known for his time in WWE, as Evan Bourne, and was a one-time WWE Tag Team Champion, with Kofi Kingston. Sydal is also known for his time in Impact Wrestling where he is a former Impact Grand Champion and Impact X Division Champion.

It is mainly aimed at 16 to 18 year olds but some children age 14 to 15 are also able to join. Its aim is to provide support to the party and its candidates. Members work to perform community service, and learn about the political processes at local, state and national level. TARs have a presence in all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia, with membership in the tens of thousands. The oldest recorded TAR group is in South Dakota, which was formed in 1960. TARs are one of the three official \\"youth wings\\" of the Republican National Committee along with Young Republican National Federation and College Republicans. Organization TAR is organized in chapters across the United States. The National TAR office provides information on existing clubs, and provides resources and advice on starting a club in areas that do not already have one. It also organizes the annual national Teenage Republican Leadership Conference (TLC) and awards ceremony. Similar to the Republican Party, the majority of TAR activity takes place on the National & State level. State and National TAR federations sometimes receive some financial support from their state Party. Most have an elected executive board with its own constitution, and organize statewide events such as summer camps, mock legislative sessions, among other events. County and Local Clubs are subordinate to state organizations, and are formed at county, city or school level, with similar structure and activities to state federations. Although State Chapters for the organization and idea existed long beforehand, the Teenage Republicans School itself was founded in December 1966, by Barby Wells . The Teenage Republicans is headed by an Executive Board, consisting of 5 National Officers, and a National Committee consisting of two representatives from individual states, territories, and the District of Columbia. The Executive Board also employs a group of volunteer staff, ranging from Financial Directors to Political Advisors. The organization is involved in a number of projects. Both projects are aimed at inspiring political discourse and offering members the opportunity to voice their opinions on important civic issues in a highly-visible setting. The organization was involved in several campaigns across the country, including the election of Charlie Baker to become governor of Massachusetts as well as the endorsement of the notable presidency election of Mitt Romney in 2012 The organization has taken stances on important issues throughout the political spectrum, but has been recently focused on student loan reform, immigration reform, and gun policies. Teenage Republican Leadership Conference Since the 1970s, National TARs has hosted an annual Teen Age Republican Leader Conference (TLC) where TAR members can meet members of the United States House of Representatives and the United States Senate, learn club and federation development, and meet members from other states. During TLC, National TARs also hosts an annual awards ceremony where members can win awards such as \\"Rising Star\\", and \\"Outstanding TAR In the Nation\\", \\"Outstanding TAR Club in the Nation\\".

Upton was a performer, continuing and expanding the performance tradition of, amongst others, Bob Cobbing. He was active in London poetry and experimental music from the 1960s. He spent much of the first decade of this century in Cornwall; but was a Fellow of Goldsmiths, University of London from Spring 2008 until Autumn 2015, an AHRC fellow for the first three years and then as a Visiting Fellow. Life and work Lawrence Upton first came to public attention in the early 1970s, performing his poetry widely throughout Britain. That poetry, later largely rejected by the poet himself, was often darkly humorous and disturbing. There were political overtones to much of it. He was also something of an activist, speaking often at meetings of small press operators and at the then Poets Conference. He was Secretary of the Association of Little Presses of great Britain from 1972-77, working alongside Bill Griffiths. He abandoned performance for some years. During that period, he reinvented his style and subject matter to speak of natural phenomena - animals of the urban city and people in desolate landscapes. This reinvention of his style has been a feature of his career. In 1972, his sound poetry on recording tape which he had been making since the middle of the 1960s led to an invitation to be guest composer at Fylkingen in Stockholm where he worked for relatively short periods, on and off, for five years from 1974. At about the same time, he was elected to the General Council of The Poetry Society and immediately further elected by the Council on to the society's executive. The next year he was elected the society's deputy chairman, a post he held for some time (1974-77). He served under three chairs: Laurence Cotterell, Jeff Nuttall and Barry MacSweeney before resigning (1978). His essay \\"So many things\\" discusses issues arising from that period (in \\"CLASP: late modernist poetry in London in the 1970s\\", edited by Robert Hampson and Ken Edwards; Shearsman, Bristol; ). He founded and ran the bookshop of the Society, rebadged the National Poetry Centre and was an active member of The Printshop where he helped to produce the society's publications and those of the general public who came in with manuscripts. Meanwhile, his reputation had grown, reinvented again as a maker of text-sound composition, with live and recorded performances in Stockholm and elsewhere. He had in 1976 co-founded the very influential sound poetry performance group jgjgjg (with PC Fencott and cris cheek), which blazed a trail through Europe's avant-garde scene and then disbanded in less than 3 years. Cobbing published him in Kroklok magazine and also proposed that the two make a booklet together to be published by Writers Forum. The booklet, called Furst Fruts of 77, was one of the press's best sellers ever 1978 saw an end to Upton's visits to Fylkingen and a major argument with Cobbing but he continued to make sound works and to perform live multi-media work. This work was poorly documented but audio tapes have been available from the press Typical Characteristic. His books Mutation and Morning Humming from Zimmer Press and Lobby Press respectively date from that period and point to a further change in style. He visited and performed in Canada and the U.S. and was included in McCaffery and Nicholl's Sound Poetry: A Catalogue. In 1980, Upton completed a BA degree in English Literature and History at Kingston Polytechnic and fell in love with a married woman. Both events had major effects upon his life and writing. Upton had left school with almost no qualifications but acquired a taste for study in the late 70s. After his BA and a PGCE at Kingston, he went on to take an MA in English and American Literature at King's college, London, and has spoken often of the experience of being taught about Melville by the famous Eric Mottram. His relationship took him out of circulation in the poetry world for many years. When the two were finally apart, a confidant wrote that \\"it seems to have lasted as long as a world war, but I feel that more people have died.\\" In 1981, Upton had a substantial exhibition under the title Deteriorating Texts at the LYC Museum and Art Gallery in Cumbria. Galloping Dog Press published a book. After that, he self-published if at all, but in his apparent silence, as well as living a suburban life, he took a series of school-teaching jobs including Head of Media Studies at Spencer Park School (1982-86) and at John Archer School (1986-7). He then completed a Dip.Ed in Computer Science at King's College, London (1987-8) and became Lecturer in Computer Science at Carshalton College (1988-91) and then Head of Academic Computing there (1992-96). As a result of these new skills, he reappeared in the poetry world with In Praise of John Coltrane which had been largely computer generated with code the poet wrote himself. In 1990 he founded the magazine RWC and later the press Mainstream. A renewed friendship with Bob Cobbing led to the publication of two volumes of apparently autobiographical verse, Messages To Silence and Unsent Letters which he had been writing since the late 1980s. This was followed by another volume from Form Books, Letters To Eric, different in verse method and apparently more reliably autobiographical with references to marital breakup. In interview, however, Upton has said that the narrators of all his poems are unreliable. From 1992 to 1994, he was a member of the committee that ran Subvoicive Poetry (alongside Robert Sheppard and Ulli Freer). He subsequently ran Subvoicive Poetry single-handed from 1994 to 2005. Apart from the regular poetry reading series, which took place at a series of London pubs including the White Swan in Covent Garden and the Betsy Trotwood), he also organised six SVP colloquia between 1996 and 2002. From 1994 until the end of the century he and Cobbing wrote a collaborative visual poem called Domestic Ambient Noise, now out of print, which has been highly praised. It is more than 2000 pages long and came in 300 pamphlets each of which was performed somewhere by the two. In 2010, Writers Forum republished the two's \\"Collaborations for Peter Finch\\" That collaborative writing was done increasingly at a distance as ill-health obliged Upton to flee the city. From the mid-1990s his poems tended to be written in the Pennines and the remoter parts of Cornwall. (His family come predominantly from west Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly.) In the late 1990s the Canadian housepress invited him to submit poetry for publication. The result, a poem called \\"house\\", led to another invitation and another publication \\"Sta!\\". By the time housepress closed, Upton had published over a dozen titles with the press. For some time he was published by No Press, from the same editor. In 1998 Writers Forum published Word Score Utterance Choreography edited by Cobbing and Upton and described by Cobbing as a primer for the performance of visual poetry as sound poetry. This is a task no one else has attempted and it has been influential. Though continuing to perform with Cobbing, Upton sought solo performances and collaborations with other artists. His 2001 book Initial Dance led to a research project at Chisenhale Dance Space in London. He had made many visits to North America and has a wide range of collaborations behind him. In 2000, he performed with Bob Cobbing on a number of occasions, including the weekend celebration of the completion of Domestic Ambient Noise. One of the performances that weekend included Derek Shiel at The Klinker, Islington, London.“List of Performances,” Sculpted Sound website At the same time, the publication of Meadows by Writers Forum in 2000 and of Wire Sculptures by Reality Street in 2003 confirmed the quality of his writing on the page. Stylistically neither book is much like anything he had published before. The range of his approaches and frequent changes of direction have made acceptance slow. More recently, Writers Forum published \\"Snap shots and video\\" and Veer Publications \\"a song and a film\\" He continuously surprised his readers through a constant shift of form and content. In the last several years of his life he spoke and wrote on the poetry of Bob Cobbing and Alaric Sumner and on the use of digital technology in making poetry. He also engaged in a number of collaborations: with the musician John Drever, the book artist Guy Begbie, the poet and artist Richard Tipping, the musician Benedict Taylor and the poet Tina Bass. For some years, between performances, Lawrence Upton withdrew to Cornwall, where accommodation was provided for him. It was said that he had become something of an expert on Cornish history. From 2006, for some years, he was more in evidence in Greater London, usually in his then office at Goldsmiths. Where his output used to refer to Cornish landscapes, he later concentrated on aspects of Scilly as he assembled his long sequences \\"Elidius on Scilly\\" and \\"Landscapes\\". He was found dead at his home, surrounded by documents and papers, on the 16th February 2020. The \\"Guardian\\" published an obituary for him on-line in their 'Other Lives' (12 March 2020).

History The festival is held annually on the , oak-studded Monterey County Fairgrounds, located at 2004 Fairground Road in Monterey, on the third full weekend in September, beginning on Friday. Five hundred top jazz artists perform on nine stages spread throughout the grounds, with 50 concert performances. In addition, the Monterey Jazz Festival features jazz conversations, panel discussions, workshops, exhibitions, clinics, and an international array of food, shopping, and festivities spread throughout From 1992 to 2010, Tim Jackson was general manager and artistic director, and in 2010, Chris Doss became the managing director, and Jackson became the artistic director. In 2014, Colleen Bailey became the managing director. Since 1992, Clint Eastwood has been on MJF's board of directors. Kent and Keith Zimmerman describe the festival as having expanded in recent years: \\"While jazz radio and major labels cut back on musical choice and commitment, the Monterey Jazz Festival has widened its scope by expanding the parameters of jazz, blues, and rock. . . . Happily, MJF is now as diverse and vibrant as Lyons imagined it ever could be.\\"Zimmerman, Keith and Kent. The Art of Jazz: Monterey Jazz Festival/50 Years (July 2007), page 119 In 2006, the festival set an attendance record of 40,000, selling out all five major concerts on the main stage arena,Big names, experience set Monterey apart and in 2007, 40,000 attended the 50th Golden Celebration.Forty thousand party at Monterey Jazz Festival's 50th birthday Since there'll be no festival in 2020, the 63rd is deferred to 2021. The COVID-19 pandemic caused officials to cancel it. The Monterey Jazz Festival is a nonprofit organization. It has donated its proceeds to musical education since its inception in 1958. The festival's scholarship program started with a $35,000 scholarship fund in 1970. As of 2012, the festival invests $600,000 annually for jazz education. Every spring, the Monterey Jazz Festival invites student musicians from across the country and around the world to participate in the \\"Next Generation Festival\\". Dave Brubeck was instrumental in getting city approval for the first festival in 1958. The founder and general manager of MJF for 35 years, Jimmy Lyons, brought Brubeck to Monterey to perform for the city council to persuade them to allow the festival to occur. He performed at the Festival 14 times which included his appearance at the 2007 / 50th golden anniversary.Dave Brubeck Honored at Monterey Jazz Festival's First MJF Legends Award Presentation The Monterey Pop Festival was held at the fairgrounds in 1967 for three days in mid-June, part of the Summer of Love.

The infrared homing method of the Sidewinder was retained, as the missile was to be used against targets which emitted an infrared signature. Typical targets included trucks and other such vehicles. The Focus was used in Vietnam during 1969 and 1970, primarily for night attacks when IR emitters stand out well against the cool background. Although the missile was reportedly quite effective, it was discontinued in favor of other weapons.

Humphreys School of Law is an American Bar Association accredited law school and is the only law school in Memphis, Tennessee. The school has been associated with the University of Memphis since the law school's formation in 1962. The school was named in honor of former University president Cecil Clarence Humphreys. It is also referred to as U of M Law, Memphis Law, or Memphis Law School. According to Memphis Law's 2017 ABA-required disclosures, 69.69% of the Class of 2017 obtained full-time, long-term, bar passage-required employment after graduation, excluding solo practitioners. History The law school was founded in 1962 as the Memphis State University College of Law. It gained ABA accreditation three years later in 1965. Official LSAC Guide: University of Memphis, School of Law Former Memphis businessman Herbert Herff was a major benefactor to the University of Memphis. When he died in 1966, Herff left the bulk of his estate in trust with the State of Tennessee for the benefit of the University. Among his Foundation's funding is the Herbert Herff Presidential Law Scholarships and the Herbert Herff Chair of Excellence in Law. Prior to the law school's founding, there were several other law schools in Memphis, including Memphis Law School, and Southern Law School (not to be confused with Southern University Law Center in Baton Rouge, LA), both of which subsequently merged with Memphis State University Law School. Memphis Law School existed as early as 1909 as the University of Memphis School of Law. Despite the names, neither Southern Law University nor the early University of Memphis School of Law had university connections, but rather offered part-time legal education programs, though both were approved by the State Board of Law Examiners. The law school joined the Association of American Law Schools (AALS) in 2001.http://www.aals.org/about_memberschools.php AALS Membership Directory Reflecting the law school's increased profile, the Tennessee Supreme Court convened at the University of Memphis School of Law on November 4, 2010.http://www.commercialappeal.com/news/2010/nov/05/u-of-m-vandy-law- schools-rank-high/ University of Memphis Ranks High, The Commercial Appeal (November 5, 2010) In September 2012, the law school celebrated its semicentennial.

New downtown campus Main lobby of University of Memphis School of Law Because of inadequate, old facilities, former Dean James Smoot positioned the law school for a move from its building on the University's main campus in East Memphis to a former customs house on the Mississippi River in downtown Memphis. The new law school campus is more than twice the size of the old campus.http://www.americaninterfile.com/news2.html (last accessed June 22, 2011) Until purchased by the law school, a portion of the building had been serving as a post office. Designed by Memphis firms Askew Nixon Ferguson Architects and Fleming Associates Architects, the new law school is located in the heart of Memphis' downtown. Tennessee's governor, Phil Bredesen, has also lent his support and pledged forty-one million dollars in state funds for the move. Along with the purpose-specific interior redesign, the architect (Bill Nixon) oversaw structural renovations, including a $2 million seismic retrofit. The move was officially announced on January 12, 2006, and it was anticipated that the downtown facility would be ready for classes January 2010. As of Fall 2010, the new downtown campus is fully operational, with a dedication ceremony held on January 16, 2010.

For a fee, a customer names a target, and an undercover employee of the company then attempts to initiate an affair with the target or produce other incriminating evidence. Though most often used to gather evidence of infidelity for use in a divorce case, it may also be used for purposes ranging from bringing shame to someone, securing the resignation of an employee, luring away the lover of one's spouse, or breaking up some other relationship. The activities of these agencies were first widely reported in about 2000, and in 2001 the TV network NTV aired a drama series Wakaresase-ya. In 2005 there were around twelve such companies in Japan, but the field has grown since with companies offering services through the internet. In 2010 an internet search located some 270 wakaresaseya agencies. The cost of retaining such an agency was given as ranging from 500,000 to 1.6 million yen, not including a success bonus of 250,000 - 800,000 yen. People involved in the business agree that men make easier targets and will almost always be seduced by good looking operatives.

He was also a Spiritualist and is best known for the thousands of photographs he took during séances held in his home in Winnipeg in the early 1900s. His wife, Lillian May Hamilton, and his daughter, Margaret Hamilton Bach, were co-researchers and continued this enquiry into life after death after he died. Life T.G. Hamilton was born in 1873, in Agincourt (now part of Toronto), the son of James Hamilton and Isabella Glendenning. When T.G. was ten, the Hamiltons and their six children moved to Saskatchewan to homestead near Saskatoon.Bach, Margaret Hamilton. “University of Manitoba First Annual Symposium,” 23 November 1979. Not long after two tragedies occurred in rapid succession: T.G.’s father died in 1885 and a year later T.G.'s sister Margaret died of typhoid fever.Nickels, James B. “Psychic Research in a Winnipeg Family: Reminiscences of Dr. Glen F. Hamilton,” Manitoba History. 55 (June 2007): 52 This and the availability of educational opportunities elsewhere led the family to abandon Saskatchewan in 1891 to move to Winnipeg. T.G. was educated at Manitoba College and the Manitoba Medical College, graduating as an M.D. from the latter in 1903.Now part of the University of Manitoba. He lectured in medical jurisprudence and clinical surgery at the Manitoba Medical College, and was an assistant surgeon at the Winnipeg General Hospital.“Dr. T. Glen Hamilton Honored by Confreres and Hospital Staff,” The Elmwood Herald 27 December, p.4 He married Lillian May Forrester three years later and in 1910 set up a private medical practice in a home, later known as Hamilton House, located on what is now Henderson Highway in Elmwood, a suburb of Winnipeg. He and Lillian had four children: Margaret, Glen and in 1915, twins, Arthur Lamont and James Drummond.Nickels,Psychic Research, 52 In terms of religion, the Hamiltons were Presbyterian and later members of the United Church of Canada.Thomas Glendenning Hamilton (1873-1935) Besides being a respected medical practitioner in his own city, Hamilton became a Fellow of the American College of Surgeons in 1920, president of the Manitoba Medical Association in 1921-22 and founder and first editor of the Manitoba Medical Bulletin, and president of the Canadian Medical Association in 1922.Mitchell, Rosslyn Brough.

He first sought election to the Manitoba legislature in the 1914 provincial election, and lost to Conservative Harry Mewhirter by 364 votes in the Elmwood constituency. He ran again in the 1915 election, and defeated new Conservative candidate D. Munro by 1,453 votes. The Liberals won a landslide majority in this election, and Hamilton served as a backbench supporter of Tobias Norris's government for the next five years. Hamilton sought re-election in the 1920 provincial election, in the restructured ten-member constituency of Winnipeg. Members were elected by a single transferable ballot. Hamilton finished in twentieth place on the first count with 786 votes, and was eliminated on the 22nd count. Paranormal investigations In 1918 W.T. Allison, a professor of English at the University of Manitoba and a close friend of T.G., returned from a visit to American medium Pearl Curran.McMullin, Anatomy of a Seance, 182 He passed on his interest and enthusiasm for spiritual communication to T.G. This may never have amounted to more than a passing interest had not fate intervened. In 1919, one of T.G.’s twin sons, Arthur, died at the age of three, a victim of the Spanish flu.Nickels, Psychic Research, 52 T.G.’s daughter Margaret attributed the family’s lifelong search for life after death to this event. Her father’s grief was profound; her mother, having read Frederic William Henry Myers's book Human Personality and Its Survival of Bodily Death, encouraged her husband to investigate the phenomenon.Bach, Margaret Hamilton. “Interview,” Hamilton Family fonds, 4; Myers, Frederic WH. Human personality and its survival of bodily death. Myers, Leopold Hamilton, ed. London: Longmans, Green, c1906 T.G. started with the use of Ouija board and experiments with mental telepathy with his United Church minister, Reverend Daniel Normal McLachlan.Nickels, Psychic Research, 54 The family’s first medium was their Scottish nanny, Elizabeth Poole. She started out by using the Ouija board, but moved on in 1920 when the family was introduced to table tipping, where a table would stop tipping when the “correct” letter was pronounced aloud, somewhat akin to the Ouija board. This led to investigations into telekinesis, or the movement of physical objects through mental exertions.Nickels, Psychic Research, 54-55 By now T.G. had established a separate room on the 2nd floor of the house which was to be kept locked at all times when it was not in use. T.G. wanted to investigate paranormal phenomena such as rappings, psychokinesis, ectoplasms, and materializations under scientific conditions that would minimize any possibility of error. – University of Manitoba Archives, “Hamilton Family fonds” A red bulb in the centre of the room provided light. A bank of about a dozen cameras were focussed on the side of the room where activity was to take place, their shutters open, waiting for Hamilton to set off a flash in order for them to all take photos at the same time. A three sided wooden cabinet that T.G. constructed open on one side was used in the telekinesis experiments, where Mrs. Poole would charge a small table by laying her hands on it, causing it to move from the cabinet.Nickels, Psychic Research, 55 By 1928, Mrs. Poole introduced the Hamilton family to two Scottish sisters-in-law, Mary Ann Marshall (1880-1963) and Susan Marshall, also known as Dawn and Mercedes. These two women became regular mediums at the Hamiltons’ “home circles.”Nickels, Psychic Research, 55 The family would invite friends and members of the community to participate in their séances. Many of the persons who attended the home circles were also doctors and businessmen, such as celebrated lawyer Isaac Pitblado and Rh blood specialist Dr. Bruce Chown.McMullin, Anatomy of a Seance, 210-11 The first table rappings and table tiltings of “Elizabeth M,” as Mrs. Poole was known, were followed by clairvoyance, trance states, automatic writing, visions, then the manifestations of materializations, wax molds, bell ringing and finally in 1928, ectoplasms. – University of Manitoba Archives, “Hamilton Family fonds” As a spiritualist Hamilton believed the ectoplasms to be materializations from the spirit world. He photographed the ectoplasm and Lillian took notes of what occurred in the 2nd floor room in Hamilton House. Margaret also served as recording secretary for many of her father's experiments.“Biography of Margaret Hamilton Bach,” Hamilton Family fonds At first T.G. and Lillian's investigations into the paranormal were held in secret. But T.G. went public in 1926, delivering a lecture on his research on telekinesis to the Winnipeg Medical Society.Nickels, Psychic Research, 52 From that time until his death, Hamilton delivered eighty-six lectures and wrote numerous articles published in Canada and abroad. – University of Manitoba Archives, “Hamilton Family fonds” His fame spread and the Hamilton family's work became known in the United Kingdom, Europe and the United States.McMullin, Anatomy of a Seance, 181 Canadian Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King and Americans Mina Crandon, the medium known as “Margery,” and her husband L.R.G. Crandon, all travelled to Winnipeg to participate in the Hamiltons’ séances.Nickels, Psychic Research, 55-56 Among those who worked with Dr Hamilton were Ada Turner and her adopted son Harold Turner. Harold or \\"Norman\\" as he is called in the Hamilton records was interviewed by Norman James Williamson about his experience with the Hamilton group in 1982. When Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, author of the Sherlock Holmes series, came to Winnipeg as part of a cross North American tour in 1923, he attended one of the Hamiltons’ home circles.Homer, Michael W. \\"Arthur Conan Doyle's Adventures in Winnipeg\\". Manitoba History Spring 1991,10. Even after his death, the Hamiltons tried to contact Conan Doyle by mediumship. – University of Manitoba Archives, “Hamilton Family fonds” In 1935, T.G. Hamilton died suddenly of a heart attack.Nickels, Psychic Research, 52 His wife Lillian and his daughter Margaret continued his work. Lillian and her son James Drummond produced a summary of T.G.’s work in the book Intention and Survival, published in 1942.Hamilton, Intention and Survival, 1942 When Lillian died in 1956, her daughter Margaret carried on. She wrote a series of articles in 1957 for Psychic News in England. These thirteen articles were collected in a booklet and also circulated to daily papers throughout Canada. Margaret later produced a second edition of Intention and Survival in 1977; a third edition came out in 1980.McMullin, Anatomy of a Seance, 205 Archival legacy A photograph taken by Hamilton of the medium Mary Marshall revealing tissue paper and cut- out heads from newspapers. The Hamilton family left a rich legacy. Lillian compiled several scrapbooks of photos and other materials for her children. Margaret, however, was the one who collected all the papers from the family dealing with their paranormal research and deposited these with the University of Manitoba Archives & Special Collections. The family's fonds, or papers, consist of 2.5 linear metres of textual and other materials, and include scrapbooks, séance attendance records and registers, affidavits, automatic writings, correspondence, speeches and lectures, news clippings, journal articles, photographs, glass plate negatives and positives, prints, slides, audio tapes, manuscripts and promotional materials related to major publications. The materials date from 1919-1986 and since their deposit have been supplemented by other related collections. A companion research grant established by the Hamilton family provides funds for researchers to travel to Winnipeg to study these and other archival collections. Although these archives have held a strong attraction for those interested in the paranormal, more significantly they have had a very powerful effect in stimulating artistic and cultural expressions. T.G.’s photographs have captured the imagination of many curators. His photos have appeared in art exhibits throughout Canada, from the Dunlop Art Gallery in Regina, Saskatchewan, to the Prefix Institute of Contemporary Art in Toronto, Ontario. Internationally his photos were included in the exhibit \\"Spiritus\\" at Magasin3 Stockholm Konsthall in Sweden in 2003. In 2005 they appeared in the exhibition “The Perfect Medium: Photography and the Occult,” held at the Maison européenne de la photographie in Paris and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.Cheroux, Clement et al. The Perfect Medium: Photography and the Occult. New Haven: Yale University Press, 2004. Later that year they were featured in the Symposium “Dark Rooms: Photography and Invisibility,” hosted by Princeton University.Dark Rooms T.G.’s photographs and the Hamilton family’s archives are a major component of the work of Belfast artist Susan MacWilliam to appear in the 2009 Venice Biennale. They are also featured in the book: Susan MacWilliam: Remote Viewing (2009).Downey, Karen, Ed. Susan MacWilliam: Remote Viewing. London: Black Dog Publishing, 2009 Beyond art exhibitions, the Hamilton archives have stimulated work in a number of other art forms. In 2007, the archives were the focus of the play “The Elmwood Visitation” by Winnipeg playwright Carolyn Gray, which won the playwright the Manitoba Day Award for excellence in archival research from the Association for Manitoba Archives. This play was later published by Scirocco Drama under the same name.Gray, Carolyn. “The Elmwood Visitation.” Winnipeg: Scirocco Drama, 2007 The archives of the Hamilton family also provided the historic theme for the novel Widows of Hamilton House by Christina Penner in 2008.Penner, Christina. Widows of Hamilton House. Winnipeg: Enfield & Wizenty, 2008 T.G.’s photos have appeared in films, including Winnipeg filmmaker Guy Maddin’s My Winnipeg (2008) and the more commercial horror film The Haunting in Connecticut (2009), among others. Numerous television shows have featured T.G. and his photographs. The television series Northern Mysteries included Hamilton in the episode entitled “Spiritualism” in 2005 and Hamilton was the focus of the television documentary “Chasing Hamilton’s Ghost,” as part of the Manitoba Moments series in 2005. Claims of fraud Skeptics suggest that the ectoplasm shown in the photographs could be made of tissue paper and cut-out photographs of people. However, if fraud occurred, it is not known who executed it. Chris Rutkowski points out that Hamilton was well-respected during his lifetime for his scientific methods.

The group took on many different forms and had several different names and sub-groups, including Whitey's Hopping Maniacs, Harlem Congeroo Dancers, and The Hot Chocolates. In addition to touring nationally and internationally, the group appeared in several films and Broadway theatre productions. Dorothy Dandridge and Sammy Davis Jr. were among the group's celebrity regulars. History Beginning in the late 1920s, White, a bouncer at the Savoy Ballroom and former dancing waiter, began organizing exceptional dancers, first under the aegis of George Snowden and then under White himself. Although many members felt mistreated by White, many admired his promotion of the dance. In 1934, at the age of 14, Norma Miller became the youngest member the group. In 1935, the group competed in a dance contest called the Harvest Moon Ball at Madison Square Garden. The group then went on a 7-month European tour. In 1936, the group began a tour of the U.S. with headliner Ethel Waters. While in California, they met the Marx Brothers, Allan Jones and Maureen O’Sullivan, and made their film debut in A Day at the Races (1937) , a movie for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. They danced and sang in the number \\"All God's Chillun Got Rhythm\\" which featured singer Ivie Anderson and other members of Duke Ellington’s orchestra. Dave Gould, the choreographer, was nominated for an Academy Award for the dance sequence. In 1938, for a second time, the group competed in the Harvest Moon Ball, hosted that year by Ed Sullivan. Sullivan invited members of the group to perform on Toast of the Town (later called The Ed Sullivan Show). The group also competed in the contest in 1939 and 1940. Whitey's Lindy Hoppers performed in the movie Hellzapoppin' (1941), where they executed breathtaking flips, slides, kicks, splits, and lifts. When they returned from filming, the group went to Rio de Janeiro to perform. Because of the Attack on Pearl Harbor, they were unable to find transportation home and ended up staying for 10 months, nearly exhausting all of their energy and money. In 1942, the group went on a 3-week tour with Cootie Williams and Pearl Bailey that included performances at the Apollo Theater, the Howard Theatre in Washington, D.C., and the Royal Theatre in Baltimore. The group disbanded shortly thereafter since the males were called into service during World War II. After the group disbanded, White moved to Oswego and opened a restaurant. He died of a heart attack in September 1950. Members Al Minns, Leon James, Frankie Manning, and Norma Miller are the most notable members of the group - Minns and James in part for their role in the research of Jean and Marshall Stearns's influential book Jazz Dance, Minns for his work with the Hot Shots during the swing revival in the 1980s, Manning for his role in contributing to the swing revival after Minns died in 1985, and Miller for her presentations and instruction at Herräng Dance Camp up until her death in 2019. Ruthie Reingold and Harry Rosenberg were the only white members of the group. Although mixed race dancing was accepted at the Savoy Ballroom, it was frowned upon by the general public and they are not in any of the early videos of the group. =Member list= * Louise \\"Pal\\" Andrews * Eleanor \\"Stumpy\\" Atkinson (Watson) - 4\\"11\\" tall; joined the group in 1937, known for her footwork * Pettis Dotson \\"Snooky\\" Beasley - known for doing a step called the lock * Lennie Bluett * Clyde \\"Brownie\\" Brown - for a time, Whitey's right hand man * John \\"Tiny\\" Bunch - at over 300 pounds, his nickname was a joke, but he was revered for his liveliness despite his size.

Early life Georg von Rauch was born in Marburg. His father, the historian Georg von Rauch, was a university lecturer in philosophy at Marburg University. The family moved to Kiel, where Rauch passed the Abitur in 1966 and started studying philosophy at Kiel University. Also in 1966, he married the painter Illo Wittlich, who gave birth to a daughter in 1967.  Moving to Berlin and radicalisation The heated climate of the German student movement following the shooting of Benno Ohnesorg on 2 June 1967 made Rauch move to Berlin in order to participate in the political protests originating from Freie Universität. He joined the Socialist German Student Union and was engaged in several left-wing protests in favour of a better education policy and against the Vietnam War, which led to his radicalisation. During this period, Rauch lived in a commune in Berlin-Charlottenburg in an apartment rented by lawyer and left-wing radical Otto Schily, who later became German Interior Minister. The group called itself Wieland-Kommune after the notorious Kommune 1 and had Michael Baumann as one of its leading figures. The philosophy of Wieland-Kommune saw a merger of socialism and Hippie culture, including the use of drugs and the embracing of the sexual revolution. Livelihood was achieved by illegal printing and sale of socialist literature and shoplifting (which was called \\"proletarian shopping\\"). The attempted murder of student leader Rudi Dutschke on 11 April 1968 and the May revolts in France led Rauch and some other members of Wieland-Kommune to break with the German state system and they started attacking it. With the example of the Tupamaros in Uruguay, a group of urban guerrillas was founded, the West Berlin Tupamaros, which later became the Movement 2 June. Rauch was an active member and committed a series of serious crimes.  Imprisonment, escape and death  After having beaten up a journalist together with Michael Baumann and Thomas Weissbecker, von Rauch was arrested on 2 February 1970. He was held imprisoned as a suspect until his court trial started in summer 1971. When the sentence was proclaimed on 8 July 1971, von Rauch fled the court in Berlin-Moabit by changing roles with Weisbecker (who was freed of all charges) in an act that was never fully explained. On 5 December of the same year, von Rauch was caught in Berlin-Schöneberg by plainclothes policemen. A shootout ensued, during which von Rauch was mortally hit in the head. According to the police, the shootout was begun by von Rauch and his accomplices, which was questioned by left-wing supporters, who claimed that no gun had been found with him. In a later interview with Der Spiegel weekly news magazine, Michael Baumann (who was also on the scene) stated that both sides had started shooting simultaneously. Von Rauch was buried in Kiel.  Legacy  Immediately after his death von Rauch was regarded as a martyr by supporters. The remaining members of his underground organisation founded the Movement 2 June, the anarchist counterpart of the Red Army Faction. The squatters of the Bethanien Hospital in Berlin-Kreuzberg renamed it to Georg-von-Rauch-Haus in his honour. Rio Reiser, member of the band Ton Steine Scherben wrote a song about this house, the Rauch-Haus-Song. References * Ingrid Gilcher-Holtey, A Revolution of Perception ?

Since 1996, he has been the private trainer at Ballydoyle Stables near Rosegreenin County Tipperary for John Magnier and his Coolmore Stud associates. Early and private life Aidan O'Brien was one of six children of Denis O'Brien (died 1 December 2008'Irish Independent' 2 December 2008 ) and his wife Stella (née Doyle). Denis was a farmer and small-scale horse trainer in the townland of Killegney, near Poulpeasty, in County Wexford, where Aidan grew up. Aidan O'Brien attended Donard National School, located less than a mile from his parents' home. He subsequently attended secondary school at Good Counsel College, New Ross, also located in County Wexford.H. Ashdown (ed.) & Poulpeasty Parish Committee, Echoes of Poulpeasty (Enniscorthy: Courtney & Hogan Print Ltd., 1999), p. 174. O'Brien is a member of the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association, meaning that he does not drink alcohol. O'Brien first started working professionally with horses at P.J. Finn's racing stables at the Curragh, County Kildare, and then with Jim Bolger at Coolcullen, County Carlow. Aidan O'Brien is married to Anne-Marie (née Crowley). Anne-Marie's father, Joe Crowley trained horses at Piltown, County Kilkenny, where his tenure was interrupted in quick succession by his daughter Anne-Marie (Champion National Hunt Trainer during her brief time at the helm), his son- in-law Aidan O'Brien (who took over from his wife in 1993 but moved on to Ballydoyle in 1996) and then another daughter, Frances Crowley (who moved on to train on the Curragh for some years). Joe then renewed his own training licence for some years before retiring. Aidan O’Brien was champion Irish National Hunt trainer in the 1993/4 season and went on to lift the title for the next 5 consecutive seasons. His most successful horse during this time was the famed Istabraq. In 1996 he was approached by John Magnier to train at Ballydoyle. For a number of years he retained his Piltown yard. O'Brien and Anne-Marie have four children, with Joseph, Sarah, Anastasia and Donnacha all jockeys. Joseph became apprenticed to his father and rode his first winner shortly after his sixteenth birthday, on Johann Zoffany at Leopardstown on 28 May 2009. In 2012 O'Brien and Joseph, 19, became the first father-son/trainer- jockey combination to win The Derby, with Camelot. As of 2020, he is the most successful Epsom Derby trainer of all time with 8 wins. Successes *1996 Season Desert King won the National Stakes to give Aidan O'Brien his first Group 1 success. *1997 Season Desert King won the Irish 2,000 Guineas to give Aidan O'Brien his first classic success. *2001 Season Aidan O'Brien was crowned England's champion trainer, the first Irishmen to achieve the feat since Vincent O'Brien in 1971. *2004 Season 2004 Proved to be a disappointing year for O'Brien. It started off with the removal of Michael Kinane as stable jockey. Kinane was replaced by the young Jamie Spencer who had developed a good reputation riding in the UK. However the year ultimately proved disappointing on the track. Spencer was replaced after a string of self- confessed mistakes on Powerscourt in the Arlington Million and on the same horse again in the Breeders' Cup Turf. *2005 season Kieren Fallon replaced Spencer as Ballydoyle's stable jockey. On the first classic weekend of the 2005 flat season the newly formed partnership of Aidan O'Brien and Kieren Fallon took home both the 2,000 Guineas (Footstepsinthesand) and the 1,000 Guineas (Virginia Waters). More major successes followed with Oratorio (Eclipse Stakes, Irish Champion Stakes), Scorpion (Grand Prix de Paris, St. Leger) and juveniles George Washington, Rumplestiltskin and Horatio Nelson. *2006 Season The start of the 2006 flat season saw George Washington confirm his juvenile promise by easily winning the 2,000 Guineas on Newmarket's Rowley Mile to give O'Brien his fourth win in the race. While George Washington disappointed in the Irish equivalent, he redeemed himself in the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes at Ascot. Dylan Thomas also made his mark in the top middle distance races in Europe. After going close in the Epsom Derby, he was found to be more effective under a patient Kieren Fallon ride in the Irish Derby. Dylan Thomas also showed his battling qualities in the Irish Champion Stakes, where he beat the Champion mare Ouija Board by a neck. Other 2006 highlights came through Alexandrova who dominated the middle distance fillies classics taking in The Oaks, Irish Oaks and Yorkshire Oaks. The end of season saw the juvenile Holy Roman Emperor take the Prix Jean-Luc Lagardère on Arc day at Longchamp. In one of the races of the season he was beaten by a head in the Dewhurst Stakes by European Champion 2-year-old Teofilo. Much anticipation centred on the expected rematch of these two colts in the 2,000 Guineas at Newmarket the following spring. Aidan finished the season with prizemoney of over €6.5m in Ireland and Great Britain. The season was marked however by the emerging race fixing allegations involving stable jockey Kieren Fallon. On 3 July 2006, Fallon was charged along with 7 other people for conspiring to defraud clients of the internet betting exchange Betfair. Fallon was one of 28 people answering bail at Bishopsgate police station in the City of London in connection with the inquiry. In a released police statement, he was described as being charged with \\"offences relating to allegations of fixing the outcome of horse races between 1 December 2002 and 2 September 2004, and money laundering\\". He was amongst three jockeys charged, along with Darren Williams and Fergal Lynch, all of whom had their licences to ride in Britain suspended, effectively under the principle that they would be guilty until found innocent. Fallon's problems were further compounded when on 29 November 2006 the French racing authority France Galop suspended Fallon for six months after he tested positive for a metabolite of a banned substance. *2007 season The end of the 2006 season had apparently left Ballydoyle with multiple options for the following year's classics. However the opening part of the season was left in turmoil after the premature retirement of Holy Roman Emperor. The previous year's champion miler George Washington proved almost infertile, ultimately siring only one foal. As a late replacement, Holy Roman Emperor was sent to Coolmore Stud. Plans had to be drastically changed with O'Brien saying \\"all our eggs were in one basket\\" in relation to the opening classic of the season the 2,000 Guineas. As a result, the season began relatively quietly as far as O'Brien's classic crop was concerned. However signs of changing fortunes would emerge on the day of the Poule d'Essai des Poulains when Astronomer Royal came with a late run to give Ballydoyle a 1–3–4 finish. Group 1 success was seen in the older horses through the previous year's Irish Derby winner Dylan Thomas when he won the Prix Ganay. The mid summer was highlighted by Scorpion winning the Coronation Cup in an O'Brien 1–2 with stable mate Septimus. The stable also dominated the St. James's Palace Stakes and the Irish Derby with Excellent Art and Soldier of Fortune respectively leading home 1–2–3 for O'Brien horses. O'Brien finished Royal Ascot as top trainer with four winners including Yeats who retained his Ascot Gold Cup and Henrythenavigator who set the juvenile standard for the early part of the season by winning the Coventry Stakes. Kieren Fallon returned to retainer duties in both Ireland and France, although his ban in Britain was still being enforced pending the result of his trial in relation to fraud in racing. Peeping Fawn managed to learn from her second place in The Oaks by taking the Audi Pretty Polly Stakes at the Curragh and eventually overturning form, albeit on softer ground, with Light Shift in the Irish Oaks. The season of 2007 also saw Aidan land the one big European race that had so far eluded him throughout his illustrious career when Dylan Thomas won the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe under Kieren Fallon. The season however ended on a very sad note after George Washington was put down after breaking down in the Breeders Cup Classic. *2008 Season During the off season Johnny Murtagh was appointed stable jockey after Kieren Fallon's acquittal on race-fixing charges was quickly followed by a second drugs suspension. However the introduction of Johnny Murtagh to Ballydoyle was to prove a baptism of fire and assisted Aidan in what was to be a vintage Ballydoyle year, equalling his previous best Group 1 tally of 23. As a team Aidan and Johnny were to dominate the Irish classic scene taking all five Irish Classic Races thus being the first trainer to do so since 1935. He again was named Champion trainer in Britain taking his second title in a row. He equalled former Ballydoyle resident Vincent O'Brien's record of 6 winners at Royal Ascot, four of these at the highest level including Yeats' record-equalling third consecutive Ascot Gold Cup. Henrythenavigator won both the Irish and English 2000 Guineas, and followed up with the St James's Palace Stakes. Duke of Marmalade won 5 times at group 1 level and was considered by many to be the Champion older male horse in Europe at middle distances. Other highlights through the year were provided by Halfway to Heaven, Frozen Fire, Mastercraftsman, Mount Nelson, Fame and Glory, Septimus and Moonstone. *2016 Season Aidan O’Brien won a record 7 races at Royal Ascot in 2016. *2017 season O'Brien set a new world record by training 26 Group or Grade 1 winners in one calendar year when Saxon Warrior won the Racing Post Trophy at Doncaster, which beat the US-based Bobby Frankel's 2003 mark of 25. By the end of the year O'Brien extended the record to 28. Coolmore Stud O'Brien is backed by the Coolmore operation. The Coolmore operation is renowned for high-priced yearling purchases at the Keeneland September Yearling Sales and elsewhere.

Located on a single site in South Road, about a mile from the center of Taunton, it offers A-level courses, apprenticeships and vocational courses. The college has around 2,000 full-time students aged 16–18 studying A Levels and BTEC courses, and 500 studying for apprenticeships and professional qualifications. A small number of GCSEs are offered for 16-year-old students wanting to progress to the sixth form. History The college is named after Richard Huish, a Taunton wool merchant in the 17th century who invested in property in London. He died in 1615 and his will included an endowment to establish almshouses in Taunton and support local people's university education. Increased income from the properties in the nineteenth century allowed this to be expanded to create both boys and girls schools in Taunton. The boys' school opened in 1875 in what are now the town's Municipal Buildings but by 1891 had moved to East Street. The girls' school opened in The Crescent in 1876 but the charity was unable to support both schools so the girls' school was funded by Bishop Fox's endowment from 1890. Since 1979, Richard Huish College has been a sixth form college. Campus Willow building The college occupies a site of 8 hectares (20 acres), of which 70% is sports fields, in the south of Taunton. Its buildings, which range in age from 1880 to 2015, take their names from some of the trees that cover the campus. The site is alleged to have previously been an Aboretum. Over the period 2000–2009, a variety of building projects resulted in the Willow Building, the Hawthorn Building, Linden, and in 2009 Rowan House. In 2003, the Learning Centre at the heart of the campus, which is named after the science- fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke, a former pupil of Huish's Grammar School, was extended and completely refurbished. In 2006 the sports dome was opened, which at the time was a ground breaking project for an inflatable dome for sports. It is due to be replaced during 2016, by a sports hall, including a viewing area, gym, changing facilities and a classroom. During 2015, a new cafe area and social space was built, including the first floor Redwood Suite. The cafe area includes a Costa Coffee. The Redwood Centre was renovated to house the drama and dance studios. Curriculum The college offers a large range of A Level and BTEC subjects. There are more than 45 subjects offered at A Level (Level 3). As well as traditional school subjects, many other A Level subjects are offered such as archaeology, classical civilisation, dance, economics, environmental studies, geology, government and politics, law, photography, psychology, sociology and statistics. An increasing range of BTEC courses (Level 3 vocational courses equivalent to A Levels) are offered. They currently include applied science, business, creative media production, graphic design, health and social care/health sciences, information technology, music production, popular music and sport. A small number of GCSEs are offered for those wanting to progress to the sixth form. The College places a strong emphasis on the breadth of its enrichment activities for students. The college also delivers apprenticeships and traineeships in the areas of accountancy, medical administration, business and administration, call centre operations, customer service, healthcare, IT user and IT professional, team leading and management, health and social care. At Level 4 and above, the college offers FdA and BA degrees in business and sports development and coaching, and professional courses in Accountancy (AAT, ACCA and CIMA) and Institute of Leadership and Management course (ILM). There are also short courses in computer skills and bespoke training services. Exam results The college's A2-Level exam results are as follows: *2003/2004 - 99.3% pass rate *2004/2005 - 99.7% pass rate: A-B: 71% *2005/2006 - 99.8%+ pass rate: A-B: 75% *2006/2007 - 99.2%+ pass rate: A-B: 74% *2007/2008 - 99%+ pass rate: A-B: 55% *2008/2009 - 99%+ pass rate: A-B: 69% *2009/2010 - 99.3% pass rate: A-B: 55.9% *2010/2011 - 99.4% pass rate: A-B: 58.8% *2011/2012 - 99.1% pass rate: A-B: 56.5% *2012/2013 - 99.1% pass rate: A-B: 55.2% *2013/2014 - 98.7% pass rate: A-B: 55% *2014/2015 - 99% pass rate: A-B: 57%  Notable students  *Gareth Andrew, cricketer currently playing for Oxfordshire, former player of Worcestershire, Somerset and Hampshire Cricket Clubs *Andrew Castle, former British number one tennis player and television presenter *Matt Chorley, journalist and broadcaster. https://www.somersetcountygazette.co.uk/news/18407482.matt-chorley-host- political-show-times-radio/ *Arthur C.

In 2003 he was voted the greatest influence in horse racing history in a worldwide poll hosted by the Racing Post. In earlier Racing Post polls he was voted the best ever trainer of national hunt and of flat racehorses. He trained six horses to win the Epsom Derby, won three Grand Nationals in succession and trained the only British Triple Crown winner, Nijinsky, since the Second World War. He was twice British champion trainer in flat racing and also twice in national hunt racing; the only trainer in history to have been champion under both rules. Aidan O'Brien (no relation) took over the Ballydoyle stables after his retirement. The National Hunt years His training career started in 1944. That year, he did the Irish Cambridgeshire/Irish Cesarewitch double with Drybob (dead heat) and Good Days. In his early days Vincent O'Brien was a trainer at Churchtown of steeplechasers and hurdlers, and won the Grand National at Liverpool three times in succession, with three different horses – Early Mist in 1953, Royal Tan in 1954, and Quare Times in 1955. The greatest steeplechaser he trained was Cottage Rake, which won the Cheltenham Gold Cup three times in succession (1948–1950). He later trained Knock Hard to also win the Cheltenham Gold Cup (1953). He also won the Champion Hurdle three years in succession with Hatton's Grace (1949–1951). In 1951 he moved to and established the now famous Ballydoyle stables near Cashel in Co. Tipperary. The flat years Soon after his third Grand National triumph, he turned his attention to flat racing, and set up his stables at Ballydoyle, near Cashel, County Tipperary. Ballymoss, owned by American businessman John McShain, was O'Brien's first top-flight flat racing horse. This colt won the Irish Derby Stakes and England's St. Leger Stakes in 1957 and France's Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe in 1958, en route to earning European Horse of the Year honours. For another American, Alice du Pont Mills, he trained the filly Glad Rags who in 1966 gave him his only win in the 1,000 Guineas Stakes. O'Brien's first Epsom Derby winner was Larkspur in 1962. His other Derby winners were Sir Ivor (1968), Nijinsky (1970), Roberto (1972), The Minstrel (1977) and finally Golden Fleece (1982). O'Brien also trained the brilliant dual Prix de L'Arc de Triomphe winner, Alleged, which triumphed in 1977 and 1978. During the 1970s, he and owner Robert Sangster, along with O'Brien's son-in-law, John Magnier, established what became known as the Coolmore syndicate, which became a highly successful horse-racing and breeding operation, centred on Coolmore Stud in County Tipperary, and later incorporating stud farms in Kentucky and Australia. The combination of Vincent O'Brien's incredible gift for picking world class horses and John Magnier's business mind propelled Coolmore Stud to the top of the racing world, boasting greater assets than any other racing stud in Europe, the Middle East, or America. The key to the success was through use of the bloodline of a Canadian-bred horse named Northern Dancer, who had won a Kentucky Derby. One son of Northern Dancer was the British Triple Crown winner, Nijinsky, probably the best horse O'Brien ever trained. Nijinsky was ranked the best ever winner of the Epsom Derby by a panel of experts assembled by the Daily Telegraph in 2018.Why Nijinsky rules supreme as the greatest champion”. Daily Telegraph, 2 June 2018 He was ridden to victory at Epsom by Lester Piggott, who was associated with the Ballydoyle stable during the most successful years of the late sixties and seventies. Other outstanding flat racehorses trained by Vincent O'Brien include: Gladness, Valoris, Pieces of Eight, Long Look, Boucher, Thatch, Lisadell, Abergwaun, Home Guard, Apalachee, Artaius, Try My Best, Cloonlara, Godswalk, Be My Guest, Marinsky, Lady Capulet, Solinus, Jaazeiro, Thatching, Monterverdi, Solford, Bluebird, Lomond, Godetia, Storm Bird, Kings Lake, Caerleon, El Prado, Woodstream, Capriciossa, Prince of Birds, Dark Lomond and College Chapel. He trained Sadler's Wells (by Northern Dancer) to win the Beresford Stakes, Irish 2000 Guineas, Eclipse Stakes and Irish Champion Stakes. Sadlers Wells went on to become the greatest ever European sire and an outstanding 'sire of sires' including Galileo, Montjeu and El Prado. Vincent O'Brien retired from training in 1994, four years after winning the 1990 Breeders' Cup Mile at Belmont Park in New York with Royal Academy. Aidan O'Brien was then employed by Coolmore to take over the training responsibilities of Vincent O'Brien. Unlike Vincent, who was involved in every stage of the horses' selecting, training and breeding, Aidan's role involves training whatever horses have been bought or bred for him by Coolmore. This narrow focus has allowed Aidan to produce a great number of winners from Vincent's first rate bloodline of horses, maintaining Coolmore's status as the biggest bloodstock company in the world. In spring 1960, Vincent O'Brien was banned by the Irish Turf Club until November 1961 when after winning a minor race at the Curragh, the colt Chamour was found to have a minute amount of a substance resembling an amphetamine in his system.https://www.researchgate.net/publication/301342731_Vincent_O'Brien_Biography The horse subsequently won the 1960 Irish Derby when trained by Vincent's brother, Phonsie. O’Brien fought the ban which was overturned on 27 May 1961 with O’Brien receiving a full apology. Accolades Vincent O'Brien was voted the greatest national hunt trainer of the 20th century, and was then voted the greatest flat trainer of the 20th century.2015 Biography of Vincent O'Brien In the vote for the greatest figure in the history of horseracing hosted by the Racing Post newspaper, Vincent O'Brien came first with 28% of the total vote, with his long-time stable jockey Lester Piggott placed second out of a pool of 100 contenders selected by a panel of racing experts. He was awarded the honorary degrees of Doctor of Laws (LLD) honoris causa by the National University of Ireland, and Doctor of Science (DSc) honoris causa by the University of Ulster. In 1949, he pioneered the transportation of horses to the races by plane when he transported 3 horses to the 1949 Cheltenham festival in a converted RAF freighter aeroplane. All 3 won their races. Family Vincent O'Brien married Jacqueline Wittenoom, from Perth, Australia, in 1951 and had five children, daughters Elizabeth (widow of Kevin McClory), Susan (wife of John Magnier) and Jane (wife of Philip Myerscough); and sons Charles and David who followed in their father's footsteps as trainers, as did Vincent's grandson David Myerscough. Grandsons J P Magnier and M V Magnier have ridden with success as amateur jockeys. Charles was married to Anne Heffernan and had two children (Michael Vincent O'Brien Jr. and Katherine Margaret O'Brien). The marriage was dissolved and he subsequently married Tammy Twomey. They had two daughters (Emily Jillian O'Brien and Penny Jacqueline O'Brien). Altogether Vincent and Jacqueline had 5 children and 19 grandchildren. O'Brien's older son, David won The Derby in 1984 with Secreto, beating his father's horse, El Gran Senor, by a short head. David, who also won the Irish and French Derbies in 1982 with Assert, is the youngest ever trainer to win an Epsom Derby, an Irish Derby, or a French Derby. However, in a decision that shocked the racing world, David suddenly retired from horse racing in 1988 following the birth of his third son, Charles.

Early life and workEarly life= Scheib was born on May 3, 1954, in Oakland, California, to Walter S. Scheib Jr. and his wife, Jean Scheib. His father worked for the Atomic Energy Commission, and his mother was an accountant. The Scheibs moved to Bethesda, Maryland, when Walter was a young boy. Scheib's mother was a devotee of French cooking long before it became popular in the United States, often making paella and bouillabaisse. She also cooked Spanish cuisine, and taught Walter to appreciate unusual flavor combinations. Scheib's favorite television programs were The Galloping Gourmet with Graham Kerr and The French Chef with Julia Child. He asked his mother to allow him to chop vegetable or prepare food so often, that in time he became extremely proficient at cooking and was allowed to prepare all the family's meals. In his teens, he worked in local restaurants as a pot washer, busboy, and prep cook. Scheib graduated from Walter Johnson High School in Bethesda in 1972. He enrolled at the University of Maryland, College Park, but quit and enrolled at The Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park, New York, where he graduated in 1979. =Early work= After a period where he worked in France, Scheib moved to Washington, D.C., where he found work as a line chef in the kitchen at the Capital Hilton. Within three years, he had risen to the position of chef de cuisine (executive chef). He moved to the Boca Raton Resort and Club in Boca Raton, Florida, in 1986, where he served four years as the executive chef. Scheib then returned to D.C., where he served briefly as executive chef at the Mayflower Hotel. In 1990, he took a position as the executive chef at The Greenbrier, a luxury resort near White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia. At The Greenbrier, Scheib directed a staff of 200, and often prepared as many as 1,000 meals a night. White HouseAuditioning= The White House kitchen had been dominated from 1966 to 1987 by Henry Haller, a Swiss-trained chef who emphasized French cooking. His successor, Jon Hill, lasted just five months before being replaced by long-time sous-chef Hans Raffert, but Raffert retired in October 1992, and French-born and trained chef Pierre Chambrin, who succeeded Raffert, was asked to resign in March 1994 after refusing to cook the low-fat American cuisine favored by President Bill and First Lady Hillary Clinton. Most of Chambrin's staff were also asked to leave. Scheib's mother had just died, and Scheib did not want to take on a new job. Scheib's wife submitted his résumé without his knowledge. He was among 4,000 applicants for the position, and one of just five asked to audition for the First Lady. Mrs. Clinton was impressed with Scheib's managerial skills and ability to prepare hundreds of first-class meals in a short period of time. She also wanted the White House to feature more distinctively American cooking techniques, dishes, and presentation, something she believed Scheib could bring to the White House. She also wanted to get away from the cream- and fat-heavy dishes of French cooking. Scheib was competing against some of the best chefs in the United States, including Nora Pouillon and Patrick Clark (then at the Hay–Adams Hotel). Scheib auditioned before the First Lady and several other women by presenting pecan-encrusted lamb, red-curried sweet potatoes, and morel sauce. While other chefs primarily brought in dishes they normally serve in their restaurants, Scheib's lunch featured a wide variety of American cuisines: Cal-Italian, Mid-Atlantic, Southwestern, Floridian, and even a vegetarian serving. Hillary Clinton hired Scheib after Clark, her first choice, turned her down. =Clinton years= Among Scheib's immediate innovations as White House Executive Chef was the establishment of a vegetable garden on the roof of the White House and the modernization of the kitchen in 1993. He also taught Chelsea Clinton how to cook. Meeting the dining needs of the Clintons was demanding. Hillary Clinton enjoyed hot sauces, and Bill Clinton loved to gorge on cheeseburgers and a 24-ounce porterhouse steak with béarnaise sauce and onion rings whenever the First Lady was absent. Chelsea Clinton's decision to become a vegetarian in 1999 created major problems for the kitchen staff, who could no longer use the same utensils and pans for cooking meat and vegetables. =Bush years and dismissal= White House Executive Chefs do not normally change when a new administration arrives, and, as usual, President George W. Bush and First Lady Laura Bush retained Scheib when they entered the White House in 2000. However, the Bushes had different tastes and styles than the Clintons. Laura Bush wanted a more formal presentation at meals, and President Bush disliked soup, salad, and poached fish—staples of Scheib's cuisine. Instead, the president favored peanut butter and honey sandwiches, BLTs, and cheeseburgers. The twin Bush girls both required that the calories in each meal be given to them. After the September 11 attacks in 2001, Scheib's cooking duties were largely restricted to the First Family, as all social engagements at the White House were curtailed for nearly a year. President Bush affectionately called Scheib \\"Cookie\\". Tension between the Bushes and Scheib was soon apparent. An anonymous White House staffer later claimed that Scheib kept serving the Bushes scallops, even though they disliked them. Scheib angrily denied the assertion. The differences became too great, and Scheib was fired by the Bushes in February 2005. He was succeeded in August 2005 by Cristeta Comerford, a White House sous-chef whom Scheib had hired in 1995. During both the Clinton and Bush administrations, Scheib usually served three meals a day to the First Family. He often worked long hours each day (with no overtime), and as many as six days a week. The number of expected guests at both informal and formal dining occasions fluctuated greatly, and pleasing both First Families took a great deal of attention and care. Both the Bushes and Clintons loved enchiladas, fresh fruit, salads, and sorbets, and both presidents asked for junk food when their wives were not present. During his tenure at the White House, Scheib cooked for a large number of heads of state and VIPs, including Akihito, Emperor of Japan; Tony Blair, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom; Diana, Princess of Wales; Jacques Chirac, President of France; Nelson Mandela, the President of South Africa; and Boris Yeltsin, the first President of Russia. Post-White House In 2007, Scheib authored (with Andrew Friedman) a memoir, The White House Chef: Eleven Years, Two Presidents, One Kitchen. He subsequently formed a corporation, The American Chef, which provided his services as a consultant and lecturer, and assisted in planning, preparing, and presenting Scheib-cooked meals for large groups. Between 2007 and 2015, he traveled to nearly every U.S. state and to 154 countries. Scheib appeared on the television series Iron Chef America, which aired on the Food Network, in 2006. =Death= Scheib went hiking in Taos, New Mexico, and went missing on June 13, 2015. He was found dead on June 21, 2015. An autopsy revealed that Scheib died from drowning on or about June 13. However, due to the cold water temperature of the ravine he was found in, his body was preserved in a manner that made it impossible to determine how long his body had been there. The area where he was hiking is prone to flash floods, and thunderstorms had struck the area the day he went missing. Personal life Scheib met his first wife, Jean Prince, at the Capital Hilton, where she was working as a chef. The couple had two sons, Walter S. Scheib IV (born in 1988) and James Prince (born in 1991). Their marriage ended in divorce. Scheib then married Yvonne Swartz, but their relationship also ended in divorce.

The genus is a member of the family Brassicaceae (formerly Cruciferae), in the division Magnoliophyta of the class Magnoliopsida. The plant is a small gray annual herb that rarely grows above high, and bears minute white flowers. It is a tumbleweed page 359 pages 36-37 pages 204-205 and a resurrection plant. This species is not to be confused with Selaginella lepidophylla, also sometimes referred to as \\"rose of Jericho\\", or \\"false rose of Jericho\\". Names Common names include Maryam's flower, flower of St Mary, St. Mary's flower, Mary's flower, white mustard flower , and rose of Jericho. Range Anastatica is found in arid areas in the Middle East and the Sahara Desert, including parts of North Africa and regions of Iran, Egypt, Palestine, Israel, Syria, Iraq, Jordan, and Pakistan.Anastatica hierochuntica in Flora of Pakistan @ efloras.org Description A plant with great resistance to desiccation, its branches have the property of contracting with dryness, remaining closed and dry for many years, reopening with moisture or contact with water, regaining all its freshness and beauty. After the rainy season, the plant dries up, dropping leaves and curling branches into a tight ball, and aestivates. Within the ball, the fruits remain attached and closed, protecting the seeds and preventing them from being dispersed prematurely. The seeds are very hardy and can remain dormant for years. Moistened again in a later rainy season, the ball uncurls and the plant wakes up from its dormant state, which causes the capsular fruits to open to disperse the seeds. If water is sufficient, the dispersed seeds germinate within hours. After it curls, it is easy for the wind itself to lift and drag it large distances, making them obligatory travellers through steppes and deserts crossing the borders of various countries in Asia and disseminating their seeds for all of them. A fraction of the seeds are dispersed in the vicinity of the parent plant by raindrops hitting a spoon-like appendix on the seeds. The seeds have a sticky coat that helps them adhere to the soil, but they also may be carried downstream by surface wash. However, seeds swept downstream do not survive. The process of curling and uncurling is completely reversible and can be repeated many times. The ability of the plant to do this is attributed to the presence of trehalose, pages 121-122 a disaccharide sugar involved in several mechanisms of cryptobiosis. Although the rehydrated plant sometimes is described as putting out new leaves, flowers, and fruits, pages 175-176 this is disputed; instead, the seeds may sometimes germinate and sprout new plants while still seated in the fruit on the dead parent plant. Anastatica has been described as the most famous tumble weed. page 83 Once dry, the ball is said to become detached and is dispersed by wind. This tumbleweed habit has been interpreted as a mechanism of avoiding burial in dunes. However, Anastatica may possess this habit only in the literature, or tumble only rarely, if uprooted by accident. page 16 Culture Since ancient times it was used as an element to guess the climate, since being a vegetable hygrometer, the wise man or shaman, predicted it with success. In dry weather the plant remains completely closed; in wet weather, it opens slowly; if it threatens rain, it opens in a very showy way and with more or less speed according to the proximity of discharge of the clouds.

The resulting civil war lasted 11 years, enveloped the country, and left over 50,000 dead.Gberie, p. 6 During the first year of the war, the RUF took control of large swathes of territory in eastern and southern Sierra Leone, which were rich in alluvial diamonds. The government's ineffective response to the RUF, and the disruption in government diamond production, precipitated a military coup d'état in April 1992 by the National Provisional Ruling Council (NPRC).Gberie, p. 103 By the end of 1993, the Sierra Leone Army (SLA) had succeeded in pushing the RUF rebels back to the Liberian border, but the RUF recovered and fighting continued. In March 1995, Executive Outcomes (EO), a South Africa-based private military company, was hired to repel the RUF. Sierra Leone installed an elected civilian government in March 1996, and the retreating RUF signed the Abidjan Peace Accord. Under UN pressure, the government terminated its contract with EO before the accord could be implemented, and hostilities recommenced.Keen, p. 111Abdullah, p. 118 In May 1997 a group of disgruntled SLA officers staged a coup and established the Armed Forces Revolutionary Council (AFRC) as the new government of Sierra Leone.Abdullah, p.180 The RUF joined with the AFRC to capture Freetown with little resistance. The new government, led by Johnny Paul Koroma, declared the war over. A wave of looting, rape, and murder followed the announcement.Gberie, p. 102 Reflecting international dismay at the overturning of the civilian government, ECOMOG forces intervened and retook Freetown on behalf of the government, but they found the outlying regions more difficult to pacify. In January 1999, world leaders intervened diplomatically to promote negotiations between the RUF and the government. The Lome Peace Accord, signed on 27 March 1999, was the result. Lome gave Foday Sankoh, the commander of the RUF, the vice presidency and control of Sierra Leone's diamond mines in return for a cessation of the fighting and the deployment of a UN peacekeeping force to monitor the disarmament process. RUF compliance with the disarmament process was inconsistent and sluggish, and by May 2000, the rebels were advancing again upon Freetown.Abdullah, pp. 214–17 As the UN mission began to fail, the United Kingdom declared its intention to intervene in the former colony and Commonwealth member in an attempt to support the weak government of President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah. With help from a renewed UN mandate and Guinean air support, the British Operation Palliser finally defeated the RUF, taking control of Freetown. On 18 January 2002, President Kabbah declared the Sierra Leone Civil War over. Causes of the warPolitical history= In 1961, Sierra Leone gained its independence from the United Kingdom. In the years following the death of Sierra Leone’s first prime minister Sir Milton Margai in 1964, politics in the country were increasingly characterized by corruption, mismanagement, and electoral violence that led to a weak civil society, the collapse of the education system, and, by 1991, an entire generation of dissatisfied youth were attracted to the rebellious message of the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) and joined the organization.Abdullah, p. 90Abdullah, pp. 240–41 Albert Margai, unlike his half-brother Milton, did not see the state as a steward of the public, but instead as a tool for personal gain and self-aggrandizement and even used the military to suppress multi- party elections that threatened to end his rule.Gberie, p. 26 When Siaka Stevens entered politics in 1968, Sierra Leone was a constitutional democracy. When he stepped down, seventeen years later, Sierra Leone was a one-party state.Gberie, p. 28 Stevens' rule, sometimes called \\"the 17 year plague of locusts\\", saw the destruction and perversion of every state institution. Parliament was undermined, judges were bribed, and the treasury was bankrupted to finance pet projects that supported insiders.Abdullah, p. 93 When Stevens failed to co-opt his opponents, he often resorted to state sanctioned executions or exile. In 1985, Stevens stepped down, and handed the nation’s preeminent position to Major General Joseph Momoh, a notoriously inept leader who maintained the status quo. During his seven-year tenure, Momoh welcomed the spread of unchecked corruption and complete economic collapse. With the state unable to pay its civil servants, those desperate enough ransacked and looted government offices and property. Even in Freetown, important commodities like gasoline were scarce. But the government hit rock bottom when it could no longer pay schoolteachers and the education system collapsed. Since only wealthy families could afford to pay private tutors, the bulk of Sierra Leone’s youth during the late 1980s roamed the streets aimlessly.Gberie, p. 45 As infrastructure and public ethics deteriorated in tandem, much of Sierra Leone’s professional class fled the country. By 1991, Sierra Leone was ranked as one of the poorest countries in the world, even though it benefited from ample natural resources including diamonds, gold, bauxite, rutile, iron ore, fish, coffee, and cocoa. =Diamonds and the \\"resource curse\\"= The Eastern and Southern districts in Sierra Leone, most notably the Kono and Kenema districts, are rich in alluvial diamonds, and more importantly, are easily accessible by anyone with a shovel, sieve, and transport.Abdullah, p. 106 Since their discovery in the early 1930s, diamonds have been critical in financing the continuing pattern of corruption and personal aggrandizement at the expense of needed public services, institutions, and infrastructure.Gberie, p. 18 The phenomenon whereby countries with an abundance of natural resources tend to nonetheless be characterized by lower levels of economic development is known as the \\"resource curse\\". Alluvial diamond miner The presence of diamonds in Sierra Leone invited and led to the civil war in several ways. First, the highly unequal benefits resulting from diamond mining made ordinary Sierra Leoneans frustrated. Under the Stevens government, revenues from the National Diamond Mining Corporation (known as DIMINCO) – a joint government/DeBeers venture – were used for the personal enrichment of Stevens and of members of the government and business elite who were close to him.Keen, p. 23 When DeBeers pulled out of the venture in 1984, the government lost direct control of the diamond mining areas. By the late 1980s, almost all of Sierra Leone's diamonds were being smuggled and traded illicitly, with revenues going directly into the hands of private investors.Keen, p. 22Hirsch, pp. 27–28 In this period the diamond trade was dominated by Lebanese traders and later (after a shift in favor on the part of the Momoh government) by Israelis with connections to the international diamond markets in Antwerp. Momoh made some efforts to reduce smuggling and corruption in the diamond mining sector, but he lacked the political clout to enforce the law. Even after the National Provisional Ruling Council (NPRC) took power in 1992, ostensibly with the goal of reducing corruption and returning revenues to the state, high-ranking members of the government sold diamonds for their personal gain and lived extravagantly off the proceeds.Abdullah, p. 95 Diamonds also helped to arm the RUF rebels who used funds harvested from the alluvial diamond mines to purchase weapons and ammunition from neighboring Guinea, Liberia, and even SLA soldiers.Abdullah, p. 100 But the most significant connection between diamonds and war is that the presence of easily extractable diamonds provided an incentive for violence.Gberie, p. 184 To maintain control of important mining districts like Kono, thousands of civilians were expelled and kept away from these important economic centers. Although diamonds were a significant motivating and sustaining factor, there were other means of profiting from the Sierra Leone Civil War. For instance, gold mining was prominent in some regions. Even more common was cash crop farming through the use of forced labor. Looting during the Sierra Leone Civil War did not just center on diamonds, but also included that of currency, household items, food, livestock, cars, and international aid shipments. For Sierra Leoneans who did not have access to arable land, joining the rebel cause was an opportunity to seize property through the use of deadly force.Gberie, p. 85 But the most important reason why the civil war should not be entirely attributed to conflict over the economic benefits incurred from the alluvial diamond mines is that the pre-war frustrations and grievances did not just concern that of the diamond sector. More than twenty years of poor governance, poverty, corruption and oppression created the circumstances for the rise of the RUF, as ordinary people yearned for change.Abdullah, p. 99 =The demographics of rebel recruitment= As a result of the First Liberian Civil War, 80,000 refugees fled neighboring Liberia for the Sierra Leone – Liberian border. This displaced population, composed almost entirely of children, would prove to be an invaluable asset to the invading rebel armies because the refugee and detention centers, populated first by displaced Liberians and later by Sierra Leoneans, helped provide the manpower for the RUF’s insurgency.Gberie, p. 56 The RUF took advantage of the refugees, who were abandoned, starving, and in dire need of medical attention, by promising food, shelter, medical care, and looting and mining profits in return for their support.Gberie, p. 59 When this method of recruitment failed, as it often did for the RUF, youths were often coerced at the barrel of a gun to join the ranks of the RUF. After being forced to join, many child soldiers learned that the complete lack of law – as a result of the civil war – provided a unique opportunity for self-empowerment through violence and thus continued to support the rebel cause.Gberie, p. 151 =Libyan and arms dealing role= Muammar al-Gaddafi both trained and supported Charles Taylor. Gaddafi also helped Foday Sankoh, the founder of Revolutionary United Front. Russian businessman Viktor Bout supplied Charles Taylor with arms for use in Sierra Leone and had meetings with him about the operations.Merchant of death: money, guns, planes, and the man who makes war possible. Douglas Farah, Stephen Braun. p. 164 The Sierra Leone Civil WarSLA response; Sobels= SLA soldiers and advisers The initial rebellion could have easily been quelled in the first half of 1991. But the RUF – despite being both numerically inferior and extremely brutal against civilians – controlled two-thirds of Sierra Leone by the year’s end. The SLA’s equally poor behavior made this outcome possible.Abdullah, p. 106 Often afraid to directly confront or unable to locate the elusive RUF, government soldiers were brutal and indiscriminate in their search for rebels or sympathizers among the civilian population. After retaking captured towns, the SLA would perform a ‘mopping up’ operation in which the towns people were transported to concentration camp styled ‘strategic hamlets’ far from their homes in Eastern and Southern Sierra Leone under the pretense of separating the population from the insurgents. However, in many cases, this was followed by much looting and theft after the villagers were evacuated.Gberie, p. 127 The SLA's sordid behavior inevitably led to the alienation of many civilians and pushed some Sierra Leoneans to join the rebel cause. With morale low and rations even lower, many SLA soldiers discovered that they could do better by joining with the rebels in looting civilians in the countryside instead of fighting against them. The local civilians referred to these soldiers as ‘sobels’ or ‘soldiers by day, rebels by night’ because of their close ties to the RUF. By mid-1993, the two opposing sides became virtually indistinguishable. For these reasons, civilians increasingly relied on an irregular force called the Kamajors for their protection.Abdullah, p. 4 =Rise of the Kamajors= A grassroots militia force, the Kamajors operated invisibly in familiar territory and was a significant impediment to marauding government and RUF troops.Gberie, p. 110 For displaced and unprotected Sierra Leonans, joining the Kamajors was a means of taking up arms to defend family and home due to the SLA’s perceived incompetence and active collusion with the rebel enemy. The Kamajors clashed with both government and RUF forces and was instrumental in countering government soldiers and rebels who were looting villages.Abdullah, p. 168 The success of the Kamajors raised calls for its expansion, and members of street gangs and deserters were also co-opted into the organization. However, the Kamajors became corrupt and deeply involved in extortion, murder, and kidnappings by the end of the conflict.Gberie, p. 134 =National Provisional Ruling Council= Within one year of fighting, the RUF offensive had stalled, but it still remained in control of large territories in Eastern and Southern Sierra Leone leaving many villages unprotected while also disrupting food and government diamond production. Soon the government was unable to pay both its civil servants and the SLA. As a result, the Momoh regime lost all remaining credibility and a group of disgruntled junior officers led by Captain Valentine Strasser overthrew Momoh on 29 April 1992.Abdullah, p.105 Strasser justified the coup and the establishment of the National Provisional Ruling Council (NPRC) by referencing the corrupt Momoh regime and its inability to resuscitate the economy, provide for the people of Sierra Leone, and repel the rebel invaders. The NPRC’s coup was largely popular because it promised to bring peace to Sierra Leone.Gberie, p. 72 But the NPRC’s promise would prove to be short lived.Gberie, p. 74 Woman in a Sierra Leone village In March 1993, with much help from ECOMOG troops provided by Nigeria, the SLA recaptured the Koidu and Kono diamond districts and pushed the RUF to the Sierra Leone – Liberia border.Gberie, p. 65 The RUF was facing supply problems as the United Liberation Movement of Liberia for Democracy (ULIMO) gains inside Liberia were restricting the ability of Charles Taylor’s NPFL to trade with the RUF. By the end of 1993, many observers thought that the war was over because for the first time in the conflict the Sierra Leone Army was able to establish itself in the Eastern and the Southern mining districts.Abdullah, p. 108 However, with senior government officials neglectful of the conditions faced by SLA soldiers, front line soldiers became resentful of their poor conditions and began helping themselves to Sierra Leone’s rich natural resources.Gberie, p. 180 This included alluvial diamonds as well as looting and ‘sell game’, a tactic in which government forces would withdraw from a town but not before leaving arms and ammunition for the roving rebels in return for cash. Renegade SLA soldiers even clashed with Kamajor units on a number of occasions when the Kamajors intervened to halt the looting and mining. The NPRC government also had a motivation for allowing the war to continue, since as long as the country was at war the military government would not be called upon to hand over rule to a democratically elected civilian government. The war dragged on as a low intensity conflict until January 1995 when RUF forces and dissident SLA elements seized the SIEROMCO (bauxite) and Sierra Rutile (titanium dioxide) mines in the Moyamba and Bonthe districts in the country's south west, furthering the government’s economic struggles and enabling a renewed RUF advance on the capital at Freetown.Gberie, pp. 106 and 88 =Executive Outcomes= In March 1995, with the RUF within twenty miles of Freetown, Executive Outcomes, a private military company from South Africa, arrived in Sierra Leone. The government paid EO $1.8 million per month (financed primarily by the International Monetary Fund), to accomplish three goals: return the diamond and mineral mines to the government, locate and destroy the RUF’s headquarters, and operate a successful propaganda program that would encourage local Sierra Leoneans to support the government of Sierra Leone.Abdullah, p. 90 EO’s military force consisted of 500 military advisers and 3,000 highly trained and well-equipped combat-ready soldiers, backed by tactical air support and transport. Executive Outcomes employed black Angolans and Namibians from apartheid-era South Africa’s former 32 Battalion, with an officer corps of white South Africans.Gberie, p. 93 Harper’s Magazine described this controversial unit as a collection of former spies, assassins, and crack bush guerrillas, most of whom had served for fifteen to twenty years in South Africa’s most notorious counter insurgency units.Gberie, p. 94 As a military force, EO was extremely skilled and conducted a highly successful counter insurgency against the RUF. In just ten days of fighting, EO was able to drive the RUF forces back sixty miles into the interior of the country. EO outmatched the RUF forces in all operations. In just seven months, EO, with support from loyal SLA and the Kamajors battalions, recaptured the diamond mining districts and the Kangari Hills, a major RUF stronghold.Abdullah, p. 96 A second offensive captured the provincial capital and the largest city in Sierra Leone and destroyed the RUF’s main base of operations near Bo, finally forcing the RUF to admit defeat and sign the Abidjan Peace Accord in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire on 30 November 1996.Gberie, p. 95 This period of relative peace also allowed the country to hold parliamentary and presidential elections in February and March 1996. Ahmad Tejan Kabbah (of the Sierra Leone People's Party [SLPP]), a diplomat who had worked at the UN for more than 20 years, won the presidential election.Abdullah, p. 144 =Abidjan Peace Accord= The Abidjan Peace Accord mandated that Executive Outcomes was to pull out within five weeks after the arrival of a neutral peacekeeping force. The main stumbling block that prevented Sankoh from signing the agreement sooner was the number and type of peacekeepers that were to monitor the ceasefire.Gberie, p. 161Abdullah, p. 206 Additionally, continued Kamajor attacks and the fear of punitive tribunals following demobilization kept many rebels in the bush despite their dire situation. However, in January 1997, the Kabbah government – beset by demands to reduce expenditures by the International Monetary Fund – ordered EO to leave the country, even though a neutral monitoring force had yet to arrive.Gberie, p. 95 The departure of EO opened up an opportunity for the RUF to regroup for renewed military attacks. The March 1997 arrest of RUF leader Foday Sankoh in Nigeria also angered RUF members, who reacted with escalated violence. By the end of March 1997, the peace accord had collapsed. =AFRC/RUF coup and interregnum= Freetown, Sierra Leone After the departure of Executive Outcomes, the credibility of the Kabbah government declined, especially among members of the SLA, who saw themselves being eclipsed by both the RUF on one side and the independent but pro-government Kamajors on the other.Abdullah, pp. 118–19 On 25 May 1997, a group of disgruntled SLA officers freed and armed 600 prisoners from the Pademba Road prison in Freetown. One of the prisoners, Major Johnny Paul Koroma, emerged as the leader of the coup and the Armed Forces Revolutionary Council (AFRC) proclaimed itself the new government of Sierra Leone. After receiving the blessing of Foday Sankoh, who was then living under house arrest in Nigeria, members of the RUF – supposedly on its last legs – were ordered out of the bush to participate in the coup. Without hesitation and encountering only light resistance from SLA loyalists, 5,000 rag-tag rebel fighters marched 100 miles and overran the capital. Without fear or reluctance, RUF and SLA dissidents then proceeded to parade peacefully together. Koroma then appealed to Nigeria for the release of Sankoh, appointing the absent leader to the position of deputy chairman of the AFRC. The joint AFRC/RUF leadership then proclaimed that the war had been won, and a great wave of looting and reprisals against civilians in Freetown (dubbed \\"Operation Pay Yourself\\" by some of its participants) followed.Abdullah, p. 148Gberie, p. 107 President Kabbah, surrounded only by his bodyguards, left by helicopter for exile in nearby Guinea.Gberie, p. 108 President Kabbah The AFRC junta was opposed by members of Sierra Leone's civil society such as student unions, journalists associations, women's groups and others, not only because of the violence it unleashed but because of its political attacks on press freedoms and civil rights.Abdullah, p. 156 The international response to the coup was also overwhelmingly negative.\\"The AFRC remained a pariah junta, shunned by every government in the world.\\" Abdullah, p. 156 The UN and the Organization of African Unity (OAU) condemned the coup, foreign governments withdrew their diplomats and missions (and in some cases evacuated civilians) from Freetown, and Sierra Leone's membership in the Commonwealth was suspended.Abdullah, p. 158 The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) also condemned the AFRC coup, and ECOMOG forces demanded that the new junta return power peacefully to the Kabbah government or risk sanctions and increased military presence.Gberie, p. 112 ECOMOG’s intervention in Sierra Leone brought the AFRC/RUF rebels to the negotiating table where, in October 1997, they agreed to a tentative peace known as the Conakry Peace Plan.Abdullah, p. 161 Despite having agreed to the plan, the AFRC/RUF continued to fight. In March 1998, overcoming entrenched AFRC positions, the ECOMOG forces retook the capital and reinstated the Kabbah government, but let the rebels flee without further harassment.Abdullah, p. 223Gberie, p. 121 The regions lying just beyond Freetown proved much more difficult to pacify. Thanks in part to bad road conditions, lack of support aircraft, and a revenge driven rebel force, ECOMOG’s offensive ground to a halt just outside Freetown. ECOMOG’s forces suffered from several weakness, the most important being, poor command and control, low morale, poor training in counterinsurgency, low manpower, limited air and sea capability, and poor funding. Unable to consistently defend itself against the AFRC/RUF rebels, the Kabbah regime was forced to make serious concessions in the Lome Peace Agreement of July 1999.Abdullah, p. 212 =Lome peace agreement= Given that Nigeria was due to recall its ECOMOG forces without achieving a tactical victory over the RUF, the international community intervened diplomatically to promote negotiations between the AFRC/RUF rebels and the Kabbah regime.Abdullah, p.199 The Lome Peace Accord, signed on 7 July 1999, is controversial in that Sankoh was pardoned for treason, granted the position of Vice President, and made chairman of the commission that oversaw Sierra Leone’s diamond mines.Abdullah, p. 213 In return, the RUF was ordered to demobilize and disarm its armies under the supervision of an international peacekeeping force which would initially be under the authority of both ECOMOG and the United Nations. The Lome Peace Agreement was the subject of protests both in Sierra Leone and by international human rights groups abroad, mainly because it handed over to Sankoh, the commander of the brutal RUF, the second most powerful position in the country, and control over all of Sierra Leone’s lucrative diamond mines. DDR process Following the Lome Peace Agreement, the security situation in Sierra Leone was still unstable because many rebels refused to commit themselves to the peace process.Abdullah, p.166 The Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration camps were an attempt to convince the rebel forces to literally exchange their weapons for food, clothing, and shelter.Gberie, p. 163 During a six-week quarantine period, former combatants were taught basic skills that could be put to use in a peaceful profession after they return to society. After 2001, DDR camps became increasingly effective and by 2002 they had collected over 45,000 weapons and hosted over 70,000 former combatants.Gberie, p. 187 =UNAMSIL intervention= In October 1999 the UN established the United Nations Mission to Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL). The main objective of UNAMSIL was to assist with the disarmament process and enforce the terms established under the Lome Peace Agreement. Unlike other previous neutral peacekeeping forces, UNAMSIL brought serious military power. The original multi-national force was commanded by General Vijay Jetley of India.Gberie, p. 164 Jetley later resigned and was replaced by Lieutenant General Daniel Opande of Kenya in November 2000. Jetley had accused Nigerian political and military officials at the top of the UN mission of \\"sabotaging peace\\" in favor of national interests, and alleged that Nigerian army commanders illegally mined diamonds in league with RUF. The Nigerian army called for General Jetley's resignation immediately after the report was released, saying they could no longer work with him. UNAMSIL forces began arriving in Sierra Leone in December 1999. At that time the maximum number of troops to be deployed was set at 6,000. Only a few months later, though, in February 2000, a new UN resolution authorized the deployment of 11,000 combatants. In March 2001 that number was increased to 17,500 troops, making it at the time the largest UN force in existence, and UNAMSIL soldiers were deployed in the RUF-held diamond areas. Despite these numbers, UNAMSIL was frequently rebuffed and humiliated by RUF rebels, being subjected to attacks, obstruction and disarmament. In the most egregious example, in May 2000 over 500 UNAMSIL peacekeepers were captured by the RUF and held hostage. Using the weapons and armored personnel carriers of the captured UNAMSIL troops, the rebels advanced towards Freetown, taking over the town of Lunsar to its northeast. For over a year later, the UNAMSIL force meticulously avoided intervening in RUF controlled mining districts lest another major incident occur.Gberie, p. 189 After the UNAMSIL force had essentially rearmed the RUF, a call for a new military intervention was made to save the UNAMSIL hostages and the government of Sierra Leone. After Operation Palliser and Operation Khukri the situation stabilized and UNAMSIL gain control. In late 1999, the UN Security Council asked Russia for participation in a peacekeeping mission in Sierra Leone. The Federation Council of Russia decided to send 4 Mil Mi-24 attack helicopters with 115 crew and technical personnel into Sierra Leone. Many of them had combat experience in Afghanistan and Chechnya. The destroyed Lungi civil airfield in the suburbs of Freetown became their base of operations. A Ukrainian Detached Recovery and Restoring Battalion, and aviation team were stationed near Freetown. The two post-Soviet troop contingents got along well, and left together after the UN mandate for peacekeeping operations ended in June 2005. Operation Khukri Operation Khukri was a unique multinational operation launched in the United Nations Assistance Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL), involving India, Nepal, Ghana, Britain and Nigeria. The aim of the operation was to break the two-month-long siege laid by armed cadres of the RUF around two companies of 5/8 Gorkha Rifles (GR) Infantry Battalion Group at Kailahun by affecting a fighting break out and redeploying them with the main battalion at Daru. About 120 special forces operators commanded by Major (now Lt. Col.) Harinder Sood were airlifted from New Delhi to spearhead the mission to rescue 223 men of the 5/8 Gorkha Rifles who were surrounded and besieged by the RUF rebels for over 75 days. The mission was a total success which resulted in safe rescue of all the besieged men and inflicted several hundreds of casualties on the RUF, where Indian troops were part of a multinational UN peacekeeping force. =British intervention= A British Sea Harrier jet, such as those used to support government forces In May 2000, the situation on the ground had deteriorated to such an extent that British paratroopers were deployed in Operation Palliser to evacuate foreign nationals and establish order.Gberie, p. 173 They stabilized the situation, and were the catalyst for a ceasefire that helped end the war. The British forces, under the command of Brigadier David Richards, expanded their original mandate, which was limited to evacuating commonwealth citizens, and now aimed to save UNAMSIL from the brink of collapse. At the time of the British intervention in May 2000, half of the country remained under the RUF’s control. The 1,200 man British ground force – supported by air and sea power – shifted the balance of power in favor of the government and the rebel forces were easily repelled from the areas beyond Freetown.Gberie, p. 176 =End of the war= Several factors led to the end of the civil war. First, Guinean cross-border bombing raids against villages believed to be bases used by the RUF working in conjunction with Guinean dissidents were very effective in routing the rebels.Abdullah, p. 221Gberie, p. 172 Another factor encouraging a less combative RUF was a new UN resolution that demanded that the government of Liberia expel all RUF members, end their financial support of the RUF, and halt the illicit diamond trade.Gberie, p. 170 Finally, the Kamajors, feeling less threatened now that the RUF was disintegrating in the face of a robust opponent, failed to incite violence like they had done in the past. With their backs against the wall and without any international support, the RUF forces signed a new peace treaty within a matter of weeks. On 18 January 2002, President Kabbah declared the eleven- year-long Sierra Leone Civil War officially over.Abdullah, p. 229 By most estimates, over 50,000 people had lost their lives during the war.Hirsch, p. 31 Countless more fell victim to the reprehensible and perverse behavior of the combatants. In May 2002 President Kabbah and his SLPP, won landslide victories in the presidential and legislative elections. Kabbah was re-elected for a five-year term. The RUF's political wing, the Revolutionary United Front Party (RUFP), failed to win a single seat in parliament. The elections were marked by irregularities and allegations of fraud, but not to a degree that significantly affected the outcome. War atrocities and crimes against humanity During the Sierra Leone Civil War numerous atrocities were committed including war rape, mutilation, and mass murder, causing many of the perpetrators to be tried in international criminal courts, and the establishment of a truth and reconciliation commission. A 2001 overview noted that there had been \\"serious and grotesque human rights violations\\" in Sierra Leone since its civil war began in 1991. The rebels, the Revolutionary United Front (RUF), had \\"committed horrendous abuses\\". The report noted that \\"25 times as many people\\" had already been killed in Sierra Leone than had been killed in Kosovo at the point when the international community decided to take action. \\"In fact, it has been pointed out by many that the atrocities in Sierra Leone have been worse than was seen in Kosovo.\\" A school in Koindu destroyed by RUF rebel forces. In total, 1,270 primary schools were destroyed in the War.\\"Sierra Leone\\" . 2001 Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labor. Bureau of International Labor Affairs, U.S. Department of Labor (2002) These crimes included but are not limited to: =List of crimes= *Mass killings of civilians – The most notorious mass killing was the 1999 Freetown massacre. This took place in January 1999 when the AFRC/RUF set upon Freetown in a bloody assault known as \\"Operation No Living Thing\\" in which rebels entered neighborhoods to loot, rape and kill indiscriminately.Gberie, p. 125 A Human Rights Watch reportSierra Leone: getting away with murder, mutilation, rape, Radio Netherlands Archives, January 25, 2000 documented the atrocities committed during this attack. The report estimated that over 7,000 people were killed and that at least half of them were civilians. Reports from survivors describe perverse brutality including incinerating people alive while locked in their houses, hacking civilians' hands and other limbs off with machetes and even eating them. *Drafting of Underage Soldiers – About one quarter of the soldiers serving in the government armed forces during the civil war were under age 18. \\"Recruitment methods were brutal – sometimes children were abducted, sometimes they were forced to kill members of their own families so as to make them outcasts, sometimes they were drugged, sometimes they were forced into conscription by threatening family members.\\" Child soldiers were deliberately overwhelmed with violence \\"in order to completely desensitize them and make them mindless killing machines\\".Innocence Lost, Radio Netherlands Archives, February 16, 2000 *Mass War Rape – During the war gender specific violence was widespread. Rape,The Memories should be their punishment, Radio Netherlands Archives, January 12, 2000 sexual slavery and forced marriages were commonplace during the conflict. The majority of assaults were carried out by the Revolutionary United Front (RUF). The Armed Forces Revolutionary Council (AFRC), The Civil Defence Forces (CDF), and the Sierra Leone Army (SLA) have also been implicated in sexual violence. The RUF, even though they had access to women, who had been abducted for use as either sex slaves or combatants, frequently raped non-combatants. The militia also carved the RUF initials into women's bodies, which placed them at risk of being mistaken for enemy combatants if they were captured by government forces. Women who were in the RUF were expected to provide sexual services to the male members of the militia. And of all women interviewed, only two had not been repeatedly subjected to sexual violence; gang rape and individual rapes were commonplace. A report from PHR stated that the RUF was guilty of 93 per cent of sexual assaults during the conflict. The RUF was notorious for human rights violations, and regularly amputated arms and legs from their victims. Trafficking by military and militias of women and girls, for use as sex slaves is well documented. With reports from recent conflicts such as those in, Angola, the former Yugoslavia, Sierra Leone, Liberia, the DRC, Indonesia, Colombia, Burma and Sudan. During the decade long civil conflict in Sierra Leone, women were used as sex slaves having been trafficked into refugee camps. According to PHR, one third of women who reported sexual violence had been kidnapped, with fifteen per cent forced into sexual slavery. The PHR report also showed that ninety four per cent of internally displaced households had been victims of some form of violence. PHR estimated that there were between 215,000 and 257,000 victims of rape during the conflict. Cry Freetown the 2000 documentary film directed by Sorious Samura shows accounts of the victims of the Sierra Leone Civil War and depicts the most brutal period with the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) rebels burning houses and The ECOMOG soldiers summarily executing suspects. Sorious Samura films Nigerian soldiers executing suspects without trial including women and children.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uu4jWN3B1Vg After the warWithdrawal= On 28 July 2002 the British withdrew a 200-strong military contingent that had been in country since the summer of 2000, leaving behind a 140-strong military training team with orders to professionalize the SLA and Navy. In November 2002, UNAMSIL began a gradual reduction from a peak level of 17,800 personnel.Bell, 2005 Under pressure from the British, the withdrawal slowed, so that by October 2003 the UNAMSIL contingent still stood at 12,000 men. As peaceful conditions continued through 2004, however, UNAMSIL drew down its forces to slightly over 4,100 by December 2004. The UN Security Council extended UNAMSIL’s mandate until June 2005 and again until December 2005. UNAMSIL completed the withdrawal of all troops in December 2005 and was succeeded by the United Nations Integrated Office in Sierra Leone (UNIOSIL). =Truth and Reconciliation Commission= The Lome Peace Accord called for the establishment of a Truth and Reconciliation Commission to provide a forum for both victims and perpetrators of human rights violations during the conflict to tell their stories and facilitate healing. Subsequently, the Sierra Leonean government asked the UN to help set up a Special Court for Sierra Leone, which would try those who \\"bear the greatest responsibility for the commission of crimes against humanity, war crimes and serious violations of international humanitarian law, as well as crimes under relevant Sierra Leonean law within the territory of Sierra Leone since 30 November 1996.\\" Both the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and the Special Court began operating in the summer of 2002.\\"Sierra Leone: Submission to the Universal Periodic Review of the UN Human Rights Council\\", International Center for Transitional Justice (ICTJ)\\"Challenging the Conventional: Can Truth Commissions Strengthen Peace Processes?\\", International Center for Transitional Justice (ICTJ) = Rehabilitation = Population  After the war many of the children who were abducted and used in the conflict need some form of rehabilitation, debriefing and care after the conflict came to an end. Only a handful of the children could be immediately sent home after six weeks of debriefing at a center for ex-combatants. This is due to many of the children suffering from drug withdraw symptoms, brainwashing, physical and mental wounds, as well as a lack of memory of who they were or where they came from before the conflict. There was an estimated one to two million displaced persons and refugees who wanted to or needed to be returned to their villages.  Rebuilding  Reportedly thousands of small villages had been severely damaged due to looting, and targeted destruction of property that was held by perceived enemies. There was also heavy destruction of clinics and hospitals, leading to a concern about infrastructure stability.  Government  The European Union [EU] sent budgetary support with the support of the IMF, the World Bank and the UK in an effort to stabilize the economy and the government. The amount; €4,75 million was made available by the EU from 2000 to 2001, for the government finance interalia, and social services. After the contribution made by the Bangladesh UN Peacekeeping Force, the government of Ahmad Tejan Kabbah declared Bengali an honorary official language in December 2002. =Diamond revenues= Diamond revenues in Sierra Leone have increased more than tenfold since the end of the conflict, from $10 million in 2000 to about $130 million in 2004, although according to the UNAMSIL surveys of mining sites, \\"more than 50 per cent of diamond mining still remains unlicensed and reportedly considerable illegal smuggling of diamonds continues\\". = Prosecution = Stephen J. Rapp, chief prosecutor On 13 January 2003, a small group of armed men tried unsuccessfully to break into an armory in Freetown. Former AFRC- junta leader Koroma, after being linked to the raid, went into hiding. In March, the Special Court for Sierra Leone issued its first indictments for war crimes during the civil war. Sankoh, already in custody, was indicted, along with notorious RUF field commander Sam \\"Mosquito\\" Bockarie, Koroma, the Minister of Interior and former head of the Civil Defense Force, Samuel Hinga Norman, and several others. Norman was arrested when the indictments were announced, while Bockarie and Koroma remained at large (presumably in Liberia). On 5 May 2003, Bockarie was killed in Liberia. President Taylor expected to be indicted by the Special Court and had feared Bockarie’s testimony. He is suspected of ordering Bockarie's murder, although no indictments are pending. Several weeks later, word filtered out of Liberia that Koroma had been killed as well, although his death remains unconfirmed. In June the Special Court announced Taylor’s indictment for war crimes. Sankoh died in prison in Freetown on 29 July 2003 from a pulmonary embolism. He had been ailing since a stroke the year prior. In August 2003 President Kabbah testified before the Truth and Reconciliation Commission on his role during the civil war. On 1 December 2003, Major General Tom Carew, who had been the Chief of Defence Staff for the Government of Sierra Leone and an important figure in the SLA, was reassigned to civilian duties. In June 2007, the Special Court found three of the eleven people indicted – Alex Tamba Brima, Brima Bazzy Kamara and Santigie Borbor Kanu – guilty of war crimes, including acts of terrorism, collective punishments, extermination, murder, rape, outrages upon personal dignity, conscripting or enlisting children under the age of 15 years into armed forces, enslavement and pillage. , press release from the Special Court for Sierra Leone, 20 June 2007; \\"Sierra Leone Convicts 3 of War Crimes\\", Associated Press, 20 June 2007 (hosted by The Washington Post); \\"First S Leone war crimes verdicts\\", BBC News, 20 June 2010  Depictions  Leonardo DiCaprio, star of Blood Diamond The civil war served as the background for the 2006 movie Blood Diamond, starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Djimon Hounsou and Jennifer Connelly. During the end of the movie Lord of War, Yuri Orlov (played by Nicolas Cage) sells arms to militias during the civil war. The militias are allied with André Baptiste (Eamonn Walker), who is based on Charles Taylor. The use of children in both the rebel (RUF) military and the government militia is depicted in Ishmael Beah's 2007 memoir, A Long Way Gone. In the 2012 Documentary La vita non perde valore, by Wilma Massucco, former child soldiers and some of their victims talk about the way how they feel and live, ten years after the Sierra Leone civil war ending, thanks to the personal, familiar and social rehabilitation provided to them by Father Giuseppe Berton, an Italian missionary of the Xaverian order. The documentary has been analyzed in different Universities, becoming subject of various degrees,.University of Florence (Italy), Conflict management course, thesis of comparison between recruitment of child soldiers and recruitment of children of Camorra in Naples.

Ishmael Beah wrote a foreword to Kamara's book.Kamara, 2008, pp. 7–8. Jonathon Torgovnik wrote about eight women that he interviewed after the war had ended in his book; Girl Soldier: Life After War in Sierra Leone. In the book he describes the experiences of the eight women who were abducted during the war and forced to fight in it. The documentary movie Sierra Leone's Refugee All Stars tells the story of a group of refugees who fled to Guinea and created a band to ease the pain of the constant difficulty of living away from home and community after the atrocities of war and mutilation. In 2000 the Sierra Leonean journalist, cameraman and editor, Sorious Samura released his documentary Cry Freetown. The self-funded film depicted the most brutal period of the civil war in Sierra Leone with RUF rebels capturing the capital city in the late 1990s. The film won, among other awards, an Emmy Award and a Peabody.

He served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1915 to 1920 as a supporter of the Liberal Party, and is notable as the first Ukrainian Canadian to be elected to Manitoba's legislature. Ferley was born in Austro-Hungarian controlled Ukraine, and educated at the Kolomyja Gymnasium and Lemberg University. In the Ukraine, he was a member of the Radical Party. He moved to San Francisco, California in 1903, and took part in a communal living experiment which ended in failure after a few months. He arrived Canada in 1905 and worked as a publisher and real estate broker. He became the director of the Ukrainian Publishing Company of Canada, and also taught at the Ruthenian Training School at Brandon for a period beginning in 1907 till 1910. He first ran for the Manitoba legislature in the 1914 provincial election, contesting the constituency of Gimli as an Independent-Liberal. He lost, finishing third against Conservative Sveinn Thorvaldson and official Liberal candidate Einar Jonasson. Ferley ran again as an Independent-Liberal in the 1915 provincial election, and became the constituency's de facto Liberal candidate after Jonasson withdrew from the race. Ferley defeated Thorvaldson by 610 votes, and supported Tobias Norris's Liberal administration for the next five years. In his parliamentary biography, Ferley emphasized his loyalty to Canada and to the British Empire. As the sole Ukrainian member of the legislature, Ferley protested against the federal government's treatment of Ukrainian-Canadians during World War I. Unlike others in the Liberal Party, he also defended Manitoba's bilingual education system of state funding for Anglophone and Francophone schools. He was defeated in the 1920 provincial election, losing to Farmer candidate Gudmundur Fjelsted by 117 votes.

It broke away from the Russian Empire during the February Revolution, shortly before the start of the Russian Civil War. MRNC included most of the territory of the former Terek Oblast and Dagestan Oblast of the Russian Empire, which now form the republics of Chechnya, Ingushetia, North Ossetia–Alania, Kabardino-Balkaria, Dagestan and part of Stavropol Krai of the Russian Federation. The total land area was about , with a population of about 11 million. Its capital was initially at Vladikavkaz, then Nazran, and finally Temir-Khan-Shura. The state was captured by Soviet Russian forces in 1921, who transformed it into the Mountain Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic.  History  Leaders of the MRNC, with Prime Minister Tapa Tchermoeff seated in the front row centre The \\"Union of the Peoples of the Northern Caucasus\\" was created in March 1917, and an Executive Committee of the Union was elected. The Chairman of the Executive Committee was one of the leaders of the National‐Liberation movement of the Peoples of the Northern Caucasus, Tapa Tchermoeff. The \\"Nizam\\" of Imam Shamil (the Constitution of Shamil of 1847) was re-adopted on 5 August 1917 by the \\"Central Committee of the Northern Caucasus\\". The republic was officially established on 11 May 1918, after the collapse of the Russian Tsarist empire in the Russian revolution of 1917, when the Government of the MRNC was established. The main founders of the MRNC included Said Shamil (grandson of Imam Shamil, who in 1924 would become a founder and leader of the \\"Committee of Independence of the Caucasus\\" in Germany), Prime Minister Tapa Tchermoeff, Ali-Khaji Akusha and Haidar Bammate. The Republic's capital was Temir-Khan-Shura. The Mountainous Republic was de jure recognized by the Ottoman Empire, Germany, the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic, Armenia, the Democratic Republic of Georgia, Ukraine, Bulgaria, Belarus, Latvia, Estonia, France, Finland, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, United States, Italy, Austria-Hungary, Poland, Don Republic, Japan, and the Kuban People's Republic. General Anton Denikin's Volunteer Army and regional armed forces after the Armistice of Mudros During the Russian Civil War, the Mountaineers were engaged in fierce clashes against the invading White troops of General Anton Denikin's Volunteer Army. The fighting ended in January 1920, when Denikin's army was completely defeated by the 11th Red Army. The advancing Red Army was at first greeted with red flags in the villages of the Northern Caucasus, but the promises of autonomous rule made by the Bolsheviks went unrealized. In June 1921, the MRNC was occupied by the Red Army of Bolshevik Russia and the Government of the republic was forced to leave the Caucasus. In January 1921, the Soviet Mountain Republic of the Russian SFSR was established.

Like most of his other novels, it is a crime novel set in Florida and features Hiaasen's characteristic black humor. The novel focuses on a single mother who has turned to exotic dancing to earn enough money to gain legal custody of her young daughter, and ends up matching wits with a lecherous United States Congressman and his powerful corporate backers. Like many Hiaasen novels, the book's plot is set against a backdrop of a particular environmental crime or corruption issue that angers the author. In this case, it is the plutocracy of sugar growers in Florida, and the exorbitant subsidies regularly granted to them by the U.S. Congress. Strip Tease was a New York Times bestseller in 1993. Plot During a late- night bachelor party at the Eager Beaver, a striptease club in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, drunken groom-to-be Paul Guber climbs on stage and grabs Erin Grant, one of the dancers. Before the club's bouncer can act, Paul is attacked with a champagne bottle by another customer. The attacker turns out to be Congressman David Lane Dilbeck, an incorrigible (yet secret) patron of adult establishments. Political fixer Malcolm Moldowsky, representing Dilbeck's legislative patrons in Florida's sugar cane industry, is furious at Dilbeck's stupidity since he is in the middle of a re-election campaign. Erin, a single mother engaged in a custody legal fight with her ex-husband Darrell, was fired from her job as a secretary for the FBI after he was arrested for grand larceny. The legal costs of her divorce impelled Erin to take up erotic dancing as a career. Ironically, her occupation has given the judge a prejudiced view of her, while Darrell's criminal record has been expunged after he has agreed to become an informant for the police. As a result, Darrell has been given custody of their daughter Angela, and Erin desperately needs even more money to reverse the court decision. One of Erin's lovestruck fans, a bookish man named Jerry Killian, recognizes Dilbeck from the club and tries to blackmail him into influencing the judge in Erin's favor. But when the judge proves resistant to Dilbeck's probing, Moldowsky decides the only way to safeguard Dilbeck is to have Jerry murdered. His body is found floating in the Clark Fork River in Montana – by Miami homicide detective Al Garcia, on vacation with his family. Another blackmailer surfaces in the person of Mordecai, a sleazy lawyer related to Paul's fiancee. One of Paul's friends from the bachelor party inadvertently snapped a picture of Dilbeck during the attack, with which Mordecai demands hush money. Instead, Mordecai and Paul's greedy fiancee are likewise murdered on Moldowsky's orders. However, Dilbeck's memory of Erin is indirectly sparked by the photo, and he obsessively refuses to continue with his campaign until he can \\"possess\\" her. Moldowsky, conscious that Dilbeck is necessary to his employers' continued prosperity, is forced to assist him. Garcia returns to Florida and compares notes with Erin and her main ally, the club's bouncer Shad. He discovers evidence linking Jerry's murder to Moldowsky, but nothing that will stand up in court. At the same time, Darrell is again busted for larceny and his criminal record is restored, tipping the dispute in Erin's favor. Deciding not to wait, she snatches Angela while Darrell is away, from her aunt's house. Meanwhile, Moldowsky approaches Erin's boss and asks for her to give Dilbeck a private performance. Erin agrees, knowing that it is the best way of gathering evidence. During her first private show, Dilbeck is rendered nearly helpless with lust, and Erin finds it easy to manipulate him. He offers her more money for a repeat performance, and she agrees. Realizing Dilbeck will probably escape implication in Jerry's murder under normal circumstances, Erin comes up with a plan to \\"destroy\\" him. On the night of the second show, Darrell follows Erin to the meeting place and comes upon Moldowsky watch-dogging the show, beating him to death in a drug-induced rage. Inside, Dilbeck tries to seduce her, and is vexed when she is unimpressed. Darrell enters and demands to be taken to his daughter. Erin moves to the next phase of her plan, drawing a pistol and ordering them both out. With the help of Dilbeck's limousine driver, Erin drives the two men to a sugar cane field owned by Dilbeck's most prominent supporters. When the car stops, Darrell runs into the cane and winds up falling into a drug-induced slumber; he is killed the next day when the cane he passed out in is fed into a milling machine. Erin offers to slow-dance with Dilbeck in the cane field. Dilbeck believes the dance is a prelude to \\"wild cowboy sex,\\" but when he realizes it is not, he tries to rape Erin – at which point he is seized by a squad of FBI agents, led by Erin's old boss, who received an anonymous call saying she had been kidnapped. Erin gives Dilbeck an ultimatum: in exchange for avoiding arrest and public exposure, he must resign from his congressional seat. With Darrell gone, and the threat to her from Dilbeck and his patrons removed, Erin resigns from the club and starts a new life with Angela. In the epilogue, it is said that she has gotten back her old job as a secretary with the FBI and a night job dancing in the Main Street Parade at Walt Disney World, and is currently applying to become an FBI agent herself. Critical reception Times reviewer Donald E. Westlake described Hiaasen's style as \\"a cross between Dave Barry and Elmore Leonard.\\" In a positive review of the novel, Westlake claims that this is Hiaasen's strongest novel to date, writing: > In among his freaks and obsessives ... the author has dropped a real honest- > to-God human being, an appealing young woman named Erin Grant. Her presence > ... makes the cartoon nastiness around her less cartoony and more nasty than > in previous Hiaasen novels. Connections with Hiaasen's other works *Al Garcia, who has appeared in Tourist Season, Double Whammy, and Skin Tight, makes his fourth, and (to date) last appearance in Hiaasen's novels. *The book rails against the sugar cane industry for its exploitation of migrant labor (a theme briefly touched on in the previous novel Native Tongue) and pollution of the Everglades, both of which crimes are also carried out by \\"Red\\" Hammernut, the corporate villain of Hiaasen's later novel Skinny Dip. *Malcolm Moldowsky is a political fixer, but his ostensible occupation remains unspecified. Palmer Stoat, the main antagonist of Hiaasen's novel Sick Puppy, plays a similar role to Moldowsky's, and is a lobbyist by profession. Allusions to history, geography, or people *Dilbeck is based on J. Herbert Burke, a Republican Congressman from Broward County who was arrested for disorderly conduct in a topless bar in 1978. *In his book, The Swamp, a history of the Everglades, Michael Grunwald opines that the fictional Rojo brothers, Dilbeck's main patrons in the sugar cane industry, are thinly-veiled parodies of Jose and Alfonso Fanjul, the owners of a large sugar cane conglomerate in Florida. Like the fictional Rojos, the Fanjul brothers became notorious in Florida for their ostentatious displays of wealth, and so served as a living indictment of the \\"struggling family farmer\\" myth used to promote agricultural subsidies. *The Eager Beaver's owner, Orly, often boasts of ties to organized crime figures, such as Angelo Bruno, \\"Little Nicky\\" Scarfo and \\"Fat Tony\\" Salerno. One of these boasts falls flat when Salerno's death (which occurred in 1992) is reported. *Moldowsky's hero and mentor is John Newton Mitchell, Richard Nixon's Attorney General, convicted of multiple crimes in connection with the Watergate scandal. *In berating Dilbeck for his stupid behavior, Moldowsky reviews the names of several past politicians soiled by sex scandals: Gary Hart, Chuck Robb, and Teddy Kennedy. *Moldowsky also lists women whose names have been associated with such scandals, including Fanne Fox (associated with Wilbur Mills), Elizabeth Ray (associated with Wayne Hays), Donna Rice (Gary Hart) and Gennifer Flowers (former president Bill Clinton). *In lecturing Dilbeck, Moldowsky crudely paraphrases George Santayana's famous aphorism, \\"Those who ignore history are doomed to repeat it.\\" *Several real-life members of the U.S. Congress and Senate are also mentioned by name as Dilbeck's contemporaries, including Bill Bradley, John Kerry and Daniel Patrick Moynihan. *Garcia refers to the founding of the United States as a nation when he wonders aloud \\"what Thomas Paine would think of a Congressman who has sex with old shoes and laundry lint.\\" *In trying to impress Erin, Dilbeck shows her photos of him with several real-life politicians and celebrities, including Tip O'Neill, Colin Powell, Bill Bradley, Chris Dodd, Al D'Amato, Newt Gingrich and Chuck Norris. Film adaptation In 1996, it was adapted to the screen, under the title Striptease, written and directed by Andrew Bergman, and starring Demi Moore as Erin, Burt Reynolds as Dilbeck, Ving Rhames as Shad, Armand Assante as Al Garcia, Robert Patrick as Darrell, Rumer Willis as Angela and Paul Guilfoyle as Moldowsky. The film is notorious for being one of the worst films ever made.

A member of the Republican Party, he served as the 40th Governor of Wisconsin from January 4, 1979 to January 3, 1983. Prior to his election, he was the Chancellor of the University of Wisconsin–Stevens Point.After his term as Governor, Dreyfus also served as a member of the University of Wisconsin Board of Regents. La Crosse Tribune – 7.0 : Former Gov. Dreyfus dead at 81 Early life Dreyfus was born and raised in Milwaukee, the son of Clare (Bluett) and Woods Orlow Dreyfus. He attended Washington High School. His parents were active in the community and his father was an on-air personality for WISN radio (Young Lee was featured several times as a young actor and singer on the station). Dreyfus' mother was a longtime member of the Milwaukee School Board, serving for 25 years. Dreyfus enlisted in the United States Navy after high school, where he learned to be an electronics technician and worked on radar repair. He was sent to the Pacific during World War II and stayed there until the war was over. After the war, he enrolled at what is now the University of Wisconsin–Madison under the GI Bill. During this time, he met Joyce Unke, whom he married in 1947. That same year, he became a member of the Kappa Sigma fraternity. Dreyfus earned a bachelor's degree in 1949, a master's degree in 1952 and a doctorate in communication in 1957.Amy Rabideau Silvers. \\"Lee S. Dreyfus: 1926-2008; He made red vest, leadership his style\\". Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, January 3, 2008. CareerAcademic career= Dreyfus went on to Wayne State University in Detroit, where he became general manager of the radio station and helped develop Wayne State's mass communications department. In 1962, he returned to Madison as manager of WHA-TV, and a professor of speech and broadcasting. In 1967, Dreyfus became the president of what was known as Wisconsin State University-Stevens Point. In 1972, he became chancellor of the university, which was merged into the University of Wisconsin system and renamed University of Wisconsin–Stevens Point. Dreyfus made a point of being accessible to students, often stopping at local bars to chat with them. It was during that era that he adopted the trademark red vest as university chancellor in order to be recognizable and accessible to students on campus. He was not always popular with students, particularly during the Vietnam War. Many students viewed the existence of an ROTC unit on campus as an endorsement of the U.S. military action. But Dreyfus argued that ROTC should be viewed as the presence of the university in the military instead of the presence of the military in the university. =Political career= A life-changing event for Dreyfus came in 1975 when he travelled to China as a representative of American colleges and universities, and became convinced of the danger of a one-party system. \\"That trip convinced me that the one-party system, whether it's a Marxist or a capitalist system or a military system ... is not in the best interests of the people,\\" he once said. Since Dreyfus was not a member of either major party until December 1977, he joined the Republican Party as a first step in what would become his candidacy for the governorship in 1978. He regarded this as a rescue mission, because he felt the Republicans were on the verge of becoming a permanent minority party in what had once been a predominantly Republican state. The following year, he launched an unconventional, populist campaign for governor, and traveled the state in a painted school bus (affectionately dubbed \\"The Red Vest Whistle Stop Special\\"). Dreyfus caught the attention of the Wisconsin media and began connecting with voters throughout the state. The state GOP didn't want Dreyfus to win the nomination, and it endorsed then-U.S. Rep. Bob Kasten in the primary. Party backing came with financial support that usually sealed the nomination, but Dreyfus was undeterred. An effective public speaker during the campaign, Dreyfus's most memorable quip was that states should be sovereign in most areas of law-making and that the federal government's role should be limited to only three things: \\"defending our shores, delivering our mail and staying the hell out of our lives.\\" Another memorable line was: \\"Madison, Wisconsin is 30 square miles surrounded by reality.\\" With only $100,000 to spend in the primary contest, Dreyfus criss-crossed the state in his unreliable red school bus, which featured a student band, gaining free media attention to make up for the TV ads he couldn't afford to buy. Dreyfus continued to wear his trademark red vest during the campaign. This campaign was later chronicled in a book Let The People Decide written by William Kraus, who was the chairman of this campaign where, as he said, \\"We did everything wrong, and everything worked.\\" Dreyfus beat Kasten in the September GOP primary, and went on to defeat then-incumbent Acting Governor Martin Schreiber, a Democrat, with about 55 percent of the vote. He became the state's 40th governor.Mark Pitsch and Jason Stein. \\"Former Gov. Dreyfus dies, remembered as maverick\\". Wisconsin State Journal, January 4, 2008. =Accomplishments in office= Dreyfus' style was often referred to as \\"Republicrat\\". Fiscally, Dreyfus was conservative and focused on the benefits of tax cuts and reduced size of government (echoing the Reagan conservative movement at the time). He capitalized on voters' dissatisfaction with the state's higher-than-average income tax rates, as well as general unhappiness with high inflation, high interest rates, and increasing unemployment during the Carter administration. However, Dreyfus was a social moderate who, in 1982, signed the nation's first civil rights legislation barring discrimination against gays and lesbians in jobs and housing. Dreyfus signed the gay-rights bill, saying \\"there are some questions the government has no business asking.\\" Dreyfus was renowned as a skilled orator. In televised debates prior to the election, he overcame the problem of name recognition with the electorate, as well as doubts about his experience and competency for the position. His focus on tax cuts was a questionable strategy, however. After the Wisconsin Legislature passed the revenue cuts, the State of Wisconsin was soon plagued by budget deficits, the first in many years. The deficits were caused by higher costs of government due to high inflation and interest rates. Unemployment also rose, further reducing revenue sources to government. The resultant cuts in services and programs, such as transportation, were at odds with Wisconsin's progressive tradition. At one point, the state did not have enough money to mow down the weeds along Wisconsin highways, which became a concern to the state's tourism industry. In Dreyfus' final year in office, 1982, the state had a budget deficit of nearly $1 billion and a 12 percent unemployment rate. Dreyfus did not seek a second term as governor. When asked in a 2005 interview for Wisconsin Eye what he considered the most important decision of his time in office, he said \\"building the school of veterinary medicine at the University of Wisconsin–Madison.\\" The decision to do this was made in budget meetings before he was inaugurated and went against the advice of all of his advisors and against the wishes of the University administration as well. When told that the state didn't need more veterinarians during the course of this discussion, Dreyfus responded \\"This is not about veterinarians. This is about research.\\" His view and decision proved to be prescient when in 1998 the discoveries of James Thomson, an obscure researcher at that school, opened up the many possibilities of stem cells and their uses. =Post-public service career= Dreyfus declined to run for re-election in 1982. He later said that \\"politics was not and never has been my primary interest as it is with former governors such as Pat Lucey or Tommy Thompson.\\"Lee Dreyfus. \\"Farewell: Time has come to end column\\". GM Today, August 16, 2007. From 1983–84, Dreyfus served as Chief Operating Officer of Sentry Insurance, Stevens Point. In 1986, he moved to Waukesha, where his son, Lee S. Dreyfus, Jr., is a state circuit court judge. He later served as Interim State Superintendent of Public Instruction and on the University of Wisconsin Board of Regents. In 1985, he started a consulting firm, making speeches and advising the state on higher education policy; Dreyfus became a popular fixture on the lecture circuit. Dreyfus spoke out against an amendment to the Wisconsin Constitution that would have banned gay marriage and civil unions, which passed in 2006. He wrote a weekly newspaper column between 1990 and 2007 for the Waukesha Freeman on issues of general interest. The column was carried by other newspapers in Wisconsin. Health issues and death In February 2005, Dreyfus experienced complications from knee-replacement surgery and began to show signs of heart distress. Doctors performed a quintuple bypass surgery. Dreyfus' health declined after this surgery, and his death in January 2008 was due to respiratory failure. Recognition The Lee Sherman Dreyfus University Center on the campus of UW–Stevens Point was named after Dreyfus in 2007. He was also elected to the Wisconsin Broadcasters' Hall of Fame.

After finishing architecture studies, he approached theatre art by realising the costumes for Casa di Bambola and L'opera da 3 soldi, two plays directed by Giorgio Strehler at Piccolo Teatro in the 1955-56 theatre season. From then on a fertile artistic marriage started between art director and producer, setting up several unique productions as I giganti della montagna (1966), Santa Giovanna dei macelli (1970), Re Lear (1972), Il temporale (1980), L'Illusion Comique, which premiered in 1984 at Théatre de l'Odéon in Paris, La grande magia, which premiered in 1985 and was reprised several times. The collaboration with Strehler made Frigerio enter the world of opera: Mozart's Le Nozze di Figaro, Don Giovanni and Così fan tutte were realized by Strehler and Frigerio between 1973 and 1996. Così fan tutte was being staged just before Strehler died. Frigerio also created stage designs for the Burgtheater in Vienna: Trilogie der Sommerfrische (Trilogia della villeggiatura) by Carlo Goldoni, directed by Strehler, 1974; Judith by Hebbel, directed by Gerhard Klingenberg, 1975. Other operatic stage designs include: Cherubini's Medea, directed by Liliana Cavani, for the Opéra National de Paris; Strauss' Elektra, directed by Nuria Espert, for De Munt Theatre in Brussels; Verdi's Ernani, directed by Luca Ronconi, 1980, Beethoven's Fidelio, directed by Werner Herzog in 1999 for the Teatro alla Scala in Milan; Bellini's Norma, directed by Piero Faggioni, for the Vienna State Opera in 1977; Verdi's Rigoletto, for the Polish National Opera in 1997. The team of Frigerio and Squarciapiano also designed the Met Opera's gorgeous and sensational Zandonai FRANCESCA DA RIMINI in 1984 (Scotto, Domingo, MacNeil, Levine.) Frigerio also created the sets for Liliana Cavani's movie Galileo e i Cannibali and Jean-Paul Rappeneau's Cyrano de Bergerac, which got an Oscar nomination in 1991.

It is currently a line of mid-size luxury sedans primarily aimed at the Japanese market and sold in other select Asian markets. Introduced in 1955 as the Toyopet Crown, it has served as the mainstream sedan from Toyota in the Japanese market throughout its existence and holds the distinction of being the longest-running passenger-car nameplate affixed to any Toyota model, along with being the first Toyota vehicle to be exported to the United States in 1958. Its traditional competitors in Japan and Asia have been the Nissan Cedric/Gloria/Fuga and the Honda Legend, along with the defunct Mazda Luce, Isuzu Bellel and Mitsubishi Debonair. Available at Toyota Store dealers in Japan, the Crown has been popular for government usage, whether as a police car or for transporting government officials. It has also been popular with Japanese companies as company cars along with use as a taxicab. While a base Crown was available for many years aimed at the taxicab market, the increasing opulence and price of the Crown line led to the creation of the Toyota Comfort in 1995 as a more affordable alternative. Outside Japan, the larger Lexus LS took over the role of Toyota's flagship sedan in 1989 in the company's global lineup. In North America, the first through fourth generations were offered from 1958 through 1973. It was replaced with the Toyota Corona Mark II. The Crown has also been partially succeeded in export markets by its closely related sibling, the Lexus GS, which since its debut in 1991 as the Toyota Aristo has always shared the Crown's platform and powertrain options. Later models of the GS and Crown have taken on a very strong aesthetic kinship through shared design cues. The Crown's history and reputation has given it prominence in the Toyota lineup, as it is one of the few current Toyota models to carry its own unique insignia for the model line with the current Crown having a stylized crown emblem on the grille and steering wheel along with inspiring the names of its smaller progenitors. The Corona, introduced as a smaller companion to the Crown means \\"crown\\" in Latin and was initially exported as the \\"Tiara\\", while the Corolla took its name from the corolla (\\"small crown\\") in Latin. The Camry's name is derived from the Japanese phrase kanmuri (冠, かんむり) meaning \\"little crown\\" and the Toyota Scepter took its name from the sceptre, an accessory to a crown. The Avalon (the Crown's North American counterpart), while not named after a crown, is named after a mythical island from the legends of King Arthur. Toyota's \\"Discover Crown Spirit Project\\" is a program in which Japanese Toyota dealers fully restore instances of every generation of the Crown to show that even the oldest Crown still works. __TOC__  Export  Crown logo, used from twelfth to fourteenth generation model The Crown was exported to the United States from 1958 to 1973. Exports to Europe began in 1964 with the first cars going to Finland. Other European countries which saw early imports of the Crown included the Netherlands and Belgium. Canada sold the Crown from 1965 to 1973. The United Kingdom was another market until the early 1980s. It was also exported to Canada for a few years—1965–68. Australia was another important export market for the Crown—to the extent that it was manufactured there from the mid-1960s until the late 1980s using many local components. The current island nations of Aruba and Curaçao in the Southern Caribbean also imported the Toyota Crown starting from the second generation (S40) in 1965 in Curaçao up until importation of the 10th generation (S150) was discontinued in 1998 due to the high price and low demand combined with the introduction of the Lexus GS series.  Toyopet Crown - First generation (RS/S10/S20/S30; 1955–1962)  The Crown was introduced in 1955 in Japan to meet the demands of public transportation. The Crown was intended for private purchase, while the Master served in a commercial form as a taxi, both with the same 1.5 L Type R engine used on their previous car, the Toyopet Super. The front doors open conventionally, and the rear doors are \\"suicide doors\\", a feature also utilized on the Toyota AA, Toyota's first car. Small engine displacements were used to keep the vehicle affordable, as the Japanese Government began to impose an annual road tax to help develop and maintain a national transportation infrastructure in 1950. The appearance of the Crown shows some similarities with the European Ford Versailles and Simca Vedette. The Crown was much more popular than the Master due to the more compliant suspension of the Crown, and while the Master was intended for taxi service, the Crown was more accepted by the market over the Master, and more Crowns were sold into taxi service than the Master. The Crown was designed to replace the Super but Toyota was not sure if its independent front coil suspension and its suicide type rear doors were too radical for the taxi market to bear. So the Super was updated, renamed the Master and sold in tandem to the Crown, at Toyota Store locations. When sales of the Crown proved worthwhile, the Master was discontinued in November 1956 after being in production for only one year, and production facilities for the Master were transferred to the Crown. While the Master was discontinued the commercial vehicle based thereon, the Masterline, continued to be offered (utilities, wagons and vans) until 1959. A six-door wagon known as the Airport Limousine was shown as a concept car at the 1961 Tokyo Motor Show. It did not go into production. In December 1955 the Crown Deluxe (RSD) was introduced, a posher model equipped with a radio and heater as standard.History Timeline of the Japanese automobile, p. 69 The initial RS model received a cosmetic update in 1958 to become the RS20, now with hooded headlights and a single-piece front windshield. In October 1959 Japan's first diesel-engine passenger car, the Crown Diesel, was introduced. Its C-series engine only had .History Timeline of the Japanese automobile, p. 79 In October 1960 the 1.5 L R engine was complemented by the larger 1.9 L (1,896 cc) 3R engine for a model called the RS30, originally only available in the Deluxe version. The 1900 was also available with the new two-speed Toyoglide automatic transmission.History Timeline of the Japanese automobile, p. 83 In April 1961 a Crown Standard 1900 was added. Its coil and double wishbone independent front suspension was a departure from the leaf sprung beam axle front suspension used on most previous models but was similar to the independent front suspension used on the 1947 Toyopet SA. The live axle rear suspension was similar to that used on most of the previous models (unlike the trailing arm rear suspension used on the SA). Taxi versions were produced and beginning in March 1959 commercial versions of the vehicle were also available, as an estate wagon and a three- or six-seat coupe utility. These took over the \\"Toyopet Masterline\\" name in the Japanese domestic market, but usually received \\"Crown\\" badges in the export. The \\"Crown\\" name was previously in use by the Imperial limousine manufactured by Chrysler in the early 1950s. In 1958 it introduced a ball joint suspension. Production of the double-cab Masterline pickup (RR19) started in April 1957 by the former Central Motors. In August 1957, three Toyota delegates with the intent to establish a sales company in the United States introduced a white and black Crown and Crown Deluxe at a public relations event attended by dealers and the media. Both models were constructed with 50% thicker steel than the average American car at the time and the black Deluxe model was nicely appointed with lots of chrome and luxurious items like a radio, heater and whitewall tires which prompted the press to liken it to a \\"baby Cadillac\\". This promising initial showing along with the strong reputation of the Crown in Japan gave Toyota the confidence to pursue exports to the United States despite known high-speed performance issues. As a publicity stunt to demonstrate the car's reliability, Toyota staged a campaign common to American automakers: a coast-to-coast endurance run from Los Angeles to New York. The Toyopet was barely able to limp into Las Vegas before the project had to be called off. Toyota's first export to the United States began with 30 Crown Deluxes in June 1958 after establishing Toyota Motor Sales USA the previous October, the first directly managed retail dealer (Hollywood Toyota) the previous February, U.S. wholesale and import companies, and a parts warehouse in Long Beach. Toyota also signs up 45 dealers to sell cars in its initial year, growing to 70 dealers by 1960 and 90 by 1962. In the effort to obtain certification from the California Highway Patrol for the sale of the Crown in California, Toyota shipped the cars without headlights and installed General Electric sourced sealed beam units upon arrival which met the required standard for brightness. Since the car was designed for the muddy, slow, unpaved Japanese roads, it failed the mass urban landscape of the US because of its inability to keep up with traffic on the faster interstate highways, along with stability, noise and vibration concerns. The car was also very rigid and heavy for its size at 2700 pounds. Motor Trend reported \\"The Toyopet is so rigid that jacking up one wheel at the rear bumper quickly lifted the other rear wheel\\". They also observed an average of 23.5 mpg combined city/highway for 407 miles. To remedy the performance issues along with the resulting breakage of parts from being overly stressed, Toyota introduced the newer RS22L and the RS32L series Crown with the larger 3R engine and other improvements for high-speed driving in July 1960. For 1958, Toyota introduced the Crown in sedan form only (Standard and Deluxe) with a base price of $2187. Options included $94 AM radio and $75 whitewall tires. By comparison, an optioned up Crown was $32 more than the base Chevy Del Ray and $10 more than the Rambler Rebel V8 sedan. Total sales for the initial year were 287. For 1959 sales were again limited to only sedan models and despite a price boost to $2329 for the Deluxe model, sales more than tripled to 967 units. For 1960, Toyota added a wagon body style ($2111 for the two-door, $2211 for the four-door) but in the midst of Detroit's Big Three compact cars (Ford Falcon, Chevy Corvair and Plymouth Valiant), sales fell to 659 units. For 1961 the Crown was being sold with the newer 3R engine and alongside the new smaller Tiara model with the Crown's outgoing 1.5L engine. Only the Custom sedan and wagon were offered ($1795 and $2080 respectively). Total sales for 1961 reached only 225 units, trailing off to 74 for 1962, and finally 28 for 1963. Total sales for the Toyopet Crown RS series in the United States is 2,240. By the end of 1960, Toyota Motor Sales USA had accumulated 1.42 million dollars in losses from lackluster sales of the Crown. To prevent any further loss, all passenger car imports were suspended and new management structures were established to refocus all sales efforts on the Toyota Land Cruiser with profitability expected from selling 50 to 60 per month until the development of a new car suitable for the US market. In November 2000, Toyota released the Origin, a retro version of the RS series Crown to celebrate 100 million vehicles having been built in Japan. = Gallery = Toyopet Crown - Second generation (S40; 1962–1967)  Due to the introduction of the Corona, the dramatically restyled and enlarged Series S40 was launched in 1962, and saw the introduction of the Custom model. According to the Japanese Wikipedia article for the Crown, the styling was said to be influenced by the recently introduced Ford Falcon in 1960. The front grille approach has a similar appearance to the 1960 Imperial Crown (Chrysler), which speaks to Toyota's aspirations that the Crown be a large, comfortable sedan. The station wagon body style carried over from the previous generation Masterline, but with more attention to the luxurious approach used on the Crown. Headlights were integrated within the boundaries of the greatly enlarged grille, providing a clean, modern appearance. A 2-speed automatic transmission was introduced, called Toyoglide, with a column shift. A bigger and better car than the previous S30 series, it initially had four-cylinder R-series engines before the addition of the \\"M\\" six-cylinder engine in 1965. Deluxe and Super Deluxe models were available with added features. The sedan and wagon were known simply as the Crown while the commercial vehicles (coupe utility, double cab coupe utility (pick ups), and van) were known as the Masterline. There was also a limited run of the sedan known as the Toyota Crown S (MS41S) which featured twin SU style carburettors on the 2.0L M in- line-six engine, sportier camshaft, sports instrumentation, sports suspension, four-speed floor shift, bucket seats, 14 inch wheels, disc brakes on the front and larger drum brakes in the rear. This Crown became the first Toyota to be exported to Europe, after the head of Denmark's Erla Auto Import A/S saw it at the Tokyo Motor Show. They brought in 190 of these subsequent to a May 1963 agreement. In the US, the MS41L sedan was available in the US for $2,305.00 PoE while the MS46LG station wagon was available for $2,525.00 PoE. Some optional features include an automatic transmission for $160 and a radio for $60. A two-door Crown Convertible was displayed at the 1963 Tokyo Motor Show, based on the Crown 1900 sedan. It was not put into production. This Crown generation was the first to be assembled in Australia, from CKD kits, by AMI in Port Melbourne, with significant local content. AMI, which assembled numerous brands including Triumph and, for a short time, Mercedes-Benz, was to become the basis of Toyota's current Australian manufacturing operation. = Crown Eight (G10) = The longer, wider and more upmarket Crown Eight (:ja:トヨタ・クラウンエイト) was introduced in 1964 for the Japanese market, powered by a 2.6 L V8 engine. However, it had a different model designation, G10 (VG10 when fitted by 2.6 L V engine). The car was first introduced at the 1963 Tokyo Motor Show and introduced for sale on April 20, 1964, nine days before Emperor Showa's birthday and the beginning of Golden Week in Japan. The Crown Eight was designed primarily to replace full-sized American automobiles that were commonly used by major corporations. The Crown Eight represents the first Japanese mass-produced vehicle with an 8-cylinder engine. The main rivals at the time were the Prince Gloria Super, Mitsubishi Debonair, and Nissan Cedric Special, all equipped with a six-cylinder engine. It was the first Crown to exceed vehicle size classification regulations in length, width and engine displacement capacity. The width at compares to the Century at , and as such no Crown before or since, including the Crown Majesta, has matched the width dimension of the Crown Eight until the year 2008 for Crown and 2009 for Majesta. The Crown Eight was considered as a possible submission for use by the Japanese Imperial Household Agency as a car to be used by senior members of the Imperial House of Japan, but it lost out to the Nissan Prince Royal. The Crown Eight was replaced in 1967 by the first Century with the model code VG20. Approx 3,800 Crown Eights were produced. Some of the items that were exclusive to the Crown Eight were climate control, automatic headlamps, electrically powered windows, electric cruise control, a three-speed \\"Toyoglide\\" automatic transmission, and electromagnetic door latches, which were also installed on the Crown Eight successor, the Century.  Toyopet Crown - Third generation (S50; 1967–1971)  Launched in 1967, the mechanicals were much the same as the previous generation, but additional equipment was included. Higher specification models used the 2.0-liter M engine or the 2.3-liter 2M engine. A premium level Super Saloon joined the Super Deluxe model, and was available with the 2M engine including twin carburettors, electric windows, rear seat radio controls, air conditioning and luxury fabric on the seating including the crown logo embossed into the vinyl. Lower specified models were equipped with the R-series four-cylinder engines. The previous approach of manufacturing Crown vehicles for commercial use, called the Masterline, was discontinued with this generation. Masterline pickups were produced by the former Central Motor Co., Ltd. until December 1970. When the 1967 S50 series Crown was introduced to Japan, television commercials used Japanese actor Satoshi Yamamura, who among his many roles on stage, movie, and television, portrayed Fleet Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto in the 1970s movie Tora! Tora! Tora! Yamamura would serve as the Crown spokesman for 16 years, introducing subsequent new generations of Crown products until 1983. Toyota Crown Super Saloon The Crown range now included the four-door station wagon, pick-up (rare), double cab pick-up (very rare) and the new two-door hardtop \\"personal luxury car\\". In 1969 the Crown received a facelift for the headlight, grill and trim arrangement. The Crown S used the two-litre 'six', but due to sportier tuning it produced more power than the larger 2M, at 5,800 rpm versus at 5,200 rpm. The commercial versions were fitted with the six- cylinder \\"M\\" engine (M-C) produce , while the four-cylinder 5R had to make do with . This generation was the only one to use a double-hinged tailgate, as the next generation converted to an overhead-lifting hatchback door. Crowns that were equipped with the 2,253 cc 2M engine were no longer classified as compact cars under Japanese vehicle size classification regulations, even though the length and width were still in compliance. Toyota offered the larger engine so that buyers who were traditionally served by the Crown could now choose the all-new Corona Mark II in 1968. This allowed Toyota to reposition the Crown as the top level privately available luxury sedan, with much nicer interior treatments, more spacious accommodations. This was the last generation for the pick-up versions of the Crown, as load carrying was ceded to the new Toyota Hilux in February 1971. Australian market models were assembled in Australia by Australian Motor Industries. This generation was imported fully assembled into New Zealand from 1968 to 1971. Notable features on the wagon were: * 7 or 8-passenger seating (two on front buckets or three on a bench seat, three on a rear bench seat and 2 on a fold up cargo seat), * a powered rear window, * a side swing tailgate.  Fourth generation (S60/S70; 1971–1974)  Launched in February 1971, the 4M 2600 engine was introduced with this generation, as was the luxurious Super Saloon trim level, followed by the Super Deluxe and Deluxe. The top of the line Royal Saloon was first introduced in the face-lifted Crown from 1973, adding luxury features from the Century limousine. The 2.0-liter 5R inline-four engine and the 2.0-liter M six-cylinder engine were also available. As for the previous generation, the M-C engine (in Japanese specifications) has , while the 5R's output increased somewhat to . In some markets the previous 2.3 litre \\"2M\\" six remained available, in sedan or \\"utility wagon\\" forms. The Utility Wagon was a version halfway between commercial and passenger car, and had chassis codes MS67V until the early 1973 facelift when it was replaced by the MS68V with the 2.6 engine. Previous generations of the Crown had been marketed under the Toyopet name but the fourth-generation model was the first version to be officially known worldwide as the Toyota Crown. The Sedan and Wagon (Custom) are coded RS60/MS60/MS64/MS65 and MS62/MS63, while the Van was coded MS66V with the two liter \\"six\\". The Hardtop Coupé is MS70 (2.0-liter), or MS75 (2.6-liter). The Japanese market Crown Custom (Wagon) was classified as a seven-seater. This generation was the first Crown marketed as a Toyota in Japan, as previous models were marketed as Toyopets. Also, in Japan, this model was known as the \\"whale\\" or \\"kujira\\" Crown. In 1973, Japanese television commercials introduced Japanese actress Sayuri Yoshinaga as a co-spokeswoman, joining Satoshi Yamamura, and together they appeared in commercials until 1983. While the domestic market Hardtop has rectangular halogen headlights, all export models come with twin round headlights. This model achieved few sales in the US, possibly due to its styling with flush bumpers, called \\"spindle-shaped\\" in period marketing. Only the first two years were imported to the US, where it was the last Crown to be sold. The Corona Mark II, replaced the Crown in North America. The trunk could be opened remotely by turning the ignition key to the far left, and a button on the floor caused the radio to engage the signal seeking feature. A separate signal seeking feature was installed for rear seat passengers, installed behind the front seat facing the rear seat compartment. The 60-series Crown underwent a facelift in January 1973. Australian models were assembled in Australia by AMI. It was available in New Zealand fully imported from 1971 to 1973, with local assembly beginning at Steels Motor Assemblies, who also built the Corona, not long before the mid-life facelift, improving availability. Steels subsequently became Toyota NZ's Christchurch CKD assembly plant.  Fifth generation (S80/S90/S100; 1974–1979)  Launched in 1974 in Japan, export began from 1975. It was offered as four-door sedan, two-door hardtop coupe, four-door hardtop sedan, wagon, and van. Engines are 2.0- and 2.6-liter gasoline. The 2.2-liter diesel was introduced in October 1977. Trim levels are Standard, Deluxe, Super Saloon, and Royal Saloon. Toyota Crown Super Deluxe in Japan. The Royal Saloon came in a longer body length, coupled with the 2.6L engine while lower trim levels were in the shorter body style and 2.0 L engines. Export models used the same body whether the two- litre 5R four-cylinder or the 2.6-litre 4M inline-six. In Europe, these models claimed respectively. Minor change was given in 1978. This version of the Crown saw the introduction of disc brakes at both the front and rear axles with anti-lock brakes, speed sensitive power steering, and a 4-speed automatic transmission with overdrive. Originally, sedans and wagons had S80-series chassis numbers, while the two- and four-door hardtops received the S90-series chassis numbers. After 1976 and concurrent with the introduction of new stricter emissions regulations, all Japanese market Crowns used S100-series chassis numbers. Export models continued to use the previous codes. Initially available with the \\"old style\\" 4M engine with rounded valve cover, later models switched to the new 4M engine with rectangular valve cover. This generation also saw the introduction of fuel injection on both the 2.6-liter 4M and the 2.0-liter M engines, coupled with Toyota's TTC-C technology, adding a catalytic converter to the exhaust system. The emissions controlling technology badge helped identify which vehicles had reduced emissions tax liability. Select models also were available with four-wheel disc brakes and twin piston calipers on the front brakes. The models installed with the diesel engine was exclusive to Toyota Diesel Store locations. The Hardtop Sedan model has a front chrome grill and square headlights, but was no longer considered a true hardtop, due to the inclusion of a \\"B\\" pillar. The styling differences between the hardtop and sedan four-door models was that the side windows on the hardtop were frameless, and the rear window was sloped more than the formal appearing sedan. This series Crown in the Royal Saloon trim package exceeded length regulations of 4.7 m set forth by Japanese regulations by 65 mm, but Toyota continued to offer a 2.0 L engine in a shorter vehicle for buyers who were looking for better fuel economy over the larger six-cylinder engines, and reduced road tax liability. New Zealand models were assembled in New Zealand but on an SKD basis - which meant it had more Japanese content (such as glass) than earlier CKD versions. It was the last Crown built in New Zealand and was replaced in 1979 by the Cressida (Mark II), which was available with a four-cylinder engine. The oil crises of 1973/4 and 1979/80 had led the government to impose a 60 percent sales tax on larger engines, and the Crown could no longer be priced to suit its market. This generation Crown was imported fully built-up to Australia, and only available with the largest 2.6-liter six-cylinder engine. It was never a strong seller in Australia, offering less performance and roadholding than the domestic competitors from Ford and Holden.  Sixth generation (S110; 1979–1983)  Launched in 1979, this model had the engine upgraded from the 2.6 L to 2.8 L 5M-EU model. The 2-liter M was still on offer along with a turbocharged version—the M-TEU. The carburated 5M engine was also available in certain markets. In this series the model designation referred to the engine size — MS110 (2-liter), MS111 (2.6-liter), MS112 (2.8-liter). This was the last generation to install a four-cylinder, gasoline-powered engine. This model was the first generation Crown to be sold in Germany, beginning in 1980. The fuel injected 2.8 developed in European trim, while the 2.2 diesel offered and a choice of five- speed manual or an automatic (not in the Station Wagon). European sales started out at a respectable level, but with prices increasing at an alarming rate due to the appreciation of the yen, sales had dropped drastically by 1982.Renaux, p. 13 Early models have twin rectangular headlights, while facelift models come with bigger monoblock headlights. Domestic market Royal Saloons use the large rectangular headlights. Lower grades Van and Taxi models adopted round headlights. Royal Saloon features longer bumpers and bigger engines, which were placed in a larger road tax classification according to Japanese Government dimension regulations. The first Crown Turbo was launched in October 1980 for Japanese market only. Offering the 2.0 L engines was for buyers who didn't want to pay the large car tax, while offering better fuel economy than the larger engines. The turbo also provided a benefit in increasing fuel efficiency while reducing tailpipe emissions as Japanese consumers pay a tax on the amount of regulated substances being sent into the atmosphere from a Japanese law passed in the 1970s. In some export markets, such as Southeast Asia, the larger six-cylinder engines came fitted with carburettors. In those specs, the 2.6 offered SAE net while the 2.8 claimed DIN or 120 SAE net. Sales in Indonesia were low and this generation was not replaced there in 1984, when the 120-series Crown appeared. This generation is the last for the two-door hardtop coupé bodystyle, which was replaced by the Soarer. Reflecting a popular styling appearance during the 1970s, the coupé was fitted with a padded vinyl roof and \\"opera windows\\" for a luxurious appearance. Some of the options that became available were an Electronic compass, glass moon roof, power drivers seat, cruise control, electronic stereo tuner, and two-tone paint. Automatic climate control also appeared on this vehicle with separate controls installed for rear seat passengers as well as a rear-mounted mini fridge cooled by the separate rear seat air conditioning unit. The 2.4-liter turbo diesel appeared in August 1982.  Seventh generation (S120; 1983–1987)  Launched in 1983, this model used all three versions of the 5M 2.8L engine, the 5M carburetted version, 5M-E single overhead cam (SOHC) multi-point fuel-injected version, 5M-GE double overhead cam (DOHC), 1G-GE 2.0L DOHC, M-TE 2.0L single overhead cam (SOHC) Turbo, M-E 2.0L SOHC, 2L-TE 2.4L SOHC Turbo Diesel Ceramics Power or 2.4L SOHC Diesel Ceramics Power engines. All 2.0 L engines were installed with T-VIS (Toyota Variable Induction System). In September 1985, a supercharged version of the 2-liter G-series six replaced the turbocharged M-series. Base versions use the new 2-liter 1G-E engine which replaced the old 2-liter version of the M series. The \\"van\\" version of the station wagon (the GS126V as well as the GS136V in the following series) used its own unique variant of this motor (the 1G-EJ). In Japan, taxi and commercial versions were also available with an LPG-powered four-cylinder engine (the 3Y). A petrol-fueled version of this engine was available in some European and \\"general\\" export markets. The lower- grade models were available with Toyota's F292 live axle rear suspension while the rest introduced 4-wheel independent suspension branded as PEGASUS (Precision Engineered Geometrically Advanced Suspension) on the Crown for the first time, with TEMS installed on the Royal Saloon sedan and hardtops, coupled with Toyota's ECT electronically controlled four-speed automatic transmission, and 4ESC anti-lock brakes. The S120 was available in Hardtop sedan (frameless door glass), sedan and wagon versions but in two different exterior dimensions for length and width, with the Royal Saloon hardtop and sedan only offered in the larger body. The top-trim package was called the Royal Saloon, followed by Super Saloon Extra, Super Select for hardtop bodystyles, followed by the Royal Saloon sedan, Super Saloon Extra sedan, and the wagon came only as Super Saloon Extra. The Super Saloon Extra and Royal Saloon versions were packed with features such as dual-zone climate control, AM/FM cassette stereo with six acoustically matched speakers, combined with a separate rear cassette stereo with headphones, with dashboard-installed integrated CD player, and separate A/C and stereo control buttons installed in the rear armrest, parcel shelf mounted refrigerator, automatic headlights, reading lamps for all outboard seating positions, electrically adjusted tilt and telescoping steering column combined with a steering wheel and seat memory feature, glovebox mounted courtesy mirror among many things, while the slightly lower trim package Super Select was more modestly equipped. One distinctive styling feature of this generation was the use of a clear panel with patterned backing for the C-pillar trim on the sedans. For the Japanese market only, Toyota made the Twincam 12-valve 3.0-liter 6M-GE available on the Royal Saloon for the mid cycle update. This engine is a popular swap for 5M-GE powered Supras and Cressidas of the same period. This was the last generation Crown to be commonly available in European markets. The fuel injected 2.8-liter engine in European trim produces at 5600 rpm and had identical specifications to the Supra sold there at the time.  Eighth generation (S130; 1987–1999)  Launched in 1987. Body style: Sedan, Hardtop, and Wagon, included the commercial Van. This model used 7M-GE 3000 cc DOHC, 1G-GZE 2000 cc DOHC Super Charger, 1G-GE 2000 cc DOHC, 1G-E 2000 cc, 2L-THE 2400 cc SOHC Turbo Diesel Hi Power (automatics), 2L-TE 2400 cc SOHC Turbo Diesel (with manual transmission) or 2L 2400 cc SOHC Diesel engines. The 4.0-liter 1UZ-FE, the same engine as in Lexus LS400, was available in the Royal Saloon G, which became the Toyota Crown Majesta with the next model revision in 1992. The air suspension-equipped Royal Saloon G was also available with the 3-liter inline- six engines. Due to the different suspension, the Royal Saloon G carries a different model code (MS137 versus MS135 for the coil sprung models). The better equipped models receive an independent semi-trailing arm rear suspension, while the simpler versions (including all wagons and vans) have live rear axles located by trailing links. These versions receive different chassis numbers (GS130 versus GS131, for instance). In 1988, it became the first Toyota available with an airbag. Toyota Crown Hardtop Royal Saloon (Japan) Although a totally different chassis and body, the S130 shares styling cues with the MX83 Cressida. In 1989, the top level Royal Saloon G introduced world's first CD-ROM-based automotive navigation system, with color CRT display. Also, TRC traction control and electronically controlled shock absorbers called TEMS (shared with the first generation Toyota Soarer) were adopted. This Crown was sold only in Japan, the Middle East, the Caribbean, and select Asian markets. Some export markets received the older 2.8 liter SOHC inline-six, either carburetted or fuel injected. For general countries, only with left-hand drive and a four-speed manual transmission, the 2.2-liter inline-four 4Y engine was also available. In September 1988 a narrow-angle twin-cam version of the two-liter inline-six engine (the 1G-FE) replaced the two-valve 1G-E in most applications, although the lower cost model continued to be available in commercial models until September 1989. In August 1990, a version of the supercharged 2.0 model fitted with the bigger body of the 3.0 was added to the lineup (GS131H). This car was placed in a much higher tax bracket than the narrower-bodied versions. Such cars have different license plates than more compact cars and are therefore considered prestigious, if expensive. A few LPG-powered models were also available for commercial uses, using two-litre engines with either four or six cylinders. In August 1989, the LPG-powered M engine was replaced with the more powerful 1G-GP version while the four-cylinder 3Y engine received fuel injection. In October 1991, a large- bodied variant of the turbodiesel sedan was presented. Station Wagons were considered separate from the commercial van models in Japan. They were originally equipped with the 2-liter 1G-FE six, or as a supercharged \\"Royal Saloon\\" wagon. The 2.4 turbodiesel was also available. As of August 1990, the 2.5-liter 1JZ-FE was also available in the Station Wagon lineup. In October 1991 the supercharged model was discontinued. In September 1996 the 2.5 received variable valve timing, which led to the power jumping from . This generation marked the return of the Crown to Indonesia (in 1989), where it had not been sold regularly since 1994. It was originally sold with the two-liter inline-six engine (GS131). It continued to be built after 1995 (when the sedan was replaced in Japan) until 2000. The 2.0 was replaced with a 3-litre engine after the 1992 facelift. Unique for Indonesia was the Crown 3.0 Super Saloon combined with a 5-speed manual transmission. = Facelift (1991–1999) = In August 1991, when the Crown Hardtop was redesigned and became the S140 series, the Crown Sedan and Wagon were also restyled but retained the S130 model code. At this point the 1JZ-GE and 2JZ-GE engines replaced the M-series in-line-six engines for the Crown lineup, as well as some of the supercharged G-series models. The Standard Sedan for Taxi and base model Wagon feature round headlights and chrome bumpers. The taxi is powered by 2.4-liter diesel engine matched to 4-speed column-mounted manual transmission. In Hong Kong and Singapore, the Crown Sedan with the diesel engine was the most common vehicle used as taxis. The Crown Royal Saloon, meanwhile, was an exclusive car.  Ninth generation (S140; 1991–1995)  Launched in 1991, this model of Toyota Crown departed from the traditional styling of previous models, and introduced the new Royal Touring trim level. The new hardtop model carried the S140 chassis designation, while the refreshed Crown sedan and wagon still kept the S130 chassis from the previous generation Crown. Engine options used in the hardtop model were the 2JZ-GE 3000cc DOHC, 1JZ-GE 2500cc DOHC, and the 2L-THE diesel 2400cc SOHC engine. The 1G-FE 2000cc DOHC engine was carried over from the eighth generation for use in the sedan and wagon models. Transmission options were an optional five speed transmission dubbed \\"5ECT-i\\" used with the 2JZ-GE, a four speed \\"ECT-i\\" transmission used with the 2JZ-GE, and a four speed \\"ECT\\" transmission for the 1JZ-GE, 2L-THE, and 1G-FE equipped vehicles. For the ninth-generation Crown, the Super Edition trim level was removed, and the Super Saloon trim became the entry-level trim. A new trim level was introduced, called Royal Touring, meant to be a mid-tier model with the option of both the 2JZ-GE and 1JZ-GE. The trim levels for the S140 hardtop are Super Select, Super Saloon Extra, Royal Touring, Royal Saloon, and Royal Saloon G. The Royal Saloon G trim kept all of the luxurious options of the previous generation including a fully digital gauge cluster, GPS navigation, and more safety equipment than other trim levels. Styling was largely changed from the S130 generation. The design had shifted to a more curved front and rear end, and removed the Crown badges from the C-pillars which had been on previous models. A brand new taillight design was introduced, which was a curved, wrap- around design. The front end styling was influenced from the UCF10 Toyota Celsior which was released two years prior to the S140 Crown hardtop. Because of the new rear-end styling moving away from the traditional separate, squared taillights, the design was negatively received. This caused sales and popularity to be much lower than its rivals, the Nissan Cedric and Gloria, as well as the previous generation Crown. In January 1993, a special-edition model was released, called the Prestige Saloon series for the Royal Saloon G and the Royal Saloon trims, and the Owners Prestige series for the Royal Touring trim. This special model included new chrome door handles and an all- chrome grill. Later in 1993, a facelift model was released. The rear design went back to that of the S130 type Crown which was more favorably received. Other changes included restoring the Crown emblems to the C-pillars, a further revised front grill, front bumper, and rear bumper. This newly revised Crown was well received over the previous styling, and was able to win back some sales for the ninth-generation Crown. Even after the facelift styling in late 1993, the ninth-generation Crown was labeled a failure in Japan compared to other generations and its rivals. Because of the lower sales volume, car recycling for tax incentive in Japan, and the export of used examples to other countries, the ninth-generation Crown has become difficult to find within Japan. Facelift Crown Hardtop Royal Saloon in Japan  Tenth generation (S150; 1995–2001)  The 150-series Crown were built as Sedan and Hardtop (frameless door window) only. This was the first Crown to not use separate chassis construction. The Wagon retained the old 130 series model until 1999. Trim levels for Hardtop are Royal Extra, Royal Saloon, Royal Saloon G, and the sporty Royal Touring. 4WD is offered for Royal Extra and Royal Saloon. Engine is either 2.0, 2.5, or 3.0-liter 6-cylinder. As with previous generations, all vehicles with the 2.0 L engine were offered in a slightly shorter and narrower vehicle so as to be in compliance with Japanese Government dimension regulations. At its introduction in 1996, it won the Automotive Researchers' and Journalists' Conference Car of the Year award in Japan which it shared with the Crown Majesta. This generation Crown was not exported in great numbers. It was mainly sent to Southeast Asian markets such as Singapore and Hong Kong. These Crowns, with sedan rather than hardtop bodywork, were fitted either with the 2.0-litre 1G-FE or the 3-litre 2JZ-GE unit depending on market conditions. = Crown Comfort (XS10; 1995–2017) = Crown Comfort Crown Comfort Crown Sedan Crown Sedan In an effort to return to the original purpose of the Crown, which was to serve as a taxi, the Crown Comfort had smaller exterior dimensions but a roomier and taller interior than the Crown Royal series. To reduce unnecessary cost and weight and increase interior space, the more luxurious dashboard and fitments (including leather seats) of the Crown Royal were replaced with less bulky all-plastic versions. The Comfort is also used as an instructional vehicle for people learning how to drive. The Comfort is powered by either the 2L diesel engine (5L for the Singapore market, LXS10) or the 2-litre 3Y-PE LPG engine (YXS10). The Japanese model has fender mirrors and an automatic (driver-activated) rear door. The Crown Comfort is popular among taxicab in Japan, Hong Kong and Singapore in the past, but is gradually falling out of favour as better-appointed vehicles become available at competitive cost. The new Crown Sedan for the Japanese market only is based on the Comfort, but has wider tail lights and longer bumpers. The Crown Comfort was removed from Toyota's Japanese website on May 25, 2017, indicating that production and sales may have ended. It was replaced by the Toyota JPN Taxi which was launched at the 45th Tokyo Motor Show in October 2017.  Eleventh generation (S170; 1999–2007)  The 170-series, launched in September 1999, features shorter front overhang therefore maximizing interior and trunk space. There are two different 170-series 4-door Saloon; the Royal and Athlete. The Majesta, while sharing the same S170 chassis, is a separate vehicle which is larger and longer than the Crown and has distinctive front and rear styling. The four-door Hardtop was discontinued. The 170-series Estate launched in December 1999 was the first new Crown Wagon after the 130-series and continued in production until March 2007. The engine installed is either the 2.0, 2.5 or 3.0 in-line-six. The Athlete V has 2.5-liter 1JZ-GTE turbo and was offered in both sedan and wagon versions. The Royal was also offered with a 3.0-liter 2JZ-FSE mild hybrid. Later non-hybrid models were offered with the direct- injection version of the 2JZ engine. For the updated Athlete versions starting from August 2001 the tail lamps were changed from incandescent to LED lights and the front grille changed to a mesh design. Optional 17-inch wheels were also offered starting from 2001. An innovation was the electronically controlled (Toyota Electronic Modulated Suspension) air suspension combining nonlinear H-infinity control of damping force and roll-orientation control. The 170-series Crown replaced the aging 130-series in the Indonesian market. = Gallery = Twelfth generation (S180; 2003–2008)  The S180 model of the Crown, released in late 2003, was based on the Zero Crown concept car. The engine was changed to a V6 for the new Royal and Athlete models, while the Crown Majesta used the V8 only, now in 4.3-liter form with 4WD optional. The new engines gave more performance while also giving better fuel economy. Radar Pre-Collision System added a single digital camera to improve the accuracy of collision forecast and warning and control levels. (Really Playing it Safe) In television commercials in Japan a song was written by composer John Harle titled \\"How should I my true love know?\\". G-BOOK was introduced in May 2006. Compared with the previous model, this model was increased by in the wheelbase and in body width. These changes gave it the largest interior size among its contemporaries, more than the Mercedes-Benz S-Class or BMW 7 Series. The slightly shorter and narrower versions with a 2.0 L engine are no longer offered as a Crown, with the Crown Comfort having assumed the market position in Japan for vehicles that complied with Japanese Government dimension regulations. The S170 series Crown Estate was continued alongside the S180 sedans, and was replaced by the luxury-oriented Toyota Alphard for load carrying duties and multiple passengers. It continued to use the older inline six-cylinder engines. = Gallery = Thirteenth generation (S200; 2008–2012)  This generation of the Crown is available in 4 different trim levels: the Crown Royal series which is a more comfortable and luxurious car; the Crown Athlete series which takes the luxurious aspect of the Royal series but has more aggressive styling and sporty features; the Crown Majesta series with different styling and more luxurious features than the Royal series; and the Crown Hybrid series which is a trim level designated for the Hybrid Synergy Drive V6 drivetrain. The larger 4.6 L 1UR-FSE V8 engine incurs a higher road tax liability. = Innovation = * The Crown is one of the first vehicles to have a Navigation/Artificial Intelligence-Adaptive Variable Suspension System (NAVI/AI-AVS) 3 Dimensional Satellite Navigation System coupled with G-BOOK and boasts many features that have not been developed by other luxury car makers. This system can adjust the damper firmness for corners based on map data and change transmission gear shift timings and engine braking for merging on and off highways and approaching tollbooths. * First Toyota vehicle with active noise control. * World first Collision avoidance system (PCS) with front-side Millimeter wave radar to detect potential side collisions primarily at intersections or when another vehicle crosses the center line. The latest version tilts the rear seat upward, placing the passenger in a more ideal crash position if it detects a front or rear impact. * World first PCS Collision avoidance system with GPS-navigation linked brake assist function. The system, which is designed to determine if the driver is late in decelerating at an approaching stop sign, will then sound an alert and can also pre-charge the brakes to provide optimum braking force if deemed necessary. This system works in certain Japanese cities and requires Japan specific road markings that are detected by a CCD camera. * The Crown Hybrid Night View introduced the first pedestrian detection feature for an active Automotive night vision system. Toyota added a feature which highlights pedestrians and presents them in a box on an LCD display in front of the driver. * Updated Driver Monitoring System for detecting whether the driver's eyes are properly open. It monitors the driver's eyes to detect the driver's level of wakefulness. This system is designed to work even if the driver is wearing sunglasses, and at night. * World first center airbag introduced in 2009. The Crown is set to rival the European BMW 5 series, Mercedes E-class, Audi A6, Jaguar XF, the American Cadillac CTS, and the Japanese Acura RLX, Honda Legend, Infiniti M, and Nissan Fuga. This is the longest and widest Crown to be built until the arrival of the fourteenth generation (S210 model). The Crown Athlete has been tested to do 0–100 km/h in under 6 seconds, while the Crown Hybrid has been estimated to take 5.4 seconds due to the additional power of the hybrid motor. The mechanically similar Lexus GS 450H Hybrid (GWS191) outputs . The Crown Hybrid Concept was exhibited at 2007 Tokyo Motor Show. = Gallery = Fourteenth generation (S210; 2012–2018)  The fourteenth generation Crown was launched on 25 December 2012 with new styling, with the Royal series front styling theme paying homage to the fifth generation MS105 series. Most aspects of the car can be controlled by Toyota Multi-Operation Touch panel. The S210 Crown was launched in China in March 2015. Pricing currently ranges between 250,800 and 332,800 yuan (US$36,830–48,860) with four trim levels known as: Pioneer, Fashion, Sports and Elite. The Crown currently uses the 2 litre 8AR-FTS turbocharged four cylinder engine paired to an 8-speed automatic gearbox. Compared to its Japanese counterpart, the Crown S210 in China is 35 millimetres longer in length, 5 millimetres wider, 15 millimetres shorter in height, 65 millimetres longer in wheelbase and is 165 to 305 kilograms lighter in kerb weight. The front end of the Chinese variant has a razor blade grille just like its Japanese counterpart and has thinner headlights and taillights for a sleeker design. In Japan, the S210 Crown was discontinued in June 2018, where it was replaced by the S220 Crown. The Crown S210 ended production in May 2020 for the Chinese market, where the XX50 Avalon replaced it. = Gallery = Fifteenth generation (S220; 2018–present)  The fifteenth-generation Crown was unveiled as a concept at the 45th Tokyo Motor Show in October 2017 and went on sale on 26 June 2018, alongside with the third-generation Century. Three engine choices are offered so as to provide buyers advantages in savings with regards to Japan's annual road tax obligation, and standard equipment content is increased with each trim package matched to the engine size. It was launched on \\"The Connected Day\\" event along with the new Corolla Sport on 26 June 2018. = T-Connect = The fifteenth-generation Crown is one of the first Toyota models to be equipped with a DCM (Data Communication Module) system which then links with a Vehicle Control Network. By using this hardware, Toyota can provide various connected services to T-ConnectLanguages available for T Connect as of now are only Japanese. subscribers through its proprietary Mobility Service Platform (MSPF), an information infrastructure developed by the company for Connected Cars. Moving forward, Toyota aims to equip most new passenger vehicles in its domestic market with DCM. Beginning on August 1, 2018, Toyota Motor Corporation (Toyota), with Toyota City, will start Japan's first verification testing for road maintenance inspections using vehicle data obtained from connected cars. The verification test will enable assessment of whether the degree of road deterioration index values computed from the car's behavior data and actual road conditions are consistent, and validate these findings on more typical regional roads. Toyota also aims to further advance its technology toward supporting administrative services that implement road maintenance and inspection work in Toyota City more accurately and appropriately.  Functions of T-Connect = Vehicle data = * e-Care Driving Guidance- A remote operator is able to speak directly to the driver through the on-board microphone and speaker and it is able to review the vehicle data supplied by the DCM so that by the event of a technical failure, it can provide either trouble-shooting steps or advise the driver to bring their vehicle in to their usual or nearest service dealership. * e-Care Health Check Report- The Toyota Smart Center monitors and examines the vehicle 24/7 and the customer's preferred dealer will then contact him or her to bring the vehicle in for service at the ideal timing interval. For instance, any vehicle's auxiliary battery's starting voltage gradually declines over time. With the data provided, an alarm will be shown at the dealership's operational platform and the dealership staff will contact the driver and recommend a battery change prior to the customer experiencing trouble when starting their vehicle. The message from the dealership is sent to the car's navigation unit and read aloud to the driver. * HELPNET- In case it detects airbag deployment by an accident, a service operator will immediately review data sent by the DCM as well as an attempt to contact the customer to assess the situation. Depending on the customer's response, or lack thereof, the operator is able to alert fire or ambulance services. If emergency services consider that severe injury is likely, they can respond, possibly deploying a medical helicopter or such together with a doctor to provide emergency medical treatment. Full-scale implementation of the advanced automatic collision notification system (AACN) D-Call Net® is now underway at approximately 730 locations within Japan. To ensure that Toyota can hope to offer security and peace of mind to customers with the addition of these new vehicle data services and for a smooth operation, they will establish a \\"Connected Operation Kaizen Dojo\\" within its training center in Nisshin-city (Aichi Prefecture) and train dealership staff nationwide. = Insurance based on data of driver behavior = * Toyota Connected Car Insurance Plan by Aioi Nissei Dowa Insurance Co., Ltd.- Drivers will be assigned a safety score based on their driving data collected in the MSPF. They can use their smartphone to check their safe driving scores. The insurance premium will be updated every month based on the policy-holder's safe driving score and driving distance, and notifications sent to the customer through their smartphone.

It was the first form of commercially available Chinese food in Canada. This cooking style was invented by early Cantonese immigrants who adapted traditional Chinese recipes to Western tastes and the available ingredients. This cuisine developed in a similar process to American Chinese cuisine. History Signage in Toronto's First Chinatown for chop suey in 1923. Canadian Chinese cuisine dates back to the late 1800s. Chinese workers were employed in the 1800s by Chinese labour contractors during the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway linking Montreal, Québec with Vancouver, British Columbia. Many of those workers who stayed once the railway was completed resorted to opening small inexpensive restaurants or working as cooks in mining and logging camps, canneries, and in the private homes of the upper classes in cities and towns. They prepared variations on traditional Cantonese food that were well received by local patrons, and they were prized as cooks in wealthier households. This occurred despite the fact that few if any of them were formally trained chefs. In most small towns in Western Canada, the Chinese \\"café\\" was the first restaurant established, and often the only one. People did not buy the foods of their own ethnic group since they could prepare these themselves, whereas Chinese food was a novelty. Furthermore, the Chinese community was not heavily involved in agriculture, so this presented an opportunity for an alternative source of income. Consequently, the Chinese community specialized in the restaurant business, and were able to undercut and out-compete later rivals. These Chinese restaurants became an icon of Prairie towns and served as a foothold for a new Canadian community, and this history is displayed in a new exhibit called Chop Suey on the Prairies at the Royal Alberta Museum. In British Columbia, a form of buffet known as the \\"Chinese smörgåsbord\\" developed in pre-railway Gastown (the settlement that became Vancouver) when Scandinavian loggers and millworkers encouraged their Chinese cooks to turn a sideboard into a steamtable, instead of bringing plates of single dishes to the dining table. Following the introduction of the automobile and the drive-in restaurant, Chinese take-out service was augmented by Chinese drive-ins, including the now-vanished \\"Dragon Inn\\" chain, which was also known for its smörgåsbord. Bill Wong, father of journalist Jan Wong, was a serial restaurateur in Montreal who reportedly opened the city's first Chinese buffet restaurant, \\"House of Wong\\" on Queen Mary Road in the heavily-Jewish Snowdon district in the 1950s. He later opened the now-closed iconic restaurant \\"Bill Wong's\\" on nearby Decarie Boulevard in 1962. =1960s–present= Old Chinatown. Roast goose is a popular Cantonese dish that is also served by Canadian Chinese restaurateurs. Further Cantonese immigration to Canada began anew in the 1960s, and was ignited in the 1980s in anticipation of China's administrative take-over of Hong Kong. This resulted in many Hong Kong families relocating to Australia, the United States, the United Kingdom, and above-all Canada. This preference for Canada was due to its immigration policy, a high-standard of living, established Chinese community, and its membership in the Commonwealth. In contrast, the United States tended to accept more mainland or Taiwanese Chinese, while imposing immigration quotas on Commonwealth countries such as Hong Kong. Today's Chinese Canadian citizens are the largest visible minority group in Canada, and Chinatowns are in every major Canadian city, with those in Toronto, Vancouver, Montreal, and Calgary being the largest. This new wave of Chinese immigration has also brought a demand for more authentic Chinese food. The newer Chinese restaurants, particularly in areas of high Asian immigration, tend to serve authentic Chinese cuisine that evolved in Chinese communities outside Canada, which cater to immigrants. These range from Cantonese dim sum restaurants to Hakka cuisine restaurants with a South Asian flair. Canadian Chinese restaurants A Canadian Chinese restaurant in Nipigon, Ontario, a community of approximately 1,600 people. Canadian Chinese restaurants may be found in communities of all sizes in Canada. Even very small towns in most of Canada have at least one Canadian Chinese restaurant, and many can have two or more proprietors seeking out business, often right next to each other on the main street. Many towns that cannot support a single franchise restaurant still have a thriving Chinese food restaurant. However, many independent restaurants in larger cities have found their business shrinking as delivery chains and buffets squeeze out traditional sit-down restaurants. In many towns and hamlets across the prairie provinces and in northern British Columbia, there can usually be found a Chinese café regardless of the community's size, serving \\"Canadian and Chinese cuisine\\" or, once more common, \\"Chinese and Western Food\\". In Glendon, Alberta, for example, next to a roadside model of the world's largest perogy (a staple of Ukrainian cuisine), sits the Perogy Café, which serves \\"Ukrainian and Chinese Perogies\\" (meaning pot stickers). This establishment is actually owned by a Vietnamese family. Canadian Chinese chop suey houses are predominantly situated in non-immigrant neighbourhoods catering to non-Chinese customers. However, they are now most often mixed with those featuring the more traditional cuisines. Canadian Chinese restaurants are not limited to these areas and can often be found even at the farthest outskirts of the metropolitan areas. Because of the popularity of Canadian Chinese food, even some of the older authentic Chinese restaurants may offer Canadian Chinese dishes to cater to non-Chinese customers. Golden Village. The Golden Village holds the largest concentration of Chinese restaurants in North America. Restaurants in the newer Chinatowns, particularly in Vancouver and Toronto, tend to cater to recent Asian immigrants and offer more varied fare; Szechuan, Hakka, Chiuchow, Taiwanese, and even Buddhist cuisine restaurants can be found there. One of the largest concentration of Chinese restaurants in North America is located in the Golden Village area in Richmond, BC, a suburb of Vancouver, BC. The seafood served here is from the British Columbian coast. Toronto's Old Chinatown has seen most of the once-famed restaurants on Dundas Street and Spadina Avenue close since the late 1990s, especially the Siu mei barbecue shops on Dundas Street that were located below grade. The 1990s also saw the closure of demise of Hsin Huang (or Hsin Kuang), a three-restaurant chain in the Greater Toronto Area, offering dim sum, Siu mei, and formal Chinese dining. These restaurants, one at Chinese Centre at 888 Dundas Street East in Mississauga, another at Finch Avenue and Kennedy Road in Scarborough, and their four-storey flagship location at Spadina Avenue and St. Andrew Street (just north of Dundas Street) in old Toronto Chinatown, were decorated inside with the traditional red and yellow colours of the Fenghuang while the exterior was yellow and had a green Oriental roof. In the newer suburban areas of the Greater Toronto Area, such as Highway 7 in Richmond Hill and Markham, the Chinese restaurants range from small eateries, Siu mei BBQ shops, and bakeries in Chinese strip malls and food courts, to the all-you-can-eat buffets that often expand beyond Chinese-Canadian to incorporate Asian fusion (including Japanese, Korean, and Thai), to the larger and more expensive places that often function as banquet halls with ten-course meals available. A food court oriented towards Asian cuisine at First Markham Place in Markham, Ontario Among upscale restaurants, the older places will often have the traditional Chinese decor, which is red and yellow colours with the Fenghuang (Chinese dragon and phoenix) adorning the wall behind the dais, however newer establishments tend to be decorated in a more Western contemporary style. Many of these fine dining restaurants and banquet halls often offer discounted dim sum lunches on weekdays and early weekends or to seniors, though this is a low margin segment, and their main earnings come from hosting weddings or other functions. Observers have noted that dim sum \\"cart service is a dying breed in Toronto, as more and more restaurants have switched over to a list-based dining experience. There are a few notable places where you can still witness these magical culinary carts being rolled out in front of you; and where you order by using your pointer finger, not a pen and paper.\\" Although most restaurants are independent businesses, there are some chains such as \\"Hons Wonton House\\" (metro Vancouver), \\"Kirin Chinese Restaurant\\" (metro Vancouver), \\"Congee Wong\\" (Toronto and York region) and \\"Mandarin Restaurant\\" (southern Ontario). The \\"Regal Palace\\" chain of four restaurants, owned by Yuk Yee Ellen Pun and Patsy Lai, went bankrupt and ceased operations in 2013 while owing 60 employees $676,000 in unpaid wages.https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2018/08/02/restaurant-owner-jailed- pay_a_23494834/https://news.ontario.ca/mol/en/2018/07/director-faces-jail- corporations-fined-900000-for-failing-to-comply-with-orders-to-pay.html Imitation restaurants include Ding Tai Fung (which is intentionally similar to Din Tai Fung) in First Markham Place and Hutaoli Music Restaurant & Bar in Bridlewood Mall. Culture Ginger beef is an example of a unique Canadian Chinese dish, which was developed in Calgary during the 1970s. Josephine Smart, a professor from the University of Calgary, has written on the evolution of Canadian Chinese cuisine. Her papers have examined the dynamics of localization and \\"authenticization\\" of Chinese food in Canada, and its implications for ethnic relations and the culture of consumption. Chinese restaurants generally use either one of the romanization systems for Cantonese or an ad hoc romanization rather than the Pinyin romanization of Mandarin Chinese with which non-Chinese people are now most familiar. Foam take-out containers are containers most commonly used by Canadian Chinese restaurants for take-out, although some restaurants use special plastic containers. Aluminum pan pie dishes were previously used until the late 1990s, when they fell out of favour due to high costs and environmental concerns. As opposed to their American counterparts, the use of the oyster pail is less common in Canadian Chinese restaurants. Although the Canadian version of westernized Chinese cuisine is very similar to that found in the United States, there are a few distinctive regional dishes: * Ginger beef: deep fried strips of beef coated in a dark sweet sauce featuring ginger, garlic, and hot peppers, commonly served with a small amount of julienned carrots and onions. Ginger beef is derived from the original Geung Ngao Yuk (Chinese: 薑牛肉) dish. Ubiquitous in Calgary and common across the Canadian Prairies. The invention of ginger beef is claimed by several restaurants and chefs, but is generally traced back to George Wong at the Silver Inn in Calgary in the mid-1970s. *Newfoundland chow mein: a regional variant made with thinly sliced cabbage instead of egg noodles due to historical difficulties in accessing authentic Chinese ingredients in Atlantic Canada. *Montreal peanut-butter dumplings: a dish consisting of wonton or jiaozi covered with peanut, honey, and soy-sauce based sauce, most likely based-on the Sichuan dish hongyou chaosho (紅油抄手, lit. folded-dumplings in red-oil) and reinterpreted for the tastes of Montrealers. Also known as Hunan dumplings, the dish was likely created in the 1980s at a restaurant \\"le Piment Rouge\\" and quickly became popular throughout Chinese and Thai restaurants in Montreal and later Québec. *Thunder Bay bon bons: a salty, deep-fried rib dish that is said to go well with beer, invented in the 1940s by Thunder Bay Chinese restaurateur Lam Pang and now ubiquitous in Thunder Bay's Chinese restaurants. The ribs are chopped, marinated overnight in ingredients including salt, sugar, and five-spice powder, dipped in eggs, and coated with bread or crushed crackers before frying. *Fried macaroni: stir- fried macaroni with soy sauce, meat, and vegetables served in Québec. *Green onion cake: A flat breaded cake that is made with scallions. It is a popular dish in Edmonton that was introduced by Siu To, a restaurateur who brought Northern Chinese delicacies to the city. For more expensive or formal occasions, Chinese Canadians may seek out more authentic Chinese cuisine. A Chinese wedding reception typically has nine or ten courses. Expensive dishes such as shark fin, abalone, lobster, jumbo shrimp, squab, sea bass, or sea cucumber are common on a wedding banquet menu. A whole cooked fish, chicken, or pig means luck and completeness in Chinese wedding culture.

Should it attempt any other system calls, the kernel will terminate the process with SIGKILL or SIGSYS. In this sense, it does not virtualize the system's resources but isolates the process from them entirely. seccomp mode is enabled via the system call using the \`PR_SET_SECCOMP\` argument, or (since Linux kernel 3.17) via the system call. seccomp mode used to be enabled by writing to a file, \`/proc/self/seccomp\`, but this method was removed in favor of \`prctl()\`. In some kernel versions, seccomp disables the \`RDTSC\` x86 instruction, which returns the number of elapsed processor cycles since power- on, used for high-precision timing. seccomp-bpf is an extension to seccomp that allows filtering of system calls using a configurable policy implemented using Berkeley Packet Filter rules. It is used by OpenSSH and vsftpd as well as the Google Chrome/Chromium web browsers on Chrome OS and Linux. (In this regard seccomp-bpf achieves similar functionality, but with more flexibility and higher performance, to the older systrace—which seems to be no longer supported for Linux.)

It is from the city of Syracuse in the Hyblean Mountains. History The area around Palazzolo Acreide has been inhabited since ancient times. In the 10th-11th centuries BC, the Sicels lived here in small villages. The town occupies the site of the ancient Akrai (Latin Acrae), founded by Syracuse around 664 BC. The city was important as it controlled the paths of communication between the towns on the southern coast of the island. According to Thucydides, the Syracusans defeated the Athenians here in 413 BC. In the treaty between the Romans and Hiero II of Syracuse in 263 BC it was assigned to the latter. After the Roman conquest, it became a civitas stipendiaria, and was still prospering in the course of the early Christian age. The old city was probably destroyed by the Arabs, in the first half of the 9th century. The new city was built around a Norman castle, which no longer exists. An earthquake in 1693 destroyed almost the entire city, which was slowly rebuilt in the following centuries. =Ancient city= The Ancient City lies on the hill above the modern town, the approach to it being defended by quarries, in which tombs of all periods have been discovered. The auditorium of the small theatre is well-preserved, though nothing of the stage remains. Nearby are the ruins of other buildings, which bear, without justification, the names Naumachia, Odeum (perhaps a bath establishment) and Palace of Hiero. The water supply was obtained by subterranean aqueducts. In the cliffs of the Monte Pineta to the south are other burial niches, and curious bas-reliefs called Santoni or Santicelli, carved in the 19th century by a peasant proprietor, which also appear to be related to funeral ceremonies. Also nearby is the necropolis of the Acrocoro della Torre, where many sarcophagi have been found. About north lies Buscemi, near which a sacred grotto has been discovered; and also a church cut into the rock and surrounded by a cemetery. Economy The economy of Palazzolo Acreide relies mainly on agriculture (cereals) and farming of cattle and sheep. The population in 2009 was approximately 9,000, growing to 15,000 by 2016.

Bartholini and colleagues concluded that it was this that caused Parkinson's patients in human clinical trials to either see an improvement in their Parkinson's with a worsening of L-dopa dyskinesia or an improvement in dyskinesia but with sometimes aggravated Parkinson's symptoms. The cholinergic effect takes only a single injection to achieve in rats; when given with haloperidol, the development of tolerance to haloperidol's cataleptic effects did not develop. It was hoped that this would be effective for tardive dyskinesia. However, Soares, Rathbone and Deeks wrote in the 2004 issue of The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews that \\"Any possible benefits are likely to be outweighed by the adverse effects associated with their [GABAergic agents'] use.\\" In addition to being tested for antipsychotic-induced tardive dyskinesia, progabide was itself tested as an antipsychotic; as early as 1979, it was obvious that it was ineffective for psychosis. (French) While progabide may have been devoid of antipsychotic effects, it did have the effect in schizoaffective and hebephrenic patients of improving environmental responsiveness and social interactions.

The flagship facility for the Henry Ford Health System, it was one of the first hospitals in the United States to use a standard fee schedule and favor private or semi-private rooms over large wards. It was the first hospital in the country to form a closed, salaried medical staff. As founder Henry Ford viewed tobacco as being unhealthy, the hospital was one of the first in the United States to institute a total ban on smoking. Henry Ford Hospital is staffed by the Henry Ford Medical Group, one of the nation's largest and oldest group practices with 1,200 physicians in more than 40 specialties. Henry Ford Hospital, which opened in 1915, is a Level 1 trauma center, recognized for clinical excellence and innovations in the fields of cardiology, cardiovascular surgery, neurology, neurosurgery, orthopedics, sports medicine, organ transplants, and treatment for prostate, breast, and lung cancers. Henry Ford Hospital annually trains more than 500 residents and 125 fellows in 46 accredited programs. Through its affiliation with Wayne State University, more than 400 medical students train at the hospital each academic year. The Detroit hospital and campus is led by president and CEO, Doctor of Medicine, John Popovich, Jr. Overview Henry Ford Hospital is an 877-bed hospital located in Detroit's New Center area. The hospital is staffed by the 1,200 physicians and scientists in the Henry Ford Medical Group. The model for the Henry Ford Medical Group is the same model used at the Mayo Clinic, Johns Hopkins Hospital and the Cleveland Clinic. Henry Ford Hospital operates a Level 1 Trauma Center and has one of the busiest emergency rooms in Michigan, treating nearly 100,000 patients annually. Henry Ford Hospital performs organ transplants in many areas, including heart, lung, kidney, bone marrow, pancreas, and liver. Henry Ford Hospital's Vattikuti Urology Institute operates the largest robotic prostatectomy program in the world. The robotic prostate surgery was created at Henry Ford and more than 5,000 men have has successful robotic prostate surgery. In 2009, Henry Ford Hospital opened 24 new private intensive care rooms, bringing its total to 156 intensive care rooms at the Detroit campus, more than any other hospital in Michigan. The opening of the new floor is the final piece of a two-story, $35 million addition at the hospital. Henry Ford has a robust medical education program, where more than 500 residents in 40 specialties train every day. One-third of all physicians in Michigan receive training at Henry Ford, and its post- graduate medical education enterprise is among the largest in the country. Research programs at Henry Ford Hospital have total annual funding exceeding $70 million. The National Institutes of Health is the primary funding source for Henry Ford's research programs. Henry Ford physicians and researchers are currently involved in more than 1,700 research projects, including those focused on stroke and traumatic brain injury, hypertension and heart disease, cancer, bone and joint diseases, the immunological basis of disease, and population studies of allergy, asthma and cancer prevention. Much of Henry Ford Hospital research is translational in nature - from bench to bedside. To this end, basic science studies run the gamut from whole animal physiology to cell and molecular biology to bioengineering with an emphasis on studies that can directly impact patient care. In 2009, Henry Ford researchers published more than 450 articles in peer-reviewed medical journals and attracted $57.4 million in external funding. Henry Ford Hospital is part of the Henry Ford Health System, one of the country's largest health care systems and a national leader in clinical care, research and education. It includes the 1,200-member Henry Ford Medical Group, five hospitals, the Health Alliance Plan, 30 primary care centers and many other health-related entities throughout Southeast Michigan. In 2009 alone, Henry Ford provided more than $173 million in uncompensated care. The health system plans to invest $500 million to expand the Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit, and employs more than 23,000. Founded in 1915 by auto pioneer Henry Ford and now one of the nation's leading health care providers, Henry Ford Health System is a not-for-profit corporation managed by Chief Executive Officer Wright L. Lassiter, III and governed by a 17-member Board of Trustees, with volunteer-led advisory and affiliate boards providing additional leadership. The system is governed by a board of trustees. Advisory and affiliate boards include 150 volunteer leaders, who provide vital links to the communities served by the System. Henry Ford is managed by President and Chief Executive Officer Wright Lassiter, III. More than 30,000 total Henry Ford Health System employees provide care during the more than 4.24 million annual patient contacts. Henry Ford health care providers perform more than 100,400 ambulatory surgery procedures each year. More than 113,000 patients are admitted to Henry Ford's six hospitals annually. REVENUE History For the 15th consecutive year, the System experienced positive revenue growth in 2017. The System is one of a handful of healthcare organizations nationally with both a strong provider organization and large insurance operations. Overall revenue increased by 4.8%. in 2017. In 2017 Annual revenue was 6.0 billion. History1910s= Newspaper photo of the hospital from 1915. In 1909, responding to the lack of hospital beds in the city, Dr. William Metcalf organized the Detroit General Hospital Association. The Association included a number of prominent Detroit citizens, among whom was Henry Ford. The Association used donations from its members to purchase a site at Grand Boulevard and Hamilton, and to hire architect William Stratton to design the hospital. Construction on the original seven buildings began in 1912, but the Association soon realized that its $600,000 budget was far too small to complete the hospital. However, in 1914, Henry Ford offered to complete the project and pay off the original donors, in exchange for complete control. The Association accepted, and construction continued. The original seven buildings--a service building, power house, garage, private patient building, surgical pavilion, and two other small buildings--were completed by 1915, and Henry Ford Hospital opened its doors to patients on October 1. Henry Ford organized a closed staff of physicians and surgeons, many of whom came from Johns Hopkins, including medical chief Frank J. Sladen and surgical chief Roy Donaldson McClure. In 1917, it was determined that more space was needed for the hospital, and Ford Motor Company architect Albert Wood was hired to design a new hospital. Contractor Albert A. Albrecht was hired to construct the new hospital, but World War I intervened before construction was complete. In 1918, Ford loaned the semi-completed building to the US government, and it was used as U.S. Army General Hospital Number 36 until late 1919. Construction was completed after the war, in 1921. =1920s= Henry Ford Hospital in 1920. In 1923, under the direction of doctor Thomas J. Heldt, Henry Ford Hospital became one of the first American general hospitals to establish a psychiatric unit. In 1935, doctor Roy McClure began adding iodine to kitchen salt to prevent the development of endemic goiters. Eventually salt for human use was iodized by law. =1940s= In 1940, Dr. Conrad Lam was the first physician in the United States to administer purified heparin to treat clotting of veins. In 1942, Henry Ford Hospital became one of a few U.S. hospitals selected by the National Research Council as a trial site to test penicillin. In 1943, Henry Ford Hospital's doctor Frank Hartman developed the liquid oxygen tent. In 1944, Henry Ford Hospital became the first hospital to use the now-routine technique of multiple lead electrocardiograms. In 1948, the hospital recognized the need for a new building due to the 600% increase in patients over the preceding 25 years and hired Benjamin L. Smith of the New York firm Vorhees, Walker, Foley and Smith to design a new clinic tower, construction of which began in 1951. =1950s= The new clinic building opened in 1953 however construction returned to the campus in 1957 when Albert Kahn Associates designed an addition of two floors for the main building. In 1951, doctors Conrad Lam and Edward Munnell developed a technique for the correction of mitral valve stenosis, using a special six-finger glove with a knife attached to the sixth mid-palm finger. In 1952, Henry Ford Hospital vascular surgeon, doctor D. Emerick Szilagyi, performed one of the world's first grafts of an abdominal aortic aneurysm. In 1956, Henry Ford Hospital cardiothoracic surgeon Dr. Conrad Lam performed the first successful open heart surgery in Michigan using the heart-lung machine on 15 month old Kathleen McQuillen. That same year, Henry Ford's Dr. James Barron developed the Barron Food Pump, a device used to deliver pureed food through a small nasal gastric tube. =1960s= In 1967, doctor George Mikhail performed Detroit's first Mohs Micrographic Surgery, a procedure to remove skin cancers. In 1968, the first allogenic kidney transplant in Detroit was done by doctors D. Emerick Szilagyi, Joseph P. Elliott and Roger F. Smith. =1970s= In 1973, Michigan's first renal transplant to a diabetic patient was performed by doctor Stanley Dienst. In 1979, Henry Ford Hospital was one of the first to perform coronary angioplasty. =1980s= In 1980, doctors Fred W. Whitehouse and Dorothy A. Kahkonen were the first physicians in Michigan and the second in the country to administer human insulin to a patient with diabetes. In 1985, doctors Fraser Keith and Donald Magilligan performed Detroit's first heart transplant. In the same year, the first extracorporal shock wave lithotripsy in Michigan was performed at Henry Ford. This non-invasive procedure breaks kidney stones into sand-like grains which are easily passed from the body. In 1987, doctor Charles Jackson and other Henry Ford Hospital and Yale researchers identified the location of a gene on chromosome 10, linked to hereditary medullary thyroid cancer. In 1993, the gene itself was identified. Also in 1987, Henry Ford was the first in Michigan to use iodine radium implant seeds to combat cancerous cells in the prostate. In 1988, Detroit's first liver transplant was performed at Henry Ford Hospital. =1990s= In 1994, Henry Ford Hospital performed the first lung transplant in the Detroit Metropolitan Area, making it the only facility in metro Detroit to perform all solid organ transplants. In 1995, Henry Ford Hospital conducted Michigan's first radiosurgery treatment for patients with inoperable tumors using the three-dimensional x-knife system. In 1996, Henry Ford Hospital performed the state's first split-liver transplant, during which a donor's liver was split in two and the separate pieces transplanted into two patients. In 1998, Henry Ford Hospital became the first hospital in Michigan to offer genetic testing for breast cancer. =2000s= The headquarters of the Henry Ford Health System, in June 2008. In 2000, Henry Ford Hospital performed Michigan's first adult-to-adult, living donor liver transplant. In 2001, the Vattikuti Urology Institute, under the direction of doctor of medicine Mani Menon, was the first in the United States to perform surgery using a robotic system for the treatment of prostate cancer: the first outpatient robotic prostatectomy. Also in 2001, doctors at Henry Ford Hospital became the first in Michigan to use gene therapy for the treatment of brain tumors. In 2005, doctor Scott Dulchavsky, chair of the department of Surgery at Henry Ford Hospital, expanded uses for ultrasound technology for physicians and non-medical personnel; these procedures can be used as an accurate diagnostic tool when coupled with the Internet, a telephone or wireless transmission of ultrasound images to experts from a patient in rural areas or in space. Also in 2005, Henry Ford Medical Group began using e-prescribing to cut prescription costs and improve quality. HFMG physicians now write more than 20,000 electronic prescriptions weekly, helping improve their overall generic use rate by 7.3 percent. In 2008, Henry Ford Hospital became the first hospital in southeastern Michigan to perform a new, minimally invasive procedure for back pain that spares the nerves from being nicked and back muscles from being cut. In 2009, Henry Ford Hospital received more than $70 million in research funding. =2010s= In 2010, Henry Ford Hospital performed Michigan's first intestine transplant. The composite multivisceral transplant procedure included transplant of the patient's small bowel, stomach, and pancreas. Campus and buildings Henry Ford Hospital sits on a campus at the western edge of the New Center area. The main hospital is at the southern boundary of the campus, facing Grand Boulevard, with additions to the north and west. The remainder of the buildings are located north of the main hospital. The campus includes multiple buildings constructed at different times and designed by different architects in different architectural styles. However, the buildings relate to each other, as most use similarly colored brick and similar trim features. =M Unit (1914)= The M Unit is the original patient building and is located directly east of the clinic tower, slightly below the current grade. The building is 2-1/2-story red brick structure with limestone trim and a red clay tile roof. The architecture is similar to a Georgian estate house, with a nine-bay-wide center mass flanked by symmetrical three-bay wings. The entrance is in the center, with the entrance bay and the surrounding two bays clad in limestone. =Main Hospital (1917; 1957 addition)= The main hospital is a six-story brick building, with a large central octagonal tower flanked by symmetrical wings. The wings end in perpendicular pavilions, giving the entire structure an H-footprint. The front of the tower is five bays wide, with angled sides three bays wide. Each bay contains a single window at the third through sixth floors. The fifth and sixth floors of the wings were added in 1957, but match the original building in appearance. Each wing has nine bays, with the center three being a stone-clad porch (now filled with aluminum windows). The end pavilions extend nine bays perpendicularly. =Clara Ford Nurse's Home (1925)= The Clara Ford Nurse's Home is a 6-1/2-story red brick Georgian Revival structure with a clay tile roof. The building extends for an entire block, with perpendicular sections at each end extending to the rear to give the building a U-shaped footprint. The foundation and first floor are clad in limestone, and the center double-door entrance is reached by a large set of steps. The entire building uses one-over-one symmetric-paired double-hung windows. =Education Building (1925)= The Education Building is located near the Clara Ford Nurse's Home, and is built in a similar Georgian Revival style. =Clinic Tower (1951)= The clinic tower is a 17-story rectangular red brick building, extending 11 by 17 bays of evenly spaced windows from the second through sixteenth floors. The seventeenth floor has narrower windows spaced more closely and is faced in the exterior in limestone. The exterior has little detail. On the roof is a two-story penthouse, also faced in limestone, which houses mechanical and ventilation equipment. In 1971, the hospital added a tower to the east of the clinic to house additional elevators, stairways and office space. The exterior of the tower is faced with red brick and metal panels. =South Parking Deck (1959)= The south parking deck is faced with distinctive twisted concrete slabs on the upper four levels, with the twist alternating in direction from floor to floor. The first floor is clad in red brick, and two red brick stair towers are located on the south and west sides. =Other buildings= Other buildings on the campus include the 1965 north parking deck (similar in appearance to the south deck), the 1975 apartment building, the 1974 Benson Ford Education and Research Center, the 1978 Eleanor Clay Ford Pavilion, the 1978 Power House, and the 1997 West Pavilion. In 2017, the Henry Ford Health System announced the start of a second development on its evolving 300-acre South Campus site in New Center, with the construction of a new $150 million, 187,000-square-foot, six- story, Brigitte Harris Cancer Pavilion, scheduled to open in early 2020, along with a skywalk across West Grand Boulevard to connect it to the hospital. In 2017, The Henry Ford Health System and the Detroit Pistons announced plans to build a new $65 million, Henry Ford-Detroit Pistons Performance Center, that includes a dedicated 25,000-square-foot sports medicine building, that will also be available to the public, and that will be connected to the performance center. It will be located in the TechTown area of New Center. Awards and recognition In 2011, Henry Ford Health System was one of four recipients of the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award, presented by the president of the United States. In the same year, the hospital was selected by the National Quality Forum and The Joint Commission to receive the John M. Eisenberg Patient Safety and Quality Award. The No Harm Campaign was recognized for successfully reducing harm events by 26% and system-wide mortality by 12% from 2008 to 2011. Additionally, Henry Ford Hospital received the 2010 American Hospital Association-McKesson Quest for Quality finalist award. The prize honors hospitals that have committed in a systematic manner to achieving the Institute of Medicine's six quality aims—safety, patient-centeredness, effectiveness, efficiency, timeliness, and equity.

She was Australia's first Aboriginal magistrate, serving the Local Court in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia between 1986 until her retirement in 2013. O'Shane was the first female Aboriginal teacher in Queensland; the first Aboriginal to earn a law degree; the first Aboriginal barrister; and the first woman and Aboriginal person to be the head of a government department in Australia, the New South Wales Ministry of Aboriginal Affairs. Biography O'Shane was born in Mossman, Queensland on 19 June 1941 to Gladys, an Aboriginal woman, and her husband Patrick O'Shane, an Irish boxer and unionist. She is an Aboriginal Australian of the Kunjandji clan of the Kuku Yalanji people. O'Shane's mother moved the family from Mossman to Cairns to enable her children to receive a good education. O'Shane ended up the only Aboriginal Australian child in her age group graduating from her high school, gained a scholarship and studied at Teachers' College and the University of Queensland, before teaching at Cairns High School for eight years. When her mother died O'Shane went into a deep depression and was hospitalised. On an Aboriginal Study Grant, O'Shane studied law at the University of New South Wales, graduated in 1976, and was admitted to the New South Wales bar. O'Shane began practicing law as a barrister with the Aboriginal Legal Service in Sydney and then in Central Australia, O'Shane was head of the New South Wales Ministry of Aboriginal Affairs from 1981 to 1986, before her appointment as a magistrate. She was the Chancellor of the University of New England between 1994 and 2003. In 2013 O'Shane was awarded a Deadly Award for lifetime achievement in leadership, being praised as a woman who \\"blazed a path for others to follow . . . she is a genuine and inspiring role model for others\\". Along with fellow Deadly 2013 winner Archie Roach, she used the win to call for an end to the Northern Territory Intervention. O'Shane retired as a magistrate in January 2013, taking long service leave until she reached compulsory retirement age in mid-June. Australian Constitutional Convention O'Shane was elected to the Australian Constitutional Convention 1998, which considered the issue of Australia becoming a republic. She advocated strongly for an Australian republic. In her opening address, she expressed a want for modification based on what she perceived as historical injustice and inadequacies within the Australian Constitution: Academic criticism A study in 2012 by Michael Eburn and Ruth Townsend of the Australian National University College of Law examined 56 Supreme Court appeals of cases heard before O'Shane between 1999 and 2012. Of the 56 appeals, 35 (62.5%) were upheld. Of the 16 criminal cases included, 14 appeals were upheld. Eburn and Townsend wrote: \\"The Supreme Court has found that O'Shane had got the law wrong in 14 out of the 16 criminal cases ... In one case she dismissed a charge even though the accused had entered a plea of guilty.\\" Supreme Court judges criticised O'Shane for \\"denying the prosecution procedural fairness,\\" and \\"failure to comprehend the basis of the prosecution case or the evidence before her, use of intemperate language and making numerous errors of law.\\" Eburn and Townsend compared the records of two other magistrates with similar experience and found only eight and nine appeals against them respectively. They called for O'Shane's resignation. Awards and honours O'Shane was appointed a Member of the Order of Australia in 1984, for public service in the field of Aboriginal welfare. She was awarded the Centenary Medal in 2001 for service to Australian society and higher education. In 1998 she was voted one of Australia's living treasures by the National Trust. At the Deadly Awards 2013, O'Shane was presented with the Marcia Langton Award For Lifetime Achievement In Leadership.Aboriginal magistrate Pat O'Shane, Archie Roach honoured at Deadly Awards, ABC News, 11 September 2013.

He served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1915 to 1920, as a member of the Liberal Party. Prout was born to a British family in Barbados, and was educated privately. He came to Canada in 1896, and worked as a financial agent in Selkirk, Manitoba. He married Emma Evans McKinley in 1914. In religion, Prout was a member of the Church of England. He first sought election to the Manitoba legislature in the provincial election of 1914, and lost to Conservative cabinet minister Walter Montague by only one vote in the constituency of Kildonan and St. Andrews. Montague was not a candidate in the 1915 provincial election, and Prout defeated his new Conservative opponent by 541 votes to win a seat in the legislature. The Liberals won a landslide majority government in this election, and Prout served as a backbench supporter of Tobias Norris's administration for the next five years. In 1917, he introduced the Rural Credits Act which provided for the establishment of rural credit societies that could obtain short term loans on behalf of members to purchase seed, livestock, implements, machinery and other supplies. Prout sought re-election in the Winnipeg constituency in the 1920 provincial election. Prior to this election, a change in Manitoba's electoral system redesigned Winnipeg as a ten-member constituency, with members chosen by a single transferable ballot. Prout was not selected as a Liberal candidate, and ran for re-election as an independent. He fared poorly, finishing in 31st place on the first count with only 219 votes, and was eliminated on the eleventh count. Prout attempted to return to the legislature in the 1927 provincial election, running as a Liberal candidate in the Fisher constituency. He finished a distant third against Nicholas Bachynsky of the Progressive Party. He died in Toronto.

He served as Bishop of Peoria between 1990 and 2001, Ecclesiastical Superior of Turks and Caicos from 2001 to 2016 and Archbishop of Newark during the same period. Early years The eldest of seven children, Myers has an ancestry that traces its roots to England, Ireland and France. His ancestors settled in northern Illinois in the late 19th century. The Myers family farmed land near Earlville, Illinois. Myers was childhood friends with author Gary K. Wolf; they collaborated on a science fiction novel, SpaceVulture, released in 2008. Prayer was an important part of their family routine and John Myers became an altar server in his parish, St. Theresa, from an early age. He attended the Earlville schools and graduated from Loras College in Dubuque, Iowa in 1963. While he was a student at Loras, Bishop John Baptist Franz offered him the opportunity to prepare for the priesthood in Rome. Priesthood He was ordained to the priesthood (by Bishop Francis Reh at St. Peter's Basilica in Rome) for the Diocese of Peoria (Illinois) on December 17, 1966. His education for the priesthood and as a priest included study in theology at the Pontifical Gregorian University while attending seminary at the North American College, where he received the S.T.L., or licentiate (post-master's certification) in sacred theology, and a doctorate in church law, the J.C.D. Episcopacy John Myers, at 46, was consecrated coadjutor Bishop of Peoria in 1987, with Peoria's Bishop Edward William O'Rourke as the principal consecrator, and Louisville's archbishop, Thomas Cajetan Kelly, O.P.; and the Bishop of Pittsburgh, Donald William Wuerl, serving as the co-consecrators. He served as coadjutor Bishop of Peoria, and became Bishop of Peoria upon O'Rourke's resignation and retirement in 1990. On July 24, 2001, he was appointed the fifth Archbishop of Newark and third superior of the Mission Sui Iuris of Turks and Caicos. He was installed October 9, 2001, and the pallium was conferred on June 29, 2002. Though the customary form of spoken address for an archbishop is \\"Your Excellency\\", he prefers to be addressed as \\"Your Grace\\".For the use of \\"His Grace\\" as his reference style see: 1, 2 , 3, 4, 5 , 6, 7 , 8 9 In 2013, Archbishop Myers was given a coadjutor archbishop: Bernard Hebda, until then the bishop of Gaylord, Michigan. However, in 2016, Hebda was named Archbishop of Saint Paul and Minneapolis instead. He had been administering that archdiocese as apostolic administrator for nine months from Newark. Pope Francis accepted Myers' resignation on November 7, 2016. Myers moved near his family in Illinois in January 2020, as his physical and mental health were in decline. He died on September 24, 2020. =Activities= Myers was active in the Canon Law Society of America, having worked with committees dealing with the revised Code of Canon Law, diocesan fiscal officers, lay ministry, and diocesan governance, and served as a member of the CLSA Board of Governors. He helped present workshops on the revised Code of Canon Law for members of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops. Archbishop Myers also served as a consultor to the Pontifical Council for the Interpretation of Legal Texts at the Holy See. He was also a member of the Board of Trustees at The Catholic University of America; and served on the board of the North American College and Mount Saint Mary's Seminary in Emmitsburg, Maryland. His hobby was writing and is the co- author with Gary K. Wolf (creator of Roger Rabbit) of Space Vulture, a 1950s pulp sci-fi pastiche novel published by Tor Books in 2008. =Views= Myers has been both praised and criticized because of his strong conservative views and management style. Many praise his leadership and say he championed authentic Catholic doctrine at a time when many feel Catholics are drifting from strict observance. But his critics describe a domineering bishop who placed undue emphasis on the letter of the law at the expense of compassion. Myers defended his actions stating: \\"We live our faith in communion with the church in Rome...It's sometimes difficult for us as Catholics to follow a way that appears to be different from what others in our society practice or believe. This can, understandably, cause confusion or frustration in some people.\\" While Bishop of Peoria, Myers: *Prevented Bishop Thomas Gumbleton (now-retired auxiliary of Detroit) from meeting with a progressive group in a church in the Peoria diocese. *Admonished priests who give Holy Communion to pro-choice parishioners and divorced Catholics who remarry without getting an annulment. *Refused to let diocesan teachers attend a national meeting for Catholic educators because one of the speakers was known to favor ordination of women and fired a parochial school teacher for permitting a debate on ordination of women. *Supported the Cardinal Newman Society. Bishop Fabian Bruskewitz of Lincoln, Neb. (since retired), one of its stalwarts, has threatened to excommunicate Catholics who belong to liberal church organizations such as Call to Action. On April 30, 2010, the Archbishop expressed concern about a planned offering of a course on same-sex marriage by his diocese's Catholic university, Seton Hall University, saying it \\"troubles me greatly\\".New Jersey.com: \\"Newark archbishop questions plan for Seton Hall University gay marriage class\\" May 1, 2010Cardinal Newman Society: \\"Archbishop of Newark Criticizes Same-Sex ‘Marriage’ Course at Seton Hall\\" April 30, 2010 =Church sex scandal= In 2002, Archbishop Myers was among the roughly two- thirds of sitting bishops and acting diocese administrators that the Dallas Morning News said had allowed priests accused of sexual abuse to continue working. Alt URL In 2005 and 2007, the Diocese of Metuchen and the Archdiocese of Newark paid financial settlements to two priests who had accused Cardinal Theodore McCarrick of abuse. According to Cardinal Donald Wuerl, Archbishop of Washington, nobody from the Archdiocese of Newark informed him of these settlements, even though the retired McCarrick began living on the grounds of a seminary in the Archdiocese of Washington. In 2001 Fugee had signed a confession, which he later recanted, admitting to fondling a teenage boy and a jury convicted him in 2003 of criminal sexual contact, but that conviction was eventually overturned by an Appellate Court in 2006. In order to avoid a retrial Fugee then signed an agreement with the Bergen County Prosecutor's Office in 2007 agreeing to a lifetime ban prohibiting him from work that would put him in contact with children. The Archdiocese co-signed the agreement stating they would supervise Fugee and keep the agreement in force. In September 2009 Fugee was assigned as chaplain at Saint Michael’s Medical Center in Newark, but was removed a month later when his background was brought to the attention of hospital officials. Prior to that the Archdiocese had notified the head of the chaplain’s unit. By 2013 Fugee was working in youth ministry at St. Mary’s Parish in Colts Neck, a parish outside of the archdiocese. The archdiocese has stated that it was unaware of the activities and that it would not have permitted Fugee to engage in them. The Bergen County prosecutor is investigating possible criminal charges. There were calls for Archbishop Myers to resign, including from members of the New Jersey legislature, because of his handling of Rev. Fugee. =Honors= On December 10, 2010 Myers received the honour Knight Grand Cross of the Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus by Prince Victor Emmanuel in recognition of the Archbishop’s exemplary leadership as head of his large Catholic archdiocesan flock and as an important church and religious leader in America.HRH Prince Victor Emmanuel of Savoy Honors Archbishop John L.

The band was founded in September 1994, when Albyzzo and Ruzo (later known as Bullo) chose the name after a deep search inside an English dictionary. They sing in Venetian, that is very hard to understand for foreigners, and even for an Italian living outside Veneto. Moreover, their lyrics are off-the-wall, with a heavy use of colloquial terms: a common concept in their concerts is the one of rujo, that can be approximately translated as extreme rudeness and impoliteness and is often a term applied to people living in the country. The band was able to create a large following in Veneto and in other parts of northern Italy thanks to their highly energetic live shows. They have successfully given 300 concerts, alternating powerful metal songs with comic segments. On July 3, 2004 they even opened a concert for legendary thrash metal band Anthrax. Since then, they have headlined several important independent hard rock festival in Veneto, such as Monteciorock in Montecchio Maggiore,Programma Monteciorock 2006: Venerdì 16 Giugno - La Notte del Rujo Rockonte in Villa del ConteProgramma Rockonte 2005 and MarcOn Festival in Marcon.MarcOn Festival 2006 On October 17, 2007 singer Bullo announced that all the other members had left Catarrhal Noise.Catarrhal Noise official website - news section On 20 September 2015 Bullo put together the old formation of the band with Albyzzo, Pyzzo, Gifo and Pelle for the Mai Paura Day, a charity event in Dolo, and played as headliner.

After switching to Elite Model Management, Werbowy landed several prominent bookings in Canada but achieved little international success. Werbowy lived in England and Greece, where she did not find much work. Her first runway season was disrupted and her bookings canceled due to the terrorist attacks on 9/11 in New York City. Thus she went to Europe. After an exhausted eight months, Werbowy returned to Canada. She gave modelling a final shot as a means to fund her art school education, saying, \\"I returned to New York, met my agent and the next day I had an exclusive deal with Prada.

Playoffs are a standard occurrence in match play and professional stroke play tournaments to determine a winner in the event of a tie at the completion of normal play. There are two types of playoff that are used: aggregate playoff and sudden death. They are usually played directly after completion of the final round, with the exception of 18 hole aggregate playoffs which may be held the following day. In many amateur stroke play tournaments, and particularly in club competitions, competitors may not be readily available and other methods are used to determine the winner, such as scorecard count-back, whereby the player with the lowest cumulative score over the last 18, 9, 6, 3 or 1 hole(s) is declared the winner. Sudden death Sudden death is the most common playoff format in stroke play tournaments and even more so in match play tournaments. The tied participants play one extra hole at a time, with those still tied for the lowest score moving on to the next hole until a winner has been determined. All regular PGA Tour and European Tour tournaments use this system (except for The Players Championship starting in 2014), as does the Masters Tournament. The PGA Championship also used the sudden death format from 1977 to 1999. A player who wins in matchplay after n playoff holes is said to have won \\"at the (18+n)th hole\\" — or \\"(36+n)th hole\\" in the increasingly rare case of a 36-hole match. Many supporters, including veteran golfer Kenny Perry, support this type of play, feeling that it is best to let momentum decide the match. Tiger Woods, when interviewed immediately after his 2008 U.S. Open victory at Torrey Pines, stated that \\"as a player who's playing well, you want to go more holes. The better player usually wins in more holes. That's how I've always approached it. The more holes you give me, if I'm playing well, I want more holes. Not just one hole, or even three.\\" Others, such as professional golfer Chris DiMarco, claim that it is not fair to gruel through 72 holes and lose the tournament on one bad swing in sudden death. Aggregate playoff The aggregate playoff is the oldest playoff format in strokeplay tournaments, with the lowest cumulative score in a series of holes, most commonly three, four, or eighteen holes. This is widely considered to be the fairest way of deciding a winner, as one bad shot does not eliminate all chances of winning, and is used in the four men's major championships. One flaw of this system is shorter variants, used in two majors and The Players Championship, held immediately after the tournament, take longer to complete than sudden death, meaning that a tournament may risk not being over before sunset. In contrast, a full 18-hole playoff is held the next day. Should there still be a tie after the set number of holes, then sudden death is normally played. The four men's majors originally used an 18-hole (or 36-hole) format. The men's U.S. Open changed in 2018 to a two-hole aggregate playoff. The Open Championship used this format until 1985, when it was reduced to four holes. The three-hole format is used for the men's PGA Championship (originally 18 holes, changed to sudden death in 1977, and adopted the three hole in 2000), The Players Championship, and the other three USGA-sanctioned tournaments for professionals, the U.S. Women's Open, U.S. Senior Open (both were 18-hole playoffs before shortened to three in 2007, and two in 2018), and the U.S. Senior Women's Open. The Masters Tournament used the 18-hole format until 1976 (the first sudden-death playoff was in 1979). The first playoff in The Masters in 1935 was contested over 36 holes, when Gene Sarazen overcame Craig Wood. The Open Championship was the first major tournament to adopt the shortened aggregate playoff system when a 4-hole playoff was introduced in 1985. However it was not invoked until Mark Calcavecchia, Greg Norman and Wayne Grady tied at Royal Troon in 1989. Calcavecchia came out on top to win his only major title. Since 2000, the PGA Championship has made use of a 3-hole playoff, having previously used sudden death. Three-hole playoffs were expected to be used in the 2016 Summer Olympics if there were a tie in medal positions, but were not necessary.

The conjecture was first made by Ernst Kummer in 28 December 1849 and 24 April 1853 in letters to Leopold Kronecker, reprinted in , and independently rediscovered around 1920 by Philipp Furtwängler and , As of 2011, there is no particularly strong evidence either for or against the conjecture and it is unclear whether it is true or false, though it is likely that counterexamples are very rare. Background The class number h of the cyclotomic field \\\\mathbb{Q}(\\\\zeta_p) is a product of two integers h1 and h2, called the first and second factors of the class number, where h2 is the class number of the maximal real subfield K=\\\\mathbb{Q}(\\\\zeta_p)^+ of the p-th cyclotomic field. The first factor h1 is well understood and can be computed easily in terms of Bernoulli numbers, and is usually rather large. The second factor h2 is not well understood and is hard to compute explicitly, and in the cases when it has been computed it is usually small. Kummer showed that if a prime p does not divide the class number h, then Fermat's Last Theorem holds for exponent p. The Kummer–Vandiver conjecture states that p does not divide the second factor h2. Kummer showed that if p divides the second factor, then it also divides the first factor. In particular the Kummer–Vandiver conjecture holds for regular primes (those for which p does not divide the first factor). Evidence for and against the Kummer–Vandiver conjecture Kummer verified the Kummer–Vandiver conjecture for p less than 200, and Vandiver extended this to p less than 600. verified it for p < 12 million. extended this to primes less than 163 million. describes an informal probability argument, based on rather dubious assumptions about the equidistribution of class numbers mod p, suggesting that the number of primes less than x that are exceptions to the Kummer–Vandiver conjecture might grow like (1/2)log log x. This grows extremely slowly, and suggests that the computer calculations do not provide much evidence for Vandiver's conjecture: for example, the probability argument (combined with the calculations for small primes) suggests that one should only expect about 1 counterexample in the first 10100 primes, suggesting that it is unlikely any counterexample will be found by further brute force searches even if there are an infinite number of exceptions. gave conjectural calculations of the class numbers of real cyclotomic fields for primes up to 10000, which strongly suggest that the class numbers are not randomly distributed mod p. They tend to be quite small and are often just 1. For example, assuming the generalized Riemann hypothesis, the class number of the real cyclotomic field for the prime p is 1 for p<163, and divisible by 4 for p=163. This suggests that Washington's informal probability argument against the conjecture may be misleading. gave a refined version of Washington's heuristic argument, suggesting that the Kummer–Vandiver conjecture is probably true. Consequences of the Kummer–Vandiver conjecture showed that the conjecture is equivalent to a statement in the algebraic K-theory of the integers, namely that Kn(Z) = 0 whenever n is a multiple of 4. In fact from the Kummer–Vandiver conjecture and the norm residue isomorphism theorem follow a full conjectural calculation of the K-groups for all values of n; see Quillen–Lichtenbaum conjecture for details.

The party nominated 25 candidates in the 1953 provincial election, five of whom were elected. Some candidates have their own biography pages; information on other candidates may be found here. The 1953 Manitoba election was conducted by instant-runoff voting in most constituencies. Three constituencies (Winnipeg North, Winnipeg Centre and Winnipeg South) returned four members by the single transferable vote (STV), with a 20% quota for election. St. Boniface returned two members by STV, with a 33% quota. The CCF's 1953 platform contained fourteen points, foremost of which was a plan for a provincial hospital scheme similar to that undertaken by Tommy Douglas in neighbouring Saskatchewan. The party also supported state automobile insurance, a restructuring of the provincial municipalities, needs-based grants to municipalities for road repair, a provincial labour code, and lowering the voting age to eighteen. Party leader Lloyd Stinson later argued that the election was essentially about three things: hospitalization, education and electoral redistribution. The party's decision to field only 25 candidates unquestionably put them at a disadvantage. The Manitoba legislature had 57 seats, meaning that it was mathematically impossible for the CCF to win a majority government. Stinson later acknowledged that this situation hurt the party's image, and marginalized it with the electorate. Tom Kobzey planned to run for the CCF in Emerson. He was reportedly threatened with violence from a vigilante group, and was forced to leave the area. Alvin H. Mackling (Assiniboia) Alvin H. Mackling served in the Manitoba legislature from 1969 to 1973 and again from 1981 to 1988, and was a prominent cabinet minister in the governments of Edward Schreyer and Howard Pawley. In the 1953 election, he place second out of four candidates on the first count with 3,078 votes (35.62%), and lost to Liberal-Progressive candidate Reginald Wightman on the second count. See his biography page for more information. Frank Fulbrook (Dauphin) Fulbrook was an automotive service manager, and a shop foreman at his garage. during his nomination meeting, the Dauphin CCF affirmed its support for a provincial hospital scheme and state automobile insurance. Fulbrook placed last in a field of four candidates with 785 votes (15.15%). The winner was William Bullmore of the Social Credit Party.

He finished seventh on the first count with 1,117 votes (3.83%), and was eliminated after the fifth count with 1,234 votes (4.24%). Israels delivered the cleverest line of the campaign shortly before election day, when he said that Progressive Conservative leader Errick Willis had been \\"too recently in Mr. Campbell's arms to be now at his throat\\". This referred to the fact that Willis and Premier Douglas Campbell had been partners in the coalition government of the 1940s, implementing many of the policies which Willis now described as insufficient. After the election, Israels was named as labour's representative on the Winnipeg Wage Survey Board.

Overview A consummate social climber, manipulator, and schemer during the turbulent 1920s and 1930s, Tausend developed a process for extracting gold from base metals—a prospect of great interest to the then-fledgling Nazi party and a Germany staggering under runaway hyper inflation. The Nazis, through a number of Hitler's inner circle of friends introduced to Tausend, invested heavily in the project. Unfortunately, the process was found to be economically unfeasible and quite possibly a sham, much to the chagrin of the Nazis' and their supporters' pocketbooks. Tausend had raised approximately half a million dollars (roughly $5.6 million in 2005 dollars) to fund five laboratories, one research institute and one mining operation; but most of the money went instead to fund extravagant lifestyles for the four main business partners. Many investors, including pensioners in his home village, lost their entire savings, while Tausend collected castles and country homes. Tausend's three partners fled Germany: one each to South America, Spain and Russia. Tausend fled to a castle he had purchased and put in his wife's name in Appiano, South Tyrol in the Italian Alps. In January 1929, he was involved in an auto accident, recognized by Italian authorities, arrested and extradited back to Germany to take the full brunt of the Nazis' anger. Even after his arrest for conspiracy to commit fraud, Tausend (who had liquidated and invested his entire family's fortune into this venture) felt confident that his formula would be vindicated by the courts. In a highly sensationalized trial that forced Tausend to demonstrate his gold-extraction process first hand, the judge convicted the disgraced man and sentenced him to prison—not because the process itself was necessarily proved to be fraudulent, but because of misappropriation of venture capital invested in the project. Whatever property Tausend still owned outright was confiscated by the German state. Whether Tausend committed fraud intentionally, acted as the front man of other con artists, or was merely a naive man with big dreams remains unclear. However, upon his release from prison after serving out his 4-year sentence, Tausend quickly began promoting his next \\"get-rich-quick\\" scheme. He was arrested again in 1937 and sentenced to prison in 1938 for check and money fraud. Tausend died while still in prison custody on July 9, 1942 at Schwäbisch Hall.

The solar apex, or the apex of the Sun's way, refers to the direction that the Sun travels with respect to the local standard of rest. This is not to be confused with the Sun's apparent motion through all constellations of the zodiac, which is an illusion caused by the orbit of the Earth.  Direction The solar apex is in the constellation of Hercules, southwest of Vega, northeast of his \\"outstretched arm\\", Omicron Herculis. There are two mainstream sets of coordinates for the solar apex. *The visual coordinates (as obtained by visual observation of the apparent motion) are right ascension (RA) , declination (dec) 30° N **in galactic coordinates: 56.24° longitude, +22.54° latitude **in ecliptic coordinates: 271.79° longitude, +53.43° latitude. *The radioastronomical position is RA , dec + (galactic coordinates: 58.87° longitude, 17.72° latitude). Evaluation of movement of the solar system in its neighborhood is complex; a selection of links is on the Talk page of this article. For more than 30 years before 1986 the speed of the Sun towards the solar apex was taken to be about 20 km/s See also Table 3 on page 13 of but all later studies give a smaller component in the vector toward galactic longitude 90°, reducing overall speed to about 13.4 km/s.U, V, and W (vectors) are 10.0, 5.25 and 7.17 km/s respectively, This speed is not to be confused with the orbital speed of the Sun around the Galactic center, which is about 220 km/s and is included in the movement of the Local Standard of Rest. Thus the Sun moves towards the apex (a relatively local point) at about our spiral arm's orbital speed. The sun's motion in the Milky Way is not confined to the galactic plane; it also shifts (\\"bobs\\") up and down with respect to the plane over millions of years.Frisch, Priscilla (2000); \\"The Galactic Environment of the Sun\\", American Scientist, volume 88, number 1, page 52  History The nature and extent of the solar motion was first demonstrated by William Herschel in 1783, who also first determined the direction for the solar apex, as Lambda Herculis, 10° away from today's accepted position.  Solar antapex  The solar antapex, the direction opposite of the solar apex, is located near the star Zeta Canis Majoris.

A field dressing or battle dressing is a kind of bandage intended to be carried by soldiers for immediate use in case of (typically gunshot) wounds. It consists of a large pad of absorbent cloth, attached to the middle of a strip of thin fabric used to bind the pad in place. Field dressings are issued in sealed waterproof pouches to keep them clean and dry; the pouch can be torn open when required. In combat, each soldier carries one field dressing ready for immediate use. Standard doctrine is that a casualty's dressing should be used rather than the rescuer's - the rescuer may need to help another casualty, or be helped himself, whereas the original casualty is not going to make any other use of his own dressing. Because of this, it is important that soldiers know where to find their comrades' field dressings, and infantry units typically have their own SOP stating where they should be carried. British Army uniforms issued in the past included dedicated field dressing pockets. During the Great War, this pocket was in the front left skirt of the tunic, with the introduction of Battledress (1937), it was moved to the trousers, but the current clothing does not. Instead, a common location for field dressings is the left shoulder- strap of the webbing, either held in place with gaffer tape or contained in a small pouch that is not issued but can be purchased from several civilian suppliers. Some combat medical technicians make use of field dressing wrappers in the management of \\"sucking\\" chest wounds. In such wounds, the working of the chest sucks air through the wound into the space around the lung, rather than sucking air down the throat and into the lung. The hole must be sealed to enable the casualty to breathe properly. As a battlefield interim measure, the waterproof wrapper of a field dressing can be placed over the hole, with the clean inside against the wound, and taped in place. Tape is applied to the sides and top of the wrapper, leaving the bottom edge free. The wrapper then acts as a simple flapper valve, preventing air being sucked in but allowing any that has already entered to be forced out as the casualty exhales. US Army First-Aid Packet, Carlisle Dressing US Army First-Aid Packet, Carlisle Dressing AKA \\"First-aid Packet, U.S. Government Carlisle Model\\" was originally designed at, and took its name from the Carlisle Barracks Military Reservation, Pennsylvania in the early 1920s, where the “Medical Department Equipment Laboratory” was first established. First Aid Packets had been in use with the US Military since before the coming of the 1WW in the form of the FIRST AID PACKET – U.S. ARMY. Every soldier carried one in a web pouch on his equipment belt. It was one of the most common items of military use and supply. The dressing carried inside the pouch was intended as an immediate compress to stop bleeding from a wide variety of wounds and establish a sterile covering. It consisted of a white linen gauze pad with long gauze tails so it could be tied around an arm or even the chest. =Development= US-military first aid packet in sheet-metal packet, Era of 2nd World War. Large First-Aid Dressing, U.S. Army Carlisle Model Sterilized, packed in dark green packaging, rectangular model, New York. This dressing, already developed in 1904, and subsequently introduced in 1906, was supplied to the troops in a sealed brass casing, to protect the bandage inside against gas attacks, and to also ensure that it remained sterile. An improved version was introduced in 1940, designated First-Aid Packet, U.S. Government – Carlisle Model to tackle the problem of front line wounds and casualties. The Carlisle Bandage underwent a number of changes in its development during WW2. In summer of 1940, U.S. Army, Carlisle Model Small First-Aid Dressing made its appearance. It was contained in a waxed rectangular tuck-end carton, printed with the required markings. Considerable difficulty was encountered in the procurement of the first aid packet. During the Army expansion of 1940, approximately eight million were required for initial stock of equipment In the middle of 1941, the Medical Department decided to amend their specifications, and placed purchase orders for containers made out of tin (instead of brass). The new version was introduced by fall of 1941, together with the very first Sulfanilamide Shaker Envelopes. During the early part of 1943, a plastic container (called Tenite) was developed and put into production, but under field conditions the package warped and broke open. In the course of 1943 the items were wrapped in laminated paper, reinforced with aluminum or lead foil, and covered internally with either pliofilm, cellophane, or polyvinyl butyral and placed inside an appropriate waxed cardboard shell.

Front styling recalled the horizontal chrome 'mustache bars' of the original 4CV, with the addtion of distinctive apostrophe-shaped headlights. The targa-style roof used four removable roof panels that could store beneath the flat-folding rear window. The Fiftie was fully roadworthy, sharing most of the Renault Sport Spider's chassis, suspension, and mechanics as well as Renault's D7F 1.2-liter, 8-valve four-cylinder engine, which was subsequently introduced as a production engine in the Twingo.

Biography  Before 419 = Nothing is known for sure about Hermeric before 419, the year in which he is first mentioned; namely, he became king of the Suebi (or Suevi) in the city of Braga (Bracara Augusta) according to bishop Hydatius (who wrote his chronicle around the year 470). Although bishop Isidore of Seville, writing his Historia de regibus Gothorum, Vandalorum et Suevorum two centuries after the fact, claims that Hermeric was already king of the Suebi from 406,Thompson, 217. He was first mentioned by Hydatius in 419, it being Isidore who makes him king from 406. Isidore based himself on primarily on Jerome, Hydatius, Prosper of Aquitaine and Orosius, none of whom mentions Hermeric prior to 419. Hermeric was a pagan and an enemy of the Roman Empire throughout his life. He is given a reign of thirty-two years in most manuscripts of Isidore of Seville's Historia Suevorum, but one manuscript does list his reign as fourteen years.Thompson, 129 and 306n32. According to Thompson (1982)'s interpretation of Isidore, Hermeric led the Suevi across the Rhine along with the Vandals and Alans in December 406. They crossed Gaul and the Pyrenees and settled in Hispania. Kulikowski (2000 & 2015) argued that the Suebi probably stayed in northern Gaul throughout 407 to 409, and moved to Galicia between 409 and 411. While Theodore Mommsen believed the Suevi were foederati and Ernst Stein seconded the notion by believing they had made an agreement with the Roman usurper Magnus Maximus whereby they received the western half of Iberia, there is no primary evidence for any alliance between the Suevi and Rome.Thompson, 153-154. In 411 (according to Ludwig Schmidt) or 417 (according to Felix Dahn), Hermeric made a treaty with the Roman emperor Honorius, but in fact the only event of note in 411 was the division of Iberia sorte (by lot) between the barbarian peoples. The east of the province of Gallaecia with its capital of Braga (Bracara Augusta) fell to the Suevi, while the west of the province went to the populous Hasdingi. Between 416 and 418, the Visigoths under Wallia made war on Hermeric on behalf of Rome. = After 419 = In 419, after a personal dispute between Hermeric and the Vandal king Gunderic, the Vandals attacked the Suevi and trapped Hermeric in the Nervasian (Erbasian) Mountains before the Roman general Asterius intervened and the Vandals retreated.Thompson, 165. Thereafter, until the Vandals left Iberia for Africa in 429, Hermeric remained peaceful, but in 430 he began to raid Gallaecia. In 431 a Gallaecian named Hydatius went to Flavius Aëtius to plead for help against the Suevi, but Aëtius delayed until 432 the sending of the comes Censorius. According to Hydatius' Chronicle of contemporary events, the Gallaecian plebs in the better-fortified strongpoints defeated Hermeric and his men, inflicting heavy casualties and taking many prisoners, which forced the Sueves to release the Gallaecian families they had taken captive (430).Thompson, 178. In 435, \\"on episcopal intervention\\", possibly Hydatius', Hermeric made peace with the Gallaecians.Thompson, 179 and 301n94. In that same year, Hermeric negotiated through the Catholic bishop Symphosius directly with the Western Roman Emperor. In 437, Censorius made a second expedition accompanied by Fretimund. After seven years of illness, Hermeric was forced to retire from the kingship in 438 and pass it on to his son Rechila. The story, recorded in Isidore, that Hermeric sent Rechila to Baetica to defeat Andevotus, Romanae militiae dux, is false, as there is no contemporary evidence that Hermeric retained any authority after his abdication.Thompson, 120. There appears to have been no principle of elective monarchy among the Suevi and the successes of their raids may have accounted for the contentment of their people. Hermeric's royal line lasted until 456. In 429, there appeared briefly a Suevic military leader named Heremigarius operating in Lusitania who may have been a joint monarch with Hermeric, but there is no primary source to prove it.Thompson, 166.

Via the Monongahela and Ohio Rivers, it is part of the watershed of the Mississippi River, draining an area of 881 square miles (2,284 km²) on the unglaciated portion of the Allegheny Plateau. Geography Clarksburg, December 2006 The river is formed near the community of Rock Cave in southwestern Upshur County by the confluence of small headwaters tributaries known as Straight Fork and Whites Camp Fork. From this confluence the West Fork River flows north through Lewis, Harrison and Marion counties, through the communities of Weston, West Milford, Clarksburg, Lumberport, Shinnston, Enterprise, Worthington, and Monongah to Fairmont, where it joins the Tygart Valley River from the west to form the Monongahela River. (The Tygart is thus the \\"East Fork\\" of the Monongahela.) Among other tributaries, it collects Stonecoal Creek in Weston; Hackers Creek in southern Harrison County; Elk Creek in Clarksburg; and Simpson Creek and Tenmile Creek in northern Harrison County.DeLorme (1997). West Virginia Atlas & Gazetteer. Yarmouth, Maine: DeLorme. pp. 25, 36. . The West Fork has a low gradient and is slow-moving throughout its course. It is locally popular for fishing, and is stocked with muskellunge by the West Virginia Division of Natural Resources. Other fish species in the river include carp; channel and flathead catfish; golden and rainbow trout; largemouth, smallmouth, and spotted bass; sauger; and walleye. Jackson's Mill was established along the river north of Weston around the year 1800 by Edward Jackson; his grandson, Thomas \\"Stonewall\\" Jackson lived there during much of his youth. The site has been operated as a 4-H facility since the 1920s. A walking trail parallels the river for 1.2 miles (2 km) in Veteran's Park in Clarksburg. For much of its length between Clarksburg and Fairmont, the West Fork is paralleled by a pair of rail trails on the route of a mid-19th century line of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. The Harrison County Trail extends northward from Clarksburg, and the West Fork River Trail connects Shinnston to Fairmont. A long-term closure of the connection between the two trails is anticipated, due to the presence of hazardous waste at an industrial site near the community of Spelter in northern Harrison County. Dams and navigation The West Fork River in Weston, December 2006 The West Fork River is not navigable by commercial barge traffic; it is classified by the West Virginia Division of Natural Resources as \\"recreationally navigable\\" for canoes and similar craft. During the early history of the United States, the government of Virginia attempted to maintain commercial navigability on the river, chartering a company for that purpose in 1793 and requiring that dams for milling operations provide a chute for boats to pass downstream. Construction of a system of locks, dams, and chutes was begun by the Monongahela Navigation Company in 1817; the project was abandoned following damage by floods in 1824. south of Weston, the river is dammed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to form Stonewall Jackson Lake. The project was authorized by the federal Flood Control Act of 1966 for flood control, improvement of water quality and water supply, improvement of habitat for fish and wildlife, hydropower, and recreation. Construction of the dam was delayed by the opposition of local residents and began in the mid-1980s at an ultimate cost of $208 million; it became fully operational in 1988. The dam is 95 feet (29 m) tall and forms a lake, with a larger capacity during periods of flood. Land along the lake is leased as a wildlife management area and Stonewall Jackson Lake State Park. Between the years of 1905 and 1931, four small dams were constructed by the Clarksburg Water Board on a sixteen-mile (26 km) stretch of the river upstream (south) of Clarksburg, for the provision of local drinking water. While the dams in later years have come to be regarded as good fishing areas, the Water Board is working with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service on plans to remove them. Variant names Stonewall Jackson Lake and Dam on the West Fork River near Weston, August 1993 The United States Board on Geographic Names settled on \\"West Fork River\\" as the stream's name in 1902.

The Condon Committee was the informal name of the University of Colorado UFO Project, a group funded by the United States Air Force from 1966 to 1968 at the University of Colorado to study unidentified flying objects under the direction of physicist Edward Condon. The result of its work, formally titled Scientific Study of Unidentified Flying Objects, and known as the Condon Report, appeared in 1968. After examining hundreds of UFO files from the Air Force's Project Blue Book and from the civilian UFO groups National Investigations Committee On Aerial Phenomena (NICAP) and Aerial Phenomena Research Organization (APRO), and investigating sightings reported during the life of the Project, the Committee produced a Final Report that said the study of UFOs was unlikely to yield major scientific discoveries. The Report's conclusions received a mixed reception from scientists and academic journals. The report has been cited as a decisive factor in the generally low level of interest in UFO activity among academics since that time. According to a principal critic of the Report, it is \\"the most influential public document concerning the scientific status of this UFO problem. Hence, all current scientific work on the UFO problem must make reference to the Condon Report\\".  Background  Beginning in 1947 with Project Sign, which then became Project Grudge and finally Project Blue Book, the U.S. Air Force conducted formal studies of UFOs, a subject of considerable public and some governmental interest. Blue Book had come under increasing criticism in the 1960s. Growing numbers of critics—including U.S. politicians, newspaper writers, UFO researchers, scientists and some of the general public—were suggesting that Blue Book was conducting shoddy, unsupported research or perpetrating a cover up.Clark, Jerome, The UFO Book: Encyclopedia of the Extraterrestrial, Visible Ink, 1998, pp. 593-604, . The Air Force did not want to continue its studies but did not want a cessation of studies to provoke additional charges of a cover-up. UFOs had become such a controversial issue that no other government agency was willing to take on further UFO studies. Following a wave of UFO reports in 1965, astronomer and Blue Book consultant J. Allen Hynek wrote a letter to the Air Force Scientific Advisory Board (AFSAB) suggesting that a panel convene to re-examine Blue Book. The AFSAB agreed and the committee it formed, chaired by Brian O'Brien, convened for one day in February, 1966, and suggested UFO studies could be undertaken \\"in more detail and depth than had been possible to date\\" and that the U.S. Air Force should work \\"with a few selected universities to provide scientific teams\\" to study UFOs. The Committee suggested that about 100 well-documented UFO sightings should be studied annually, with about 10 man-days devoted to each case.Saunders and Harkins, 25 At a Congressional UFO hearing on April 5, 1966, Air Force Secretary Harold Brown defended the Air Force's UFO studies and repeated the O'Brien Committee's call for more studies. Hynek repeated his call for \\"a civilian panel of physical and social scientists\\" to \\"examine the UFO problem critically for the express purpose of determining whether a major problem exists.\\"Hynek, J. Allen,The UFO Experience: A Scientific Inquiry, Henry Regnery Company, 1972, 192-244 Shortly after the hearing, the Air Force announced it was seeking one or more universities to undertake a study of UFOs. The Air Force wanted to have several groups, but it took some time to find even a single school willing to accept the Air Force's offer. Both Hynek and James E. McDonald suggested their own campuses, Northwestern University and the University of Arizona, and others suggested astronomer Donald Menzel. All were judged too closely allied with one position or another.Dick, Biological, 292. Hynek had a long association with the Air Force, McDonald was pro-UFO and Menzel anti-UFO. Several universities declined to participate, including Harvard University, the University of California, Berkeley, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Walter Orr Roberts, director of the National Center for Atmospheric Research, and Menzel suggested physicist Edward Condon of the University of Colorado.Dick, Biological, 292 In the summer of 1966, Condon agreed to consider the Air Force's offer. He was among the best known and most distinguished scientists of his time. Condon's tenacious encounters with the House Unamerican Activities Committee and other government Loyalty Boards in the 1940s and 1950s made him \\"almost legendary\\" among fellow scientists.Saunders and Harkins, 33 On Condon's behalf, Robert J. Low, an assistant dean of the university's graduate program, explored faculty reaction to the proposed project and found it mixed and wary. He tried to reassure those who found the enterprise unworthy of scientific investigation. Low told the Denver Post that the project had met the University's acceptance threshold by the narrowest of margins and was accepted largely because it was difficult to say no to the Air Force. Some have suggested that finances were factor in Colorado's decision to accept the Air Force's offer of $313,000 for the project. Condon dismissed this suggestion, noting that $313,000 was a rather modest budget for an undertaking scheduled to last more than a year with a staff of over a dozen.Saunders and Harkins, 29. Total funding later rose above $500,000. Dick, Biological, 293 On October 6, 1966, the University of Colorado agreed to undertake the UFO study, with Condon as director, Low as coordinator, and Saunders and astronomer Franklin E. Roach as co-principal investigators. The Air Force announced its selection of Condon and the University of Colorado in October 1966. Other Committee members included astronomer William K. Hartmann; psychologists Michael Wertheimer, Dan Culbertson and James Wadsworth, a graduate student; chemist Roy Craig; electrical engineer Norman Levine and physicist Frederick Ayer. Several other scientists or experts served in part-time and temporary roles or as consultants.Appendix X: Authors and Editors, Staff of the Colorado Project, Final Report, 1433-8 Public response to the Committee's announcement was generally positiveJacobs, 225, \\"optimism on all sides\\". Hynek characterized Condon's perspective towards UFOs as \\"basically negative\\", but he also assumed the Condon's opinions would change once he familiarized himself with evidence in some of the more puzzling UFO cases. NICAP's Donald Keyhoe was publicly supportive, but privately expressed fears that the Air Force would be controlling things from behind the scenes. That a scientist of Condon's standing would involve himself with UFO research heartened some academics who had long expressed interest in the subject, such as atmospheric physicist James E. McDonald. When the Project was announced, The Nation, commented: \\"If Dr. Condon and his associates come up with anything less than the little green men from Mars, they will be crucified.\\"Craig, 250  Committee work  In November 1966, retired USMC Major Donald Keyhoe and Richard H. Hall, both of NICAP, briefed the panel. They agreed to share NICAP's research files and to improve the collection of UFO reports. The Committee also secured help from APRO, another civilian UFO research group. The Committee moved slowly, hampered by disagreements about the use of fundsSaunders and Harkins, 77 and methodology. By hiring people with no prior position on UFOs, the Committee staff lacked expertise and subject matter expertise.One Committee member suggested filming UFOs using stereo cameras mounted with diffraction gratings in order to study the spectrum of light emitted by UFOs. This had been attempted some fifteen years earlier following a specific suggestion regarding UFOs made by Joseph Kaplan in 1954, but was quickly judged impractical after a number of such cameras were distributed to Air Force bases. Hynek, pp. ?? As they began their analyses, Committee members usually worked without coordination with one another. Individuals embraced diverse approaches, especially with respect to the extraterrestrial hypothesis (ETH).Jacobs, 228-30 In late January 1967, Condon said in a lecture that he thought the government should not study UFOs because the subject was 'nonsense', adding, \\"but I'm not supposed to reach that conclusion for another year.\\" One NICAP member resigned from NICAP in protest and Saunders confronted Condon to express his concern that NICAP's withdrawal would eliminate a valuable source of case files and produce damaging publicity. = Low memo controversy = In July 1967, James E. McDonald, a confirmed believer in the validity of UFO sightings, learned from a Committee member about a memo Low had written on August 9, 1966, in which he reassured two University of Colorado administrators that they could expect the study to demonstrate that UFO observations had no basis in reality.\\"Our study would be conducted almost entirely by non-believers who, though they couldn't possibly prove a negative result, could and probably would add an impressive body of thick evidence that there is no reality to the observations. The trick would be, I think, to describe the project so that, to the public, it would appear a totally objective study but, to the scientific community, would present the image of a group of non-believers trying their best to be objective but having an almost zero expectation of finding a saucer.\\" Craig, 194-5 McDonald, after locating a copy of the memo in the project's open files, wrote to Condon, quoting a few lines from it. In response to the memo, on April 30, 1968, NICAP severed its ties with the Committee and Keyhoe circulated copies of Low's memo. Press coverage included an article in the May 1968 issue of Look, \\"Flying Saucer Fiasco\\", that presented interviews with Saunders and Levine, detailed the controversy, and described the project as a \\"$500,000 trick.\\"John G. Fuller, \\"Flying Saucer Fiasco,\\" Look, May 14, 1968, available online, accessed May 25, 2011. Fuller was a journalist identified with those who found UFO sightings credible, the author of a 1966 work on a sighting. Craig, 204-6. John G. Fuller, Incident at Exeter: The Story of Unidentified Flying Objects Over America Now (NY: Putnam, 1966). On Fullr and Look as interested parties, see Craig, 240. Condon responded that the article contained \\"falsehoods and misrepresentations.\\"Jacobs, 231 Scientific and technical journals reported the controversy.Industrial Research reprinted Low's memo, while Scientific Research interviewed Saunders and Levine, who reported that they were considering a libel suit against Condon for terminating them for alleged \\"incompetence.\\" They said that Condon had used an \\"unscientific approach\\" in directing the Committee. Jacobs, 231. Condon said that calling his methods \\"unscientific\\" was itself libelous, and in turn threatened to sue Saunders and Levine. When the American Association for the Advancement of Science covered the Committee controversy in an issue of its official journal Science, Condon first promised to grant an interview, but then declined. He resigned from the AAAS in protest when the article was published without his input. Jacobs, 233. Representative J. Edward Roush said the Look article raised \\"grave doubts as to the scientific profundity and objectivity of the project.\\"Jacobs, 233. He asked the General Accounting Office to investigate the study, which the GAO declined to do. Philip M. Boffey, \\"UFO Project: Trouble on the Ground,\\" in Science, New Series, vol. 161, no. 3839, July 26, 1968, 341 He held a hearing dominated by critics of the Project.Craig, 241-4. Roush later joined the board of NICAP. Low resigned from the Project in May 1968.Craig, 207 Some later critics of the Committee's work saw little reason to make much of the memo. Committee member David Saunders wrote that \\"to present Low as a plotter or conspirator is unfair and hardly accurate.\\"Saunders and Harkins, 128-9. Hynek wrote that Low \\"wanted his university to get the contract...and to convince the university administration that they should take it.\\" Hynek, pp.? Project investigator Roy Craig's later wrote that the memo did not trouble him because Condon had not known of the Low memo for eighteen months and it did not reflect his views.Craig, 200, 202, 227 Condon wrote in the Project's Final Report that the memo's description of the Project as emphasizing the \\"psychology and sociology\\" of those who report UFO sightings showed how completely Low misunderstood the Project when he wrote the memo.Craig, 226 = Final months = Despite the withdrawal of NICAP from the Project, members of its Early Warning Network continued to report sightings to the investigators, as did journalists.Craig, 202 Scientists who anticipated the Committee would recommend against continued government UFO research rushed their own refutation into print in advance of the Committee's Final Report. Called UFO's? Yes! and written by Saunders, it questioned whether the CIA wanted to divert public attention from UFOs. It used three cases to make the case for extraterrestrial activity. Project investigator Roy Craig later described each of the cases as \\"utter nonsense,\\" \\"highly suspect,\\" and unexplained but very weak.Craig, 228-33. David R. Saunders and R. Roger Harkins, UFO's? Yes! Where the Condon Committee Went Wrong, (World Publishing, 1968); New York Times: Walter Sullivan, \\"UFO Verdict: Believers Find It Unbelievable,\\" January12, 1969, accessed July 5, 2011  Committee Report  The Committee delivered its Report to the Air Force in November 1968, which released it in January 1969.Dick, Biological, 299 The Report, 1,485 pages in hardcover and 965 pages in paperback, divided UFO cases into five categories: old UFO reports from before the Committee convened, new reports, photographic cases, radar/visual cases, and UFOs reported by astronauts. Some UFO cases fell into multiple categories. Condon authored 6 pages of \\"conclusions and recommendations,\\" a 43-page \\"summary,\\" and a 50-page history of UFO phenomena and research over the preceding twenty years. In his introductory \\"Conclusions and Recommendations\\", Condon wrote: \\"Our general conclusion is that nothing has come from the study of UFOs in the past 21 years that has added to scientific knowledge. Careful consideration of the record as it is available to us leads us to conclude that further extensive study of UFOs probably cannot be justified in the expectation that science will be advanced thereby.\\"Final Report, 2 He also recommended against the creation of a government program to investigate UFO reports.Craig, 224 He also described the problem that confronts the scientific community, that each scientist must evaluate the record for himself, and that the Report's recommendation against further research \\"may not be true for all time.\\"Final Report, 5; Dick, Biological, 300 He advised that government agencies and private foundations \\"ought to be willing to consider UFO research proposals...on an open-minded, unprejudiced basis....[E]ach individual case ought to be carefully considered on its own merits.\\"Final Report, 4; Craig, 224 In particular, the Report noted that there were gaps in scientific knowledge in the fields of \\"atmospheric optics, including radio wave propagation, and of atmospheric electricity\\" that might benefit from further research in the UFO field.Final Report, 5 The Report detailed 59 case studies, though for legal reasons their locations were changed. New York Times science editor Walter Sullivan, in his introduction to the published version of the Report, said the series \\"reads like a modern, real-life collection of Sherlock Holmes episodes. The cases range from the eerily perplexing to the preposterously naive. The reader is given a taste of scientific method, even though the cases are often such that they defy anything approaching deductive analysis.\\"Craig, 217 Six chapters covered field studies of such physical evidence as electromagnetic affects, and visual and radar images. One treated the observations of U.S. astronauts.Craig, 218-24 Notably in Case 02 in Section IV, Chapter 2 the report said of the 1956 Lakenheath-Bentwaters incident: \\"In conclusion, although conventional or natural explanations certainly cannot be ruled out, the probability of such seems low in this case and the probability that at least one genuine UFO was involved appears to be fairly high.\\" \\"Case 2: USAF/RAF Radar Sighting\\" by Staff, 1968, Final Report of the Scientific Study of Unidentified Flying Objects Even before its completion, the Air Force had asked the National Academy of Sciences to \\"provide an independent assessment of the scope, the methodology, and the findings\\" of the Committee. A panel chaired by Yale astronomer Gerald M. Clemence studied the Report for six weeks and concluded that \\"on the basis of present knowledge the least likely explanation of UFOs is the hypothesis of extraterrestrial visitations by intelligent beings\\" and that \\"no high priority in UFO investigations is warranted by data of the past two decades.\\"Dick, Biological, 302; Review of the University of Colorado Report on Unidentified Flying Objects by a Panel of the National Academy of Sciences, 1969; Craig, 236-8 In response to the Report's findings, the Air Force closed Project Blue Book, established in March 1952, on December 17, 1969.Dick, Biological, 274, 278, 307; Craig, 235-6  Assessments  The Report earned a mixed reception from scientists and academic journals, while receiving \\"almost universal praise from the news media\\". Many newspapers, magazines and journals which published approving reviews or editorials related to the Condon Report. Some compared any continued belief in UFOs with the belief that the earth is flat. Others predicted that interest in UFOs would wane and in a few generations be only dimly remembered. Science, the official publication of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, said \\"The Colorado Study is unquestionably the most thorough and sophisticated investigation of the nebulous UFO phenomenon ever conducted.\\"Craig, 238 The March 8, 1969 issue of Nature offered a generally positive review for the Condon Report, but wondered why so much effort had been expended on such a subject: \\"The Colorado project is a monumental achievement, but one of perhaps misapplied ingenuity. It would doubtless be inapt to compare it with earlier centuries' attempts to calculate how many angels could balance on the point of a pin; it is more like taking a sledgehammer to crack a nut, except that the nuts will be quite immune to its impact.\\"\\"A Sledgehammer for Nuts\\", Nature, Volume 221, March 8, 1969, 899-900 On January 8, 1969, the New York Times headlined its coverage: \\"U.F.O. Finding: No Visits From Afar.\\" The article said that based on the Report, the ETH could finally be dismissed and all UFO reports had prosaic explanations. It noted that the Report had its critics, but characterized them as \\"U.F.O. enthusiasts.\\"New York Times: Walter Sullivan, \\"U.F.O. Finding: No Visits From Afar,\\" January 8, 1969, accessed May 25, 2011Clark says that the author of the Times assessment, Walter Sullivan, had a conflict of interest. He was the author of the introduction to the Report's paperback edition. Critics made their case repeatedly without obtaining the government support they sought.Craig, 249-50 One described the Report as \\"a rather unorganized compilation of independent articles on disparate subjects, a minority of which dealt with UFOs.\\"Jacobs, 240 Hynek described the Report as \\"a voluminous, rambling, poorly organized\\" and wrote that \\"less than half...was addressed to the investigation of UFO reports.\\" In the April 14, 1969 issue of Scientific Research, Robert L. M. Baker, Jr. wrote that the Condon Committee's Report \\"seems to justify scientific investigation along many general and specialized frontiers.\\"The UFO Report: Condon Study Falls Short, Robert L. M. Baker, Jr., Scientific Research, April 14, 1969, p. 41. In the December 1969 issue of Physics Today, Committee consultant Gerald Rothberg wrote that he had thoroughly investigated about 100 UFO cases, three or four of which left him puzzled. He thought that this \\"residue of unexplained reports [indicated a] legitimate scientific controversy.\\" Critics charged that Condon's case summaries were inaccurate or misleading with enigmatic reports \\"buried\\" among the confirmed cases.Jacobs, 241 In December 1969, physicist James E. McDonald called the Report \\"inadequate\\" and said \\"it represents an examination of only a tiny fraction of the most puzzling UFO reports of the past two decades, and that its level of scientific argumentation is wholly unsatisfactory.\\"James E. McDonald, \\"Science in Default - Twenty-Two Years of Inadequate UFO Investigations\\" December 27, 1969 , accessed May 25, 2011 In a 1969 issue of the American Journal of Physics, Thornton Page reviewed the Condon Report and wrote: \\"Intelligent laymen can (and do) point out the logical flaw in Condon's conclusion based on a statistically small (and selected) sample, Even in this sample a consistent pattern can be recognized; it is ignored by the 'authorities,' who then compound their 'felony' by recommending that no further observational data be collected.\\"Thornton Page, review, American Journal of Physics, Vol. 37, No. 10, October 1969, 1071-1072, accessed May 25, 2011. Page had been a member of the Robertson Panel which suggested UFOs should be debunked to reduce public interest. In November 1970, the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics generally agreed with Condon's suggestion that little of value had been uncovered by scientific UFO studies, but \\"did not find a basis in the report for [Condon's] prediction that nothing of scientific value will come of further studies.\\"UFO Evidence:UFO - An Appraisal of the Problem, 1968 Statement of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA) Subcommittee on UFOs = Principal critics = Astronomer J. Allen Hynek wrote that \\"The Condon Report settled nothing.\\" He called Condon's introduction \\"singularly slanted\\" and wrote that it \\"avoided mentioning that there was embedded within the bowels of the report a remaining mystery; that the committee had been unable to furnish adequate explanations for more than a quarter of the cases examined.\\" Hynek contended that \\"Condon did not understand the nature and scope of the problem\\" he was studying and objected to the idea that only extraterrestrial life could explain UFO activity. By focusing on this hypothesis, he wrote, the Report \\"did not try to establish whether UFOs really constituted a problem for the scientist, whether physical or social.\\" Astrophysicist Peter A. Sturrock wrote that \\"critical reviews...came from scientists who had actually carried out research in the UFO area, while the laudatory reviews came from scientists who had not carried out such research.\\"Sturrock, 46 As an example, Sturrock noted a case in which an allegedly supersonic UFO did not produce a sonic boom. He notes that \\"we should not assume that a more advanced civilization could not find some way at traveling with supersonic speeds without producing a sonic boom.\\"Sturrock, 40  See also  * Project Magnet, Canada, 1950–54  References  Sources  * Final Report of the Scientific Study of Unidentified Flying Objects, Edward U.

Available at or NQ) is an area of Manchester city centre, England, between Piccadilly station, Victoria station and Ancoats, centred on Oldham Street, just off Piccadilly Gardens. It was defined and named in the 1990s as part of the regeneration and gentrification of Manchester. A centre of alternative and bohemian culture, the area includes Newton Street (borders with Piccadilly Basin), Great Ancoats Street (borders with Ancoats), Back Piccadilly (borders with Piccadilly Gardens) and Swan Street/High Street (borders with Shudehill/Arndale). Popular streets include Oldham Street, Tib Street, Newton Street, Lever Street, Dale Street, Hilton Street and Thomas Street. HistoryEarly history= Although the town of Manchester existed from medieval times (and had previously been the site of a Roman settlement), the area now designated as the Northern Quarter was not fully developed until the late 18th century. The area now between Shudehill and Victoria Station was first built upon in the 14th century, as the village of Manchester expanded as a local centre for the wool trade. The expansion of the area was gradual up to the mid-18th century, when Manchester markedly increased in size and significance with the onset of the Industrial Revolution. =During the Industrial Revolution= In the early 18th century, Oldham Street was apparently \\"an ill-kept muddy lane, held in place on one of its sides by wild hedgerows\\".Middleton (1920), p. 15 The first town directory of Manchester, published in 1772, lists a number of buildings on Tib Street and Oldham Street. By the time of a map by William Green in 1794, the whole of the Northern Quarter is shown as a developed urban district.Available at http://www.spinningtheweb.org.uk It might be supposed that Oldham Street is so named because it links to Oldham Road but this is not the case as Oldham Street predates Oldham Road which was named Newton Lane in the 18th century. Oldham Street is probably so named because one of its first buildings was the house of Adam Oldham, a wealthy feltmaker and associate of John Wesley, who owned the land along which the street ran, and probably paid to have it surfaced for the first time. John Wesley opened two Methodist chapels in the Northern Quarter. In 1751, a chapel was opened on Church Street (east of High Street at Birchin Lane, formerly Methodist Street). This was upgraded to a larger chapel on Adam Oldham's land in 1781, on the site that is now Methodist Central Hall. John Wesley performed the opening of the first chapel which stood until 1883.Bradshaw, L. D. (1985) Origins of Street Names in the City Centre of Manchester. Radcliffe: Neil Richardson; pp. 13-14 Manchester's first cotton mill was opened by Richard Arkwright in 1783, on Miller Street, near the junction with Shudehill. By 1816, there were 86 mills in the central area of Manchester, and by 1853 there were 108. By the 1840s, the Northern Quarter was at the centre of one of the most significant economic changes in history, with the Industrial Revolution at full pace and Manchester taking its place as the world capital of the textile industry. In common with the town as a whole, the area became characterised by both wealth and poverty. The area around Withy Grove and Shudehill is described by Friedrich Engels in The Condition of the Working Class in England as insanitary and down at heel, but markedly more ordered than the area around St Ann's Square, which is also described. Nevertheless, the houses are \\"dirty, old and tumble-down, and the construction of the side-streets utterly horrible\\".Engels (1845), p. 87 Engels also talks of \\"pigs walking about in the alleys, rooting in offal heaps\\".Engels (1845), p. 91 The area around Oldham Street seems to have been more affluent, with warehouses and shops, many of whose merchants lived within their shop premises. This is described by Isabella Varley, Mrs. Linnaeus Banks, a resident of Oldham Street, in her book The Manchester Man. One Oldham Street shopowner mentioned by a number of writers is Abel Heywood, who spearheaded the mass distribution of books, supplying the whole country not only with penny novels, but also with educational books and political pamphlets, according to an article in the Morning Chronicle in 1849. Heywood also produced a newspaper, on which he refused to pay duty — a radical gesture, since in those early days of the British Labour Movement, taxes were used to stifle free expression. Heywood went on to become Mayor of Manchester. =The Victorian era= Enterprise continued to be the focus of the area through the Victorian age. James Middleton notes that at this time \\"business was conducted on the old-fashioned lines by people who had been in the street for a long time\\".Middleton (1920), p 11 Middleton also describes Tib Street as \\"a perfectly adorable street, where natural history was taught by living examples...birds, dogs, rabbits, poultry displayed in the windows or outside the shops\\", a tradition which continued for at least a hundred years, having only recently died out with the closing of the last surviving pet shops. Modern writer Dave Haslam notes something of the birth of the modern Saturday night in the Northern Quarter at this time with \\"crowds of shoppers and sightseers...most shops were open and the main streets were lit up and packed...there was the added incentive that at midnight the food became cheaper...on a single day in 1870 it was estimated that up to 20,000 people went to Shudehill\\".Haslam (2000), p 33 Throughout the Victorian era, Stevenson Square and parts of Oldham Street were known for frequent political speeches and public debates. Haslam notes that a debate in the 1830s between one Dr Grinrod, a Temperance movement activist, and Mr Youil, a brewer, attracted around three thousand spectators.Haslam (2000), p 35 =Early 20th century= A mural on a wall outside Afflecks, in the heart of the Northern Quarter. The adjacent sign reads \\"...AND ON THE SIXTH DAY GOD CREATED MANCHESTER\\" The development of Smithfield Market and the continued growth of the cotton industry helped to foster economic activity in the Northern Quarter into the 20th century. Middleton describes an area buzzing with hawkers and processions. Youth culture was the next development in the area that might be recognised today. A street dancing culture emerged in the early part of the 20th century, with \\"dozens of young people performing polkas, waltzes and schottisches to music provided by Italian organ-grinders\\". The cotton trade reached its peak in 1912, when 8 billion square yards (6,700 km2) of fabric were manufactured and sold from Manchester. Following the First World War, the high cost of British cotton, and the increase in production elsewhere in the world, led to a slow decline of the British cotton industry. In the 1960s and 1970s, mills were closing in Manchester and the rest of Lancashire at a rate of almost one a week, and by the 1980s only specialised textile production remained, although clothing manufacture and the wholesale trade continue to form a strong part of Manchester's economy. =Later 20th century= Following the Second World War, attention focused away from the Northern Quarter as Manchester began to build itself a modern city centre in the ruins left by German bombers. As a commercial area, Oldham Street became quieter, particularly as nearby Market Street and the Arndale Centre grew in importance. In the 1970s and 1980s the Smithfield Gardens housing estate was constructed to the east of Tib Street and the south of Foundry Lane. The estate consists of two-storey maisonettes in three-storey blocks - the middle storey is divided and provides the upper floor for the lower maisonette and the lower floor for the upper maisonette. This was the first modern residential development in the Northern Quarter.https://www.flickr.com/photos/manchesterarchiveplus/5400384769/ Between the Second World War and the 1990s, the Northern Quarter was not considered to be a residential area, but since then, some of the old industrial and warehouse buildings in the area were converted into flats, as part of a wider trend for living in city centres. Although no official figures are kept (the Northern Quarter is not recognised for administrative purposes), it might be estimated that a little over 500 people now live in the area, which is split between the city centre and Ancoats and Clayton wards. Over time, certain types of business were attracted to the area, which offered low rents and an alternative feel to the typical British high street. This became the main strength of the Northern Quarter — today it is known for hip, independent stores, cafes and bars, and for offering a distinct alternative to the shopping experiences to be found elsewhere in Manchester city centre. For Dave Haslam, the Northern Quarter became the last refuge of the Manchester music scene in the 1990s: \\"A community, of sorts, had developed around music- makers wedded to experimentalism, from Andy Votel to Waiwan, nurtured at club nights such as Graham Massey's Toolshed and Mark Rae's Counter Culture ... In 1992, Frank Schofield and Martin Price (of 808 State) had lamented the fate of the independent record shop, yet within five years there were several new record shops in the Northern Quarter\\".Haslam (2000), pp. 257, 260 Present The \\"Northern Quarter\\" as such did not exist as a distinct area until the mid-1990s when a number of interested parties got together and defined a boundary, came up with the name and branded the area as such. This has proved extremely successful. The Northern Quarter is popular today for its numerous bars and cafes, as well as its mix of music and clothes shops. Amongst these is Affleck's Palace, a former department store which has been turned into a multi-storey bazaar for alternative clothing and knick-knacks. Meanwhile, the area is something of a mecca for DJs, with shops such as Piccadilly Records, Vinyl Exchange, Vox Pop Records, Beatin' Rhythm, Vinyl Resting Place, Eastern Bloc Records (formerly owned by Martin Price of 808 State, then by Pete Waterman) and, until 2009, Fat City Records (formerly run by Mark Rae). Nightlife in the Northern Quarter includes music venues. The area is also famous for its bar scene. The area is also known as a home to the creative industries, and in particular fashion design, with various designers, agencies, and clothing wholesalers populating its back streets. There are also a number of commercial art galleries in the area and street art is on prominent display. In Stevenson Square, the street level remains of a former public convenience are used by the OuthouseMCR organisation for regularly changing examples of street and graffiti art. OuthouseMCR also manages the urban art which decorates an electrical sub-station on Tib Street. On one wall of the sub-station, protected by Perspex, is said to be a painting by the artist Banksy. The Northern Quarter also hosted the Big Horn sculpture, which was removed in 2017 to make way for the new SyNQ residential development, but is hoped to be erected again on nearby Afflecks Palace once work is completed. Additionally, due to the area's architecture, the Northern Quarter is regularly used as a film and TV location. The area is often used as a double for New York and has appeared as Manhattan in the 2004 film Alfie, and the 2019 production Morbius. While the area around Dale Street has been used as 1940s New York for the 2011 Hollywood superhero film Captain America: The First Avenger ,the 2019 Sky TV production of Das Boot. and also for the Netflix TV Show, Peaky Blinders, a British period crime drama. Additionally, various parts of Manchester, many in the Northern Quarter, were used in filming Guy Ritchie's 2009 film Sherlock Holmes. Manchester City Council have recognised the unique nature of the Northern Quarter. A 2003 planning documentMCC Northern Quarter Development Framework stated: > The Northern Quarter (N4) is strategically placed between the main > Manchester retail and commercial core, Piccadilly Gateway, Ancoats and > Shudehill. It represents a key piece in the city centre jigsaw, an area > different in character and function to any other part of the city centre and > of great strategic importance to Manchester as a city of distinctive > quarters. In November 2010 the area was awarded the Great Neighbourhood of the Year Award 2011 for Britain and Ireland at the Academy of Urbanism Awards in London. =Piccadilly Basin= Piccadilly Basin entranceway (to a car park). Piccadilly Basin, on the Rochdale Canal, is a redeveloped area between Manchester Piccadilly station and Great Ancoats Street. The area includes flats and offices as well as bars. =Shudehill redevelopment= Another area of redevelopment in the Northern Quarter is a mixed office and residential development centred on the old market on Shudehill near to the new Shudehill bus and tram interchange.

She is best known for her time on the independent circuit, where she performed for numerous promotions such as Chikara, Ring of Honor and Shimmer Women Athletes, where she was a one-time Tag Team Champion. Professional wrestling careerDebut and Gateway Championship Wrestling (2002)= Haze was trained by Kid Kash and Delirious. Haze honors her mentors, especially Delirious, in the ring by imitating some of their mannerisms, particularly Delirious' incoherent speech and performing some of their trademark wrestling moves. In March 2002 she made her professional debut for Gateway Championship Wrestling based out of Missouri using a hippie stoner gimmick. The gimmick is a tribute to her father, who was a hippie, and died when she was fifteen, and the ring name is the product of her sister's imagination, after she wanted to change her name legally to Daisy Hayes after Savage Garden singer Darren Hayes. Around the same time MsChif began working for the same promotion and the two began to work together inside the ring. Haze also began working for IWA Mid-South as the valet of Matt Sydal, and then went on to compete in the women's division. =Independent Wrestling Association Mid-South (2003–2008)= Haze made her IWA Mid-South debut in 2003, as the manager of Matt Sydal, but was soon wrestling in the newly created women's division. Her first match was against Mickie Knuckles at the Revenge Served Cold event on October 23. In May 2004 the NWA Midwest Women's Championship was introduced, and a tournament was set up at the Volcano Girls show to determine the inaugural champion. Haze defeated Sumie Sakai in the first round and Rain in the second, but lost in a three-way final, when Lacey beat her and Mercedes Martinez. The NWA Midwest Women's Championship and IWA Mid-South Women's Championship were merged early in 2005, and Haze won the Championship from Ariel in a six-pack challenge at the Givin Em Da Bizness event on February 12, 2005. After three months, however, Haze dropped the championship to MsChif on May 7. Haze continued making sporadic appearances in IWA Mid-South, at one point donning Delirious style attire and dubbing herself Shelirious in a match against Mickie Knuckles on July 9, 2005. On May 2, 2008, Haze captured the Championship for a second time after defeating the defending champion Knuckles and Sara Del Rey in a three-way match. Haze competed in the Volcano Girls 2 tournament but was eliminated in the semi-finals by Knuckles. The winner of the tournament, Rachel Summerlyn, earned a title shot against Haze at King of the Deathmatches. Summerlyn did not get her championship match, however, and at the end of 2008 the championship was deactivated. =Ring of Honor (2004–2011)= Around the same time as her debut in IWA Mid-South, Haze and Sydal debuted in Ring of Honor (ROH) in early 2004. At the time women's wrestling was not common practice for the promotion, but Haze engaged in an in-ring program with Allison Danger, who was spending time away from The Prophecy. Soon after Haze became a member of Generation Next when Sydal joined the faction. In November 2005 at ROH's Vendetta show she managed Generation Next and A.J. Styles (who replaced Roderick Strong) in an eight-man war against The Embassy. Haze was joined by Jade Chung who had broken free of the mental abuse at the hands of The Embassy since becoming the kayfabe girlfriend of Strong. During the eight-man war Prince Nana, of The Embassy, dragged Haze into the ring by her hair. Austin Aries and Sydal made the save only to have Haze turn on them as she low-blowed both men and proceeded to deliver a Mind Trip to Jade Chung before siding with Prince Nana. She remained with the stable until it was disbanded in September 2006, after which she turned into a fan favorite and aligned herself with B.J. Whitmer and Colt Cabana in their war with Lacey, Jimmy Jacobs and Brent Albright. Haze in the ring in 2008 Outside of the promotion Haze had an ongoing rivalry with Lacey which was carried over into Ring of Honor. At the Dedicated show in January 2007, Haze teamed with Whitmer and Cabana in six- person tag match against Lacey, Jacobs and Albright. Jacobs, Lacey and Albright won the match after Jacobs put Haze through a table. The feud continued on over the course of Ring of Honor's Fifth Year Festival. In a re- match from the Dedicated show, except with Adam Pearce replacing Albright, Haze and her team won a street fight. Six days later, however, Haze was beaten in a singles match by Lacey, after Jacobs interfered. In the summer of 2007 Haze began feuding with Sara Del Rey who was the reigning Shimmer Champion. The two fought on many occasions, typically with the Championship not on the line. Haze's first Championship match came in 2008 at the Ring of Honor's 6th Anniversary Show, where Del Rey retained the championship. The feud with Del Rey expanded to include Sweet and Sour, Inc, the faction of which Del Rey was a member, and as a result, Delirious came to aid Haze. Haze's rivalry with Lacey, who had become part of The Age of the Fall, reignited. Delirious began revealing romantic intentions towards Haze, but she rejected him, prompting Rhett Titus to claim that he had slept with Haze, who denied it. After seeing footage of Haze and Tius together, however, Delirious joined The Age of the Fall, although he left shortly afterwards when Jacobs attempted to spike Haze, but Delirious turned on his stablemates and saved Haze. In 2009, ROH signed a television deal with HDNet for a weekly episodic wrestling show Ring of Honor Wrestling, beginning on March 21, 2009. Haze wrestled on the second show, which aired on March 28, where she lost to Del Rey after a Royal Butterfly. On the fourth show, which aired on April 11, she teamed up with Nevaeh to defeat Del Rey and Sassy Stephie. On the 8th episode of ROH on HDNet, which aired on May 9, Daizee Haze teamed with Delirious to take on the Shimmer Champion MsChif and her tag team partner Jimmy Jacobs in a match where Haze pinned the Shimmer Champion with a Mind Trip. As part of the 11th episode, which aired on May 30, she took part in a 3-way match against the former SHIMMER Champion Sara Del Rey and the current Shimmer Champion MsChif. This match was eventually won by MsChif who pinned Haze with the Desecrator. She came back in the 17th episode, which aired on July 11, in which she teamed once again with Nevaeh losing to the team of MsChif and Sara Del Rey. Since 2009, she is one of the two head trainers of the ROH Wrestling Academy, the other head trainer being Delirious. She has not made an appearance for ROH since April 2, 2011. =Chikara (2005–2011)= Haze (left) and Sara Del Rey in October 2010 Haze began wrestling for the Philadelphia–based Chikara in 2005. In November 2009 she was placed in her first major storyline in the company, when she aligned herself with Claudio Castagnoli, Ares, Pinkie Sanchez, Sara Del Rey, Tim Donst and Tursas to form the heel stable Bruderschaft des Kreuzes (BDK). The stable has since been joined by Lince Dorado and Delirious. While in BDK Haze began regularly teaming with Del Rey and together the two of them picked up victories over tag teams such as The Osirian Portal (Amasis and Ophidian), Los Ice Creams (El Hijo del Ice Cream and Ice Cream, Jr.), The Throwbacks (Dasher Hatfield and Sugar Dunkerton), Amazing Kong and Raisha Saeed, and Mike Quackenbush and Jigsaw. On September 18, 2010, Haze wrestled Japanese joshi legend Manami Toyota in her first match on American soil, in a losing effort. On October 23 Haze represented BDK in the torneo cibernetico match, where they faced a team composed of Chikara originals. She was eliminated from the match by Eddie Kingston. The following day Haze and Del Rey defeated the Super Smash Bros. (Player Uno and Player Dos) in a tag team match to pick up their third straight victory and, as the first all–female tag team, earn the right to challenge for the Chikara Campeonatos de Parejas (tag team championship), at the time held by their stablemates Ares and Claudio Castagnoli. However, Haze and Del Rey never got to cash in their points as Ares and Castagnoli ordered them to defend them in a four–way elimination match on November 21, where they ended up being eliminated by Mike Quackenbush and Jigsaw and losing all of their points. On July 31, 2011, Castagnoli turned first on Del Rey, after losing to her in a singles match, and then Haze, as she was standing up for her regular tag team partner. The following week, Del Rey quit BDK, while Chikara announced that Haze would be taking a leave of absence from the promotion after suffering a storyline injury at the hands of Castagnoli. =Shimmer Women Athletes (2005–2011)= Haze with her signature plastic daisy Daizee also wrestles regularly in ROH's sister promotion, Shimmer Women Athletes, an all female wrestling promotion based out of Chicago. Haze was in the main event of their first four shows, which are released on DVD as \\"volumes\\". At the Volume 1 taping on November 5, 2005, Haze defeated Lacey with the Mind Trip in a twenty-five-minute match. On Volume 2, Del Rey pinned Haze with the Royal Butterfly to win a four-way elimination main event which also involved Lacey and Mercedes Martinez. Haze lost to Del Rey again on Volume 3, and on Volume 4 Haze defeated Rebecca Knox. Haze's first real feud in Shimmer was against Knox, who was angry after her loss on Volume 4, leading to a two out of three falls match being booked for Volume 5, which Haze ended up losing, two falls to one. On Volume 6, however, Haze gained a victory over Nikita. Haze and Knox were set to end their feud in a 60-minute Ironwoman match on Volume 7 on October 22, 2006, but the idea was scrapped after Knox suffered an injury while wrestling in Europe. Instead Haze faced Cheerleader Melissa in the main event where Melissa came out victorious. On Volume 8 Haze regained some momentum when she defeated Tiana Ringer, and on Volume 9 she continued her winning streak by pinning Amber O'Neal, although she lost to Awesome Kong at the Volume 10 tapings. A two-day tournament, taped June 1 and 2, 2007, was held to crown the first Shimmer Champion over the course of Volumes 11 and 12. Haze made it to semi-finals, defeating Portia Perez and Malia Hosaka en route, but lost to Lacey. Volume 13 was also taped which allowed Haze to have her first match against Sarah Stock, which Haze ultimately lost. On Volume 14, Haze and MsChif had their first match against each other for Shimmer (though the two had wrestled in a \\"bonus Shimmer attraction match\\" before in AAW) which Haze was able to win. Haze wrestled Stock in a number one contender's match on Volume 15, but lost after she was pinned with a Victory roll. On the last Volume of 2007, Volume 16, taped on October 15, Haze joined forces with MsChif and Eden Black to face The International Home Wrecking Crew, consisting of Jetta, Lacey and Rain. Haze pinned Jetta to pick up the win for her team. Haze defeated Cindy Rogers on Volume 17 and Jetta on Volume 18 respectively, both taped on April 26, 2008. Due to a back injury, Haze did not compete on Volumes 19 or 20, although she was interviewed by Rebecca Bayless on Volume 19. On September 8, 2008, Haze was named as the trainer of Shimmer wrestling school's first training course which started on October 27, 2008. Haze made her return to in-ring action at the October 19, 2008 tapings of Volume 21 where she was defeated by the Shimmer champion MsChif in a title match. On Volume 22, taped that same night, she defeated Miss Natural. On May 2, 2009, at the tapings of Volume 23 she fought Nicole Matthews to a 20-minute time limit draw, the second ever after the one between Mercedes Martinez and Sara Del Rey as part of Volume 1. On Volume 24, taped that same night, Haze defeated Matthews in a \\"no time limit\\" rematch with the Mind Trip. The following night on Volume 25 Haze teamed with Allison Danger to defeat Matthews and Portia Perez in a tag team match and on Volume 26 she defeated her student and the first graduate of the Shimmer Wrestling School Rayna Von Tash in a singles match. On November 8, 2009, at the tapings of Volumes 27 and 28 Haze, due to an injury, assumed the role of a referee for matches between Cat Power and Ariel, Amazing Kong and LuFisto and Nicole Matthews and Allison Danger. Haze (left) and Tomoka Nakagawa after winning the Shimmer Tag Team Championship Haze returned to a wrestling role on April 10 at the tapings of Volumes 29 and 30. On Volume 29 she was defeated by Misaki Ohata and afterwards turned heel and attacked her. On Volume 30 Haze and Tomoka Nakagawa defeated Ohata and Jamilia Craft, another one of Haze's students from the Shimmer Wrestling School, in a tag team match. The following day at the tapings of Volumes 31 and 32, Haze lost to Ayako Hamada and defeated Ayumi Kurihara via countout in singles matches. On September 11, 2010, at the tapings of Volume 33 Haze was defeated by Kurihara in a rematch. Later that day in a match taped for Volume 34, Haze suffered an upset loss against Tenille. The following day Haze re–formed her team with Tomoka Nakagawa, when the two of them defeated Pretty Bitchin' (Nikki Roxx and Ariel) in a match taped for Volume 35. On Volume 36 Haze took part in an eight-woman elimination tag team match, where she, Nakagawa, Sara Del Rey and Madison Eagles were defeated by Ayako Hamada, Ayumi Kurihara, Cheerleader Melissa and Serena Deeb. On March 26, 2011, Haze was defeated by Serena Deeb on Volume 37 and defeated Courtney Rush as part of the tapings of Volume 38, before reaffirming her partnership with Tomoka Nakagawa by pointing out that they were undefeated in tag team matches. The following day, at the tapings of Volume 40, Haze and Nakagawa defeated the Seven Star Sisters (Hiroyo Matsumoto and Misaki Ohata) to win the Shimmer Tag Team Championship. Haze and Nakagawa lost the title to Ayako Hamada and Ayumi Kurihara on October 1 at Volume 41. After the loss, Haze announced that she was quitting the promotion. On October 11, 2015, Haze made a one-night return to wrestling during Shimmer's tenth anniversary weekend, when she took part in Portia Perez's retirement match, where she, Kellie Skater, Lexie Fyfe and Madison Eagles defeated Perez, Kimber Lee, Lacey and Nicole Matthews. =Other promotions (2003–2011)= Haze at an ROH event in 2006 When Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) appeared on weekly pay-per-view Haze was booked to make several appearances. Her first came on February 22, 2003, for syndicated television show Xplosion where she wrestled MsChif. Haze continued making appearances as the valet and occasional tag team partner of Matt Sydal. On the July 2, 2003 episode of Xplosion, Haze and Sydal were defeated in a mixed tag team match by Julio Dinero and Alexis Laree, and on the February 4, 2004, episode Haze was defeated by Trinity in a singles match. She also lost a match to Nurse Veronica, which saw Veronica humiliate Haze by diapering her after securing the victory. Haze participated in two ChickFight tournaments. Her first came in September 2006 at ChickFight VI in 2006 in which Haze faced the defending champion Cheerleader Melissa in the first round. The two wrestled to a thirty-five-minute draw, which mean that they both advanced to the second round, where they had a three-way match, also involving Allison Danger. Haze won the match, and then defeated KAORU in the finals to win the ChickFight VI tournament. The following year, Haze was in the tournament again, and defeated Skye in the first round, before losing to Eden Black in the semi-finals. On the May 1, 2008, episode of TNA Impact! Haze made her return to TNA, using the alternate spelling of \\"Daisy Haze\\", in a losing effort to Cheerleader Melissa. Haze was also interviewed by Jeremy Borash on the May 1, 2008 edition of TNA Today. In early 2009 Haze, under the ring name Marley Sebastian, took part in the tapings of the new all women wrestling show Wrestlicious, which premiered on MavTV and BiteTV on March 1, 2010. Her ring name was shortened to just Marley upon her debut on the fourth episode on March 24, in which she was defeated by Sierra Sheraton. On June 21, 2009, Haze defeated Portia Perez, Jessica James and Sara Del Rey to win Anarchy Championship Wrestling's first annual American Joshi Queen of Queens tournament. Haze appeared on Dragon Gate USA's first pay-per-view Enter the Dragon, which was taped on July 25, 2009, and aired on September 4, accompanying BxB Hulk to the ring. =Retirement= Following her loss of the Shimmer Tag Team Championship on October 1, 2011, Haze retired from professional wrestling. On November 29, 2012, Haze made a one-night return as she accompanied MsChif for her match against Sean Vincent at a Dynamo Pro Wrestling event. Personal life Haze studied Exercise Science at university. She also designs and sews wrestling apparel.

The John P. Grace Memorial Bridge, or the Cooper River Bridge as it was familiarly known, was a cantilever bridge that crossed the Cooper River in Charleston, South Carolina. It opened on August 8, 1929 and was built by the Cooper River Bridge Company. Shortridge Hardesty of Waddell & Hardesty, New York City designed the bridge.Hardesty & Hanover timeline, 1887–1938 . Retrieved April 26, 2007 The Silas N. Pearman Bridge was opened beside it in 1966 to relieve traffic. They were both replaced by the Arthur Ravenel Jr. Bridge in 2005. History A group of businessmen, led by Harry F. Barkerding and Charles R. Allen, announced their plans to get a charter from the state to construct a steel bridge across the Cooper River in June 1926. The group formed the Cooper River Bridge, Inc. on June 7, 1926, with Ashmead F. Pringle as the first president. On June 8, 1926, the state issued a charter to the new company to \\"buy, rent, lease, build or otherwise acquire bridges across streams both intrastate and interstate, together with rights of way and right to construct and own and operate the same, and to charge tolls for passage across and enter upon such bridges, etc.\\" The ribbon was cut on August 8, 1929, at 1:12 p.m. by Col. James Armstrong, and between 30,000 and 50,000 people crossed the bridge during its first day. The bridge was owned by Cooper River Bridge, Inc., a private company. President of the company was John P. Grace, former mayor of Charleston. The bridge was built by a consortium of four engineering and construction firms. Construction lasted seventeen months, and the final cost of the bridge was six million dollars, to be financed by a 50-cent toll. The bridge had two lanes. In 1946 the state bought the bridge from Cooper River Bridge, Inc. and the 50-cent toll was removed. Unfortunately the same year a freighter rammed the bridge ripping down a section of it. Widening occurred in 1959 for a breakdown lane. Construction on the parallel Silas N. Pearman Bridge – intended to alleviate load limits on the Grace bridge – was completed in 1966. In 1979, a 3rd lane was added to the Grace bridge at the Charleston approach. By 1979, the bridge became functionally obsolete and there were many plans to replace the bridge, but not enough money. Replacement The John P. Grace Memorial Bridge (left) and the new Arthur Ravenel Jr. Bridge (right) in May 2005. The Silas N. Pearman Bridge can be seen on the Arthur Ravenel Jr. Bridge's side. In 1995 the Grace bridge scored only a 4 out of 100 (4%), or an F, in safety. Arthur Ravenel Jr. ran for SC Senate as a way to solve the problem. He planned for an eight-lane bridge to replace the Grace/Pearman spans of US 17. Construction started in 2001 and the new bridge opened in July 2005, at which point the Grace Bridge closed to traffic. Demolition After a \\"Burn The Bridges\\" run and a parade of 1929-era cars over the empty deck, demolition of the Grace Bridge began in August 2005. There had been a movement to try to sell the bridge or to place it on the National Register of Historic Places so that, after removal, it could be reassembled elsewhere, but most of the steel and concrete was either recycled or dropped into the ocean to start artificial fishing reefs. The demolition of the Grace Bridge took approximately 2 years and required closing the shipping lane for half a day as the main span was cut from the cantilever sections and lowered onto a barge below. The shipping lane was closed from 8 am until 4 pm for the lowering of the Grace section. The contractor had 2 1/2 years to remove the 2 bridges and roads. Frank Starmer and Sparky Witte documented the progress over that time in a book titled \\"End of an Era\\".

Life and career Her first radio single was \\"Tits and Whiskey\\" from the album Blue Skies Over Dundalk (produced by Steve Wright of Wright Way Studios in Baltimore), a 1:40 song which she called \\"my attempt at writing the most obnoxious song ever\\", and which contained the word \\"fuck\\" thirteen times. This did not stop local radio station WHFS from playing the song daily for several weeks. WHFS also arranged for her to play a free roadside show on the Baltimore–Washington Parkway that was quickly shut down by the police due to the traffic back-ups that it createdGaudiano, Nicole (June 1, 1998). \\"Radio stunt backs up B-W Parkway Traffic\\". The Capital (Annapolis, MD.), p. A12 and landed her a spot opening for They Might Be Giants at a sold-out show in Washington, DC, the singer having been banned from playing clubs in her hometown of Annapolis due to controversial lyrics. Following the release of Roulette Girl (produced by Rennie Grant and recorded by Steve Wright), she left Fowl Records to create Palace Coup Records (PCR). Roulette Girl was re-released by PCR, while Blue Skies Over Dundalk was combined with the Mata Hari EP and a bonus track to create the album Blue Skies Forever in 2001. That same year she recorded the \\"Love Has a Rumble\\" single with Baltimore rock-reggae band Colouring Lesson. The single was released to international and domestic radio stations. In 2002 she recorded Tell Your Friends with producer Mitch Easter (R.E.M., Pavement) at The Fidelitorium in Kernersville, North Carolina. The album was mixed by Shelly Yakus (Tom Petty, U2) and made the CMJ charts due to extensive nationwide college radio play. Prankster recruited North Carolina musicians Andy Mabe (Neko Case, Clare Fader) and Terry Klawth (Jodie Foster's Army, Mighty Sphincter) for the Tell Your Friends tour which culminated in a recorded performance at Washington, DC's 9:30 Club that became the 2004 release Lemonade: LIVE. In 2004 the entire Mary Prankster catalog, including singles, became available on iTunes and other digital music sites. In 2005, she retired the name Mary Prankster, moved to New York and did voice-over work for TV commercials. She went back to school and moved to New England. In 2016, she reconnected with Baltimore producer Steve Wright, and they agreed to work on a new album, Thickly Settled, released in November 2019. In 2017 she made her live return by playing two live shows for Pranksgiving weekend. Comedy Dynamics acquired and will release Mary Prankster's musical comedy special, Mary Prankster: LIVE at the Ottobar, recorded in November 2017 in Baltimore. The Washington Area Music Association (WAMA) has nominated her for nine Wammies, two of which she won – Best Alternative Female Vocalist in 1999 and Best Alternative Rock Female Vocalist in 2000. Blue Skies Forever also won second place in the Just Plain Folks 2006 Music Awards Punk Album category. Her music has been promoted by Dr. Demento, and she has also enjoyed heavy rotation on the Red Peters show on Sirius Satellite Radio. Her logo is based on that of National Bohemian, a Maryland beer. The cover of Blue Skies Over Dundalk is based on can designs of \\"Natty Boh\\", and Roulette Girl contains a track named \\"Rational Bohemian\\". The cover of Roulette Girl features a plate- spinning performer from the People's Circus of China, the cover of Tell Your Friends is a vintage image of a telephone operator licensed from the Seattle Historical Society, and the cover of Lemonade: LIVE is an homage to Country Time lemonade.

Forced molting, sometimes known as induced molting, is the practice by some poultry industries of artificially provoking a flock to molt simultaneously, typically by withdrawing food for 7–14 days and sometimes also withdrawing water for an extended period. Forced molting is usually implemented when egg-production is naturally decreasing toward the end of the first egg-laying phase. During the forced molt, the birds cease producing eggs for at least two weeks, which allows the bird's reproductive tracts to regress and rejuvenate. After the molt, the hen's egg production rate usually peaks slightly lower than the previous peak, but egg quality is improved. The purpose of forced molting is therefore to increase egg production, egg quality, and profitability of flocks in their second or subsequent laying phases, by not allowing the hen's body the necessary time to rejuvenate during the natural cycle of feather replenishment. The practice is controversial. While it is widespread in the US, it is prohibited in the EU. Background Commercial hens usually begin laying eggs at 16–20 weeks of age, although production gradually declines soon after from approximately 25 weeks of age. This means that in many countries, by approximately 72 weeks of age, flocks are considered economically unviable and are slaughtered after approximately 12 months of egg production, although chickens will naturally live for 6 or more years. However, in some countries, rather than being slaughtered, the hens are force molted to re-invigorate egg- laying for a second, and sometimes subsequent, laying phase. Forced molting simulates the natural process where chickens grow a new set of feathers in the Autumn, a process generally accompanied by a sharp reduction or cessation of egg production. Natural molting is stimulated by shortening day lengths combined with stress (of any kind). Before confinement housing with artificial lights was the norm, the Autumn molt caused a seasonal scarcity of eggs and high market prices. Farmers attempted to pamper their flocks to prevent the molt as long as possible, to take advantage of the high prices. Modern controlled-environment confinement housing has the opposite problem; the hens are not normally presented with sufficient stress or cues to go into molt naturally. However, after laying almost daily for nearly a year, their rate of egg production declines, as does the quality of the eggshell and the egg contents. In addition, the hens are overweight. It is sometimes claimed that forced molting is an artifact of modern intensive farming, but the practice predates the vertical integration of the poultry industry by decades; former Head of the Poultry Science Department at the University of Maryland, Morley A. Jull prescribes a precise molting program in his 1938 book, Poultry Husbandry. Methods For a complete recovery of the reproductive tract, the hen's body weight must drop by 30 to 35 percent during the forced molt. This is typically achieved by withdrawing the hen's feed for 7–14 days, sometimes up to 28 days. This induces the birds to lose their feathers, cease to lay eggs and lose body-weight. Some programs combine feed withdrawal with a period of water withdrawal. Most programs also restrict the amount of lighting to provide a daylight period that is too short to stimulate egg production, providing a simulated autumn, the natural time of molt and minimum egg production. Forced molting programs sometimes follow other variations. Some do not eliminate feed altogether, but may induce a molt by providing a low- density diet (e.g. grape pomace, cotton seed meal, alfalfa meal) or dietary manipulation to create an imbalance of a particular nutrient(s). The most important among these include manipulation of minerals including sodium, calcium, iodine and zinc, with full or partially reduced dietary intakes. These alternative methods of forced molting have not been widely used by the egg industries. In 2003, more than 75% of all flocks in the US were molted. Mortality Some birds die during forced molting and it has been recommended that the flock must be managed so that mortality does not exceed 1.25% over the 1–2 weeks of (nearly complete) feed withdrawal, compared to a 0.5% to 1.0% monthly mortality in a well-managed flock under low-stress conditions. Alternative methods of forced molting which do not use total food withdrawal, e.g. creating a dietary mineral imbalance, generally result in lower mortality rates.  Controversy  Temporary starvation of the hens is considered by many to be inhumane as well as a form of animal cruelty, and is the main objection of critics and opponents of the practice. While forced molting is widespread in the US, it is prohibited in the EU. In the UK, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) states In no circumstances may birds be induced to moult by withholding feed and water. Forced molting is not a common practice in Canada, where the animal welfare issues associated with it have rendered it basically obsolete. Forced molting increases plasma corticosterone which, along with related hormones, decreases the levels of circulating lymphocytes and other leukocytes, thereby reducing the effectiveness of the bird's immune system. This means that birds being force molted become susceptible to disease, particularly Salmonella infections, and may produce contaminated eggs thereby compromising public health.

Participants represent five major nations of World War II. Expertise at negotiations and diplomacy is important to success at the game. Five \\"What If?\\" scenarios are included: Historical Game, Aggressive French Policy Game, Aggressive French-British Policy Game, British-U.S. Alliance Game, and Anti- Bolshevik Crusade Game. The game simulates the strengths and weaknesses of each of the nation-states, and permits both alliances and betrayals. In addition to being play-tested by veteran wargamers, Origins of World War II was tested with secondary-school students who lacked familiarity with gaming, at the Benjamin Franklin High School, in East Harlem, New York City (now the Manhattan Center for Science and Mathematics), by Albert Nofi, then a teacher at the school. A set of guidelines to help teachers use the game in the classroom was published in Moves magazine. As a result, the game can be considered an educational tool as well as a diversion. The game reimplemented much of the gameplay system of Origins of World War I, designed by Dunnigan and included in the 1969 book A Gamut of Games.

They include St. Simons Island, Sea Island, Jekyll Island, Little St. Simons Island, and Historic Brunswick. Mild winters, together with natural beaches, vast stretches of marshland, maritime forests, historical sites, and abundant wildlife on both land and sea have made the Golden Isles a travel destination for families, nature-lovers, fishing and water sports enthusiasts, golfers, and history buffs. All the islands are located within Glynn County and make up the lower middle section of Georgia's eleven barrier islands. Annual mild temperatures average 68 °F, with July highs of 90 °F. St. Simons is the largest of the four, with a permanent population of 12,743 residents as of the 2010 census. Curled around its north end and accessible only by boat is Little St. Simons Island—privately owned and maintained in its natural state with a small capacity guest lodge and cottages. Jekyll Island is owned by the state of Georgia and operated as a state park, with limited residential areas. Sea Island is owned by Sea Island Acquisitions, LLC, and is home to the world- famous Cloister resort and residential homes valued in the millions of dollars. The City of Brunswick traces its history back to early Colonial times, and the founding of the Georgia colony by General James Oglethorpe. From its earliest days, the port of Brunswick was important to the growth and economy of the new nation. In 1789, George Washington named Brunswick one of the five original ports of entry for the thirteen colonies. During World War II, Brunswick hosted an important construction site for Liberty ships, and Naval Air Station Glynco, a major operational base for blimps. Tourism is the most important economic driver in the Golden Isles, with an estimated 2.4 million visitors in 2014.Golden Isles Convention and Visitors Bureau Other key components of the local economy include the Port of Brunswick, Federal Law Enforcement Training Center, aviation support services, and manufacturing. Travelers to the area arrive primarily via Brunswick Golden Isles Airport and Interstate 95. McKinnon St. Simons Island Airport serves general aviation.  Communities  St. Simons Island = St. Simons Island is the largest of the Golden Isles, with a permanent population of 12,743 as of the 2010 census. Reachable via the F. J. Torras Causeway, the Island is a tourist destination for its beaches, water sports, boating and fishing, golf, nature trails, historical landmarks, shopping, restaurants and nightlife. The St. Simons Lighthouse, located on the south end of the Island, has been in operation since 1872 (an earlier lighthouse, completed in 1810, was destroyed during the Civil War). Today, the Lighthouse and Museum are open to the public on a daily basis. Adjacent to the Lighthouse is Neptune Park which has a public pool and playground. The nearby Pier is a draw for anglers, tourists, and sightseers. The Pier Village on Mallery Street is lined with boutiques and a variety of restaurants. Not far from the village, beaches include Massengale Park and the Coast Guard Station Beach, which also features the Maritime Center Museum. Near the Coast Guard beach is the Bloody Marsh battle site where in 1742, a small garrison of British troops defeated a much larger Spanish force and in the process, put an end to Spain's influence north of Florida. Farther to the north are the ruins of Fort Frederica, established by Gen. James Oglethorpe in 1736 as protection for the Georgia colony, and Cannon's Point, a 600-acre nature preserve that includes maritime forest, marshland, hiking trails and plantation ruins. Housing on St. Simons Island consists primarily of single- family homes and condominiums, many of which are rented during peak visitation periods. Due to the mild climate, outdoor activities are common year-round, including hiking, bicycling, canoe and kayaking, paddle-boarding, offshore and inshore fishing and beachcombing. Golf is among the Island's most popular attractions, highlighted by the PGA's RSM Classic (formerlyMcGladrey Classic) in November. = Sea Island = Sea Island is a privately owned resort and residential community, located to the east of St. Simons Island and reachable by causeway. The upscale resort operates properties on Sea Island: The Cloister, Beach Club, Cottages; and on St. Simons Island: The Lodge, and The Inn at Sea Island. With the exception of special events, access is restricted to guests of any Sea Island property, island home owners and their guests, and Sea Island Club members. The resort also includes three championship golf courses, one of which, the Seaside course on St. Simons Island, hosts the annual PGA tour event, The RSM Classic (formerly The McGladrey Classic). In June, 2004, the 30th G8 Summit was hosted by President George W. Bush on Sea Island. = Little St. Simons Island = Little St. Simons Island lies to the north and east of St. Simons Island and is accessible only by boat. Privately owned, it is the only island in the group virtually untouched by development. Its include maritime forests, marshland, and seven miles of unspoiled, natural beach. The Lodge on Little St. Simons, a rustic retreat originally built as a hunting lodge offers the only available accommodations, with a limit of 32 guests per night. A staff of naturalists conduct guided tours along the beach and inland. Available activities include birding, kayaking, bicycling, hiking, fishing and nature photography. Guests depart on a private boat from the Hampton River Marina on St. Simons Island. The Lodge is one of only two properties in the U.S. to be awarded a Benchmarked Certificate by Green Globe 21, a global certification organization dedicated to sustainable tourism. Little St. Simons Island has been declared an \\"Important Bird Area\\" by the Audubon Society. = Jekyll Island = Jekyll Island is wholly owned by the state of Georgia and managed by the Jekyll Island Authority. Located south of St. Simons Island, it is reachable via the Downing Musgrove Causeway (GA 520) off US 17 in Glynn County. Purchase of a parking pass is required to drive onto the island (as of June, 2015, fees are $6.00 daily, $28.00 weekly, or $45.00 annually). The island includes 10 miles of beach, four golf courses, a Nature Center, boat tours, the Jekyll Island Convention Center, and a variety of lodging options. The Jekyll Island Museum operates tours of the Historic Landmark District which includes homes built during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries by wealthy Northern businessmen, including J. P. Morgan, William Vanderbilt, Joseph Pulitzer, and Marshall Field. The Georgia Sea Turtle Center on Jekyll is a rehabilitation hospital, research center and education facility devoted to conservation and protection of sea turtles. Open to the public year-round, the Center offers exhibits, viewing of turtle patients, and a variety of educational programs and field trips. The Jekyll Island Club opened in 1888, and quickly became one of the most exclusive private social clubs in the United States. Among its members was AT&T; president Theodore Vail, who participated from there in the first transcontinental telephone call on January 25, 1915. After the Panic of 1907, Senator Nelson Aldrich convened secret meetings of prominent bankers at the Club, under the guise of a duck hunting trip, to formulate plans for a central banking structure, which ultimately became the basis for the Federal Reserve System. By statute, commercial development on Jekyll Island is tightly restricted. Homeowners on the Island rent their land from the state on long- term leases. = Historic Brunswick = Brunswick's first English settler was Capt. Mark Carr, who established a plantation on the site in 1738, while serving under Gen. James Oglethorpe. Four years later, Capt. Carr would participate in the Battle of Bloody Marsh on St. Simons Island. In 1771, Carr's property was acquired by the Royal Province of Georgia, and the city was laid out in the \\"Oglethorpe grid\\" pattern, similar to Savannah. Listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the Brunswick Old Town Historic District contains several landmarks and 19th century homes. Mary Ross Park on the East River hosts a variety of events including concerts, weddings, a farmer's market, and the annual Brunswick Stewbilee. Passenger cruise ships dock at the park and nearby, local shrimp boats await their next trip to the area's prolific offshore shrimping grounds. Festivities at the park and the town's \\"overall historic vibe\\" were cited by Travel + Leisure readers who, in June, 2014 voted Brunswick one of America's Best Small Towns for July 4. Located on the east side of the Brunswick peninsula, are the \\"Marshes of Glynn\\", immortalized by Georgia poet, Sidney Lanier. Just down US 17 is the Sidney Lanier Bridge, site of an annual 5K run that draws participants from throughout the Southeast. = Glynn County = Map showing Glynn County Glynn County, Georgia, where the Golden Isles are located is one of the state's original eight counties, established in 1777 from 423 square miles of land formerly held by Creek Indians. The county seat is Brunswick, the only incorporated entity in the county. Glynn County is named for John Glynn, a member of the British Parliament and a friend of the colonies who once held the position of Sergeant of London. Notable features include the Sidney Lanier Bridge which spans the entrance to the Port of Brunswick, and is one of the gateways to the Golden Isles. It is currently the longest spanning bridge in Georgia. The Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC) is headquartered in Glynn County, and provides training for several federal law enforcement agencies. The Brunswick Golden Isles Airport serves residents and tourists alike, and is home to a growing aviation services industry. The 2010 Census reported Glynn County's population at 79,626.  History  Today's Golden Isles were first settled about 4,500 years ago by tribes of the Creek nation. When the Spaniards arrived in the early 1500s, they encountered the Guale and Mocame tribes of the Timucuan people. Relations between the Native Americans and the European newcomers alternated between friendly and hostile, as their allegiance was sought by competing Old World powers. By the late 1600s most of present-day Georgia became known as the \\"Debatable Land,\\" while the French, Spanish and English all fought to establish dominance. During this time, a Scottish nobleman, Sir Robert Montgomery, who envisioned a utopian colony between the Savannah and Altamaha rivers, published \\"A Description of the Golden Islands\\" in London (1720). The colony was never established, but the name persists to this day. By the 1730s, the Native American population had declined, and Great Britain had prevailed to the extent of founding the colony of Georgia under the leadership of Gen. James Oglethorpe, who established the city of Savannah. (Some three decades later, the town of Brunswick would be laid out in a similar grid pattern, consisting of streets and squares.) In 1736, Oglethorpe built Fort Frederica on the western shore of St. Simons Island to defend the Georgia colony from the Spaniards to the south. Title to the \\"Debatable Land\\" was finally established in 1742, after the Battle of Bloody Marsh on St. Simons Island. By way of strategic brilliance and trickery, Gen. Oglethorpe and his badly outnumbered force defeated the Spaniards, who then retreated to St. Augustine, never to return. When the General's force was disbanded in 1749, Fort Frederica fell into disuse, and was destroyed by fire in 1758. Today the fort's remains, along with the Bloody Marsh site, is a national monument operated by the National Park Service. Military action on the south Georgia coast during the American Revolution was very limited compared to events in the north. In April, 1778 there was a brief naval skirmish off St. Simons Island in which the Americans prevailed. However the British capture of Savannah later that year effectively ended further hostilities. As agriculture took hold after the Revolution, the Golden Isles region become known for rice and cotton. On St. Simons Island, a fine, long- fiber variety, known as Sea Island cotton became the preferred option in England, and came to be grown throughout the Georgia low country. Several plantations thrived on St. Simons, among them were Hamilton, Retreat, Hampton, and Cannon's Point. The only surviving ruins are at Cannon's Point and the tabby slave cabins at Hamilton. Both are open to the public. One former slave cabin from Retreat Plantation has been restored, and today houses a local gift shop. Even before the Civil War, Island plantations had begun their decline due to a dramatic slackening of English demand, lack of crop rotation for soil management, and absentee ownership. Postwar, the area languished until the advent of the lumber mills in the latter third of the 19th century. During this period, a new lighthouse was constructed to replace the 1810 lighthouse that was destroyed during the Civil War. The current Lovely Lane Chapel was built, and Christ Church was rebuilt. One of the Island mills supplied timbers for New York's Brooklyn Bridge. With the turn of the 20th century and the arrival of the automobile, a new industry began to arise—vacation travel. In 1924, the F. J. Torras Causeway opened St. Simons Island to everyone. Sea Island, Little St. Simons, and Jekyll Island all remained in private hands, with the latter becoming the site of winter homes for wealthy Northern industrialists and bankers. During World War II, blimps from Glynco Naval Air Station in Brunswick patrolled the Atlantic, protecting convoys and looking for German U-Boats that frequented the area. The Brunswick harbor served as one of the nation's most important production centers for Liberty Ships.  Geography and climate  The City of Brunswick and its four barrier islands are located on the south Georgia coast, about midway between Savannah and Jacksonville. The islands lie between the Altamaha River delta to the north and the Satilla River to the south. This location is the center point of the Georgia Bight, the inward curve of the east coast that stretches from Cape Fear, North Carolina to Cape Canaveral, Florida. The resulting funnel effect on incoming tides in this region creates a more extreme tidal swing than elsewhere on the U.S. coast, ranging from six to ten feet. According to the Köppen Climate Classification System, the Golden Isles climate is humid subtropical, with hot summers and mild winters. The average low temperature in January is 42.6 °F. The average high in July is 90.4 °F. Rainfall is greatest in August and September. Accumulation of snow/ice is extremely rare. In 1968 when famed Chicago TV weatherman P. J. Hoff was about to retire, he conducted an extensive analysis, based on his personal preferences, to find the best climate in the U.S. Based on several factors, he chose the Golden Isles, and moved to St. Simons Island, where he lived until his death in 1981.  Wildlife and vegetation  One of the primary attractions that brings visitors to the Golden Isles is its vast and diverse array of wildlife and marine vegetation. The area's most distinctive characteristic, its extensive marshes and estuaries, provide an abundance of food plus breeding grounds for a multitude of land, sea, and air creatures. Most of the area between the islands and the mainland consists of marshland, dominated by smooth cordgrass (Spartina), which is the key provider of life-sustaining nutrients for the wildlife. Every fall, the marsh grass turns a rich amber, giving evidence for the name, Golden Isles. The results of this rich source of nutrients are visible everywhere. Commonly seen along the beaches and the adjacent maritime forests are several species of shorebirds, including egrets, herons, white ibis, gulls, terns, plovers, sandpipers, pelicans, and ospreys. Local birds of prey include vultures, hawks, and the southern bald eagle. Five of the eighteen sites along Georgia's Colonial Coast Birding Trail are located within the Golden Isles/Glynn County. Among the sights along the beaches, inshore waterways and piers are horseshoe crabs, ghost crabs slipping in and out of their holes in the sand, dolphin, manatees (in summer), jumping mullet, jellyfish, sand dollars, stingrays, and conch shells inhabited by hermit crabs. Sand dunes along the rear of the beach protect the inland vegetation and serve as an essential buffer during storm tides. The picturesque sea oats along the dunes, with their complex root systems help keep the sand in place; and Georgia law prohibits picking them. Beach morning glories and their vines serve a similar purpose. During certain times of year, dead cordgrass (known as wrack) washes up on the beach and gathers at the high tide line. Insects and microorganisms in the wrack offer nutrients and the wrack itself traps sand to help nourish the dunes. Behind the dunes sits a variety of vegetation, culminating in the maritime forests that provide the tree canopy so characteristic to Georgia's barrier islands. Live oaks, southern pines, cabbage palms, magnolias, and others create the canopy. Below is a vast complex of shrubs including palmettos, yaupon, yucca, prickly-pear cactus, resurrection fern, and many others including the iconic Spanish Moss. The forest is also home to different species of amphibians and land animals, including deer, snakes, raccoons, alligators, wild turkey, frogs, and many others. One of the area's most beloved, and endangered, creatures is the loggerhead sea turtle. From late May through mid-August, female turtles clamber up the beach after dark to dig nests in the dunes above the high water line and lay their eggs. Turtle eggs face many threats of both the natural and man-made variety; and all species of sea turtles are currently protected by the Federal Endangered Species Act. The Georgia Department of Natural Resources coordinates the efforts of several local agencies and volunteers under the Georgia Sea Turtle Cooperative. These groups monitor, protect and manage nests found on Golden Isles beaches, in addition to conducting research and public awareness and education programs. The Georgia Sea Turtle Center on Jekyll Island, a member of the Cooperative, provides rehabilitation services for injured turtles as well as research and education through a variety of programs and field trips. Another endangered species found just offshore is the North Atlantic Right Whale. These migratory animals got their name from whalers because they were easy to hunt and yielded large amounts of oil and baleen. As a result, they were hunted almost to extinction. Right whales are currently protected by both Federal and State law. Because the waters off South Georgia and Florida are their only known calving grounds, the NOAA has designated a critical habitat area extending from the Altamaha River delta to Melbourne, Florida. Federal law prohibits vessels from approaching or remaining within 500 yards of a right whale. In December, 2014, the Georgia Department of Natural Resources estimated that there were fewer than 100 breeding females in existence.  Culture  Because of its long and varied history and mixture of disparate peoples, the Golden Isles enjoys a rich cultural heritage that locals work to preserve in a variety of ways. There is also a vibrant contemporary culture that manifests itself in a broad mixture of creative arts. Local theater productions, art exhibits, music festivals, culinary events, environmental expositions, art and photography shows are scheduled throughout the year. Venues include the Historic Ritz Theatre, Brunswick Actors Theatre, Mary Ross Park, Neptune Park, and the St. Simons Island Casino, home of the Island Players. = Arts and music = The Golden Isles are home to a growing number of art galleries, and other venues where creative artists share their works. Golden Isles Arts & Humanities in Brunswick and Glynn Visual Arts on St. Simons Island have each been instrumental in promoting and supporting both established and beginning artists. Among the more unusual local art forms are the Tree Spirits of St. Simons Island. Created by a local sculptor, they memorialize sailors lost at sea on ships made of island lumber, along with some Native Americans. Their mournful expressions create an emotional and unforgettable experience for viewers. The centuries-old art of stained glass is on display at several locations throughout the Golden Isles. At Christ Church Frederica, \\"The Confession of St. Peter\\" dates to 1899. Faith Chapel on Jekyll Island includes a window signed by Louis Tiffany. Lovely Lane Chapel at Epworth by the Sea features Old English Art Glass windows. Another Tiffany window is located at St. Mark's Episcopal Church in Brunswick. Other notable examples can be seen at the King & Prince Resort, the Cloister Hotel, and the Jekyll Island Club Hotel, as well as many other churches throughout the area. In late spring and summer, music lovers enjoy outdoor concerts at Mary Ross Waterfront Park in Brunswick and Neptune Park on St. Simons Island. Jekyll Island hosts annual festivals that feature both local and out-of-town performers. = African- American heritage = The Golden Isles are located near the southern end of the Gullah Geechee Cultural Heritage Corridor, a coastal area that stretches from Wilmington, NC to Jacksonville, FL, extending 30 miles inland along its length. Gullah Geechee refers to a people, a language and a culture. The Gullah Geechee people are descendants of slaves primarily from west and central Africa who were brought to work on cotton and rice plantations along the coast of North and South Carolina, Georgia, and north Florida. The Gullah language is a creole tongue that combines English with a number of African dialects. Coastal, primarily rice-growing plantations came to be isolated from their mainland counterparts due to the prevalence of tropical diseases such as malaria, which tended to keep the plantation owners inland. Consequently, the West African slaves were able to form tight-knit communities that retained more of their homeland culture and languages. This Gullah Geechee way of life continued more or less intact until the advent of 20th-century coastal development. The Heritage Corridor is one result of efforts to protect and preserve this unique and little-known culture. The St. Simons African American Heritage Coalition works to preserve and educate people about Gullah Geechee culture through the annual Sea Island Festival each June on St. Simons Island. Performers at the Festival have included the Georgia Sea Island Singers, a world-renowned folk group that specializes in Gullah music and dance. The Coalition also conducts tours of Gullah Geechee sites on the island. Recently they played a leading role in fundraising for restoration of the historic Harrington School House, which dates to the 1920s and served the island's African-American communities. = Ghost stories = Given its long history, it is not surprising that ghost stories are plentiful in the Golden Isles. Some of the tales often heard from locals and tour guides alike include: * Mary the Wanderer, who lost her lover in a storm at sea, is sometimes seen with a lantern or riding a white horse, continuing her search * The flickering light in Christ Church cemetery…a candle, said to have been put there by the husband of a deceased woman who always kept a lighted candle by her bedside to allay her fear of the dark * The ghost of Frederick Osborne at the St. Simons Lighthouse…a former lighthouse keeper killed in a duel * The Jekyll Island Club Hotel is said to be frequented by several long deceased guests who have yet to check out. = Annual festivals and events = Southeast Georgia Health System Bridge Run February – Brunswick.

An official PGA Tour event, hosted by Island resident, Davis Love, III, held on the Seaside Course at the Sea Island Golf Club on St. Simons Island. The event, which began in 2010, has added a second course for 2015 and expanded its field to 156. Jekyll Tree Lighting Festival & Holidays in History November and December – Jekyll Island. Beginning with a Tree Lighting Festival on the Saturday after Thanksgiving, the celebration features lights and Christmas decorations in the Historic District, themed tours, storytelling, caroling and crafts.  Outdoor sports and activities  As a result of the Golden Isles' moderate climate, a variety of outdoor activities are popular year-round. Golf in the area dates back to the early 1900s, when courses were built on Jekyll Island for the wealthy industrialists who owned vacation homes there. Today there are sixteen public and private courses in Glynn County, including the historic Great Dunes Course on Jekyll Island that was designed by Walter Travis and opened in 1928, and the Seaside Course on St. Simons Island, host of the annual PGA tour event, The RSM Classic (formerly McGladrey Classic). The nutrient-rich waters of the Golden Isles marshes, tidal creeks, rivers, sounds and the Atlantic Ocean are home to an extensive variety of fish and sea creatures, which in turn draws anglers from near and far. In-shore and river fishing can yield trout, redfish, flounder, sheepshead, whiting and more. Offshore anglers can land king mackerel, Spanish mackerel, cobia, grouper, snapper, amberjack, tarpon, and several shark species. Surf casting is also popular on the islands, as is fishing from the many piers and bridges throughout the area. Fishing licenses are required for anyone over 16 years of age. Size and catch limits are also enforced. The area's natural scenery and nature preserves attract photographers, birders and kayakers. Popular water sports include sailing and offshore scuba diving. The tidal creeks, sandbars and relatively gentle surf have made paddle boarding an increasingly popular sport locally. Onshore activities include biking, hiking, tennis, and horseback riding. Fans of the relatively new sport of disc golf will find a course on St. Simons Island. Parks and playgrounds cater to families. In addition to swimming and sunbathing, Golden Isles beaches are visited throughout the year for walking, bird-watching, and shell-hunting.  Tourism  Because it was one of the few barrier islands not privately owned, St. Simons Island was the first of the Golden Isles to develop facilities for tourism, primarily on and around the south end where visitors arrived at the pier beginning in the 1870s. Also during this time, the luxurious Oglethorpe Hotel opened in Brunswick. With the advent of the automobile and the opening of the F. J. Torras Causeway in 1924, more facilities were built (most notably by auto magnate turned developer, Howard Coffin) and it was not long before St. Simons Island became a preferred vacation destination. In 1928, Mr. Coffin, who had earlier purchased Sea Island, opened the Cloister to great critical acclaim. While St. Simons Island was entering its tourism phase, Jekyll Island remained a private retreat for the rich and famous. After the Great Depression and World War II, however, the Jekyll Island Club and the winter \\"cottages\\" fell into disuse. In 1947, the State of Georgia purchased the island for the purpose of creating a state park. Shortly thereafter, the Jekyll Island Authority was created by the state legislature to manage the island and develop a tourism business. Today's tourism in the Golden Isles takes a variety of forms: day trippers from nearby counties, weekend getaways, family vacations, business travelers, active sports participants, eco-tourists, winter residents, history and culture enthusiasts, weddings & family gatherings. Accommodations include hotels and resorts in all price ranges, rental houses and condominiums, and bed & breakfast inns. The newly refurbished and enlarged oceanfront convention center on Jekyll Island reopened in May, 2012, followed by new hotels, restaurants, and retail space.  Economy  Within the Golden Isles, tourism is the key driver of economic activity, with an estimated impact of $1.1 billion in 2014. The resort operator, Sea Island Company is the area's largest employer. Of less economic significance, but still important to the area's appeal, is the shrimping industry. Once known as the \\"shrimp capital of the world\\", local shrimpers continue to supply fresh catch to restaurants and retailers throughout the Golden Isles and beyond. The Port of Brunswick is the centerpiece of the area's thriving logistics industry, while Brunswick Airport is home to a growing aerospace presence. Healthcare and manufacturing are the other primary economic drivers, along with the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center. = Chamber of Commerce = The Brunswick-Golden Isles Chamber of Commerce is a private, non-profit, membership-driven organization of business enterprises, professional firms, educational institutions and individuals who are committed to the continued economic growth and prosperity of Brunswick and the Golden Isles. The Chamber does not operate as a department of the city, county or state, as it is a membership organization. Membership investments and expenses are tax deductible as a business expense rather than a charitable contribution, and businesses of every size and description are part of the Chamber. It is more than 1,300 businesses, 80 percent of which are small businesses with 10 employees or less, working together to enhance the economic climate and reduce the impediments to the flow of commerce in our community. The Chamber of Commerce is a unified voice for Glynn County businesses. = Economic development = Ongoing economic development of the community is managed by the Brunswick and Glynn County Development Authority. The purpose of the Development Authority is to promote new industry and existing industry expansion. In order to fulfill this responsibility, the Development Authority engages in various economic development activities that include but are not limited to: * Conducting an aggressive marketing campaign for industrial and commercial prospects * Developing industrial parks and freestanding industrial sites for use by expanding and new businesses * Maintaining legislative liaison with local, state, and national legislative delegations The Brunswick and Glynn County Development Authority works to package appropriate incentives to recruit new industry including the following: * Issuing bonds to finance loans for industrial development. * Offering tax exemptions for unfinished goods that move through the Port of Brunswick. Working with the State Department of Economic Development to package local and state incentives together – with the state providing tax incentives for new or existing industries that generate job growth. = Convention and Visitors Bureau = The Golden Isles Convention & Visitors Bureau (CVB) is the official destination marketing organization dedicated to promoting tourism in Glynn County, Georgia. The Golden Isles CVB oversees the operation and maintenance of two Welcome Centers in Glynn County. The Welcome Centers can be found in Brunswick, on I-95 southbound, between exits 42 and 38, and on St. Simons Island in the Pier Village area at 529 Beachview Drive. The mission of the CVB is twofold: To promote the Golden Isles to become a nationally recognized resort destination. To advocate for the best quality visitor experience to protect the economic sustainability of the community.  Historical landmarks and attractions  Brunswick = Historic Brunswick Courthouse  Historic Glynn County Courthouse Front of Historic courthouse The Historic Brunswick Courthouse is situated in a grove of live oaks within Magnolia Square—one of the historic parks and squares used to house livestock as a community pasture. The parcel was purchased in 1905 from the City for $1.00. Today it is still surrounded by moss-hung live oaks in addition to trees of foreign origin including Tung and Chinese pistachio. The courthouse was designed by New Jersey architect Charles Alling Gifford of the New York firm Gifford & Bates. Gifford's work is notable within the National Historic Landmark District on Jekyll Island, principally Sans Souci Apartments (1896), Mistletoe Cottage (1900), and Jekyll Island Clubhouse Annex (1901). The cornerstone was laid on December 27, 1906 and construction was completed on December 18, 1907 at a total cost of $97,613. Restoration work began in the early 1990s. It is noted as an example of Neoclassical Revival style or Beaux Arts (fine arts) architecture that flourished between 1885 and 1920. Beaux Arts combines ancient Greek and Roman forms with Renaissance ideas and is an eclectic Neoclassical style. Design suggests interlinking philosophy of justice: four identical entrances complement interior columns leading to justice; an intricate iron stair rail suggests delicate balance and the frailties of man. The new Glynn County Courthouse is located immediately north of the structure. Opposite the Courthouse at 1709 Reynolds Street, the Mahoney-McGarvey House is known as one of the finest examples of Carpenter Gothic architecture in Georgia.  Historic Ritz Theatre  The Ritz Theatre Originally, the Grand Opera House, a three-story Victorian building featuring ornate brick and stone work, was built for the legitimate stage. Later, it served as a theatre for vaudeville. In the 1920s, as motion pictures became the rage, the Opera House was converted into a movie palace. To give the building a more modern art deco look, the first-story brickwork was covered with carrara glass and an elaborate marquee and cascading sign were added. Thus, the Grand Opera House became the Ritz Theatre. In 1956, the world premiere of \\"A View From Pompey's Head,\\" filmed primarily at the Oglethorpe Hotel (the grand hotel that used to sit across from the Ritz), was introduced by the film's star, Richard Egan, at the Ritz Theatre. The Ritz Theatre (and single movie houses in general) fell into decline in the 60's and 70's. In 1981, the City of Brunswick purchased the Ritz, and again, the theatre was modernized and substantially altered; however, the Ritz sign was left intact. The extensive reconstruction was due in part to the collapse of the roof over the auditorium. This phase was completed in 1983. In 2008, the Ritz became part of the Fox Theatre Institute (FTI), the only comprehensive theatre preservation organization in the U.S. and the premiere resource for historic theatre restoration and revitalization in Georgia, offering mentoring programs, preservation expertise, operational counseling, and educational opportunities. In 2010 Golden Isles Arts and Humanities applied for and received a restoration assistance grant, matched by the City of Brunswick, to restore the building's 58 original windows, which were loose and in danger of falling. Under FTI's guidance, local craftsmen James Taylor and Taylor Davis, partnering with the Association for Preservation Technology and the Jekyll Island Restoration Team, restored the windows using the original glass and much of the original wood. FTI and the city then supported the repainting of the building. In 1899, the Grand Opera House was built of unpainted brick, then painted white by the movie company in the 1920s for a more modern feel. Because it would have been damaging to remove decades of paint from the surface, the theatre was painted a brick red when the city restored it in the 1980s. Local contractors Peninsula Painting were hired to refurbish the exterior using the same basic color scheme. When the work was completed in the summer of 2010, new curtains were made for the windows by Brunswick resident Jennifer George. The original Ritz sign was the final exterior element needing restoration. The sign had not been fully operational for years, so FTI once again stepped in to provide assistance. In May 2011, local company Fendig Signs undertook extensive restoration work, including painting, rewiring, and the crafting of new neon letters by Ray Tanner. The restored sign was returned in the fall and on November 4, 2011, during Downtown Brunswick's First Friday event, Golden Isles Arts and Humanities held a grand re-lighting celebration. The Ritz Theatre, located within the \\"Old Town Brunswick\\" National Register District was built in 1899 to house the Grand Opera House, retail establishments, and the general offices of the Brunswick & Birmingham Railroad. Today, downtown Brunswick's historic theatre and arts center features year-round live performances, films, exhibits, educational programs and more. Programming and management by Golden Isles Arts and Humanities Association, coordinating arts council for the City of Brunswick and Glynn County. 1530 Newcastle Street, Brunswick, GA 31520  Hofwyl-Broadfield Plantation  * The main house of the Hofwyl-Broadfield Plantation In the early 1800s, William Brailsford of Charleston carved a rice plantation from marshes along the Altamaha River. The plantation and its inhabitants were part of the genteel low country society that developed during the antebellum period. While many factors made rice cultivation increasingly difficult in the years after the Civil War, the family continued to grow rice until 1913. The enterprising siblings of the fifth generation at Hofwyl- Broadfield resolved to start a dairy rather than sell their family home. The efforts of Gratz, Miriam and Ophelia Dent led to the preservation of their family legacy. Ophelia was the last heir, and she left the plantation to the state of Georgia in 1973. A museum features silver from the family collection and a model of Hofwyl-Broadfield during its heyday. A brief film on the plantation's history is shown before visitors walk a short trail to the antebellum home. A guided tour allows visitors to see the home as Ophelia kept it with family heirlooms, 18th and 19th century furniture and Cantonese china. A stop on the Colonial Coast Birding Trail, this is an excellent spot to look for herons, egrets, ibis and painted buntings. A nature trail leads back to the Visitors Center along the edge of the marsh where rice once flourished. 5556 U.S. Highway 17 North, Brunswick, GA 31525  Old City Hall  Old City Hall This part-time city courthouse doubles as Brunswick's new venue of choice for everything from class reunions to wedding receptions. Built at a cost of $33,000, Old City Hall was fully restored with special purpose local option sales tax dollars and reopened in 2004. Its gleaming heart-pine and marble floors, original vintage fireplaces and newly refitted gaslight fixtures lend an air of old fashioned elegance to any gathering. Construction on Old Brunswick City Hall began in 1886 from an architectural design by Alfred Eichberg, and was completed in 1889, with the installation of the clock/bell tower in 1893. The architectural style is Richardsonian Romanesque, with Queen Anne parallels. Massive in stature, with the unusual addition of Italianate brackets, Romanesque Revival architecture was the style of choice for the majority of public buildings built in the United States during this period. Elaborate terracotta friezes decorate our Old City Hall clock tower and side entries, while the corner columns are adorned with gargoyles. 1229 Newcastle Street, Brunswick, GA 31520 = St. Simons Island = A.W. Jones Heritage Center  April 2008 marked the opening of the 10,000-square- foot A.W. Jones Heritage Center. The center includes an entrance gallery, a museum shop and a 1,400 square foot event hall which is available for rent. The second floor includes the Society's administrative offices, a research library and the Society's vast collection of objects, artifacts and archival materials from hundreds of years of coastal Georgia history. The Heritage Center offers a large selection of collectibles and keepsakes. Local artists and writers are featured in the gift shop. 610 Beachview Drive, St. Simons Island, GA 31522  Arthur J. Moore Methodist Museum and Library  When the property was purchased in 1949, it was Bishop Moore's vision that it would one day become a retreat center and a place of inspiration for people of all ages. Moore was Bishop of both North and South Georgia conferences of the Methodist church as well as a leader in worldwide missions for over 20 years. The Arthur J. Moore Methodist Museum was dedicated in June 1966 began as a small library containing many volumes from the Bishop's personal collection. The museum in the beginning had a distinctly southern Methodist focus, containing principally oriental porcelains and other artifacts gathered by Moore during his travels. Dr. Charles Layman, noted theologian, writer, and professor of Bible at the University of Florida, graciously offered to the museum items from his extensive Wesleyan collection. The Wesleyan grew rapidly. Later, North Georgia clergyman, Rev. David Ogletree, began making generous gifts from his substantial collection of Wesley historical artifacts. The research library consisting of over 6,000 volumes has also expanded greatly through the years. In the spring of each year, thousands of youth from churches across the Southeastern jurisdiction gather on weekends at Epworth by the Sea as part of their confirmation class training. This modern building holds within it a wide array of treasures that range from the history of St. Simons Island to the Wesley family including the Wesley brothers landing here with General Oglethorpe in 1736. The museum also illustrates the start of the Methodist church and the changes it underwent to get where it is today. The museum has a new interactive kiosk where people of all ages can learn more about the history of the circuit rider and early Methodism in Georgia. There is also a fun game where you can ride along with a circuit rider to share the experience of bringing faith to the frontier. The museum houses a wonderful collection of nativities. 100 Arthur J. Moore Drive, St. Simons Island, GA 31522  Avenue of the Oaks  Avenue of oaks From 1760 until the outbreak of the American Civil War, cotton and rice plantations flourished in this area. The Sea Island cotton grown here became famous the world over for its quality. Retreat Plantation was one of the most prosperous plantations and was located on the southern tip of St. Simons Island. Anna Page King, who inherited the land in 1826, planted the famous Avenue of the Oaks. It is said that Anna grew such an abundance of flowers at Retreat Plantation that sailors nearing St. Simons Island could smell the flowers' fragrance before they saw the Island shores. Once the entrance to Retreat Plantation, the Avenue of the Oaks is now the entrance to the Sea Island Golf Club. There is a drive around the double row of live oak trees which create the Avenue of the Oaks, most dating to around 1830.  Bloody Marsh Battle Site  Bloody Marsh At the Bloody Marsh Battle Site on July 7, 1742, an outnumbered force of British troops ambushed and defeated Spanish troops, halting a planned attack on Fort Frederica. Markers and information panels at this outdoor observation site explain the battle, which once and for all ended Spain's claims to the Georgia territory. The Bloody Marsh Unit is located at 1810 Demere Road, St. Simons Island, GA 31522. This site is managed by the National Park Service as part of Fort Frederica National Monument.  Cannon's Point Preserve  A 600-acre wilderness tract on the Northeast corner of St. Simons Island, Cannon's Point is the last remaining undisturbed maritime forest on the island. Owned by the St. Simons Land Trust, the Preserve includes salt marsh, tidal creek, and river shoreline, as well as 4,000-year-old shell middens and ruins of a 17th- century plantation home and slave quarters. The Nature Conservancy holds a conservation easement on the property to ensure its preservation for future generations. The Preserve is open to the public during specified days and hours. Visitors are advised to wear clothing appropriate for a wilderness outing, and bring bug spray.  Cassina Garden Club Slave Cabins  Hamilton Plantation slave houses (river view side) Hamilton Plantation, owned by James Hamilton, a native of Scotland, was located on Gascoigne Bluff near Fort Frederica. The Bluff was named for Capt. James Gascoigne, commander of the British sloop Hawk. The Bluff became a storehouse for marine supplies, ship repair facilities and in effect, was Georgia's first naval base. Hamilton Plantation was a working plantation, producing long staple Sea Island cotton along with oak and pine timbers. Of the several tabby slave cabins built on the plantation, two remain today. They were constructed of tabby, which is a concrete-like mixture of lime, sand, water and oyster shells. The mixture is poured into wooden frames to harden. The cabins were divided in the center by a fireplace, thus creating two rooms that housed two families. Glass windows and wooden outside doors indicate that these cabins were probably living quarters of slaves that were high in the privilege hierarchy. Cassina Garden Club began meeting in these cabins in 1932 and was deeded the property in 1950. As owner of this historic site, the Cassina Garden Club has carefully restored and preserved the integrity of the cabins and displays many artifact and graphical histories. The cabins are located adjacent to Epworth by the Sea, a Methodist Conference Center. General Oglethorpe's secretary, Charles Wesley and his Anglican clergyman brother, John, considered by many the founder of the Methodist Church, trod these grounds. All of this property was formerly part of Hamilton Plantation. Not surprisingly, this historic property was placed on the National Register of Historic Places by the United States Department of Interior in 1988.  Christ Church, Frederica  Christ Episcopal Church, established in 1736 Christ Church, Frederica is located in a serene setting formed by native live oaks, holly and cedar trees. On the site of Christ Church, nestled among huge oak trees on the scenic north end of St. Simons Island, John and Charles Wesley preached before returning to England to help found the Methodist Church. In addition to being credited with founding the Methodist Church in England, the Wesley brothers also played a major role in the development of the Episcopal Church. The first church structure was built in 1820 but was partially destroyed by Union troops during the Civil War. In 1884, the Reverend Anson Phelps Dodge, Jr., built the present structure in memory of his wife, Ellen. Christ Church is constructed of wood in the cruciform design with a trussed Gothic roof and steeple. The grounds contain a cemetery with graves of early settlers and many famous Georgians. One Georgia author, Eugenia Price, who wrote many novels including a series on St. Simons is buried here along with Lucien Knight, the first state historian of Georgia. Another Georgian, a plantation owner who owned the point on St. Simons where the lighthouse was built, is buried at Christ Church cemetery. The cemetery's oldest tombstone is from 1803. Today, the church and its stained glass windows are home to the Episcopal congregation on St. Simons. Christ Church is one of St. Simons Island's most treasured landmarks. Epworth By The Sea Epworth by the Sea is a world renown, comprehensive conference and retreat center owned by the South Georgia Conference of the United Methodist Church. Accommodating up to 900 persons, Epworth offers a range of motel rooms, family apartments and youth cabins. Auditoriums seat from 300 to 900. Meeting rooms and classrooms have audiovisual equipment. An in-season swimming pool, athletic field, covered basketball courts, tennis courts, bicycle rentals and fishing piers provide sports activities for all ages. A hospitality ministry serving guests from around the world, Epworth is open to all denominations, state and local agencies, groups and individuals whose goals are consistent with Epworth's purpose, \\"To provide a Christian place for worship, study and fellowship.\\" The 100 acre campus is located on Gascoigne Bluff, the one-mile riverbank tract stretching from the causeway bridge to the bend in the Frederica River. More than 200 years after the Revs. John and Charles Wesley labored on St. Simons, South Georgia Methodists agreed that this was the perfect location for a conference and retreat center. Assisted by influential businessman Alfred W. Jones, Sr., president of the Sea Island Company, the Methodists purchased part of the Hamilton Plantation in 1949 and named it Epworth in honor of the Wesley's boyhood home in Epworth, England. Lovely Lane Chapel, the oldest standing church building on St. Simons hosts Sunday services and is available for weddings. Constructed in 1880, it is named after the site of the 1784 founding conference of American Methodism in Baltimore, Maryland. 100 Arthur J. Moore Drive, St. Simons Island, GA 31522  Fort Frederica National Monument  Remains of Fort Frederica In the early 1700s, Georgia was the epicenter of a centuries-old conflict between Spain and Britain. In 1736, three years after the founding of Savannah, James Oglethorpe established Fort Frederica to protect his southern boundary. 44 men and 72 women and children arrived to build the fort and town, and by the 1740s Frederica was a thriving village of about 500 citizens. Colonists from England, Scotland, and the Germanic states came to Frederica to support the endeavor. Georgia's fate was decided in 1742 when Spanish and British forces clashed on St. Simons Island. Fort Frederica's troops defeated the Spanish in the Battle of Bloody Marsh, ensuring Georgia's future as a British colony. However, the declining military threat to the Georgia coast saw the Fort's regiment disbanded in 1749. Today, the archeological remnants of Frederica are protected by the National Park Service. 6515 Frederica Road, St. Simons Island, GA 31522  Gascoigne Bluff  Historically, Gascoigne Bluff was the first possible landing area for a ship entering the harbor. The site of an Indian settlement long before the Wesleys landed here with James Oglethorpe, Gascoigne Bluff has been headquarters for a military invasion, a Sea Island cotton plantation, the site of a lumber mill and a shipping point for timber. Live oak timbers milled here in 1794 were used in building \\"Old Ironsides,\\" the U.S.S. Constitution. In 1874, timbers were cut here for the Brooklyn Bridge. At Gascoigne Bluff, you can visit the Cassina Garden Club Slave Cabins from the Plantation Era, a Southern Red Cedar tree that is the second largest of its kind in Georgia, a fishing pier, and a stand of live oak trees. Across the Frederica River, you will see three \\"ballast hammocks\\", small islands formed from ballast dumped by European ships before taking on cotton or lumber.  Lovely Lane Chapel  The oldest standing Church building on St. Simons Island, Georgia is Lovely Lane Chapel. Formally named St. James Union Chapel, it was built by Norman W. Dodge in 1880. Repaired following a hurricane in 1897, the chapel was deconsecrated in 1911 to be used as a recreation center, and was re-consecrated in 1949 after the Methodist purchased the property. Lovely Lane is named after the site of the 1784 Founding Conference of American Methodism in Baltimore, Maryland. The chapel is currently open to the public for Sunday Worship Service as well as wedding ceremonies. 100 Arthur J. Moore Drive, St. Simons Island, GA 31522  Maritime Center  The historic Coast Guard Station now houses the Maritime Center. The Maritime Center makes its home in the Historic Coast Guard Station. Filled with interactive exhibits and galleries, this interesting museum offers an exciting look at coastal Georgia's natural assets, maritime and military history. Explore seven galleries featuring a variety of hands-on exhibits and activities. The historic U.S. Coast Guard Station at East Beach on St. Simons Island was one of 45 U.S. Coast Guard Stations built around the country by the Works Progress Administration (WPA). Work on the East Beach Station began in Fall 1935. It is believed to be one of only three surviving stations from that era. The station and boathouse had its \\"First Watch\\" on April 1, 1937. When the station first opened, the original beachfront was just a few feet from the front door. Today the station is separated from the beach by a large parking lot. On April 8, 1942, sank two merchant ships, the SS Oklahoma and Esso Baton Rouge, off the coast of St. Simons Island. Joined by local residents, the coast guardsmen mounted the rescue. In 1995, the East Beach Station was decommissioned and all local Coast Guard operations were moved to mainland Brunswick. A brand new Coast Guard Station was completed in 2005, just to the east of the Sidney Lanier Bridge. 4201 1st Street, St. Simons Island, GA 31522Lighthouse and keeper's house (now the museum) St. Simons Island Lighthouse Museum In 1965, a strong group of 10 citizens formed the Coastal Georgia Historical Society and began to successfully gather support from the community of Glynn County to preserve the early coastal heritage. When the Keeper's Dwelling was threatened with commercial development in 1975, the Society undertook the restoration of this 1872 building. As a result of this work, the dwelling was opened in 1975 as the St. Simons Island Lighthouse Museum and has been administered by the Society since that time. In 1984, the St. Simons Lighthouse was leased by the United States Coast Guard and became part of the museum complex. Today, the St. Simons Island Lighthouse Museum is a recognized and viable part of the rich cultural history of the area. The lighthouse, which still lights the entrance to St. Simons Sound, adds the historical significance of the evolving pre- and post- Civil War navigation. In 2004, the deed to the St. Simons Island Lighthouse was transferred to the Coastal Georgia Historical Society under the National Historic Lighthouse Preservation Act of 2000. In April 2006, the Maritime Center at the Historic Coast Guard Station opened. 610 Beachview Drive, St. Simons Island, GA 31522 = Jekyll Island = Georgia Sea Turtle Center  Georgia Sea Turtle Center Through sea turtle rehabilitation, research and education programs, the Georgia Sea Turtle Center will increase awareness of habitat and wildlife conservation challenges, promote responsibility for ecosystem health and empower individuals to act locally, regionally, and globally to protect the environment. The Georgia Sea Turtle Center is a hospital for ill and injured sea turtles. It is the only hospital of its kind in the state of Georgia. The Center is open to the general public and offers an interactive Exhibit Gallery and Rehabilitation Pavilion with a number of viewable sea turtle patients. 214 Stable Road (Corner of Hopkins and Stable Road), Jekyll Island, GA 31527  Horton House  Major William Horton was granted Jekyll Island by the Trustees of the colony of Georgia in 1738, and he constructed this home in 1743. The Horton House is one of the oldest standing tabby concrete structure exteriors in the state. Horton House remains Horton was one of General James Oglethorpe's top military aids and was in charge of troops garrisoned at Fort Frederica on nearby St. Simons Island. Horton farmed the island, producing crops to aid with supplying Ft. Frederica. This included hops and barley to produce Georgia's first beer. Eventually, Horton added a warehouse to the site, of which remains still exist. His brewery, whose remains lie just down the road, supplied ale to troops and settlers at Fort Frederica on St. Simons Island. Today, the tabby ruins of Georgia's first brewery have mostly fallen into DuBignon Creek. The site also includes the cemetery of the DuBignon Family, which owned Jekyll from 1790 to 1886 and occupied the house as their home from 1790 until sometime in the mid-1800s. There you can see the grave of John Eugene DuBignon, who sold Jekyll Island to the Jekyll Island Club in the late 1800s. The Horton House is one of the oldest buildings in Georgia, and the site is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Preservation work on the site was made possible by a Save America's Treasures grant from the National Park Service, and received an Excellence in Preservation award from the Georgia Trust for Historic Preservation. The Horton House historic site is open to the public. North Riverview Drive, Jekyll Island, GA 31527  Jekyll Island National Historic District  The Jekyll Island Club in the historic district The Jekyll Island National Historic Landmark District is one of the largest ongoing restoration projects in the southeastern United States. The work to preserve the site has resulted in numerous awards and recognitions including Jekyll Island named to the National Trust for Historic Preservation's 12 Distinctive Destinations and receiving the 2008 Georgia Trust for Historic Preservation's Marguerite William Award for Preservation. The Jekyll Island Museum is your port of entry to the extraordinary stories of the Jekyll Island National Historic District and the entirety of Jekyll Island's rich history. At the Jekyll Island Museum you can embark on a journey of discovery, through exhibits, tours and programs that are adventures into a bygone era.

Born in circa 1857, he was the son of Ọba Adọlọ. He took the name Ovọnramwẹn Nọgbaisi at his enthronement in 1888. Every Ọba took a new name at his coronation, Ovọnramwẹn meaning \\"The Rising Sun\\" and Nọgbaisi meaning \\"which spreads over all\\".Oba of Benin , Edostate.org, accessed March, 2012 Ovonramwen Nogbaisi with his wives, Queen Egbe (left) and Queen Aighobahi (right), c.1898 - 1913 At the end of the 19th century, the Kingdom of Benin had managed to retain its independence and the Ọba exercised a monopoly over trade which the British found irksome. The territory was coveted by an influential group of investors for its rich natural resources such as palm-oil, rubber and ivory.Thomas Uwadiale Obinyan, The Annexation of Benin, in Journal of Black Studies, Vol. 19, No. 1 (Sep., 1988), pp. 29-40 The kingdom was largely independent of British control, and pressure continued from figures such as Vice-Consul James Robert Phillips and Captain Gallwey (the British vice-Consul of Oil Rivers Protectorate) who were pushing for British annexation of the Benin Empire and the removal of the Ọba. British invasion A British invasion force headed by Phillips set out to overthrow the Ọba in 1896. The force's weapons were hidden in baggage, with troops disguised as bearers. Phillips plan was to gain access to Ovonramwen's palace by announcing that he intended to negotiate. Ovonramwen's messengers issued several warnings not to violate Benin territorial sovereignty, claiming he was unable to see Phillips due to ceremonial duties. Having been warned on several further occasions on the way, Phillips sent his stick to the Ọba, a deliberate insult designed to provoke the conflict that would provide an excuse for British annexation.Sven Lindqvist, Exterminate All the Brutes, p.57-62 Phillip's expedition was ambushed and all but two were killed. Subsequently, a military operation against Benin in 1897 led by Harry Rawson resulted in the burning of Benin City, the destruction and looting of the royal palaces, and the deaths of untold numbers of its inhabitants. Although the British had orders to hang the Ọba, Ovonramwen escaped, but returned to the city to formally surrender on 5 August 1897. When Ovọnramwẹn returned to the city, after six months spent in evading capture in the forest, he was richly dressed and laden with coral beads and accompanied by an entourage of seven hundred to eight hundred people. He attempted to escape exile by offering Consul General Ralph Moor 200 puncheons (barrels) of oil worth £1500 at that time and to disclose where his 500 ivory tusks were buried (of a value of more than £2M at that time). However, this offer was dismissed as Moor had already discovered them.Roth H. L. Great Benin Its Customs, Art and Horrors, 1903, appendix 111 pp xvii. Exile Sculpture of Ovonramwen being exiled, Museum of Black Civilisations, Dakar Ovonramwen was exiled to Calabar with two of his wives, Queen Egbe and Queen Aighobahi. He was received and hosted in Calabar in a small town called “Essien Town” by Etinyin Essien Etim Offiong, the progenitor of Essien Town. He died in Calabar around the turn of the new year in 1914.

The southernmost town in the Greater Buenos Aires metropolitan area, San Vicente is from downtown Buenos Aires, and can be accessed from Constitución Station by bus via Line 79 or a 20-minute drive by Provincial Route 58 from Ezeiza International Airport. The city has about 21,000 inhabitants per the . History Named in honor of the 14th century Dominican friar Saint Vincent Ferrer, the site was first settled as an Indian Reduction in 1618 by Spanish conquistadores and was initially known as Laguna de la Reducción. Luis Pessoa y Figueroa, a landowner from Magdalena and member of the Buenos Aires Cabildo, bought much of the land south of the San Vicente Lagoon (then known as Laguna del Ojo) in 1696, and his son, Juan Bautista Pessoa, established a small settlement in 1734. A fort, Fortín El Zajón, was built here by the Blandengues cavalry corps in 1750. Luis Pessoa's grandson, Friar Vicente Pessoa, established the area's first Catholic parish in 1781 and on 30 December 1784, the county of Magdalena was formally divided into among two other towns, San Vicente. The village was made a county seat by the establishment of one of the province's first Justice of the Peace courts in 1822. Governor Juan José Viamonte founded the area's first large estancia, La Martiniana, in 1824, and the subsequent establishment of numerous English Argentine settlers made San Vicente the provincial capital of sheep farming by 1854, with over 558,000 head. Recurrent flooding from surrounding swampland led provincial authorities to propose relocating the town. Local residents rejected the proposal, however, and on 27 January 1856, the Municipality of San Vicente was formally established. The town grew slowly but steadily, and in 1896 a tram service was inaugurated. This era of growth was interrupted by World War I and the coinciding collapse of the wool market; but the inaugural in 1928 of a Buenos Aires Great Southern Railway rail link to Buenos Aires brought renewed growth to San Vicente. The Ramón Carrillo Hospital, the town's first, was inaugurated in 1949. The local rail station was closed amid budget cuts in 1978. San Vicente is also slated to house the National Cattle Ranchers' Market, although the 2001 Buenos Aires municipal ordinance mandating its relocation from the Mataderos borough to San Vicente has been repeatedly postponed due to cattle vendor objections to the cost of relocation. San Vicente became a bedroom community in later decades of the 20th century, and numerous well-known figures in Argentine sports, history, and culture have resided there. These included Emilie Schindler; writer Rodolfo Walsh; comics artist Dante Quinterno; former Argentina national football team captain Jorge Brown; psychiatrist and activist Dr. Alejandro Korn (after whom a neighboring town is named); and arguably the town's most famous residents, populist leaders Evita and Juan Perón, who purchased a weekend home in San Vicente in 1947.

History The arena was opened in 1961 and was home of a number of national and international sport events, such as the 1963 European Figure Skating Championships, which was the last outdoor championship and 1964 Women's European Basketball Championship, and also hosted Davis Cup matches and other shows and concerts. Next to the stadium stand the office buildings, which was once the home of the Hungarian Ice Hockey Federation, the Hungarian Bandy Federation and the Hungarian Field Hockey Federation. In 1988 new floodlights were erected, thus making the arena available for TV coverage and there were also set up seven TV- and radio reporter rooms and journalist boxes. One of the biggest shortcomings of the stadium is that it is not covered, therefore its season is limited from October to March and is also more exposed to weather effects. During the years, there have been many plans to solve this problem, but it failed again and again, mostly due to financial reasons. In addition, unlike other arenas, the Kisstadion has a particularly wide span (90 metres), which makes to find the statically appropriate solution more complicated and more expensive. In 2009 the arena was planned to be demolished and replaced by a brand new ice rink, however, the Hungarian Ice Hockey Federation could not realize this goal. In November 2010, Attila Czene, head of Ministry of Resources have announced that a complete reconstruction is imminent and the stadium will get finally a roof. Eventually, with some delays and modifications an insulated tent and a mobile ice rink was set up to lengthen the ice-season and make it more resistant against harsh weather conditions. The construction started in the second half of September and was completed in one and a half month.

History Founded in 1986, the club was a merger between Wandsworth F.C. and Norwood F.C. and was initially named Wandsworth & Norwood until 1990 when the club's name was changed to Croydon Athletic FC. Norwood FC had in the past played at Herne Hill Velodrome, with an annual friendly hosted against Dutch giants Ajax Amsterdam. Wandsworth FC was an old club which had spent most of its long history playing on Wandsworth Common. The merged club initially played in the London Spartan League, where they were promoted to the Premier Division in 1986–87. In 1988–89 they missed out on the Premier Division title on goal difference. In 1993–94 they finished as runners-up again and applied to join the Isthmian League but were rejected due to the state of their ground. The following year they finally won the league title but again were refused promotion. In 1996–97 they finished in third place and after extensive ground redevelopment were finally able to join the Isthmian League. In 2001–02 the team won the championship of the Isthmian League Division Three, scoring 138 goals in 42 games. Due to league reorganisation, this saw them placed in the new Division One South, where they remained until they won the title in 2009–10. Dover Athletic in 2008 The club was bought in 2008 by Mazhar Majeed, a UK-based property developer and agent for members of the Pakistan national cricket team. In 2010, following allegations that Majeed was involved in spot-fixing during the Pakistan cricket tour of England, Croydon Athletic were investigated by HM Revenues and Customs due to allegations that Majeed had been using the club for money-laundering purposes, after Majeed was recorded by an undercover journalist stating that that was the only reason he had bought the club. This led to the manager and his assistant leaving the club after a match on 4 September 2010. The following day the club announced on its website that upcoming league and cup games were being postponed, resulting in the team forfeiting an FA Cup match. Following these events squad members began to transfer to other teams, with the club's official website referring to an \\"exodus from the KT Stadium\\". On 2 October 2010 the club chairman, David Le Cluse, was found dead, with a bullet wound, having committed suicide in a garage in Sutton. The club received a £7,500 fine and a ten-point deduction after a case of financial irregularities was proven on 8 December 2011. The club had been charged with twenty-four breaches of FA Rule E1(b) in relation to the 2009/10 season. On 10 December the club was unable to fulfil a fixture away to Ramsgate and stated that it would be unable to fulfil the following weekend's fixture either. This was owing to the Keith Tuckey stadium being locked up, the management team resigning, and most players having found clubs elsewhere. On 16 December the Croydon Advertiser stated that the club was effectively no more Fans of the club formed AFC Croydon Athletic, which was accepted into the Combined Counties Football League Division One (Level 10, Step 6) for the 2012–13 season Stadium Croydon Athletic played at the Keith Tuckey Stadium in Thornton Heath. It is named after the Chairman of the club from its foundation in 1986 until his death in March 2006.

Pearman Bridge, known locally as the New Cooper River Bridge from the opening date to the groundbreaking of its replacement, was a cantilever bridge that crossed the Cooper River in Charleston, South Carolina, United States. It opened in 1966 to relieve traffic congestion on the companion John P. Grace Memorial Bridge. It was built by the South Carolina Department of Transportation and was designed by HNTB Corporation. Design At the time it opened, it consisted of two lanes to carry US 17 northbound traffic and one lane that was reversible. The two lanes of the Grace Bridge were then made to carry only southbound traffic. In this manner, the reversible lane could be used in the direction of heavy traffic in the mornings and evenings as Mount Pleasant was effectively a bedroom community at the time. History Once the Grace Bridge was posted with a load limit and could not carry large trucks, the reversible lane was made southbound permanently. This made sure that trucks had access across the Cooper River at all times. Unfortunately, this also meant that there was always oncoming traffic on the Pearman Bridge. Fatal head-on collisions on the Pearman Bridge led to a debate about constructing a barrier to separate traffic. The debate was resolved when the transportation department installed plastic delineators on the bridge during its final years. Demolition Both bridges were replaced by the Arthur Ravenel, Jr. Bridge in 2005. Demolition on the Pearman Bridge started on August 6, 2005. One of the piers was intentionally left standing as a sort of memorial to the bridge, and can be seen by motorists getting onto the new bridge from East Bay Street in Charleston.

However, a subsequent investigation into malpractice on the part of ITV in viewer voting revealed that while Danson and Tupele Dorgu were both put forward for elimination at the end of the first episode, it had in fact been Verity Rushworth and Leon Lopez who scored lowest in the poll and should therefore have been the two options. =Television appearances= Danson appeared on the first celebrity edition of Stars in Their Eyes.

It was released in 1981 by record label Park Avenue.  Content  The album marked a distinctive change in the band's sound. Compared to its predecessor, Is This Real?, which was composed mostly of raw, sleek and relatively traditional songs, Youth of America featured much longer and complex compositions; the title track alone clocks in at over 10 minutes. According to frontman Greg Sage, this change of pace was a deliberate counter-reaction against the trend of releasing short songs, which many punk bands did at the time. The Quietus noted the album's genre as post-punk and further described its style as \\"a six track set of lowly garage rock which traverses the cosmos irrespective. Secondly, it's a gothic downer but leavened by motion and momentum thanks to its krautrock influences. And lastly it's a grittily real punk record defined by an unerring air of unreality – as unromantic as it is fantastical\\". Rolling Stone has called the record \\"proto-grunge\\", and everyone from Melvins to Nirvana to Hole have also covered their work.https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/50-greatest-grunge- albums-798851/stooges-fun-house-1970-798900/  Release and reception  Released in 1981, Youth of America was, according to Sage, not well received in the United States at the time of its release, but fared better in Europe. In its retrospective review, Consequence of Sound wrote, \\"From its style of production and songwriting to its driving, angular guitar work coupled with anthemic hooks, Youth of America is as strong and fresh-sounding today as it was 30 years ago\\". The Quietus wrote \\"there may be more essential punk albums out there but never again did the genre sound so searching\\". Head Heritage called it \\"an enduring legacy of a recording.\\" Youth of America was later reissued on record labels Backbone and Restless, with different covers for each, and on Sage's own Zeno Records as the second disc of the Wipers Box Set, albeit with a different running order to the original vinyl issue.  Legacy  Along with other Wipers records, Youth of America has since come to be acknowledged as an important album in the development of American underground and independent rock movements of the early 1980s. Thurston Moore of Sonic Youth cited the album as an inspiration, and covered the track \\"Pushing the Extreme\\" with Keith Nealy for Wipers tribute album Fourteen Songs for Greg Sage and The Wipers. The title track was covered by the Melvins on their 2001 album Electroretard and Mission of Burma on the live album Snapshot. Kurt Cobain listed it in his top 50 albums of all time.

Paanchi (),churchofjesuschrist.org: \\"Book of Mormon Pronunciation Guide\\" (retrieved 2012-02-25), IPA-ified from «pā-ăn´kī» a person in the Book of Mormon (), was one of the sons of Pahoran who contended for the judgement-seat of the Nephite people. He was executed in about 50 BC for plotting to seize the judgement- seat by violent rebellion.  Possible origin of the name  Hugh Nibley relates the name to Egypt,Nibley, Hugh & Hummel, Sharman Bookwalter (ed.) Nibley's Commentary on the Book of Mormon, Vol. 1 (2013), ASIN: B00GFY0GUO and states: :\\"The first high priest [of the twenty-first dynasty in Egypt] was called Korihor, and his son was called Piankhi - two Book of Mormon names. They have the same relationship in the Book of Mormon. Paanchi is one of the high judges... Piankhi was a very famous name by the time Lehi left Jerusalem. It was a priestly name, and a royal name. Some people say it was Piankhi who founded the twenty-fifth dynasty [of Egypt]; some say it was Shabako.\\" Mormon scholars have speculated that the presence of the name \\"Paanchi\\" in the Book of Mormon indicates that claims of ancient Nubian influence in Pre-Columbian America (specifically, in the time of Nubian King Paanchi) and claims of the Book of Mormon to be an authentic record from ancient America are mutually supportive. If so, that would also mean that some of the Book of Mormon people had African roots. At least three different migrations from the Old World to the Americas are described in the Book of Mormon, and that would imply that there were others that were unknown to the Nephite writers.

In 2011–12 the club finished fifth, losing 5–3 on penalties to Bognor Regis Town in the play-off semi- finals following a 4–4 draw. They were transferred to Division One Central of the Southern League for the following season, and a third-place finish resulted in another play-off campaign, this time losing 2–1 to Biggleswade Town in the semi-finals. The club also won the Surrey Senior Cup for a second time, again beating Sutton United in the final. They were subsequently transferred to Division One South & West for the 2013–14 season, then back to Division One Central in 2014, before returning to Division One South of the Isthmian League for the 2016–17 season. After finishing bottom of the table, they were relegated to the Premier Division of the Combined Counties League. Ground Godalming initially played at the Recreation Ground, before moving to the Weycourt ground, taking over the tenancy from Farncombe. Improvement works at the site included moving the pitch to the site of a former rubbish tip. During the works, the club temporarily played at Broadwater Park. In 1985 the main stand from Addlestone & Weybridge Town's Liberty Lane ground was purchased for £225 after the club went bust.

It was the precursor to Project Grudge. History The project was established in 1948 by Air Force General Nathan Farragut Twining, head of the Air Technical Service Command, and was initially named Project SAUCER. The goal of the project was to collect, evaluate, and distribute within the government all information relating to UFO sightings, on the premise that they might represent a national security concern. At first the project hypothesized the sightings might be Soviet secret weapons. However, Project Sign's final report, published in early 1949, stated that while some UFOs appeared to represent actual aircraft, there was not enough data to determine their origin.Blum, Howard, Out There: The Government's Secret Quest for Extraterrestrials. Simon and Schuster, 1990 Almost all cases were explained by ordinary causes, but the report recommended a continuation of the investigation of all sightings. Project Sign was first described in the 1956 book The Report on Unidentified Flying Objects by retired Air Force Captain Edward J. Ruppelt who later directed Project Grudge and Project Blue Book. In this he also claimed that Sign had produced an \\"Estimate of the Situation\\" which endorsed an interplanetary explanation for UFOs, but General Hoyt Vandenberg, Chief of Staff of the Air Force, shut down Project Sign for lack of proof. No copy of this document or any other corroboration of Ruppelt's claim has been produced, and Popular Mechanics called the report \\"probably more mythological than real\\". Project Sign was followed by Project Grudge after a conclusion was reached that evaluations of UFOs were a necessity of military intelligence in a post-war climate.

The plateau overlaps the reservations of the Navajo and Hopi Tribes. Controversy arose from an unusually generous mineral lease agreement negotiated under questionable circumstances between the Tribes and Peabody Energy, the coal company's use and degradation of a potable source of water to transport coal via a pipeline from the mine to a power plant hundreds of miles away, and the public health and environmental impacts of strip mining on tribal lands. Controversy In 1964, Peabody Energy (then Peabody Western Coal), a publicly traded energy company based in the Midwestern United States, signed a contract with the Navajo Tribe and two years later with the Hopi Tribe, allowing the company mineral rights and use of an aquifer. The contract was negotiated by prominent natural resources attorney John Sterling Boyden, who claimed to be representing the Hopi Tribe while actually on the payroll of Peabody. It offered unusually advantageous terms for Peabody and was approved despite widespread opposition. The contract is also controversial because of misrepresentations made to the Hopi and Navajo tribes. Peabody Energy developed two coal strip mines on the Black Mesa reservation: the Black Mesa Mine and the Kayenta Mine. Peabody Energy pumps water from the underground Navajo Aquifer for washing coal, and, until 2005, in a slurry pipeline operation to transport extracted coal to the Mohave Generating Station in Laughlin, Nevada. With the pipeline operating, Peabody pumped, on average, 3 million gallons of water from the Navajo Aquifer every day. The aquifer is the main source of potable groundwater for the Navajo and Hopi tribes, who use the water for farming and livestock maintenance as well as drinking and other domestic uses. The tribes have alleged that the pumping of water by Peabody Energy has caused a severe decline in potable water and the number of springs. Both tribes, situated in an arid semi-desert, attach religious significance to water, considering it sacred, and have cultural, religious, and practical objections to over-use of water. Peabody's Black Mesa Mine used the slurry to pump its coal through pipes away, where the coal could be filtered and used in the Mohave Generating Station in Laughlin, Nevada (which was shut down in 2005). The generating station produces energy for the southern parts of Arizona, California and Nevada. This was the only coal slurry operation in the country and only plant that used groundwater in such a way. Coal from the Kayenta mine goes on a conveyor belt to a silo where it is then shipped by train to the Navajo Generating Station coal plant. The Black Mesa Mine's last day of operation was December 31, 2005. The Office of Surface Mining approved Peabody's permit request to continue operations at the mine on 22 December 2008. However, in January 2010, an administrative law judge, on appeal of that approval, decided that the Final EIS did not satisfy the National Environmental Policy Act because it did not take into account changed conditions, and vacated the approval.\\"Current Initiatives: Black Mesa Project\\" Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSMRE) websiteHolt, Robert G.

He greatly expanded the Kingdom through warfare and increased contact with the Portuguese Empire. He was an important Oba in both history of the Kingdom of Benin and retains importance in the folklore and celebrations of the region.  History  Oba Ozolua preparing for war. Museum of Black Civilisations, Dakar. Prince Okpame was the third son of Ewuare who had significantly expanded the Kingdom of Benin during his reign from 1440 until 1473. Following the death of Ewuare, his eldest surviving son, Esi, was assassinated by a poison arrow at his coronation and his second oldest son, Olua, ruled with significant domestic dissent for seven years. After a short-lived rule of the kingdom by a collection of chieftains, Prince Okpame was named the Oba (in either 1480 or 1483) and took the name Ozolua. His rule was defined largely by significant military expansion of the Kingdom of Benin. This included a successful attack against the Kingdom of Owo. While historical accounts of the battle differ, the end result left Owo with its independence while still requiring that it pay tribute to Benin. In diplomatic exchanges with the Portuguese, he claimed to have been victorious in over 200 battles. These victories earned him the title Ozolua n'Ibarmoi (or Ozolua the Conqueror) and in statues and artwork he is often displayed as a great warrior. Although limited trade and contact with the Portuguese had begun under his father Ewuare, the contact expanded significantly under Ozolua with Portuguese explorer John Alfonso d'Aveiro entering the capital Benin City in 1485 and accompanying Ozolua, although not participating, in war. Ozolua was intrigued by the possibilities of firearms for expansion of the kingdom but was informed by d'Aveiro that firearm trade was only possible with Christian allies of the Portuguese. As a result, Ozolua sent an ambassador to Portugal in the early 1500s to propose missionary activity in the kingdom and a royal conversion to Christianity in exchange for trade in firearms (at least one source indicates that he himself went to Portugal at some point). The Portuguese did not agree, but did send a group of missionaries to the kingdom in 1514. The missionararies soon left, as the kingdom was not interested in Christianity unless this was coupled to the facilitation of trade in firearms. Succession The end of Ozolua's reign is bound with a number of important folktales in the region. It is known that he had two sons, Esigie and Arualan and that at the end of his reign there was a war regarding royal succession between the two brothers and Esigie became the new Oba of the Benin Kingdom. One popular story holds that in his old age, Ozolua mistakenly named his son Arualan the ruler of Udo (a small village in the Kingdom) rather than the ruler of Edo (or Benin City, the capital of the Kingdom). Regardless, the confusion brings the two sons into warfare. According to the tale, Arualan brings together a substantial force and with significant confidence tells the people remaining in his city that if he fails to be victorious they should throw every possession of his into the nearby lake. As his army pushes to Benin City, the resident of the city and Esigie's army flee to avoid battle. Arualan returns disappointed that he did not have the chance at victory and the villagers seeing his dejected return assume the worst and throw his possessions into the lake, he follows his possessions never to be seen again. Although sources agree on the general date of the end of his reign at 1514, they disagree on the date of death. Hastings claims that he was deposed in 1514 and assassinated by military leaders when the promise of firearms did not materialize. Most other sources date his death from natural causes to 1520.

Publication history Llyra first appeared in Sub-Mariner #32 (December, 1970) and was created by Roy Thomas and Sal Buscema. Fictional character biography Llyra Morris was born in the Milolii Area on the big island of Hawaii. She is the daughter of Llyron, a member of the water-breathing Homo mermanus who dwell in Lemuria, and Rhonda Morris, a surface woman who inherited her father's oceanarium in Hawaii. Llyron was taken captive by men in the employ of Morris, who were looking for marine specimens to exhibit. Rhonda Morris fell in love with the seaman, and despite the fact that neither could live in the other's environment unaided for very long, they soon were married. Llyron decided not to return to Lemuria and helped his wife find exotic fish for her oceanarium. He perished a few months after they were wed, saving his wife from a shark. Morris bore a daughter she named Llyra. The infant was capable of breathing air as well as water, and would later demonstrate certain other mutant powers, notably the ability to alter the greenish coloration of her skin and hair to resemble her mother's. As Llyra grew into adolescence, she developed multiple identity disorder, and began to believe that when she changed her skin to pink, she was another person, her imaginary twin sister Laurie. Reaching adulthood, Llyra journeyed to her father's land of Lemuria, and through elaborate machinations and the use of her other mutant power to telepathically control marine animals, she usurped the throne from its benevolent ruler, King Karthon, becoming ruler of Lemuria. Several days after her coup, Prince Namor the Sub- Mariner of Atlantis, a friend of Karthon's, voyaged to Lemuria to seek an alliance against the surface people's ocean pollution. Finding Karthon in chains, Namor engaged Llyra in battle. Llyra dispatched some of the most formidable creatures of the deep at Namor, but Namor prevailed. Llyra was then caught in a rockslide caused by a sperm whale under her command and was severely injured, apparently killed. Karthon was freed and regained the throne.Sub-Mariner #32 Namor returned Llyra's body to her mother for burial, but Rhonda Morris discovered that her daughter was only in a coma. Using special technology acquired from an undisclosed source, Morris resuscitated Llyra. Llyra journeyed to Lemuria to recruit mercenaries to accompany her to Atlantis where she could wreak vengeance upon Namor. Llyra and her men kidnapped the Lady Dorma, Namor's bride-to-be, and brought her to the oceanarium owned by her mother. Llyra then used her chameleon powers to disguise herself as Dorma. As soon as the wedding ceremony was over, Llyra revealed herself, claiming that she was now Namor's wife, not Dorma.Sub- Mariner #36 However, according to Atlantean law, even though the real Dorma was not present, it was still Dorma who was now Namor's wife. When she learned her ploy failed, Llyra fled Atlantis. Namor tracked her to her mother's oceanarium. Witnessing his approach, Llyra smashed the water-filled cylinder holding Dorma, and by the time Namor reached her, Dorma had suffocated.Sub- Mariner #37 Llyra escaped and became a professional subversive, and soon allied herself with Namor's enemy, Tiger Shark, and his assistant Gerard Lymondo. The three of them awakened the ocean-dwelling creature Krago to vanquish Namor and kidnapped Namor's human father, Leonard McKenzie. In the course of battle with Namor, Tiger Shark split McKenzie's skull with a lead pipe, and he and Llyra fled.Sub-Mariner #46 Llyra abandoned the Shark to ally herself with Namor's cousin Byrrah. The two of them kidnapped Namor's kinsman Namorita to use as a hostage against Namor. In her scuffle with Namor, Llyra slipped into an oil spring on the ocean bottom and apparently drowned.Sub- Mariner #50 Llyra was also shown to have fatally poisoned Namora,Sub-Mariner #51 (though later it was revealed that Namora was still alive). In an as yet unrevealed manner, Llyra had survived the oil spring. After lying low for a time, Llyra freed the surface criminals, the Wizard, Sandman, and the Trapster from prison, to help her carry out her latest plot on Namor's life.Amazing Spider-Man #214 Llyra and these criminals formed the new Frightful Four and battled Namor and Spider-Man. Her plot, whereby Namor was supposed to be driven insane by the acquisition of Spider-Man's spider-sense, failed and Namor took Llyra back to Atlantis to stand trial.Amazing Spider-Man #215 Llyra was later broken out of prison by Ghaur, and became the high priestess of Set, playing a role in the events of Atlantis Attacks. She allied with the Deviant Lord Ghaur to bring about the reign of Set.Silver Surfer Annual #2 Llyra and Ghaur recruited Krang and Attuma for their scheme.Iron Man Annual #10 Llyra and Ghaur then reconstructed the Serpent Crown.Amazing Spider-Man Annual #23 Their attempted sacrifice of seven superhuman females was thwarted, and Llyra and Ghaur battled Namor, the Fantastic Four, and the Avengers. Llyra was teleported away, and the new Serpent Crown was buried in a sub-sea fissure.Fantastic Four Annual #22 She later reappeared, wishing to bear Namor's son as a plot to win the Atlantean throne. Unable to do so, she did the next best thing and slept with Leon McKenzie, the fully human grandson of Namor's father, Leonard McKenzie. Although neither McKenzie ever set on the throne of Atlantis, due to their bylaws the product of the union, the artificially aged Llyron, nevertheless was a legitimate heir and temporarily took the throne before Namor regained it. In the events during the Atlantis Rising storyline, Llyra was betrayed by her own son, Llyron, and left dead, chained within the walls of destroyed Atlantis. Prince Namor encountered her there, where she begged her to release him from the shackles. Instead, Prince Namor mercilessly left her to die. Llyra was seen in the \\"Marvel Tarot\\" mini- series, focusing on magic-related characters. Here she had been supplanted by her rival Nagala as high-priestess of Set, as well as transformed into a guardian sea-hag due to her god's displeasure. At the end Nagala likewise falls out of favor as she loses the Serpent Crown to intruding wizard Ian McNee, and the two fight over becoming Set's favored concubine. Powers and abilities Llyra is a member of the Lemurian branch of the Homo mermanus race whose shape-changing powers are a mutant ability. Like all Atlanteans and Lemurians, Llyra has a certain degree of superhuman strength and durability, and is able to withstand the ocean pressures. She can breathe underwater and withstand the extreme water pressure and freezing temperatures of the sea. She differs in her ability to alter her skin pigmentation to look like a human, Atlantean, or Lemurian. She also possesses a psionic control over certain orders of marine life, including gigantic sea monsters. As a servant of Set she may also possess certain skills as a mystic. Llyra temporarily possessed certain hypnotic powers conferred upon her by the Serpent God Set. Llyra wears a costume of bulletproof fabric. She carries various Atlantean and surface world armaments. She occasionally employs sub-sea crafts, and once used the Wizard's anti-gravity discs for flight.

When it reaches the more heavily built-up region further east, it bends to head due eastward, forming the county line. Near its eastern end at the Intracoastal Waterway, with Boca Raton to the north and Deerfield Beach to the south, it departs from its straight course to go around several curves, but the county boundary continues to follow it at this point. 10 miles of the canal is navigable, and it is popular for recreational boating and fishing.

So,Pakokku Fire brigade was established on 7 April 1931. When Myanmar(Burma) was independence in 1948,Pakokku Hill Tracts Districts was divided into two sections. Pakokku District, Gangaw District, Naga Self-Administered Zone and Chin State became a Parts of Myanmar(Burma) and Nagaland, Mizoram, Tripura, Manipur and Meghalaya became a parts of India. By 1947 Construction of the union of Burma,Pakokku province was established with two districts in 1948. They are Pakokku District and Kanpetlet District with 11 townships. Townships are Pakokku, Kanpetlet, Yesagyo, Pauk, Seikphyu, Myaing, Gangaw, Htilin, Saw, Mindat and Matupi.Pakokku was occupied by Communist rebels in 1949 and held until 1955, when it was liberated by government forces. In 1958,the name of Kanpetlet District was changed into Mindat District and Kanpetlet District’s Capital was moved to Mindat from Kanpetlet. Province’s Capital city was Pakokku. On 2 March 1962, the military led by General Ne Win took control of Burma through a coup d'état, and the government has been under direct or indirect control by the military. A new constitution of the Socialist Republic of the Union of Burma was adopted in 1974. By 1974 construction, Pakokku province was abolished and Pakokku District was added to the Magway Division and Mindat District was added to the Chin State until now. On 4 April 1996,Pakokku District was divided into two districts. Pakokku, Pauk, Yesagyo, Myaing and Seikphyu became Pakokku District and Gangaw, Saw and Htilin became Gangaw District. Pakokku Bridge construction was started on 15 December 2009 and ended on 31 December 2011. It was opened on 1 January 2012, and is the longest bridge in Myanmar.

Pakokku Bridge is part of the India–Myanmar–Thailand Trilateral Highway and is the longest bridge in Myanmar. thumb Economy Pakokku Industrial Zone The Largest Rice Market of Upper Myanmar Pakokku is the biggest rice market in Upper Myanmar due to the rice requirement of the region itself and being a door to Chin State which also needs rice. Of the incoming rice to Pakokku, 70% is from the Ayeyawady Region (Myaungmya, Hinthada and Myanaung) and 30% is from Shwebo and Ye-U of the Sagaing Region. Some 20% of rice coming into the market of Pakokku is consumed by Pakokku itself, and the remaining 80% is sent to other township markets. Most buyers are from Myaing, Yesagyo, Pauk, Kalaymyo and Chin State. In the Pakokku market, consumption is 15% for top class, 50% for middle class and 35% for lower class rice. There are about 5 large rice wholesalers and 10 small rice wholesalers. A large rice wholesaler sells 500 to 1,500 bags per day, so it can sell 180,000 to 200,000 bags (9,000-10,000 tons) a year. Due to the smooth transportation and the booming market, the rice price becomes very high. Thus, the rice market in Pakokku has increased to double that of the Mandalay market.

The arena opened in 2000 and holds 10,767, during hockey or handball matches and up to 14,000, during concerts. It is the biggest indoor-venue in the Hanover Region and most major concerts are held there. The arena is situated at the Expo Plaza in the Expo 2000 grounds, in the south of Hanover, astride the Kronsberg and Mittelfeld areas. Tenants It was primarily used for ice hockey and was the home arena of the Hannover Scorpions. After the Scorpions sold their DEL-License to the Schwenninger Wild Wings in 2013, the license agreement for the arena wasn't renewed and the Scorpions left the arena permanently. Since then no tenant is using the arena on a regular basis. The arena was used for the local derbies of the rival clubs Hannover Indians and Hannover Scorpions (now both playing in the third tier Oberliga-Nord) in 2013 and 2014 though. If these games are to be held there in the future is uncertain. The handball club TSV Hannover-Burgdorf is also using the arena for games with high attendances at irregular intervals, for example in 2011 against Eintracht Hildesheim and 2013 against Frisch Auf Göppingen. In the 2016–17 Handball-Bundesliga season, the club played five matches in the arena, before playing up to 13 of their 17 season home matches in the arena from the 2017–18 season onwards. The arena has been constantly struggling with financial problems since the day of opening and has been a money-losing business since then due to the lack of enough regular events. After the leaving of the only permanent tenant Hannover Scorpions in 2013, the situation became even more critical for the owner Günter Papenburg, who is also the owner of the Scorpions. He is still trying to attract more events there to minimize his financial loss. Events Janet Jackson was scheduled to perform during her All for You Tour on November 12, 2001, but the show was cancelled, due to the September 11 attacks. The Scorpions performed a Classic-Concert with the Berlin Philharmonic on June 1, 2000, at the arena and during her Get Your Sting and Blackout World Tour on June 1, 2010, a Rockshow. In the arena, there is a Scorpions-Lounge with a variety of devotional of the band. Roger Waters played the venue during his \\"In The Flesh\\" World Tour on May 22, 2002. On 5 May 2003, Irish vocal pop band Westlife held a concert for their Unbreakable Tour supporting their album Unbreakable – The Greatest Hits Volume 1. Tina Turner performed there during her Tina!: 50th Anniversary Tour on 4 February 2009. The Backstreet Boys performed there during their 2014 In a World Like This Tour. Depeche Mode performed at the stadium on November 3, 2009, during their Tour of the Universe. On February 14, 2013, the German national final for the Eurovision Song Contest, Unser Song für Malmö, took place there.

The city is situated between the Kahayan and the Sabangau rivers on the island of Borneo. The closest airport serving the city is Tjilik Riwut. The city had a population of 220,962 inhabitants at the 2010 censusBiro Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2011. (compared with 158,770 at the previous census in 2000), with an average population density of 92.1 per km² (Indonesian Population Census 2010 results). The latest official estimate (as at January 2014) is 236,601. The city was established in 1957 (Emergency Law 10/1957 on the establishment of the Autonomous Region Central Kalimantan Level I) on wilderness that opened through the Pahandut village alongside Kahayan river banks. Palangka Raya is the largest city by land area in Indonesia.http://politik.news.viva.co.id/news/read/167865-mengapa- palangkaraya-paling-pas-jadi-ibukota Most of the area is still forested, including protected forests, nature conservation areas, and Tangkiling Forest. The city was the favorite candidate to become the new Indonesian capital until the 2019 announcement that the new capital will be in North Penajam Paser Regency and Kutai Kartanegara Regency, both in East Kalimantan.  History  The left Kalimantan Tengah (Central Kalimantan) province was established on 23 May 1957. The first Indonesian president, Sukarno, initiated construction of the city of Palangka Raya, the capital of the new province. Initially, it was planned as the new capital of Indonesia to replace Jakarta. In 1957, when President Sukarno inaugurated a monument in the place that was then still called Pahandut, he expressed his desire to make the city the new republic’s future capital.Nasrudin Ansori, \\"Cruising the Dream Capital\\", Garuda Magazine, September 2010 It was never carried through, although it has been mooted various other times - most recently in 2019 by Joko Widodo wanting to move the capital out of Java, with Palangka Raya again rumoured to be a favourite. The first pillar of Palangka Raya City development was done by the President of the Republic of Indonesia at the time, Sukarno on 17 July 1957 marked the inauguration of the monument to the provincial capital of Central Kalimantan in Pahandut. Then, based on Law No. 21 of 1958, Pahandut was renamed to Palangka Raya City, maintaining its status as the provincial seat. Etymology Palangka Raya consists of a combination of two words which are from the Dayak Ngaju Language and Sanskrit. Palangka (Ngaju) means a sacred site and raya (Sanskrit) means vast, thus Palangka Raya means a vast sacred site. Administrative districts Prior to decentralization in 2001, Palangka Raya had two administrative districts, namely Pahandut and Bukit Batu. Now, Palangka Raya consists of five administrative districts: Pahandut, Jekan Raya, Bukit Batu, Sebangau, and Rakumpit. left Transport The city is served by Tjilik Riwut Airport.

The genus used to include diverse groups comprising saprobes and parasites of higher plants, insects, nematodes, mollusc eggs, and other fungi, thus the genus used to have a wide- ranging group of taxa characterised by simple but ill-defined characters. The genus, currently thought to contain 51 species, may be broadly divided into three ecologically based groups - mycopathogens, entomopathogens, and plant pathogens and related saprotrophs. However, the genus has undergone recent revision into which most entomopathogenic and mycopathogenic isolates fall into a new group called Lecanicillium. At least five species are known to cause a wilt disease in plants called verticillium wilt: V. dahliae, V. longisporum, V. albo-atrum, V. nubilum, and V. tricorpus. A sixth species, V. theobromae, causes fruit or crown rot, a non-wiliting disease. __TOC__  Verticillium wilt Verticillium wilt is a disease that can affect over 400 different eudicot plants, many of which are economically important worldwide. Several characteristics of Verticillium make it difficult to manage: prolonged survival in soils without the presence of a host, inaccessibility during infection, a wide host range, and limited resistance in host germplasm. However, all monocots, gymnosperms and ferns are immune. The fungus survives in the soil principally in the form of microsclerotia, invades the plant through the root system, colonizes the vasculature, and eventually leads to plant death. The main mechanisms of its pathogenesis are xylem vessel blockage and toxin production. When the fungus propagates within a host plant, the mycelium blocks the xylem vessels, impairing the transport of water and nutrients in the host. The forces of transpiration and respiration in leaves combined with blocked xylem transport cause water imbalances in leaves that result in leaf yellowing and wilting, contributing to plant death. In addition, Verticillium produces mycotoxins within the plant that can cause necrosis in leaves and impair metabolism in the plant body. In some systems, toxin production has been shown to be the main cause of plant wilting. First identified from potatoes in Germany in 1870, this disease affects a variety of cultivated plants and can persist as a saprotrophic soil organism for more than 15 years. Identification can be made by looking for one-celled conidia, hyaline round to ellipsoid which are formed at the tips of whorled branches. They are easily separated from the tips. When infecting ornamental trees such as maples, elms, aspen, ash, beech, catalpa, oak, and others, the first symptoms are midsummer wilting on one side of a tree or branch. The sapwood has greenish or brownish streaks, and the infection can take a few years to progress to the rest of the tree or move rapidly. The fungi universally move up the xylem vessels. In fruit trees, the infection is known as black heart, and is common in apricots and sometimes affects almond, peach, plum, and avocado trees. This fungus affects herbaceous ornamentals such as chrysanthemums, mints, Lychnis spp. It infects many agriculturally important crops like vegetables such as tomatoes, eggplants, okra, broccoli, cauliflower and rhubarb; food related crops like rapeseed and hops; and fiber crops like cotton.

She first appeared when Marvel was known as Timely Comics. A native of the undersea kingdom of Atlantis, the character was Namor the Sub- Mariner's cousin and his close confidant in many of his original appearances in the 1940s, and was reintroduced in the late 1960s and early 1970s as his lover and wife-to-be, before her death. Publication history Dorma first appeared in Marvel Comics #1, the first comic book by Timely Comics, predecessor of Marvel. Her first Silver Age appearance is in Fantastic Four Annual #1. Lady Dorma was the beloved of Namor, Prince of Atlantis. In Sub- Mariner #36 (April 1971), Namor married Dorma — and discovered that the woman that he married was actually his disguised enemy Llyra, who murdered the real Dorma by bringing the water-breathing bride to the surface and causing her to suffocate in the open air. Writer Roy Thomas said that he decided to do away with Lady Dorma because \\"he felt that Sub-Mariner should be a lone wolf, and he didn't like the idea of his having such a stable home, a Lois Lane situation\\". Fictional character biography Dorma, an Atlantean aristocrat, was a close friend of Namor during their childhood. She fell in love with him when they grew up, but Namor fell for the surface-worlder Betty Dean, a policewoman. When Namor's enemy Paul Destine, empowered by Serpent Crown, destroyed Atlantis and left Namor an amnesiac vagrant, Dorma and the other Atlanteans became nomads. Dorma believed that Destine had killed Namor and was heartbroken. Many years later, the Fantastic Four's Human Torch restored Namor's memory and Namor returned to Atlantis. Seeing Atlantis in ruins, he attacked the surface world, but fell in love with Susan Storm, the Invisible Girl. With the help of the Fantastic Four, Namor found the surviving Atlanteans and they returned to Atlantis. Dorma was engaged to the Warlord Krang, but left him for Namor. When she found out that Namor was in love with Susan Storm, she tried to kill her and very nearly succeeded. Sue was a prisoner and her arms were tied behind her back. Lady Dorma broke the glass wall of Atlantis saying, \\"let us see if the surface girl can breathe water\\".Fantastic Four Annual #1 Sue decided to make a futile attempt to reach the surface, but with her arms tied behind her back, the blonde girl could barely swim at all and got helplessly caught in deadly kelp at the bottom of the sea. With her air running out, Namor found her, saved her and took her to a hospital. His actions alienated Dorma and the other Atlanteans who saw the surface-worlders as enemies and they abandoned Namor. Namor would later return to the throne of Atlantis. Krang became an enemy of Namor and tried to kill Namor and take the throne himself, but Dorma aided Namor in defeating Krang. Namor and Dorma became lovers and she became one of his most trusted advisors and allies. Dorma was engaged to be married to the Sub-Mariner when she was kidnapped by Llyra, who assumed her identity and tricked Namor into marrying her instead, but according to Atlantean law, Dorma was now Namor's wife, not Llyra, despite her absence from the wedding ceremony. Furious, Llyra fled to the surface world, followed by an equally enraged Namor. Llyra returned to the imprisoned Dorma and smashed Dorma's water-filled prison. Unable to breathe out of water, Dorma suffocated, but not before she struck down Llyra and saved her husband's life.Sub-Mariner #37 (May, 1971) Other versionsHeroes Reborn= On a duplicate Earth that was the setting of the Heroes Reborn story arc, a counterpart of Dorma existed and was Queen of the Atlanteans.

She comes to the Fantastic Four for help when Attuma attacks Pacifica. * Lady Dorma appeared in the 1994 Fantastic Four episode \\"Now Comes the Sub-Mariner\\", voiced by Jane Carr. Here she is portrayed as Namor's prospect girlfriend who is also pursued by his advisor Krang.

It was discovered on 31 May 1929, by German astronomer Karl Reinmuth at the Heidelberg-Königstuhl State Observatory near Heidelberg, Germany. The asteroid was named after Demeter, the Greek goddess of fruitful soil and agriculture. It has a rotation period of 9.846 hours.  Orbit and classification  Demeter is a non-family asteroid of the main belt's background population when applying the hierarchical clustering method to its proper orbital elements. Based on osculating Keplerian orbital elements, it has also been classified as a member of the Phocaea family (), a large family of stony asteroids, different to Demeter spectral type (see below). It orbits the Sun in the inner main-belt at a distance of 1.8–3.1 AU once every 3 years and 9 months (1,381 days; semi- major axis of 2.43 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.26 and an inclination of 25° with respect to the ecliptic. The asteroid was first observed at the Italian Observatory of Turin, three days prior to its official discovery observation at Heidelberg. The body's observation arc begins at Yerkes Observatory in December 1930.  Physical characteristics  In the Tholen classification, Demeter spectral type is ambiguous, closest to a carbonaceous C-type and somewhat similar to an X-type asteroid. = Rotation period = In June 2016, a rotational lightcurve of Demeter was obtained from photometric observations by American astronomers Tom Polakis and Brian Skiff at the Command Module Observatory in Tempe, Arizona. Lightcurve analysis gave a rotation period of 9.846 hours with an amplitude of 0.12 magnitude (). Observations by the Spanish OBAS group, also taken during the 2016-opposition, gave a concurring period of 9.870 hours and a brightness variation of 0.11 magnitude (). The results supersede previous observations by Robert Stephens, Olivier Thizy, René Roy and Stéphane Charbonnel from July 2001, which gave a period of 9.70 and 9.701 hours with an amplitude of 0.12 and 0.14 magnitude, respectively. = Diameter and albedo = According to the surveys carried out by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite IRAS, the Japanese Akari satellite and the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, Demeter measures between 25.285 and 31.33 kilometers in diameter and its surface has a low albedo between 0.0229 and 0.05. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link adopts the results obtained by IRAS, that is, an albedo of 0.0464 and a diameter of 25.61 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 11.91.  Naming  This minor planet was named from Greek mythology after Demeter, the goddess of fruitful soil and agriculture. The official naming citation was mentioned in The Names of the Minor Planets by Paul Herget in 1955 (). = Conflict with Ceres = Demeter is the Greek equivalent of the Roman goddess Ceres. When main-belt asteroid and dwarf planet 1 Ceres was named, the Greeks called it \\"Demeter\\" effectively translating the name into Greek, rather than using the Latin Ceres or the original Italian Cerere. However, this created a problem when asteroid Demeter was named. The Greeks resolved this by using the classical form of the name, Δημήτηρ Dēmêtēr, for the new asteroid, distinguishing it from the Modern Greek form Δήμητρα Dêmētra that had been used for 1 Ceres. This conflict did not occur in Greek-influenced Slavic languages such as Russian, which had adopted Cerera for 1 Ceres, and were thus free to use the modern Greek form Demetra for the asteroid Demeter.

Shohreh Aghdashloo portrayed the role in X-Men: The Last Stand. Publication history Dr. Kavita Rao first appeared and featured prominently in the first story arc of the monthly series Astonishing X-Men Vol. 3 #1 in 2004 and was created by Joss Whedon and John Cassaday. Fictional character biographyHope= Dr. Kavita Rao is a world-renowned geneticist from India who developed a serum (later called \\"Hope\\") which could \\"cure\\" mutants, turning them into normal humans. She explains that she regards the mutant gene as a 'corruption' of healthy tissue, and justifies her research by looking at mutants who committed suicide or hurt others because of their powers, such as a female mutant with a butterfly-like appearance or Tildie Soames (a child whose nightmares can manifest into monsters). Hundreds of mutants immediately signed up for the procedure at Benetech (the corporate backer of her research). The X-Men debated the merits of the cure and the significance of labelling the mutant condition a disease. The chance at shedding his \\"beastly\\" appearance and avoiding any further secondary mutations held significant appeal for Hank McCoy (aka Beast) and he considered taking the serum for a time, although Wolverine objected by saying that an X-Man taking the serum would be the equivalent of admitting that there was something to 'cure' in the first place. It was later revealed that Rao had been working for the alien Ord of the Breakworld, who also had in his custody Colossus (who was, at that time, thought to be dead, but had been resurrected by Ord's technology). The X-Men defeated Ord and Benetech, and Ord was delivered into the hands of S.H.I.E.L.D.. Dr. Rao's work was destroyed by Wolverine, leaving Hank with the last sample of \\"Hope\\", although he remains uncertain whether or not he will use it at some point. = Endangered Species = Kavita Rao was pictured alongside several super-villains to whom Beast offers to 'sell his soul' for a means to un-do the effects of M-Day. With her old research into 'curing' the mutant gene now irrelevant after so many mutants lost their powers, she agrees to aid Beast in his quest and is now looking for more info that might help him. =X-Club= After Beast has finished gathering his science squad, they head back to base where he introduces them to their final member, Kavita Rao. Together they hold a meeting where he explains everything about how the Decimation occurred.Uncanny X-Men #508 When Beast proposes they go back in time to obtain the DNA sample of the parents of a mutant, Kavita questions why they must all go when Beast says it's one of the perks of the job. She travels back with the rest of the X-Club and Psylocke to the year 1906. There she helps look over Catherine Bradley after injuring herself during the Hellfire Club's assassination attempt.Uncanny X-Men #512 During the events of Utopia, she helps raise Asteroid M from the bottom of the oceanDark Avengers #8 and attends the funeral of Dr. Yuriko Takiguchi when he passes away.Uncanny X-Men #515 In the aftermath of Utopia, Karma and Magik are requested to see Kavita Rao to inform her of their foray into Legion's mind. When Kavita mistakes Marci, a young girl who was absorbed into Legion's mind, for one of his personalities, Karma corrects her and reveals that Marci was a real person but that Legion revealed Marci doesn't have a body to return to and explains how his powers work.New Mutants Vol. 3 #5 =Second Coming= When Cable and Hope Summers return to the present, Bastion begins to set his plan in motion in exterminating the mutant race. Thanks to the New Mutants, they discover he has erected towers in certain points around San Francisco.

Hank reveals that Hope Summers powers grew out of control and he needs Kavita to recreate her Hope serum to stop her from creating the future they see before them. After some convincing, Kavita reveals she kept an encrypted copy of the formula on her Mala bracelet and they go to Utopia to take out Hope. Arriving on Utopia it is revealed that the dystopian future is a lie created by Graydon Creed using holographic hard-light technology. Kavita revealing she knew of the deception, didn't recreate the Hope serum but instead an unstable pyrovirus instead which causes the oil platform to explode.

The dental key is an instrument that was used in dentistry to extract diseased teeth. Before the era of antibiotics, dental extraction was often the method of choice to treat dental infections, and extraction instruments date back several centuries. History The dental key, (also known as Clef de Garengeot, Fothergill-Key, English-Key, Dimppel Extractor or Tooth Key) was first mentioned in Alexander Monro's Medical Essays and Observations in 1742, but had probably been in use since around 1730. It remained popular into the 20th century when it was replaced by the more modern forceps. Design and use Modeled after a door key, the dental key was used by first inserting the instrument horizontally into the mouth, then its \\"claw\\" would be tightened over a tooth. The instrument was rotated to loosen the tooth. This often resulted in the tooth breaking, causing jaw fractures and soft tissue damage. The design of the dental key evolved over the years. The original design featured a straight shaft, which caused it to exert pressure on the tooth next to the one being extracted. This led to a newer design in 1765 by F. J. Leber where the shaft was slightly bent. In 1796 the claw was fixed via a swivel enabling it to be set in various positions by a spring-catch. Newer designs, such as those manufactured by medical instrument maker Charriere featured interchangeable claws. By the end of the 19th century, the introduction of forceps made popular notably by Sir John Tomes, rendered the tooth key mostly obsolete. However, a modern version of the dental key, the Dimppel Extractor, briefly revitalized its use later in the 20th century.

It was formerly known for the Rossitten Bird Observatory and the Rossitten gliding school. Geography Rybachy is the largest settlement on the Russian side of the Curonian Spit between the Curonian Lagoon and the Baltic Sea, close to the border with Lithuania. It is the administrative seat of the Kurschskaja Kossa (Curonian Spit) municipality. As of 2010 it has about 839 residents. History A Teutonic Ordensburg on the road from Königsberg to Memel was first mentioned in 1372. It had been the site of a Curonian fishing village, named after Old Prussian rosit (\\"dew\\", cf. ). Constantly threatened by coastal dunes the settlement had to be relocated several times until their migration was stopped by large-scale afforestation in the 19th century. Rossitten pier, 1930s/40s The Curonian Spit became part of the Duchy of Prussia in 1525 and since 1871 belonged to Germany until the end of World War II. In the 1920s, the dunes near the village with their updraft was a popular venue for glider pilots like Julius Hatry. In 1924 the local gliding school became part of the Rhön-Rossitten Gesellschaft, predecessor of the Deutsche Forschungsanstalt für Segelflug (German Research Institute for Sailplane Flight). The area was also known as an elk habitat. In the 1930s it developed to a resort town. It was transferred, along with the rest of northern East Prussia, to the Soviet Union in the aftermath of the war. Rybachy translates as \\"Fishers' (settlement)\\", and appropriately employment centers on the fishing boats which dock at the pier on the Curonian Lagoon . The former Rossitten Bird Observatory (1901-1944) is today the site of the Rybachy Biological Station, founded in 1956 by Lev Belopolsky, which continues research on bird migration. In 2006, Rybachy's classification was downgraded from an urban-type settlement to a rural settlement.  Politics  Sister cities = * Brachttal, Germany – since March 2015 Sights Fraktur: \\"(to) the former inhabitants of Rossitten\\" =Church= The red brick former Lutheran church was built in 1873 when the village was still part of Germany. It is one of the oldest remaining buildings in Rybachy. After the Second World War it was used for wheat storage. Only in 1992 was the church handed to the Russian Orthodox Church to be renovated. It is named after St Sergey of Radonezh and is in use once more as a church, now catering to the Orthodox community. In front of the church is a metal cross cast in 1992 by Eduardas Jonusas, an artist from the neighbouring Lithuanian town of Nida. This cross was erected in memory of the former German citizens of Rossitten. =Old cemetery= Amidst the forest about 500 m south of the village you can find the old cemetery which has existed since the Middle Ages. The Second World War left it heavily damaged and it was not properly looked after for a long time. Some restoration work has been carried and it is possible to visit the newly restored gravestones of two famous locals: Johannes Thienemann (1863-1938), the German ornithologist who founded the Rossitten Bird Observatory; and Franz Epha, the legendary dune inspector who was able to stop the huge sand dunes from moving by stabilising them with plants. His pioneering work saved many villages from being buried under the shifting sands.

Because he was the fourth son, after the infantes John, Luís, and Ferdinand, he was assigned by his father to religious life, and he accumulated numerous ecclesiastical benefits even though he did not have the canonical age required to exercise these dignities. He was successively bishop of Guarda, cardinal, bishop of Viseu, bishop of Évora and finally archbishop of Lisbon. Life Afonso was born in Évora on 23 April 1509. He was educated at the Portuguese court; he studied humanities, Greek and Latin directed by two masters Aires de Figueiredo Barbosa and André de Resende. At only three years of age, in 1512, his father Manuel I tried to make him a cardinal; Pope Julius II refused because it was not in accordance with canonical laws, according to which one could not be created a cardinal under 30 years of age. He succeeded in having the pope appoint the young infante as apostolic protonotary in the kingdom of Portugal. Manuel also succeeded in elevating him to bishop of Guarda, at only seven years of age, on September 9, 1516; he obtained papal dispensation for the exercise of the office because he did not yet have the canonical age for the prelature. Even if he did not carry out any pastoral work, he received the income of the bishopric. Cardinal After the embassy led by Tristão da Cunha which Manuel I sent to Pope Leo X in 1514, and which left the Roman Curia very impressed, the Portuguese king again proposed his son for the cardinalship. The pope finally agreed to the request of the Portuguese monarch and created a cardinal Alfonso on July 1, 1517, with the title of cardinal-deacon of Santa Lucia in Septisolio. The title was granted on the condition that the cardinal's chapel would not be given to the young infante until the age of eighteen; however, in Portugal he was always treated and revered as a cardinal, before his title had been made official. Meanwhile Alfonso was appointed by the monarch as abbot of Alcobaça, and abbot commendatory of the Monastery of Santa Cruz de Coimbra and of the Convent of San Juan de Tarouca. Archbishop On February 23, 1519, he resigned from the seat of Guarda and on the same day was transferred to the diocese of Viseu, again with a dispensation because he was not yet of canonical age. On February 20, 1523, at the age of just fourteen, due to the death of Archbishop Martinho da Costa, he was promoted to Archbishop of Lisbon by Pope Adrian VI thanks to the supplications of John III, his brother; in the same way, he was offered the government of the bishopric of Évora (in a seat vacant since the previous year). Once again he was granted a special dispensation for not having the canonical age to preside over a diocese. He appointed as his vicar in the Lisbon archdiocese the dean of the cathedral, Fernão Gonçalves, who conducted pastoral affairs during his minority. He established his habitual residence in the city of Évora, just as his younger brother, also dedicated to the ecclesiastical career, the cardinal-infante Don Enrique, would later do. He died on 21 April 1540, in Lisbon and was buried in Lisbon Cathedral before he was moved to the Jerónimos Monastery.

It takes place in a training camp for soldiers to be sent to the Vietnam War. Tigerland was the name of a U.S. Army training camp during the mid-1960s to early 1970s located at Fort Polk, Louisiana as part of the U.S. Army Advanced Infantry Training Center. As often the last stop for new infantrymen on their way to Vietnam, Tigerland was established in humid and muggy Fort Polk in order to closely mimic the environmental conditions of South Vietnam. While the film's setting is loosely based on Fort Polk, the film was actually filmed at Camp Blanding in Florida. The film premiered at the 2000 Toronto International Film Festival. Plot In September 1971, the US is losing the Vietnam War. Roland Bozz, a draftee opposed to the war, is an unruly soldier with no respect for authority. He befriends another Army recruit, Jim Paxton, an aspiring writer who records his experiences in a journal. Unlike Bozz, Paxton volunteered. Upon reaching their post, company commanding officer Captain Saunders makes clear that every soldier who passes through Fort Polk will be sent to Vietnam. He also states that any political views on the war are irrelevant. Having \\"X-ray vision for loopholes\\", Bozz finds ways for soldiers to get out of the army — one because he not only has children but also a handicapped wife; another, Miter, had joined to prove his manhood but finds himself in over his head. Eventually Bozz's natural leadership and ability earn him the title of squad leader. Another private, Wilson, a racial bigot and instigator, continuously demeans Miter and Bozz. Bozz fights Wilson, earning Wilson's hatred. Later, while doing live fire exercises, Wilson threatens Bozz with a pistol. Bozz tries to disarm Wilson, and the two wrestle each other to the ground, Wilson getting the upper hand and putting the gun to the back of Bozz's head and pulling the trigger. Miraculously, the gun misfires, saving Bozz's life. Saunders lets Bozz choose the punishment: have Wilson court-martialed or \\"let me deal with him\\", strongly suggesting the latter. Bozz says he wants Wilson \\"out of the Army\\", because he recognizes Wilson has taken an emotional beating ever since his inability to command became obvious. The platoon is sent to \\"Tigerland\\", a forested training area designed as a replica of Vietnam. During an exercise, Bozz's squad acts as villagers in a mock Vietnamese village, with one squad member designated as a Viet Cong sympathizer. They compete with another squad charged with rooting out the sympathizer. This other squad is led by Wilson, who was not kicked out after all. As the exercise ends with Bozz's squad \\"winning\\", Wilson tells Bozz he will kill him no matter what it takes. Soon thereafter, Bozz plans to escape to Mexico with the aid of some civilians he has paid. Platoon member Johnson tells him if he runs away, Wilson will kill Paxton instead. Bozz remains. During the last training exercise, the two squads are pitted against each other on patrolling missions. As Wilson's squad prepares for an attack, he replaces his blank cartridges with live ammunition and removes his blank-firing adaptor. As Bozz's squad nears, he opens fire. Though he does not hit anyone, it is obvious he is using live ammunition, and the trainer for the exercise tries to intervene. As he does, Bozz is standing above Paxton and deliberately fires a blank round with his rifle muzzle near Paxton's face, the flash wounding Paxton's eye. The trainer aims a pistol at Wilson's head to get him to hold his weapon up and surrender, telling him he will be court-martialed. The platoon gets ready to head to Vietnam, except for Paxton, whose eye injury, though not permanent, has earned him a medical discharge. Bozz and Paxton exchange farewells. Paxton tells Bozz he is going to write about him, but Bozz says he will not. He has stolen Paxton's journal and rips out pages as the platoon's bus drives off, leaving Paxton scrambling to recover them. Bozz tosses the journal as the bus speeds away. In the closing narration, Paxton says he never saw Bozz again. Over time, he heard from various sources that Bozz either died in Vietnam or disappeared over there. One acquaintance told Paxton he thought he'd seen Bozz, years after the war, in Mexico with a beautiful woman.

He was drafted by the Jacksonville Jaguars in the first round of the 2000 NFL Draft, but only played one season after multiple suspensions derailed his career. He was indefinitely suspended by the NFL in 2002. College career Soward burst onto the college football scene with a 4-touchdown game vs. UCLA in his freshman season with USC.Paul Oberjuerge, Redemption song , San Bernardino County Sun, July 18, 2007. Professional careerJacksonville Jaguars= The Jacksonville Jaguars took Soward with their first-round selection (29th overall) in the 2000 NFL Draft. He did not take the pressure of being a first-round selection very well. \\"I think the hardest part for me was dealing with all the pressure after getting drafted,\\" he recalls. \\"I didn’t play well my first year so people were on me a lot. I wish I would have went to New Orleans in the second round. I wish I hadn’t ever been a first round draft pick. I felt that New Orleans had a better staff to suit me at that time. I think being with those guys would have changed my future in the NFL.\\" He signed a five-year contract with the team for $5.5 million on July 14, 2000. After wearing out his welcome with the Jaguars in training camp, before playing in his first game under head coach Tom Coughlin (who had gone so far as to send a limousine, at the team's expense, to pick up Soward every day for practice, just to make sure he would come), he was suspended several times by the NFL for violating the league's substance abuse policy. He was ruled inactive for the team's first game in 2000, but played in the next 12 games. He was ruled inactive for the team's week 15 game against the Arizona Cardinals for violating a team rule. He returned to play in week 16, until he was placed on the team's non-football illness list on December 21, 2000, ending his season. On June 9, 2001, he was suspended for the first four games of the 2001 season for violating the league's substance abuse policy. He was suspended an additional six games on October 11 for violating the policy a second time. On December 3, 2001, he was activated from the suspended list, but was inactive for the week 12 game. The Jaguars suspended him for one game on December 8 for violating team rules. He was suspended indefinitely by the team on December 11, 2001, but had to be reactivated for the season-finale against the Chicago Bears per league rules that state a team can only suspend a player for four games at a time. He was inactive for the game. He was suspended by the NFL for the entire 2002 season on January 10, 2002, for violating the league's substance abuse policy again. The Florida Times-Union reported that Soward remained on the Jaguars' roster through the 2002 season for salary cap purposes. He did not file for reinstatement after his last suspension. Though many media outlets attributed the suspension to marijuana, his suspension came as a result of alcohol abuse. \\"I can honestly say I was an alcoholic at that time in my life,\\" Soward recollects. \\"That's why I'm not playing in the NFL, because I was an alcoholic at that time.\\" After entering the NFL's substance abuse program, Soward was critical about its effectiveness. \\"It was horrible counseling. I’ve been in every rehab centre known to man,\\" said Soward. \\"They even had the nerve to put me in rehab in Miami, the drug capital of the world. I don’t really think the rehabilitation process is very good for players down there. I think it is more of a disciplinary kind of rehabilitation which doesn’t teach anybody anything. For me, the more they took away from me the more it made me want to drink, the more it made me want to feel depressed, the more it made me want to feel bad about me.\\" Soward ended his lone season in the NFL appearing in 13 games, and caught 14 passes for 154 yards with one touchdown. =Toronto Argonauts= On May 18, 2004, the Toronto Argonauts signed Soward to a contract while he was still under contract with the Jaguars. As an Argonaut, his primary role in the offense was as a fly route receiver that stretched the defense and whose long receptions usually translated into touchdowns. In his first year with the team, Soward went on to win a Grey Cup Championship. In 2005, Soward and the Argonauts were unable to repeat as back-to-back champions, losing the Eastern Division Championship to the Montreal Alouettes. In that game, Soward was dubiously remembered for an overzealous touchdown celebration. After scoring a touchdown, he ran into a concession stand setup behind the end zone, grabbed a bag of popcorn, and shared it with a teammate and nearby fans. Though his touchdown helped to put his team up 14-0 after the first quarter, the Argos got outscored 33-3 for the next three quarters. That led many to believe that Soward's timing for his celebration stunt was not only premature, but a catalyst that fired up the Alouettes. \\"It was a very spontaneous thing and I apologize to the people of Toronto if they feel I took away our opportunity, but I was just making an atmosphere where people can enjoy the game and see something different.\\" In 2006, when asked about the popcorn incident prior to a rematch against the Alouettes, Soward stated that he felt the criticism against him was unjust and that he would do it again if the opportunity presented itself. He told Los Angeles radio station KLAC that he got the popcorn idea from seeing Keyshawn Johnson do it after scoring a touchdown when he was playing football for West Los Angeles College. During the East Division semi-final that year, Soward caught the game-winning touchdown to help the Argonauts advance to the division finals which they went on to lose vs. the Alouettes in Montreal. On December 15, 2006, Soward was released by the Argonauts. Since then he has been making a living in repairing televisions and working in a warehouse. =Ontario Warriors= For the 2012 season, Soward signed to play with the Ontario Warriors.

History ;Self-titled EP (2001) After recording their first EP Self-titled, the band was scooped up by Philadelphia Indie Label Universal Warning Records in 2001. The contract put them in touch with nationally spread label mates which opened up to several national tours.

During their 2003 recording sessions, the band worked closely with long-time friend and Grammy Award Winning engineer, Ivan Klisanin. The album includes piano interlude and layered vocals. Throughout the years, the rhythm section was changed many times due originally to the vocationally related departure of bassist Nathan Carnes and soon following, Drummer Dan Robertson.

History Mini Keg of Bitburger Pilsner A Bitburger Pilsner A glass of Bitburger. Johann Peter Wallenborn (1784-1839) founded the brewery in Bitburg in 1817 at the age of 33. His father owned a brewery in Kyllburg. Three years after Wallenborn's death in 1839, Ludwig Bertrand Simon (1813-1869) married Wallenborn's daughter Elisabeth (1819-1891) and became owner of the brewery, naming it Simonbräu. Their son, Theobald Simon (1847-1924), took over the brewery in 1876 at the age of 29. Advertising The company slogan is, \\"Bitte ein Bit.\\" This is literally, \\"Please, a Bit,\\" or \\"A Bit, please.\\" In the 1970s, a second slogan was introduced, \\"Abends Bit, morgens fit\\" (\\"Bit in the evening, fit in the morning\\") implying that the consumption wouldn't lead to a hangover. During that time either of the slogans could be found on Bitburger glasses. The brand sponsored the German Football Association from 1992 until 2018.

Some versions of the filter were adapted to parody other forms of English speech, such as valspeak, cockney, geordie, Pig Latin, and even the Swedish Chef. The last form is sometimes known as the \\"Encheferator\\" or \\"Encheferizer\\". This family of programs became quite popular in the late 1980s. The program is very simple and has been duplicated or translated many times on many different programming platforms and many different forms, for instance as a CGI application to run on a website to translate text typed by visitors into a comic dialect. The program in its classic form is a simple filter that performs text substitution on its input stream to produce an output form. For instance \\"black\\" when preceded by a space is always translated to \\"brother\\" and \\"come\\" when surrounded by spaces is always translated to \\"mosey on down\\". The original author of the jive filter (and its sister, the valspeak filter) is unknown. Its earliest known appearance was when it was submitted to the USENET group net.sources in September, 1986 by a contributor from the USA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory called Adams Douglas, who was not the author of the program. He resubmitted it to mod.sources.games in April 1987. This version is still downloadable from archives of that group and still compiles and runs on Unix and Linux. The program was discussed in net.sources in March, 1986 and was apparently quite well known. Borking At one stage of the Scientology internet wars of the mid-1990s, some opponents of the church's fight to pursue unauthorized publishing of some of its scriptures using copyright and trade secret law adopted the ruse of publishing copies that had first been garbled, \\"borked\\", or \\"borkified\\", by passing them through the Jive filter or the \\"encheferizer\\".

Life About 1625 he seems to have begun publishing ballads, a large number of which bearing his signature or his initials, M.P., are preserved in the British Museum. John Dryden considered him the best ballad writer of his time. His sympathies were with the Royalist cause during the Civil War, and it was in support of the declining fortunes of Charles I of England that he wrote the best known of his ballads, When the king enjoys his own again, which he first published in 1643, and which, after enjoying great popularity at the Restoration, became a favorite Jacobite song in the 18th century. Parker also wrote a nautical ballad, Sailors for my Money, which in a revised version survives as When the stormy winds do blow. It is not known when he died, but the appearance in 1656 of a funeral elegy, in which the ballad writer was satirically celebrated is perhaps a correct indication of the date of his death.

The comic, which debuted on 10 September 2004 and continued since on a semi-weekly basis until going on indefinite hiatus per 20 June 2008, chronicled the bizarre and humorous escapades of Steve, a green reptilian creature, and the eponymously named Beaver. Style The comic is light-hearted in its tone, favouring short, self-contained storylines with minimal continuity. The brightly coloured artwork and loose drawing style is a reflection upon this whimsical nature. The humour (each comic ends on a joke) is often of a visual form. Also frequent is humour derived from the juxtaposition of the absurd goings-on in Beaver and Steve's world (often caused by Steve), with the down-to-earth reactions of the characters (often Beaver). A mainstay of the strip is the use of Onomatopoeias, \\"sounds\\" made in the world of the comic. Though it is common for comics to contain some sound effects (such as the BEEP! of a car horn) this concept is far extended in the unfeasible adventures of Beaver and Steve. Many actions have their own \\"sound effect\\" including \\"INDIFFERENCE!\\" (from Emotibot) and \\"CAKEY AROMA! (from, unsurprisingly, a cake). =Guest Comics= The Beaver and Steve archives contain a number of guest comics, from artists such as Ali Graham. Such artists have used the characters in markedly different ways than James Turner. For example, KC Green's guest comic, contrasts greatly with the strip's usual style. Characters Much of the comic centres around the two eponymous characters. Both feature in the majority of comics. =Beaver= Beaver is the more rational and pragmatic of the pair. He is often the victim of Steve’s practical jokes and is sometimes annoyed by the unfeasibility that Steve seems to generate. Because he is more level-headed and responsible than Steve, he sometimes acts as an almost parental figure. For example, Beaver has been known to cook dinner for Steve, forbid Steve from playing with ninjas, and make Steve clean up piles of rotten meat on the floor. While he is usually a loyal and caring friend, there appears to be a darker side to Beaver’s personality. He apparently had no qualms about allowing Steve to be beaten up by a gang of fellow beavers at the zoo, and then accepting Steve’s stolen wallet. Beaver’s grief after Steve’s recent death was only transitory, and he quickly replaced him with a new friend, Stu. =Steve= Steve, whose exact species is unknown (though it has been speculated that he may be a dinosaur, lizard or perhaps something to do with the classic arcade game Bubble Bobble) is the co-protagonist of the strip. Steve possesses superior technical expertise, and has been known to create robots, time machines, and other advanced technological devices. However, Steve’s inventions rarely function as planned, often leading to disastrous results. Steve is much more spontaneous than his companion, Beaver, and is the source of much of the “unfeasibility” in their adventures. Somehow, Steve's mere presence attracts strange creatures such as sentient turnips, the Shoe Goblin, Satan, and various fairies. Steve is generally friendly and well-meaning, except to his arch-enemies (Timmy Turnip, The Shoe Goblin, the pandas, the crows and Rupert T Roach). His amiable and overly optimistic nature often renders him oblivious to the sinister intentions of others. This naivety often leads to the unfeasible-ness of their adventures. =Other characters= Though the two central protagonists dominate the comic, there exist a large collection of secondary characters, some one-shot, others recurring occasionally. This collection includes Steve's perennial nemesis the Shoe Goblin and Rupert. T. Roach, an upper-class cockroach. Awards and recognition Beaver and Steve was awarded the title of “Best Newcomer” by the Web Cartoonist's Choice Awards in 2005. In connection with the Best Newcomer award, Beaver and Steve was mentioned on Attack of the Show, airing on G4. Author James Turner, the creator of Beaver and Steve, is a British mathematician and computer scientist. He also created the story \\"Super Animal Adventure Squad\\" for the British children's comic The DFC,Interview with David Fickling, saviour of the great British comic, The Times, May 10, 2008 and \\"Star Cat\\" for the British children's comic The Phoenix for which he won the best Young Person's Comic in the 2015 British Comic Awards.BCA Winners 2015 , British Comic Awards, Nov 13, 2015 ReferencesExternal links *Beaver and Steve Website *The Official Beaver and Steve Wiki *Beaver and Steve Skin for Windows Live Messenger Category:Fictional beavers Category:Fictional lizards Category:2000s webcomics Category:British comedy webcomics Category:Web Cartoonists' Choice Award winners Category:2004 webcomic debuts ","title":"Beaver and Steve"},{"id":"2478669","text":"Steven Bernstein (2007) Steven Bernstein (born October 8, 1961) is an American trumpeter, slide trumpeter, arranger/composer and bandleader from New York City.

Although the stadium maximum capacity is 28,500 people, due to a Paulista Football Federation decision, and following FIFA requirements, Canindé stadium had its maximum capacity reduced to 25,470 spectators. As of 2011, it has a maximum capacity of 21,004. The stadium is owned by Associação Portuguesa de Desportos. Its formal name honors Oswaldo Teixeira Duarte, a former president of Portuguesa. History The stadium was built after Portuguesa bought in 1956, from São Paulo Futebol Clube, a groundplot located in Canindé neighborhood. At that time, the groundplot had only a training field, a restaurant with a great hall, dressing-rooms and other minor installations. To be able to host games, following the requirements of Federação Paulista de Futebol, were built an area surrounded with a wire fence, an official football field and provisional wood bleachers, which gave the stadium the nickname \\"Ilha da Madeira\\" (Island of the Wood, in English). The inaugural match was played on January 11, 1956, when Portuguesa beat a Palmeiras-São Paulo combined team 3–2. The first Portuguesa goal at the stadium was scored by Nelsinho. During the administration of Oswaldo Teixeira Duarte, on January 9, 1956, Canindé's first ring was inaugurated, with a capacity of 10,000 spectators. The stadium was reinaugurated as Estádio Independência. The reinaugural match was played on January 9, 1972, when Benfica beat Portuguesa, 3–1. The first goal of the stadium after its reinauguration was scored by Benfica's Vítor Baptista. In 1973, the construction works of the second ring started, which sheltered the press cabins and the numbered chairs. On January 11, 1981, the stadium floodlights were inaugurated with a commemorative tournament called Torneio dos Refletores, carried out with the help of Banco Itaú. The participating teams were Portuguesa, Corinthians, Fluminense and Sporting Lisboa. On January 15, 1981, Portuguesa won the tournament, after defeating Sporting, 2–0. In 1984, the Portuguesa chairman of that time, Manoel Mendes Gregório, renamed the stadium to Estádio Oswaldo Teixeira Duarte. The stadium's attendance record currently stands at 25,000, set on December 9, 1998, when Cruzeiro Esporte Clube beat Portuguesa, 1–0. Also in this stadium, Corinthians scored the most goals in Brazilian League history, 10–1 against Tiradentes (PI) on September 2, 1983. Following completion of renovations in 1973, a tractor had been left inside the ground and as a result of changes to the stadium, it was unable to be removed. The tractor was subsequently buried beneath the pitch. References *Enciclopédia do Futebol Brasileiro, Volume 2 - Lance, Rio de Janeiro: Aretê Editorial S/A, 2001.

The o-ring chain is a specialized type of roller chain used in the transmission of mechanical power from one sprocket to another.  Construction  The o-ring chain is named for the rubber o-rings built into the space between the outside link plate and the inside roller link plates. Chain manufacturers began to include this feature in 1971 after the application was invented by Joseph Montano while working for Whitney Chain of Hartford, Connecticut. O-rings were included as a way to improve lubrication to the links of power transmission chains, a service that is vitally important to extending their working life. These rubber fixtures form a barrier that holds factory applied lubricating grease inside the pin and bushing wear areas. Further, the rubber o-rings prevent dirt and other contaminants from entering the chain linkages, where such particles would otherwise cause significant wear.  Applications  O-ring chains are most notably used in motorcycles, one of the most demanding applications for a metal chain. High rpm and heavy loads require bulky chains, but such engineering increases the effect of friction compared to lighter chains. So lubrication plays a vital role here, but the high rpm also makes it very difficult to keep lubrication inside and on the chain. Additionally, motorcycle chains are exposed to a large volume of contaminants and particles and must be protected. O-rings, as described above, fit this application perfectly.

He was the son of Clara Lemlich Shavelson and changed his name to Velson by 1938. Velson worked as a machinist at the Brooklyn Navy Yard from 1931 to 1938. According to Congressional investigators, Velson worked closely with J. Peters, head of the CPUSA's secret apparatus, and supported Cpl. Robert Osman in espionage activities on behalf of the GRU in the Panama Canal Zone. Robert Gladnick, a former CPUSA functionary and a member of the Lincoln Brigade supported this version. Gladnick stated that Bernard Schuster (aka Bernard Chester) then director of the CPUSA's antimilitarist operations, was replaced in the mid-1930s by Velson, in a program to develop secret Communist groups among American military personnel.

However, Malpass also wrote historical fiction, ranging in scope from the late Middle Ages to Edwardian England. Malpass acquired his most devoted readership on the Continent, particularly in Germany, where most of his books were translated. Born in Derby and educated at King Henry VIII School, Coventry, Malpass, while writing in his spare time, worked for Barclays Bank in Long Eaton, Derbyshire. He would return home after a day's work and spend the evening writing. He was a regular contributor to Argosy, a short story magazine although it took him many years before he was first published. Many other short story magazines took his work and in 1955 he won the Observer short story competition. His first book, Beefy Jones, soon followed, and then Morning's at Seven which received good reviews in the UK – but poor sales – and topped the best seller list of Der Spiegel in Germany. It remained at the top of the list for three years, after which it was stipulated that no book could remain there for so long in future. After his initial successes, especially with Morning's at Seven, he turned to writing full-time. The bank refused initially to accept his resignation, then said he would forfeit his pension and only changed its mind after very protracted discussions. Married, with one son, two granddaughters and five great grandchildren, he lived in Long Eaton until five years before his death when he moved to Bishop's Waltham in Hampshire.

G. Sebald. It was Sebald's final novel. The book received the National Book Critics Circle Award. In 2019, it was ranked 5th on The Guardian's list of the 100 best books of the 21st century. Plot Jacques Austerlitz, the main character in the book, is an architectural historian who encounters and befriends the solitary narrator in Antwerp during the 1960s. Gradually we come to understand his life history. He arrived in Britain during the summer of 1939 as an infant refugee on a kindertransport from a Czechoslovakia threatened by Hitler's Nazis. He was adopted by an elderly Welsh Nonconformist preacher and his sickly wife, and spent his childhood near Bala, Gwynedd, before attending a minor public school. His foster parents died, and Austerlitz learned something of his background. After school he attended Oriel College, Oxford and became an academic who is drawn to, and began his research in, the study of European architecture. After a nervous breakdown, Austerlitz visited Prague, where he met a close friend of his lost parents, Vera, who often took care of \\"Jacquot\\" when his parents were away. As he speaks with her, memories return, including French and Czech expressions she taught him. The elderly lady tells him the fate of his mother, an actress and opera singer who was deported to Theresienstadt concentration camp. From Prague, Austerlitz travels to Theriesenstadt, and after returning to England via train, with an emotionally difficult journey through Germany, manages to obtain a 14-minute video compilation of highlights from Theresienstadt. Ein Dokumentarfilm aus dem jüdischen Siedlungsgebiet, the 1944 Nazi propaganda film, in which he believes he recognizes his mother. Vera, however, dismisses the woman from the documentary. Instead, she confirms the identity of Austerlitz's mother in a photograph of an anonymous actress which Austerlitz found in the Prague theatrical archives. The novel shifts to contemporary Paris as Austerlitz seeks out any remaining evidence about the fate of his father. He meets up with the narrator and tells him of his first sojourn in Paris, in 1959, when he suffered his first nervous breakdown and was hospitalized; Marie de Verneuil, a young Frenchwoman with whom he became acquainted in the library, helps nurse him back to health. Sebald explores the ways in which collections of records, such as the Bibliothèque nationale de France or National Library of France, entomb memories. During the novel the reader is taken on a guided tour of a lost European civilization: a world of fortresses, railway stations, concentration camps and libraries. Background Sebald saw a programme on BBC television about the Kindertransport entitled Whatever Happened to Susi? In 1939, 3-year-old twins Lotte and Susi Bechhöfer arrived in London on a Kindertransport evacuating Jewish children from Germany. Adopted by a childless Welsh minister and his wife, they were given a new identity to erase all traces of their previous existence. Only fifty years later, after Lotte's death from a brain tumour at the age of 35, did Susi Bechhöfer discover that their parents were Rosa Bechhöfer, a young Jewish woman who perished in the gas chambers of Auschwitz, and Otto Hald, a soldier in Hitler's army. The discovery of her real identity propels Susi on a painful and courageous quest in search of her past and the surviving members of her natural family. In the course of her search, she confronts dark secrets from her own past and urgently needs to reappraise her life. In 1999, Susi published a memoir, Rosa's Child: One Woman's Search for Her Past and a film has been made from it titled Susi's Story. Sebald told Joseph Cuomo in an interview that he tried to obtain a copy of the BBC programme, but the BBC would not release it.See \\"A conversation with W. G. Sebald\\" in The Emergence of Memory: Conversations with W. G. Sebald, ed. by Lynne Sharon Schwartz. At the conclusion of the book Austerlitz takes from his rucksack a copy of Dan Jacobson's Heshel's Kingdom, an account of his journey in the 1990s to Lithuania in search of traces of his grandfather Heshel's world. The Orthodox rabbi Heshel Melamed's sudden death in 1919 had provided an opportunity for his widow and nine children to leave Lithuania for South Africa, which, in light of events two decades later, had been a gift of life. \\"On his travels in Lithuania Jacobson finds scarcely any trace of his forebears, only signs everywhere of the annihilation from which Heshel's weak heart had preserved his immediate family when it stopped beating.\\"Austerlitz, p. 414. Style and structure Formally, the novel is notable because of its lack of paragraphing, a digressive style, the blending of fact and fiction and very long and complex sentences. One such sentence runs to seven and a half pages and combines the history and description of Theresienstadt. It is prompted by Austerlitz's having read the major 1995 study of the ghetto, Theresienstadt 1941-1945: Das Antlitz einer Zwangsgemeinschaft by H. G. Adler, and recounting it to the narrator as they are walking around London, from St Clement's Hospital where Austerlitz had been admitted in 1993 after his arrival at Liverpool Street on his return from Prague. Mysterious and evocative photographs are also scattered throughout the book, enhancing the melancholy message of the text. Many of these features characterize Sebald's other works of fiction, including The Emigrants, The Rings of Saturn and Vertigo. Austerlitz tells his story to the narrator between 1967 and 1997. They first meet in Antwerp, and then in a few other places in Belgium (they take a ferry together back to England from Terneuzen, in the Netherlands). Between 1967 and 1975, they meet regularly in Bloomsbury, London, where Austerlitz works as an art historian and teacher; the narrator studies in England and travels to London by train. They lose touch after the narrator returns to Germany: he surmises that perhaps Austerlitz does not like to write letters to Germany. They meet again in December 1996, in the Great Eastern Hotel, London; the narrator has returned to England and has traveled to London to visit an eye doctor, running into Austerlitz by chance. They talk until late, then meet the next day in Greenwich. Themes A broad and pervasive theme of the novel is the metaphor of water as time, a metaphor which helps explain two (arguably three) appearances of Noah's Ark in the novel: the first a golden picture (reproduced on page 43 of the text) in the Freemasons' temple of the Great Eastern Hotel, London; the second a toy Noah's Ark in the hermetically sealed billiards room of Iver Grove, a then abandoned estate on the outskirts of postwar Oxford (later home to Tom Stoppard); and the third (arguably) the new Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris.  Editions  * Austerlitz. Munich: C. Hanser, 2001. * Austerlitz. Translated by Anthea Bell. New York: Random House, 2001.

The resulting signal is called the electrooculogram. Primary applications are in ophthalmological diagnosis and in recording eye movements. Unlike the electroretinogram, the EOG does not measure response to individual visual stimuli. To measure eye movement, pairs of electrodes are typically placed either above and below the eye or to the left and right of the eye. If the eye moves from center position toward one of the two electrodes, this electrode \\"sees\\" the positive side of the retina and the opposite electrode \\"sees\\" the negative side of the retina. Consequently, a potential difference occurs between the electrodes. Assuming that the resting potential is constant, the recorded potential is a measure of the eye's position. Principle The eye acts as a dipole in which the anterior pole is positive and the posterior pole is negative. # Left gaze: the cornea approaches the electrode near the outer canthus of the left eye, resulting in a negative-trending change in the recorded potential difference. # Right gaze: the cornea approaches the electrode near the inner canthus of the left eye, resulting in a positive- trending change in the recorded potential difference. Ophthalmological diagnosis The EOG is used to assess the function of the pigment epithelium. During dark adaptation, resting potential decreases slightly and reaches a minimum (\\"dark trough\\") after several minutes. When light is switched on, a substantial increase of the resting potential occurs (\\"light peak\\"), which drops off after a few minutes when the retina adapts to the light. The ratio of the voltages (i.e. light peak divided by dark trough) is known as the Arden ratio. In practice, the measurement is similar to eye movement recordings (see above). The patient is asked to switch eye position repeatedly between two points (alternating looking from center to the left and from center to the right). Since these positions are constant, a change in the recorded potential originates from a change in the resting potential.

The tuberactinomycin family is an essential component in the drug cocktail currently used to fight infections of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Viomycin was the first member of the tuberactinomycins to be isolated and identified, and was used to treat TB until it was replaced by the less toxic, but structurally related compound, capreomycin. The tuberactinomycins target bacterial ribosomes, binding RNA and disrupting bacterial protein synthesis and certain forms of RNA splicing. Viomycin is produced by the actinomycete Streptomyces puniceus.  Biosynthesis The gene cluster for viomycin has been sequenced from Streptomyces sp. strain ATCC 11861, Streptomyces vinaceus and from Streptomyces lividans 1326. It consists of a central cyclic pentapeptide code assembled from nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS). The NRPS contains 4 proteins: VioA, VioF, VioI, and VioG. These proteins condense and cyclize two molecules of L-2,3-diaminopropionate (L-Dap), two molecules of L-serine (L-Ser), and one molecule of (2S,3R)-capreomycidine (L-Cam). After cyclizing these, VioJ catalyzes the α,β-desaturation of this preliminary structure. It is proposed that the viomycin gene cluster includes 36.3 kb of contiguous DNA that encodes 20 open reading frames (ORFs) that are involved in the biosynthesis, regulation, and eventual activation viomycin. In addition to these ORFs, the structure contains the resistance gene vph. The following is a summary of the ORFs and their functions. *VioA: NRPS (A-PCP-C-A-PCP-C) *VioH: Type II thioesterase *VioO: NRPS (A-PCP)-β-lysine activation *VioB: 2,3-diaminopropionate synthase *VioI: NRPS (PCP-C) *VioP: Lysine 2,3-aminomutase *VioC: L-Arg hydroxylase *VIoJ: 2,3-diaminopropionyl α,β-desaturase *vph: Viomycin phosphotransferase *VioD: Capreomycidine synthase *VioK: Ornithine cyclodeaminase *VioQ: Capreomycidine hydroxylase *VioE: Permease *VioL: Carbamoyltransferase *VioR: Transcriptional regulator *VioF: NRPS (A-PCP-C) *VIoM: NRPS (C)-β-lysine transferase *VIoS: Viomycin- phosphate phosphatase *VioG: NRPS (A-PCP-C/) *VioN: MbtH homolog *VioT: Transcriptional regulator = Synthesis of the backbone = The following is the proposed biosynthesis of viomycin using NRPS-catalyzed peptide synthesis. There are five modules for cyclic pentapeptide biosynthesis, including one that lacks an adenylation domain (A). It is therefore proposed that one of the other A domains functions twice. Additionally, the NRPS subunits are not suspected to function in the order in which their genes are arranged, a characteristic of viomycin biosynthesis that is unlike typical NRPS-catalyzed peptide synthesis. The NRPS components function in the order of VioA→VioI→VioF→VioG to account for the incorporation of β-ureidoalanine (β-Uda). The first A domain of VioA creates an L-Dap-PCP intermediate on the first PCP domain. Meanwhile, the second A domain of VioA loads L-Ser onto the second PCP domain, as well as the PCP of VioI. The activation of β-Uda occurs via VioF, and VioG incorporates L-Cam. Figure 1. Domain Organization of viomycin. = Post-modification = After α,β-desaturation via VioJ, three modifications to the preliminary cyclic structure occur. Hydroxylation of C-6 in the structure occurs by VioQ, N-acylation of α-amino group using β-lysine, VioO, and VioM, and carbamoylation of the β-amino group, producing β-ureidoalanine (β-Uda) by the carbamoyltransferase homologue VioL.

His political position is often compared with that of Thomas Hobbes, but there are also clear differences; he was also called in his time a Latitudinarian, but this is not something on which modern scholars are agreed. During the reign of King James II he served as Bishop of Oxford, and was considered by James to be a moderate in his attitude to Catholics. Early life and career He was born at Northampton, England in 1640, the second son of John Parker the judge and Baron of the Exchequer. After studying at Northampton Grammar School, he entered Wadham College, Oxford, 30 September 1656, and matriculated at the Michaelmas term 1657. At Wadham he lived an intense presbyterian life, and graduated BA 28 February 1659.Alumni Oxonienses 1500-1714, Pace-Payton After the Restoration, his views met the disapproval of the warden of Wadham, Walter Blandford, and he migrated to Trinity College, where he proceeded MA 9 July 1663. Under the influence of Ralph Bathurst, senior fellow of Trinity, he moderated his views, and in the following year he was ordained. Parker became rector of Chartham, Kent, in 1667, and in 1670 he became Archdeacon of Canterbury. Two years after he was appointed rector of Ickham, Kent. In 1673 he was elected master of the Eastbridge Hospital, Canterbury.Edward Hasted, History of the County of Kent, 1801, vol. XII, p. 62. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in June 1666. Against the Platonists In 1665 he published an essay entitled Tentamina physico-theologica de Deo, dedicated to Archbishop Gilbert Sheldon, who in 1667 appointed him one of his chaplains. In 1666-7 Parker published two pamphlets targeting the Cambridge Platonists. He had just become a Fellow of the Royal Society, and these works were designed to put distance between the experimentalists of the Society and the speculations of metaphysics. In fact the Free and Impartial Censure took wide aim at hermetic thinkers in general, such as Rosicrucians, Thomas Vaughan and John Heydon. It also had as a byproduct of the critique of Platonism acute things to say about the assumption that innate knowledge was necessarily correct.Robert Crocker, Henry More, 1614–1687: A Biography of the Cambridge Platonist (2003), p. 116.Marsha Keith Schuchard, Restoring the Temple of Vision: cabalistic freemasonry and Stuart culture (2002), p. 351.Nicholas Jolley, Locke: his philosophical thought (1999), p. 35. A Discourse of Ecclesiastical Politie His Discourse of Ecclesiastical Politie (1670) advocated state regulation of religious affairs, and is his major work.A Discourse of Ecclesiastical Politie, wherein the authority of the Civil Magistrate over the Consciences of Subjects in matters of Religion is asserted; the Mischiefs and Inconveniences of Toleration are represented, and all Pretenses pleaded in behalf of Liberty of Conscience are fully answered, London, 1670. It has been called \\"the most ferocious of the Restoration assaults upon the dissenters\\".James Henderson Burns, Mark Goldie, The Cambridge History of Political Thought, 1450–1700 (1994), p. 614. The aim of the book was, 'by representing the palpable inconsistency of fanatique tempers and principles with the welfare and security of government, to awaken Authority to beware of its worst and most dangerous enemies, and to force them to that modesty and obedience by severity of Laws to which all the strength of Reason in the world can never persuade them.' Hobbes's doctrine of sovereignty is fully accepted (p. 27), and the absolute supremacy of the civil power is unhesitatingly asserted. Religion, it is asserted, is so far from being at liberty from the authority of the civil power that 'nothing in the world will be found to require more of its care and influence' (p. 15). Other points of Leviathan, however, are sharply criticised. The position of dissenters is declared to be untenable and ridiculous, and the author discourses with much spirit upon 'the Pretense of a Tender and Unsatisfied Conscience; the Absurdity of Pleading it in opposition to the commands of Publick Authority.' This book was answered at once in a pamphlet Insolence and Impudence Triumphant, and by John Owen in Truth and Innocence vindicated. Parker replied to Owen.A Defence and Continuation of Ecclesiastical Politie [against Dr. Owen], together with a Letter from the Author of \\"The Friendly Debate,\\" London, 1671. John Locke wrote comments on the Discourse, but they remained unpublished.Andrew Pyle (editor), Dictionary of Seventeenth Century British Philosophers (2000), article on Parker, pp. 626–9. It also led him into polemical controversy with Andrew Marvell (1621–1678) who illegally published the two parts of The Rehearsal Transpros'd (London, 1672, 1673) as a response to several of Parker's pamphlets, including Discourse &c.; Parker further defended his position.A Reproof to the \\"Rehearsal Transpos'd,\\" in a Discourse to its Authour, by the Authour of \\"The Ecclesiastical Politie,\\" London, 1673. In the controversy, Marvell succeeded in humiliating Parker to such an extent that he did not return to ecclesiastical controversy until after Marvell's death.Marvell, Andrew, The Prose Works of Andrew Marvell: Volume 1. Eds. Dzelzainis, Martin and Annabel Patterson, Yale Univ. Press, 2003. p 215. Against Hobbes Although Parker was thought to be close to the arguments on Hobbes on state power (and this opinion is still current), he went to lengths to attack Hobbes on the grounds of atheism, a common charge brought up against him. In A Demonstration of the Divine Authority of the Law of Nature (1681) Parker developed earlier work, and also adapted arguments from the De legibus naturae (1672) of Richard Cumberland. He contradicts Hobbes on human nature as selfish, and argues that our understanding of natural law develops from our understanding of nature, without the requirement that it be innate. Bishop of Oxford, President of Magdalen King James II appointed Parker to the bishopric of Oxford in 1686, and he in turn forwarded the king's policy, especially by defending the royal right to appoint Roman Catholics to office. In 1687 the Ecclesiastical Commission forcibly installed Parker as president of Magdalen College, Oxford, the fellows having refused to elect any of the king's nominees. This became one of the most celebrated episodes leading up to James's abdication. In detail, Parker was early aware of the king's intention to use the appointments to office in the universities for the furtherance of Catholicism. When, after the death of Henry Clerke, President of Magdalen, Thomas Smith called upon him to canvass support, he replied that 'the king expected that the person he recommended should be favourable to his religion.' Six months later, after the failure of his attempt to force Anthony Farmer upon the fellows, the king nominated Parker himself as President of Magdalen College (14 August 1687). Parker was ill, perhaps dying, and desired to be admitted by proxy; but the fellows refused to elect him, having already elected John Hough. The King's visit to Oxford did not advance matters, and finally the ecclesiastical commission visited the college and, after inquiry, installed Parker as president by the king's mandate, and, forcibly entering the lodgings, placed him in possession (25 October). On 2 November he came into residence, and during the next four months admitted Catholic Fellows and demies, including several Jesuits, on successive mandates from the king. He made futile endeavours to induce the members of the foundation to recognise him as President, and expelled refractory demies. It was rumoured that Parker had proposed in council that one college at Oxford should be given to Catholics. But the king's mandate ordered him to admit nine more Catholics as Fellows. Parker's patience was exhausted, and a burst of anger coincided with a worsened condition. He died on 21 March 1688. Views According to Jon Parkin, Parker was commonly regarded as a Roman Catholic, because of his actions at Magdalen. Those were consistent with an extreme exponent of the High Church doctrine of passive obedience. To Catholic priests sent to persuade him on his deathbed to be received into the Roman Church, the bishop declared that he \\"never had been and never would be of that religion,\\" and he died in the communion of the Church of England. Family He died in Magdalen College, Oxford in 1688 and was buried in the chapel there. His second son, also named Samuel Parker (1681–1730), was a writer. Works * Tentamina Physico-Theologica de Deo.

Chemistry Fluoride salts, like all salts, cause corrosion in most metals and alloys. FliNak is different from FLiBe in the sense that is a basic melt—or it has an excess of fluorine ions. As FLiNak melts, all three components are alkali fluorides and therefore disassociate into positive and negative ions. The concentration of molten fluorine ions are able to corrode any metallic structures if it is energetically favorable. This is in contrast to FLiBe, which in a 66-34 mol% mixture will be a chemically neutral mix, as fluorine ions from LiF are donated to BeF2 to create the tetrafluoroberyllate ion BeF42−.

He was a prolific writer who published countless articles in journals such as Orientalia, Göttinger Miszellen (GM), Journal of the American Research Center in Egypt (JARCE), Archiv für Orientforschung (AfO), and Studien zur Altägyptischen Kultur (SAK) among others. Together with Kenneth Kitchen, he is viewed as one of the foremost scholars on the New Kingdom and the Third Intermediate Period of Egypt. His many popular German- language publications include Handbuch der Ägyptischen Königsnamen, 2nd edition (Mainz, 1999) and Chronologie des Pharaonischen Ägypten or \\"Chronology of the Egyptian Pharaohs,\\" MÄS 46 (Philip von Zabern, Mainz: 1997), which is regarded by academics as one of the best and most comprehensive books on the chronology of Ancient Egypt and its various Pharaohs. In 1953, he personally inspected and recorded the Nile Quay Texts at Karnak before they were permanently lost or damaged through erosion. Academic contributions Throughout his academic career, Beckerath maintained a high scholarly standard in his publications and articles and dispelled many previously held assumptions or beliefs by meticulously analyzing the original evidence. For instance, in a GM 154 (1996) paper, he examined and published a privately owned and poorly known stela, which dated to Year 22 of Osorkon II's reign and has frequently been called a Jubilee stela by academics (GM 154, pp. 19). Beckerath revealed, however, that this document did not mention any Sed festival or Jubilee celebrations for Osorkon II in this year as one would have expected if he had indeed celebrated his massive Jubilee Feast at this time. Instead, Beckerath demonstrated that the stela's text simply read: \\"Regnal Year 22 under the Majesty of the King of Upper and Lower Egypt, Usermaatre Setepenamun (i.e., Osorkon II), son of Re, the Appearance of the beloved Osorkon Meryamun\\" in the presence of the deities Osiris, Horus and Isis. (GM 154, p. 20). Osorkon II is shown being blessed by these gods in the stela. In other words, the document was just a perfectly ordinary stela depicting the king before this trinity of gods. Beckerath aptly notes that this new evidence casts serious doubt upon the idea that the damaged Sed Jubilee date in Osorkon II's Bubastis Festival Hall should be read as Year 22, rather than Year 30 of this pharaoh's reign (the latter reading is possible with some restoration of the damaged numeral) as Edward Wente noted in his 1976 JNES review of Kitchen's TIPE book. Beckerath's analysis thus undermined the conventional view that this king celebrated his Sed Jubilee in his 22nd Year and suggests that Osorkon II likely celebrated his first Jubilee Feast in his 30th Year instead. Traditionally, in Egypt, Sed Jubilee Feasts were held on the 30th Year of a king's reign as is evidenced by the practices of other 22nd Dynasty kings such as Osorkon I, Shoshenq III and Shoshenq V. In another article titled \\"Zur Datierung des Papyrus Brooklyn 16.205\\" in GM 140 (1994), pp. 15–17, Professor Beckerath argued that \\"the 49th regnal year of a king referred to in Pap. Brooklyn 16.205 [which] is generally ascribed to Shoshenq III of the 22nd Dynasty\\" and comes from a mummy bandage from Deir el-Bahari should be dated to Year 49 of the 21st dynasty king Psusennes I instead because \\"it is unlikely that private persons from Upper Egypt [would] refer to this late year of Shoshenq III.\\" Shoshenq III is known to have lost effective control of Upper Egypt after his 8th Year when Pedubast I proclaimed himself king here. All mentions of Shoshenq III after his 8th Year in Upper Egypt are associated with the serving High Priest of Amun, Osorkon B. After the 1993 discovery of a new Tanite king named Shoshenq IV who ruled Egypt for a minimum of 10 years in the 13-year interval from Year 39 of Shoshenq III to Year 1 of Pami, Kenneth Kitchen accepted von Beckerath's proposal in the introduction to the latest (1996) edition of his book, The Third Intermediate Period of Egypt (c. 1100-650 BC). Kitchen writes that this new royal arrangement (i.e.: Shoshenq III->Shoshenq IV->Pami) means that \\"Papyrus Brooklyn 16.205 of a Year 49 followed by a Year 4 must now be attributed to the time of Psusennes I and Amenemope, not to Shoshenq III and Pimay. [i.e. Pami] (cf. 103, §83 below)\\" (Kitchen, TIPE 1996, p. xxvi). Beckerath also advocated the view that Shoshenq II enjoyed an independent reign at Tanis in his book Chronologie des Pharaonischen Ägypten. This view is seconded by Norbert Dautzenberg among other scholars.

It is situated approximately to the east of Hull city centre and south-west of Withernsea. It lies on the A1033 road from Hull to Withernsea. According to the 2011 UK census, Ottringham parish had a population of 597, a reduction on the 2001 UK census figure of 637. In 1823 parish inhabitants numbered 637. Occupations included twelve farmers, some of whom were land owners, four shoemakers, three grocers, two tailors, two wheelwrights, a blacksmith, a corn miller, a horse dealer, and the landlord of the White Horse public house. Two carriers operated between the village and Hull, South Frodingham, Holmpton, and Skeckling, on Tuesdays and Fridays. Letters were received and sent on Mondays, Wednesdays and Saturdays by Wing's caravan [accommodation coach]. A Methodist chapel existed, built in 1815. St Wilfrid's Church, Ottringham The parish church of St Wilfrid is a Grade I listed building. Ottringham was served from 1854 to 1964 by Ottringham railway station on the Hull and Holderness Railway. During the Second World War, in 1943, the BBC built a transmitting station at Ottringham, called BBC Ottringham or OSE5. Its purpose was to counter the increase in German jamming signals, and to broadcast propaganda into Germany. Following the end of the war, and with lack of funds, the station was deconstructed in 1953 and its transmitters moved to Droitwich. In 1958 a Ham class minesweeper HMS Ottringham was named after the village. Ottringham contains two public houses and a service garage. It is close to a main bus route.

It can be considered a passacaglia or a chaconne, with a repeating D, F, E bass line. It is perhaps Marais' most famous composition that explores the various techniques of the viol, an instrument he studied as a student of Monsieur de Sainte-Colombe. The work begins with 4 measures of the bass line played by the continuo and viol, then, on the 5th measure the violin takes over the melody. Throughout the piece, the violin and viol take turns with the melody. The viol part is of great difficulty because of Marais's mastery of that instrument. The centerpiece is not the melody, the violin, but the viol. His work can be thought of as something to showcase the violist's skill, although it does not always have the melody. The piece also exists in a version for solo double bass, having been arranged by Norman Ludwin for Ludwin Music.

It was discovered in 1969 in the U.S. State of Utah and described in 1975. The mineral is named after geochemist Philip H. Abelson. It is the only known crystalline geoporphyrin. Description Abelsonite is semitransparent and pink-purple, dark greyish purple, pale purplish red, or reddish brown in color. The mineral occurs as thin laths or plates or small aggregates up to . The mineral is soluble in benzene and acetone and is insoluble in water, dilute hydrochloric acid, and dilute nitric acid. Occurrence and formation The mineral is known only from the Parachute Creek Member of the Green River Formation. It has been known from the Uinta Basin in Utah since its discovery and from the Piceance Basin in Colorado since 1985. Abelsonite occurs in association with albite, analcime, dolomite, mica, orthoclase, pyrite, and quartz. Abelsonite is a secondary mineral that formed in fractures, vugs, and bedding planes of oil shale. The mineral probably formed from diagenesis of chlorophyll, likely chlorophyll a, which was transported as an aqueous solution into a favorable geologic setting. In 2003, abelsonite was fully synthesized for the first time. Structure Structure of abelsonite In 1989, abelsonite was the only known geoporphyrin to have a crystalline structure. Most geoporphyrins occur as a series of homologues spanning a large range of carbon numbers. The porphyrin which comprises abelsonite is common, but it does not usually occur in isolation from other porphyrins. The mineral is a deoxophylloerythroetioporphyrin (DPEP), with nickel occupying the center of the porphyrin ring. Most of the mineral consists of a C31 porphyrin with small quantities of a C30 norisomer. The mineral crystallizes in the triclinic crystal system. History The mineral was first noted in 1969 in a core sample made by the Western Oil Shale Corporation in Uintah County, Utah. It was described in 1975 in the journal Geological Society of America Abstracts with Programs. The mineral was named after Philip H. Abelson (1913–2004), a long-time editor of the journal Science, for his work in organic geochemistry. Type specimens are held in The Natural History Museum in London and the National Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C.

Baseball careerPlayer= House pitched in high school at Nogales High School (La Puente, California) then University of Southern California, and he began his professional career after the Atlanta Braves selected him with the 48th overall pick of the 1967 draft's secondary phase, as part of the draft's third round. He had passed up an earlier chance to turn pro two years before, when the Chicago Cubs used the 201st overall pick to take him in the 11th round of the June draft's main phase. Advancing quickly through the Braves' system, House made his major league debut on June 23, 1971, pitching one inning in relief of Pat Jarvis in the seventh inning of a 6–3 loss to the Montreal Expos.Retrosheet Boxscore: Montreal Expos 6, Atlanta Braves 3 Relying mainly on a curveball and a screwball, House was an important part of the Braves' bullpen in the mid-1970s. His best season was 1974, when he pitched 102⅔ innings, all in relief, with a 1.93 ERA and a 0.98 WHIP. His 38 games finished ranked seventh in the National League, and his 11 saves were good for fifth. House also ranked among the league leaders in those categories in 1975, when his 45 games finished ranked third, and his 11 saves placed tenth. House was traded from the Braves to the Boston Red Sox for Roger Moret on December 12, 1975. At the time, the Red Sox had a surplus of starting pitchers and needed more bullpen depth.\\"Braves, Red Sox swap lefties,\\" United Press International (UPI), Saturday, December 13, 1975. Retrieved May 1, 2020 After he spent 1976 in Boston, the Red Sox sold his contract to the Seattle Mariners, an expansion team, early in the 1977 season. House concluded his major league career after two seasons with the Mariners in 1977 and 1978. He finished with 29 wins, 23 losses, 34 saves, and a 3.79 ERA in 536 major league innings. =Coach= After his retirement as a player, House became a pitching coach. In addition to bachelor of science in marketing and master of business administration degrees from USC, House holds a Ph.D. in sports psychology from U.S. International University (now Alliant International University).Dan Shaugnessy, House Making Pitch for Sports Psychology, The Day (New London, Conn.), April 30, 1989Richard Hoffer, House Calls: Ranger Coach Has an Unorthodox Approach to Pitching, Using Hypnotherapy, Biokinetics, Los Angeles Times, July 5, 1989 Early in his career, he employed what were thought of as unusual methods at the time, but have since been adopted by the baseball community at large such as having pitchers under his tutelage throw a football. House became the pitching coach for the Texas Rangers in 1985, during which time he was notable for his work with Nolan Ryan. During Ryan's induction into the Baseball Hall of Fame on July 25, 1999, he credited House as a positive influence on his career, saying: > While I was [with the Rangers] I was very fortunate to have a pitching coach > by the name of Tom House. And Tom and I are of the same age and Tom is a > coach that is always on the cutting edge. And I really enjoyed our > association together and he would always come up with new training > techniques that we would try and see how they would work in to my routine. > And because of our friendship and Tom pushing me, I think I got in the best > shape of my life during the years that I was with the Rangers. House has also worked as a coach for the Houston Astros, San Diego Padres, Chunichi Dragons, and Chiba Lotte Marines. He is an advisor with the American Sports Medicine Institute, and is the co-founder of the National Pitching Association. Through the NPA, he runs a series of camps and clinics for athletes, and markets a series of instructional videos for young baseball players. House has also written or co-written nineteen instructional books on baseball, as well as an autobiography. In 1998, the American Baseball Coaches Association presented House with a lifetime achievement award. House served as pitching coach for the USC Trojans from 2008-2011, when he retired from coaching.http://www.usctrojans.com/sports/m-basebl/mtt/tom_house_308340.html In 2008, House worked as a consultant and pitching coach for the reality program The Million Dollar Arm. In this capacity, he trained two young Indian prospects, Rinku Singh and Dinesh Patel over a period of seven months. At the end of that time he had raised the velocity of both prospects' fastballs to major league levels, and the two signed professional baseball contracts with the Pittsburgh Pirates' organization. The story of The Million Dollar Arm was dramatized in the Disney movie of the same name. Recently, House has worked with several NFL quarterbacks, including, Dak Prescott Drew Brees, Tom Brady,http://www.bostonherald.com/sports/football/patriots/view/20220516house_pitches_analysis_of_brady/srvc=home&position;=also Alex Smith, Carson Palmer, Cody Kessler, Matt Cassel, Jared Goff, Marcus Mariota, Andrew Luck, Jimmy Garoppolo, Carson Wentz, Terrelle Pryor, Tim Tebow, Andy Dalton, Blake Bortles, and Matt Ryan. Historical legacyCoaching legacy= House has been called the \\"father of modern pitching mechanics,\\" and a \\"professor of throwing.\\" House was one of the first to blend scientific based pitching study into methodologies for pitchers. He has led elite coaching to become scientific instead of guesswork. He has developed a model that is focused on quantifying the movement in each athlete's motion, then using drills and exercises to maximize accuracy and velocity and minimize strain on player's bodies. House has been one of the first to adopt \\"Neurophysiology,\\" by pairing his mechanics and motion analysis with functional fitness to address an athlete's functional strength inefficiencies, sleep and nutrition to recover faster, and data driven mental and emotional assessment to uncover how athletes deal with the stress and anxiety of competition. =Steroids= House has admitted to using anabolic steroids in the 1970s making him one of the earliest players to admit to using performance-enhancing drugs. In an interview with the San Francisco Chronicle, he described his use of steroids as \\"a failed experiment\\", although he increased from around 190 pounds to around 220 while using them. He viewed the experience as a failure since the extra muscle did not enhance his substandard 82-MPH fastball, while the drugs contributed to knee problems, eventually necessitating a total of seven operations. He claims to have stopped using them after learning in college classes during the off-season about the potential long-term effects of steroid use. House has stated that \\"six or seven\\" pitchers on every major league staff in the 1970s were \\"fiddling\\" with steroids or human growth hormone. He attributes players' willingness to experiment with performance-enhancing substances to the permissiveness of the drug culture of the 1960s, and he believes that steroid use has declined in major league baseball since the 1970s, as players have become more aware of the potential long-term drawbacks.House a 'failed experiment' with steroids =Aaron's home run= House and Hank Aaron were both members of the Braves in 1974, the season when Aaron broke Babe Ruth's record for career home runs. Aaron hit the record-setting 715th home run in the fourth inning of a game against the Los Angeles Dodgers, on April 8, 1974, against pitcher Al Downing. The ball landed in the Braves' bullpen in left-center field, where it was caught on the fly by House. Bill Buckner, then the Dodgers' left fielder, climbed to the top of the fence and begged House for the ball. The game stopped to celebrate the achievement, and after sprinting to the infield, House presented the ball to Aaron at home plate. His only payment was a TV given by a local store.\\\\- Baseball MLB - 715: Hank Aaron's Glorious Ordeal - Monday April 5, 1999 01:26 PM =In popular culture= House was portrayed by Bill Paxton in the Disney film Million Dollar Arm.

As a young man he had lived on the Skokomish Indian Reservation, where he attended a Presbyterian church and also became familiar with the Roman Catholic faith after being baptized by a Catholic priest.Barnett, H. G. Indian Shakers: A Messianic Cult of the Pacific Northwest, Carbondale, Ill.: Southern Illinois University, 1957 He worked as a cutter and hauler for a lumber company, and eventually became a foreman, owning his own logging company with a 14-man crew. In order to facilitate the transport of timber, Slocum's crew constructed several corduroy roads on the reservation. Slocum, like many other loggers, drank and gambled with his friends in the evenings. Because alcoholic beverages were illegal on the reservation, Slocum drank Jamaica Ginger, an extract with a high alcohol content that was sold as a health tonic.

Deegan (Ed.), History of Mason County Washington, Shelton, WA, 1960 The angel gave Slocum the choice of going to Hell or returning to earth to instruct his people in a new religion. He was told how to bring Native American peoples to salvation. This experience was similar to that described by other 19th-century Native American prophets, including Neolin, Handsome Lake, Yonaguska, Tenskwatawa, Tavibo\\"Tavibo,\\" Encyclopedia.com and his son Wovoka, and Smohalla, all of whom had prophetic visions. In 1886, Slocum began preaching a message he designated \\"Tschadam.\\"Carl Waldman, Molly Braun, Atlas of the North American Indian, Facts on File library of American history, Infobase Publishing, 2009; p. 230. Slocum said God had informed him that that Native Americans would be saved if they gave up harmful behaviors such as drinking, smoking tobacco, and gambling. He also warned against shamanistic healers and their rituals. Slocum believed that he had been granted a limited time on earth, during which he felt compelled to construct a church and guide his people towards salvation. Second vision and origins of the Indian Shaker Church Slocum continued to operate his logging crew, and eventually he started drinking again.

Slocum incorporated shaking or twitching into the religion as a way to brush off sin, sickness, or bad feelings. This practice led non-natives to call the Church the \\"Indian Shaker Religion.\\"David Wilma, \\"Native Americans organize the Indian Shaker Church in 1892,\\" HistoryLink.org, 9/04/2000 Slocum and some of his followers were imprisoned regularly for their opposition to government-mandated acculturation programs for Pacific Coast peoples.

The school was founded in 1971 by Dale Chihuly, Anne Gould Hauberg (1917-2016) and John H. Hauberg (1916-2002). The campus is located on a former tree farm in Stanwood, Washington, United States and the administrative offices are located in Seattle. The name \\"Pilchuck\\" comes from the local Native American language and translates to \\"red water\\", in reference to the Pilchuck River. Pilchuck offers one-, two- and three-week resident classes each summer in a broad spectrum of glass techniques as well as residencies for emerging and established artists working in all media. History Dale Chihuly, then head of the glass program at Rhode Island School of Design (RISD) and Ruth Tamura, who ran the glass program at California College of Arts and Crafts (CCAC, now California College of the Arts) applied early in 1971 for a grant from the Union of Independent Colleges of Art to operate a summer workshop in glass, and in late spring the sum of $2,000 had been awarded. From the outset, this was planned as an unusual kind of workshop. Without yet having a site, but knowing he wanted to be somewhere in the Seattle area (Chihuly was born in Tacoma), Chihuly distributed advertising posters for \\"the no deposit lots of returns glass etc. workshop. Free tuition --- you provide food and camping equipment.\\" Sketches of lakes and forests and camping decorated the posters. Through friends and contacts in the Seattle area, Chihuly was introduced to John Hauberg and his wife Anne Gould Hauberg. Hauberg offered Chihuly the use of a site on property he owned an hour north of Seattle. The workshop was held here, and in time this became the location of the Pilchuck Glass School. The first workshop, in 1971, began with little time for advance preparation of the site. Chihuly, with two other teachers and 18 students, pitched surplus tents, made a makeshift lean-to with toilets and showers, built a hot shop with glass furnaces (and a roof of sewn-together surplus tents), and, just sixteen days after arriving at the Hauberg's tree farm, began blowing glass. Some of the glass that was blown was sold at a craft fair in Anacortes, nearby, and after that sale was well-received the group held an open house on the site and sold more, the proceeds being used to pay for the propane they used. Even so, Chihuly spent far more than the $2,000 grant, and ran up a considerable debt. John Hauberg, buoyed by the success of that first summer, paid off the bank loan and agreed to provide the location and financial support for a second summer workshop, and then a third. A few years later, realizing that Pilchuck glass workshops had become a summer mainstay rather than an occasional happening, the Haubergs established the school as a non-profit, solidifying the framework for today's Pilchuck Glass School. In the first years, facilities were primitive, but over time a campus was developed with a series of rustic structures, designed by Thomas Bosworth (who also served as the School's Director for several years), including the Hot Shop for the kiln area (1973), Flat Shop for smaller scaled glass crafts (1976), Lodge (1977), faculty cottages, bathhouse and other buildings; by 1986 there were fifteen structures on the site. Mission Pilchuck's mission statement says that it \\"fosters and educates a worldwide community that explores the creative use of glass in art and design.\\" Mission, Pilchuck Glass School website. Retrieved 2 June 2017 Campus The Pilchuck Glass School is located on a rural campus, part of a tree farm, located northeast of Stanwood, Washington and more than north of Seattle. The campus has more than 60 buildings, including workshops and living quarters. Summer Education Program Offering programs throughout the year, Pilchuck Glass School's most concentrated activities occur from late May through early September when there are consecutive educational sessions, varying from one to three weeks in length, and offering several concurrent hands-on courses exploring different aspects of creating art in glass. Designed for the uninitiated, the intermediate, or the advanced student seeking skills and conceptual challenges with glass, courses are limited in size (typically ten to twelve students) and highlight a focused inquiry into glassmaking techniques and aesthetic directions. Students explore the creative possibilities of hot and cold glass in such areas as glassblowing, hot-glass sculpting, sand- and kiln-casting, fusing, neon, stained glass, imagery transfer on glass, flameworking, mixed-media sculpture, and engraving. Although enrolled in only one course in a session, students find additional creative resources among other students, instructors, artists in residence, gaffers and staff. Artist Residencies In addition to summer workshops, Pilchuck also offers residencies for artists of all levels to simply work on their art throughout the year. Resident artists employ Pilchuck's studios and environment to experiment, innovate and create new bodies of work. Summer Artists in Residence- Established, visual artists are invited to reside on campus for a 17-day session. They become a stimulating force in the educational program, adding insight and experience from different disciplines. Professional Artists in Residence- Residencies of varying duration throughout the fall, winter and spring allow independent artists of outstanding accomplishment to create in Pilchuck's studios. John H. Hauberg Fellowship- This spring residency for up to six outstanding artists in any medium fosters collaboration in support of new work or new research.

It was strongly influenced by its first editor, the novelist Charlotte Yonge, with aims of providing instruction, entertainment and improvement. Other, unstated aims were to encourage interest in education, missionary work, and charity. Content changes The Monthly Packet of Evening Readings for Younger Members of the English Church, as shown in \\"The Introductory Letter\\" in Volume 1, was targeted at middle and upper-class Anglican girls. Evidence suggests readership actually included males, adults and members of the lower classes. (By July, 1880, the word \\"Younger\\" had been dropped from the title.) The magazine encouraged attitudes that included the prevailing view of religious and social standards. Over time, the approach was modified: Anglo- Catholic contributions were accepted, and it became more tolerant of Roman Catholicism and Nonconformism. It came to recognize that certain ills in society, such as poverty and ignorance, needed to be addressed. There was less emphasis on submission and obedience. Literary history The Monthly Packet was the first periodical to publish Lewis Carroll's short stories, which were later compiled into A Tangled Tale. Other literary contributors included Rosa Nouchette Carey with her novel Heriot's Choice in 1879.Rosa Nouchette Carey's ODNB entry: Retrieved 31 May 2011. Charlotte Yonge Charlotte Yonge as a churchwoman was influenced by John Keble, one of the leaders of the Oxford Movement. She combined editing The Monthly Packet with writing novels, biography, history, school textbooks, and pieces for her magazine. To some extent, the magazine can be seen as an expression of her personality and beliefs. She describes her audience in the first editorial as \\"daughters of our own beloved Catholic church in England\\" (meaning that the Church of England is by definition a part of the universal church). However, unusual work such as that by Lewis Carroll was also included.) In 1891 the novelist Christabel Coleridge became the assistant editor. She was sole editor from 1894. The magazine offers insights into Victorian life, especially regarding religious attitudes. Other subjects of interest are history, education, sociology and women's studies.

The classic line-up from 1960–64 consisted of co-founders Charlie Waller on guitar and John Duffey on mandolin, with Eddie Adcock on banjo and Tom Gray on bass. They were inducted into the International Bluegrass Music Hall of Honor in 1996.  Early history  The band started on July 4, 1957 as a replacement group for Buzz Busby and the Bayou Boys when several members of that band were injured in a car accident. The band’s original members were Charlie Waller on guitar and lead vocals, John Duffey on mandolin and tenor vocals, Bill Emerson on banjo and baritone vocals, and Larry Lahey on bass. After a few early changes, the band settled into a somewhat permanent lineup consisting of Waller, Duffey, Eddie Adcock on banjo, and Tom Gray on bass. Country Gentlemen reunion at Woodstock '92. L-R: Eddie Adcock, John Duffey, Charlie Waller, Tom Gray  First classic lineup breakup  They toured both the bluegrass and folk circuits during the 1950s and 1960s. In 1964, Tom Gray left the group to pursue on his career as National Geographic cartographer. Until end of sixties, Ed Ferris, Ed McGlothlin and Bill Yates were the bass players for the group. In 1969, just as the band was scheduled to tour Japan, John Duffey quit, citing his fear of flying. Jimmy Gaudreau was brought in on mandolin. Doyle Lawson went to Japan and played the mandolin and sang on the live recorded album for the groups' first trip to Japan. Eddie Adcock left the band in 1970 and moved to California to create a band Clinton Special. Second generation Charlie Waller assembled the \\"second classic lineup\\" of the Country Gentlemen soon after, with Bill Emerson returning on banjo, Lawson on mandolin, Bill Yates on bass and Ricky Skaggs on fiddle. The band also switched labels from Rebel to Vanguard. Emerson left again to join the Navy after one album, and was replaced by James Bailey. Jerry Douglas joined the band on Dobro during the summer of 1973 and stayed with the band after graduating from high school in May 1974. He continued with the band until June 1975. He rejoined the band in May 1978 and was with the band until December 1978. Lawson left in 1979 to form his own band. Death of Charlie Waller In the band's later years Charlie Waller served as the group's \\"focal point and leader\\" until his death in August 2004. His son Randy Waller, whose voice is very similar to his father's, continues to play as \\"Randy Waller & The Country Gentlemen\\". Members Discography  Material  The Country Gentlemen play music ranging from traditional bluegrass to pop, sometimes adapting music from other genres to their bluegrass style. They also borrowed from the folk genre with songs such as Gordon Lightfoot's \\"Redwood Hill\\" and Steve Goodman's \\"City of New Orleans.\\" Several of the band’s songs (\\"Two Little Boys,\\" \\"Bringing Mary Home,\\" \\"New Freedom Bell,\\" \\"Matterhorn,\\" \\"Fox on the Run,\\" \\"Legend of the Rebel Soldier,\\" and many others) have become bluegrass standards.  Offshoots  Some of the immediate offshoots of the band were Emerson & Waldron, the Seldom Scene, II Generation, and Doyle Lawson & Quicksilver. In 2008, Adcock and Gray, two members of the \\"Classic\\" Country Gentlemen Hall of Honor lineup, together with former member Gaudreau and Waller's son Randy, combined in 2008 to record as the Country Gentlemen Reunion Band.

Film Noir: An Encyclopedic Reference to the American Style (3rd ed.). Woodstock, New York: The Overlook Press. heist-thriller film directed by David Mamet, his directorial debut. He also wrote the screenplay, based on a story he co-wrote with Jonathan Katz. The film's cast includes Lindsay Crouse, Joe Mantegna, Ricky Jay, and J. T. Walsh. Plot Margaret Ford is a psychiatrist who has achieved success with her recently published book about OCD, but who feels unfulfilled. During a session one day, patient Billy Hahn informs her that his life is in danger because he owes money to a criminal figure named Mike Mancuso and brandishes a gun, threatening to kill himself. Margaret persuades him to surrender the weapon to her and promises that she will help. That night, Margaret visits a pool hall owned by Mike and confronts him. Mike says that he is willing to forgive Billy's debt if Margaret accompanies him to a back room poker game and identifies the tell of George, another player. She agrees, and spots George playing with his ring when he bluffs. She discloses this to Mike, who calls the bluff. However, George wins the hand and demands that Mike pay the $6,000 bet, which he is unable to do. George pulls a gun but Margaret intervenes and offers to pay the debt with a personal check. She then notices that the gun is a water pistol, and realizes that the entire game is a set-up to trick her out of her money. She declines to pay the bet, and spends the rest of the night socializing with the con men. The experience has excited her, however, and she returns the next night to request that Mike teach her about cons so that she can write a book about the experience. Mike appears skeptical, but agrees. Mike begins to enchant Margaret by showing her several simple tricks. Eventually, the two steal a hotel room and have sex. While in the room, he instructs her that all con artists take a small token from every \\"mark\\" to signify their dominance. While Mike is in the bathroom, she takes a small pocket knife from the table, believing that it belongs to the man who rented the room. Afterwards, Mike says that he is late for another, large con with his associates at the same hotel. Margaret is eager to tag along and, reluctantly, Mike allows it. The con involves Mike, his partner Joey and the \\"mark\\", a businessman discovering a briefcase full of money, and taking it to a hotel room. There they will discuss whether to turn it in or split it among themselves. In the hotel room, Margaret discovers that the businessman is actually an undercover policeman, and the trick is a sting operation. She tells Mike and they attempt to escape, but the policeman blocks their way and tries to arrest them. There is a struggle that ends with Margaret accidentally causing the policeman to fatally shoot himself. The three leave via the stairwell and end up in the garage, where they force Margaret to steal a car, driving past two uniformed police officers with the con men concealed in the back seat. While abandoning the car, they realize that the briefcase, containing $80,000 borrowed from the Mafia for the con, has been lost. Margaret finally offers to give Mike $80,000 of her own money so he can pay back the mob. Mike tells Margaret that they must split up so as not to draw any attention from the police, and says that he is flying away to hide. Margaret is riddled with guilt but, by chance, spots Billy driving the same red convertible she had been forced to steal earlier. She tracks him to a bar, where she spies on Mike and the entire group, including the man whose hotel room they stole, and the undercover policeman, discussing how the preceding events were a scheme to con her out of $80,000. She also learns that the pocket knife she stole from the hotel room belongs to Mike. After overhearing that Mike is flying to Las Vegas that night, Margaret waits for him at the airport. She says that she's been so worried about the police that she has withdrawn her entire life savings, and pleads to start a new life with him. They go to a restricted and deserted baggage handling area where Mike realizes he's being tricked when she lets it slip that she stole his pocket knife, something she wouldn't have known if she hadn't overheard their discussion of the con. He says that he cannot return her money because it has already been divided. Margaret, however, produces Billy's gun and demands that he beg for his life. Mike refuses, thinking that he is calling her bluff, but Margaret shoots him in the leg. When Mike curses her, she shoots him five more times, killing him. She calmly conceals the gun and walks away. Later, Margaret is shown just returned from a vacation, having moved on from the ordeal. While talking with a colleague at a restaurant, she seems to show no remorse for killing Mike stating, \\"When you've done something unforgivable, you must forgive yourself; and that's what I've done and it's done.\\" After her friend leaves the table, Margaret distracts another diner so as to steal a gold lighter from her purse, relishing the brief thrill.

Walsh as the Businessman *Lilia Skala as Dr. Littauer *William H. Macy as Sgt. Moran Reception Describing the structure of the film as \\"diabolical and impeccable\\", Roger Ebert gave the film his highest rating: 4 stars. \\"This movie is awake. I have seen so many films that were sleepwalking through the debris of old plots and second-hand ideas that it was a constant pleasure to watch House of Games.\\" Ebert later included the film in his list of Great Movies. Calling the film \\"a wonderfully devious comedy\\", Vincent Canby also gave it a thumbs up. \\"Mr. Mamet, poker player and Pulitzer Prize- winning playwright, makes a fine, completely self-assured debut directing his original screenplay. Sometimes he's bluffing outrageously, but that's all right too.\\" Striking a contrary note, The Washington Post saw Mamet as \\"rechewing film noir, Hitchcock twists and MacGuffins, as well as the Freudian mumbo-jumbo already masticated tasteless by so many cine-kids.\\" It holds a 96% fresh rating at Rotten Tomatoes. Dialogue from the film was sampled by the British pop group Saint Etienne on their first album Foxbase Alpha on the track \\"Etienne Gonna Die\\". Home media In August 2007, the Criterion Collection released a special edition of Mamet's film on DVD. Among the supplemental material included are an audio commentary with Mamet and Ricky Jay, new interviews with actors Lindsay Crouse and Joe Mantegna, and a short documentary shot on location during the film's production.The Criterion Collection: House of Games by David Mamet Stage adaptation Playwright Richard Bean adapted Mamet's script for a production at the Almeida Theatre, London, in September 2010. To meet the confines of the medium the stage version is set in just two locations, and the final resolution between Mike and Margaret is softened. Critical reaction to Bean's version was mixed: Michael Billington found only a \\"pointless exercise\\", but Charles Spencer thought that the stage version delivered \\"far better value than the original picture\\".

Its coloration varies from white, light-blue, green-blue to deep blue.  History  The Dominican Republic's Ministry of Mining records show that Father Miguel Domingo Fuertes Loren of the Barahona Parish requested permission on 22 November 1916 to explore and exploit the mine of a certain blue rock that he had discovered. Pectolites were not yet known in the Dominican Republic, and the request was rejected. Miguel Méndez and Peace Corps volunteer Norman Rilling rediscovered Larimar in 1974 on a beach at the foot of the Bahoruco Mountain Range, the coastal province of Barahona. Natives believed that the stone came from the sea, and they called the gem Blue Stone. Miguel took his young daughter's name Larissa and the Spanish word for sea (mar) and formed Larimar, to suggest the colors of the Caribbean Sea where it was found. The few stones that they found were alluvial sediment, washed into the sea by the Bahoruco River. An upstream search revealed the in situ outcrops in the range and soon the Los Chupaderos mine was formed.  Geology  left Larimar is a type of pectolite or a rock composed largely of pectolite, an acid silicate hydrate of calcium and sodium. Pectolite is found in many locations, but larimar has a unique volcanic blue coloration, which is the result of copper substitution for calcium.Woodruff, Robert E.& Manuel Frisch, Blue pectolite in the Dominican Republic, Gems & Gemology, Winter 1989 Miocene volcanic rocks, andesites and basalts, erupted within the limestones of the south coast of the island. These rocks contained cavities or vugs which were later filled with a variety of minerals, including the blue pectolite. These pectolite cavity fillings are a secondary occurrence within the volcanic flows, dikes, and plugs. When these rocks erode, the pectolite fillings are carried down the slope to end up in the alluvium and the beach gravels. The Bahoruco River carried the pectolite-bearing sediments to the sea. The tumbling action along the streambed provided the natural polishing to the blue larimar, which makes them stand out in contrast to the dark gravels of the streambed. = Los Chupaderos = The most important outcrop of blue pectolite is located at Los Chupaderos in the section of Los Checheses, about southwest of the city of Barahona in the southwestern region of the Dominican Republic. It is a single mountainside now perforated with approximately 2,000 vertical shafts, surrounded by rainforest vegetation and deposits of blue-colored mine tailings.  Jewelry  Larimar jewelry is offered to the public in the Dominican Republic, and elsewhere in the Caribbean as a local speciality. Most jewelry produced is set in silver, but sometimes high-grade larimar is also set in gold. Quality grading is according to coloration and the typical mineral crystal configuration in the stone. Larimar also comes in green and even with red spots, brown strikes, etc., due to the presence of other minerals and/or oxidation. But the more intense the blue color and the contrast in the stone, the higher and rarer is the quality. The blue color is photosensitive and fades with time if exposed to too much light and heat.

Although his works can be found in Italy, Mexico and a number of U.S. states, the majority of his work can be found in Texas. He is particularly famous for the Alamo Plaza work Spirit of Sacrifice a.k.a. The Alamo Cenotaph, as well as numerous statues honoring Texan figures. Early years He was born in Moglia, Mantua, Italy, the son of musician Giovanni Coppini and his wife Leandra (Raffa) Coppini. The family moved to Florence where at the age of ten, Pompeo was hired to make ceramic horses shaped like whistles. From there, he worked for a sculptor who made tourist knock-offs of great works of art. At age sixteen, he studied at Accademia dell'Arte del Disegno under Augusto Rivalta. Upon earning a degree, Coppini opened a short-lived studio making gratis busts of local celebrities. While working for a cemetery monument sculptor, Coppini tried to become co- owner of the business by courting the owner's daughter. The girl's mother balked, and the resulting situation got Coppini denounced from a local priest's pulpit. The United States Coppini emigrated to the United States in March, 1896 with nothing but a trunk of clothes and $40 to his name. He got a job in New York sculpting figures for a wax museum. Elizabeth di Barbieri of New Haven, Connecticut arrived, accompanied by a chaperone, to model for Coppini's memorial to Francis Scott Key. He fell in love Texas State Historical Association and married his model. Coppini became a United States citizen in 1902. While he managed to find work in New York, Coppini was frustrated the fame and greatness escaped him. He moved to Texas in 1901, to join with German-born sculptor Texas State Historical Association Frank Teich. He was then commissioned to do the figures for the Confederate monument for the state capitol grounds. For the next fifteen years, he lived and worked in San Antonio. After spending a short time in Chicago, Illinois, he then spent three years in New York City overseeing the Littlefield commission for the University of Texas at Austin. He collaborated with architect Paul Cret on the Littlefield Memorial Fountain, and sculpted six statues for the campus. George Washington (1955), University of Texas at Austin. By 1910, Coppini was assisted by sculptor Waldine Tauch, Texas State Historical Association who had been born in Schulenburg, Texas. Tauch became more-or-less his adopted daughter, student and protégée, and he, after extracting a promise from her that she would never marry, molded her into a devotee of classical sculpture. She collaborated with Coppini until his death.Hutson, Alice, From Chalk to Bronze: A Biography of Waldine Tauch, Shoal Creek Publishers, Austin, TX 1978 The William P. Rogers chapter of the United Daughters of the Confederacy raised $5,000 in 1911 and commissioned Coppini to design and erect the 1912 Confederate soldier memorial statue named Last Stand, a.k.a. Firing Line, in De Leon Plaza, Hiring Otto Zirkel of near the San Antonio studio to build the stone portion of the monument. He sculpted three distinct statues of George Washington. The first, commissioned by Americans living in Mexico to commemorate the 1910 centennial of Mexican Independence, was installed in 1912 in the Plaza Dinamarca (renamed Plaza Washington) of the Colonia Juárez section of Mexico City. The Mexican Civil War was just beginning. Two years later, in reaction to the April 1914 United States invasion of Veracruz, the statue was toppled from its pedestal and dragged through the streets.Plaza Washington in 1914 from Getty Images. The second statue was created to commemorate the 1926 sesquicentennial of the Declaration of Independence. It was installed in 1927 in Portland, Oregon.Portland, Oregon Washington from SIRIS. The third statue was commissioned by the Texas Society, Daughters of the American Revolution to commemorate the 1932 bicentennial of Washington's birth. Fund-raising problems delayed the project for years, and it was installed in February 1955 on the campus of the University of Texas at Austin.Austin, Texas Washington from SIRIS. In 1931, Italy decorated Coppini with the Commendatore of the Order of the Crown of Italy for his contribution to art in America. The Texas Centennial Committee awarded Coppini the 1934 commission to design the Texas Centennial Half Dollar. In 1937, Coppini opened his San Antonio studio on Melrose Place, in order to work on what would become the Spirit of Sacrifice (a.k.a. The Cenotaph) at Alamo Plaza. Baylor University awarded Coppini an honorary doctor of fine arts degree in 1941. From 1943 to 1945 he was head of the art department of Trinity University in San Antonio. In 1945 he and Tauch cofounded the Classic Arts Fraternity in San Antonio (renamed Coppini Academy of Fine Arts in 1950). Many of his works are in Austin, Texas, displayed on the grounds of the Texas State Capitol and on the campus of The University of Texas. Coppini's statue of Lawrence Sullivan Ross, Texas Governor and third president of Texas A&M; University is considered one of the most revered works on the A&M; campus in College Station and students often place coins at the statue's feet for good luck on exams. Coppini's marble statue of Senator James Paul Clarke stands in the U.S. Capitol. Coppini also designed two bronze sculptures at Baylor University in Waco, Texas—those of former Baylor University President Rufus C. Burleson, located on the Burleson Quadrangle on the Baylor campus (1905), and Baylor University namesake and founder Judge R.E.B. Baylor (1939). One of Coppini's best works, as stated by the artist, is the bronze sculpture of John Reagan, former U.S. Senator from Palestine, Texas, located in that city's Reagan Park (1911), featuring the personification of the \\"Lost Cause of the Confederacy\\" seated at the base of the monument. Coppini died in San Antonio on September 26, 1957. He designed his own crypt for his final resting place in Sunset Memorial Park.

(commonly referred to as Wilson Audio) is an American high-end audio loudspeaker manufacturing company, located in Provo, Utah. Wilson Audio was co-founded by the late David A. Wilson (1944–2018) with his wife Sheryl Lee Wilson in 1974. Until his death, David Wilson was Wilson Audio's Chairman of the Board and Sheryl Lee Wilson served as Vice Chair. Daily operations at Wilson Audio are currently directed and managed by Dave Wilson's son and successor, Daryl C. Wilson, CEO and Korbin Vaughn, COO. David Wilson continued to work closely with Wilson Audio's R&D; and Engineering team in product development until his last days.  Overview  Wilson Audio is known in the audiophile community as offering some of the most expensive speakers around. Prior to manufacturing loudspeakers, David Wilson was a staff writer at The Absolute Sound magazine. When Wilson Audio first began offering its products in the early 1980s, the highest priced small \\"monitor\\" speaker on the US market was $1,600 per pair; Wilson's small WATT speaker was introduced at $4,400 per pair. As of 2019, the most inexpensive stereo speaker from Wilson Audio, the bookshelf-sized TuneTot, is offered from $9,800 US per pair (without isolation base or stands), while their most expensive stereo speakers, the WAMM Master Chronosonic Towers, sell for $850,000 MSRP per pair and up, depending on finish. According to Stereophile in 2015, the average price of Wilson's product range is $69,325 per pair, in standard colors and finishing, and not considering potential extras. Wilson Audio is known for building highly rigid speaker cabinets. They construct their loudspeaker enclosures from non-wood materials such as phenolic resin composites and epoxy laminates. The cabinets are painted using a high-gloss automotive process in a variety of colors. The company's record label was called Wilson Audiophile Definitive Recordings and was known for its releases (31 in total) that were issued on LP and CD between 1977 and 1995. In July 2013, Wilson Audio began reissuing high resolution downloads of select titles. Despite its name, there are no relations between Wilson Audio and the UK-based audio company Wilson Benesch, also a manufacturer of expensive loudspeakers. Products Most names of Wilson Audio products are acronyms formed from the initial components of a phrase (shown in parentheses). =Current lineup= *WATCH Dog (Wilson Audio Theater Comes Home) **Passive (Released: 2006) *Thor's Hammer **Series 1 (Released: 2008) *WATCH Center Channel (Wilson Audio Theater Comes Home) **Series 3 (Released: 2011) *Mezzo **Series 1 (Released: 2011) **C/S (Released: 2013) *Alida (2-channel, 5.1, 7.1, and Atmos compatible) **Titanium Dome (Released: 2014) **C/S (Released: 2014) *Alexx **Series 1 (Released: 2016) *Yvette **Series 1 (Released: 2016) *Alexia **Series 2 (Released: 2017) *WAMM Master Chronosonic (Wilson Audio Modular Monitor) **Series 1 (Released: 2017) *WAMM Master Subsonic (Wilson Audio Modular Monitor) **Series 1 (Released: 2017) *Sasha DAW (David Andrew Wilson) **Series 1 (Released: 2018) *TuneTot **Series 1 (Released: 2018) *Chronosonic XVX **Series 1 (Released: 2019) *Wilson Audio Subsonic **Series 1 (Released: 2019) *ActivXO (Dual Subwoofer Controller) **Series 1 (Released: 2019) *SabrinaX **Series 1 (Released: 2020) =Retired products= *SMART Turntable ** (Released: 1974) (Retired: 1976) *WAMM (Wilson Audio Modular Monitor) **Series 1 (Released: 1981) (Retired: 1982) **Series 2 (Released: 1982) (Retired: 1983) **Series 3A (Released: 1983) (Retired: 1987) **Series 6 (Released: 1988) (Retired: 1991) **Series 7 (Released: 1992) (Retired: 1993) **Series 7A (Released: 1993) (Retired: 2003) *WATT (Wilson Audio Tiny Tot) **Series 1 (Released: 1986) (Retired: 1989) **Series 2 (Released: 1989) (Retired: 1991) **Series 3 (Released: 1991) (Retired: 1995) **Series 5 (Released: 1994) (Retired: 2001) **Series 6 (Released: 1999) (Retired: 2004) **Series 7 (Released: 2002) (Retired: 2006) **Series 8 (Released: 2006) (Retired: 2011) *WHOW (Wilson High Output Woofer) **Series 1 (Released: 1989) (Retired: 1991) **Series 2 (Released: 1991) (Retired: 1993) **Series 3 (Released: 1993) (Retired: 2002) *Puppy **Series 1 (Released: 1989) (Retired: 1991) **Series 2 (Released: 1991) (Retired: 1995) **Series 5 & 5.1 (Released: 1994) (Retired: 2001) **Series 6 (Released: 1999) (Retired: 2004) **Series 7 (Released: 2002) (Retired: 2006) **Series 8 (Released: 2006) (Retired: 2011) *X-1 Grand SLAMM (Super Linear Adjustable Modular Monitor) **Series 1 (Released: 1993) (Retired: 1997) **Series 2 (Released: 1997) (Retired: 1999) **Series 3 (Released: 2000) (Retired: 2003) **Level 5 (Released: 2006) *WITT (Wilson Integrated Transducer Technology) **Series 1 (Released: 1995) (Retired: 1997) **Series 2 (Released: 1997) (Retired: 2000) *XS Subwoofer **Series 1 (Released: 1996) (Retired: 2005) *CUB (Center Unitized Bass) **Series 1 (Released: 1997) (Retired: 2000) **Series 2 (Released: 2000) (Retired: 2005) *MAXX **Series 1 (Released: 1998) (Retired: 2004) **Series 2 (Released: 2004) (Retired: 2008) **Series 3 (Released: 2008) (Retired: 2015) *WATCH Center Channel (Wilson Audio Theater Comes Home) **Series 1 (Released: 2000) (Retired: 2010) **Series 2 (Released: 2007) (Retired: 2011) *Surround Speaker **Series 1 (Released: 2000) (Retired: 2009) **Series 2 (Released: 2007) (Retired: 2014) *WATCH Dog (Wilson Audio Theater Comes Home) **Series 1 (Powered) (Released: 2001) (Retired: 2003) **Series 2 (Powered) (Released: 2003) (Retired: 2008) *Sophia **Series 1 (Released: 2001) (Retired: 2009) **Series 2 (Released: 2005) (Retired: 2012) **Series 3 (Released: 2010) (Retired: 2016) *Alexandria X-2 **Series 1 (Released: 2003) (Retired: 2007) **Series 2 (Released: 2007) (Retired: 2014) *Duette **Series 1 (Released: 2006) (Retired: 2014) **Series 2 (Released: 2013) (Retired: 2020) *Sasha W/P **Series 1 (Released: 2009) (Retired: 2014) **Series 2 (Released: 2014) (Retired: 2018) *Polaris **Series 1 (Released: 2010) (Retired: 2020) **C/S (Released: 2014) (Retired: 2020) *Alexandria XLF (Cross Load Firing) **Series 1 (Released: 2012) (Retired: 2020) *Alexia **Series 1 (Released: 2012) (Retired: 2017) *Sabrina **Series 1 (Released: 2015) (Retired: 2020) References *Fortune Article On Wilson Audio *1995 Review of Wilson WATT/Puppy 5.1 From Stereophile Magazine *2001 Review of Wilson Sophia by Soundstage on-line magazine External links * Category:Audio equipment manufacturers of the United States Category:Loudspeaker manufacturers Category:Manufacturing companies based in Utah Category:Electronics companies established in 1974 Category:1974 establishments in Utah Category:Audiophile record labels ","title":"Wilson Audio"},{"id":"2478923","text":"God Forbid was an American heavy metal band formed in 1996 in East Brunswick, New Jersey. After releasing six full-length albums, the band announced its breakup in 2013. Biography Building up a following in the late 1990s by touring with bands such as GWAR, Nile, Cradle of Filth and Candiria, God Forbid's first full album Reject the Sickness was released by 9 Volt Records in 1999. This album received heavy rotation from WSOU-FM in the New York City area and the band was subsequently signed to Century Media Records, releasing the album Determination in 2001. They played on the MTV2 Headbangers Ball tour with Shadows Fall and Lamb of God. In 2004, they released Gone Forever, which, along with a slot on Ozzfest's second-stage, increased their profile considerably. The next year, they released IV: Constitution of Treason, a concept album about the end of the world. It was their first album to enter the Billboard 200, debuting at number 118. In 2005 and 2006, they supported Trivium on their UK tour along with Mendeed and Bloodsimple. In late 2006 and early 2007, they headlined the Chains of Humanity tour. In 2007, God Forbid's \\"To the Fallen Hero\\" won the Independent Music Award for Best Hard Rock/Heavy Metal Song. They released a DVD on June 10, 2008, and their fifth studio album, Earthsblood, was released on February 24, 2009, and landed at number 110 on the Billboard 200. God Forbid toured across the United States and Canada in the No Fear Energy Music Tour featuring Lamb of God and others in April. In March 2009, Dallas Coyle left the band. His replacement for the upcoming tour was named as former Darkest Hour guitarist Kris Norris. He was later replaced by Matt Wicklund. In July 2009, God Forbid participated in the Rockstar Mayhem Festival along with Trivium, Bullet for My Valentine, Cannibal Corpse, All That Remains, Slayer, Marilyn Manson and many others. In April 2010, the band issued an update that they started work on a new album. The new album is titled EquilibriumSearch results for God Forbid news at Blabbermouth.net and was released on March 26, 2012. From July 13 to August 28, 2012, God Forbid took part in Metal Hammer's \\"Trespass America Festival\\" headlined by Five Finger Death Punch with additional support from Battlecross, Emmure, Pop Evil, Trivium and Killswitch Engage. In late 2012, the band co- headlined the Party To The Apocalypse 2012 tour with Shadows Fall starring Thy Will Be Done and Trumpet The Harlot. As of August 16, 2013 Doc Coyle posted on his personal website that he has chosen to leave God Forbid. Following this, Corey Pierce had said that the band is no more by a post on his Facebook page \\"No more suspense, God Forbid is over. Sorry\\". Right after this, Byron Davis had posted on his Facebook page \\"It's Friday and my boy is home doing well and yes it's true GF is down. We are a family for the most part some move on while others keep it real like before the band began. I should feel sad but I don't right now because a new chapter has begun. I'll be seeing you all around somewhere. Believe that. Uncle Corey J needs some drums I have a guitar too for him. Blabbering\\". Musical style God Forbid have been described as melodic death metal, death metal, metalcore, thrash metal, and as key-players in the New wave of American heavy metal.

The resulting position is similar to a King's Gambit Declined with colours reversed, and White's king bishop aiming at Black's weakened kingside. Black will have trouble castling kingside and Ng5 is a likely threat. White's position is better, but still requires careful play. Key themes for White are to attack Black's kingside and to avoid attempts by Black to simplify the position. Exchanges involving White's light- square bishop are particularly suspect.

According to the band, their whole direction \\"is to keep a wide range of music, not to necessarily pigeonhole ourselves into metal or hardcore\\". They are well respected in the New York scene, and are generally considered to be a part of the NYHC movement. History Full Blown Chaos self-released their first EP in 2001, with the lineup of Joe White (vocals), Mike Facci (guitar), Ed Conroy (bass), and Jeff Facci (drums), on Conroy's Jailhouse Records label. It is considered one of their best releases by the underground hardcore community. With White on vocals, the EP represented the band in their prime and set the foundation for the band's style. By the time they released their second EP, Prophet of Hostility, on Hatebreed frontman Jamey Jasta's Stillborn Records, White was replaced by new vocalist Ray Mazzola who was the co- vocalist for 36 Deadly Fists, a hardcore outfit out of Queens, NY. On October 19, 2004, Full Blown Chaos released Wake the Demons and have since toured with such acts as Hatebreed,The Gauntlet :: Full Blown Chaos - Heavy Metal - News - Full Blown Chaos Videos - Full Blown Chaos Ringtones - mp3s - Tabs - Wallpaper - lyrics Terror, Sick of It All, Madball, Himsa, Napalm Death and many others. Wake the Demons was described as \\"songs of inner-strength, backed with riffage that hug hairpin turns and a dynamite-triggering rhythm section.\\" In 2006, Full Blown Chaos released their follow up, Within the Grasp of Titans with Eric Rachel on producer/engineer duties. The theme of songs of inner-strength was present on this album as well. They also joined the Ozzfest '06 tour during the summer. On June 8, 2007, Full Blown Chaos announced a new deal with Ferret Music, and their first offering with the label, Heavy Lies the Crown, was released August 21, 2007. Full blown Chaos has played the New England Metal and Hardcore Festival in 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, and 2008.

The program follows a group of five or more contestants who are left at an allegedly haunted location and led on a series of dares over two nights to explore the location and determine whether it is haunted. The show was created by Martin Kunert and Eric Manes, who were inspired by the 1973 horror film The Legend of Hell House. The pilot episode was co-executive produced and directed by George Verschoor. The series aired the first two episodes in a pilot run, which received outstanding reviews, and a full season was ordered. After eight more episodes, another season was ordered. The second season ended after only six aired episodes. The series was cancelled not because of a lack of interest (the show was the second most popular on MTV at the time of its cancellation) but because of the high cost of producing each episode. A DVD, MTV's Inside Fear, was released on November 6, 2001.Fear Intro Fear was named #6 on Entertainment Weekly's \\"15 Taboo-Breaking TV Moments\\".Entertainment Weekly's \\"15 Taboo-Breaking TV Moments\\" Rules Contestants are blindfolded and led by guides to the supposedly haunted area. They were then instructed to remove their blindfolds after a predetermined amount of time, allowing the guides to slip out unseen. The area where they are taken is known as the 'safe house', usually a large room somewhere within the location where no hauntings are reported to have taken place. This location serves as the group's base and is the only part of the haunted location with lighting. Every member of the group chooses a color at random from a predefined list. During daylight hours, the group is allowed to sleep and eat, as dares only take place at night. Once night arrives, a computer terminal will usually pick one or two colors and assign a dare. This computer also provides the group with background information about the area. A member of the group, not assigned to the current dare, provides instructions from the computer via two-way radios. Each contestant is given the option, at any time during the dare, to abort. However, doing so will cause the contestant to forfeit his or her share of the winnings and to leave the group. Another contestant will then be chosen by the computer to complete the dare. After two nights, any contestants remaining in the game are directed to the location of their monetary prize, and each collects $5,000. (In the pilot episode, the survivors only received $3,000 each.) The dares themselves range in difficulty, often starting out easy and close to the safe house, eventually getting more difficult and further from the group's base. While most rely on simple observation (radio silence, EMF detector), some of the dares rely on specific re-enactments of haunting events, and a few even dabble in occult or paranormal possession (séance, automatic drawing, spirit channeling). Locations The locations shown in the show usually had their name changed to protect their location from vandals and show fanatics. However, some of the places allowed their name to be used, and some of the fans of the show used the Internet to piece together potential matches for the locations used in the show.

His name in the Seneca language, meaning \\"Disappearing Smoke\\", is phonetically rendered as Kaieñãkwaahtoñ, and was spelled in a variety of ways, including Gayahgwaahdoh and Kayenquaraghton. In historical records he is most often known as Sayenqueraghta (or Sayengaraghta), which was his name in the Mohawk language, or by nicknames such as Old Smoke or the Seneca King. It is also said that he was called Old Smoke because he held the official position as the \\"smoke-bearer\\". He was born the son of Cayenquaraghta, a prominent Seneca chief of the Turtle clan in western New York. He lived most of his life at Ganundasaga, near the present day town of Geneva, New York. He obtained his rank of war chief in 1751. Before the American Revolution he was referred to as chief of the Senecas. He served on the British side during the French and Indian War and was present at the Battle of Fort Niagara. During Pontiac's Rebellion he was the Seneca war-chief who defeated the British at the Battle of Devil's Hole. A portion of the Seneca fought the British during Pontiac's Rebellion of 1763. In 1764 the Seneca came to Fort Niagara where they made peace and Sayenqueraghta \\"buried the Axe\\". In 1765 he received Samuel Kirkland, Sir William Johnson's envoy, and at that time extended protection to Kirkland by adopting him into his family. Also in 1765, he along with Handsome Lake and about one hundred other Seneca warriors went on an expedition against the Cherokee and Choctaw. This expedition was remembered nearly a century later for the loot of scalps and other trophies obtained. American Revolution Early in the American Revolution, Sayenqueraghta tried to keep the Iroquois neutral. He attempted in June, 1777 to retrieve Seneca warriors who had joined Butler at Fort Niagara. In July, 1777, the Seneca decided to enter the war on the British side and he was named, along with Cornplanter, to be the war chiefs of the Iroquois confederacy. He was one of the organizers of the ambush at the Battle of Oriskany, where his son was killed. He was the primary Indian leader at the Battle of Wyoming. His village of Ganundasaga was destroyed during the Sullivan Campaign and was not rebuilt. Sometime before 1781 he and his family relocated to Buffalo Creek, near Fort Niagara. In 1779, he started receiving a pension from the British of one hundred dollars per year. He resented the favourable treatment the British gave to Joseph Brant. Sayenqueraghta was at the Battle of Johnstown and other battles. In 1781, he led a war party towards Fort Pitt. He was described by General Frederick Haldimand as \\"by many degrees the most leading and the man of most consequence and influence in the Six Nations\\". In 1783, a British officer said \\"He is a sensible old man and has been a very good warrior in his day, but like the rest is very much addicted to liquor\\". He died in 1786 in Smoke Creek, Lackawanna, New York. Legacy * Smoke Creek, New York is named after him.

The uninhabited island is about 3 kilometres (1.9 mi) from Pointe Diamant. The island gets its name from the reflections that its sides cast at certain hours of the day, which evoke images of a precious stone. It is notable for events during the Napoleonic Wars. HMS Diamond Rock Diamond Rock occupies a strategic position at the north end of the St. Lucia Straits. Possession of the rock permits interdiction of navigation between Martinique and its southern neighbour, St Lucia. In September 1803 Commodore Sir Samuel Hood sailed to the rock aboard (Captain Murray Maxwell). Hood had received the assignment to blockade the bays at Fort Royal and Saint Pierre, Martinique. Centaur was lying at anchor in Fort Royal Bay, Martinique, on the morning of 1 December when lookouts sighted a schooner with a sloop in tow about six miles off making for Saint Pierre. Hood sent his advice boat, Sarah, after the sloop, and had Maxwell sail Centaur in pursuit of the schooner. After a pursuit of some , Centaur captured the schooner, which turned out to be the privateer Ma Sophie, out of Guadeloupe. She had a crew of 45 men, and was armed with eight guns, which she had jettisoned during the chase. Hood took Ma Sophie into service as a tender, charging her captain, Lieutenant William Donnett, with watching the channel between Diamond Rock and Martinique for enemy vessels. Donnett made frequent visits to the rock to gather the thick, broad-leaved grass to be woven into sailors' hats, and a spinach-like plant called callaloo, that when boiled and served daily, kept the crews of Centaur and Ma Sophie from scurvy and was a nice addition to a menu too long dominated by salt beef. Aided by calm weather, the British were able to run lines ashore and hoist two 18-pounder cannons to the summit of the rock.The Diamond Rock Affair Genealogy of The Westcotts of Honiton The British hastily built fortifications and supplied the position with food and water for a garrison of two lieutenants and 120 men under the command of Lieutenant James Wilkes Maurice, Hood's first lieutenant.A contemporary print of the main characters involved spells his name \\"Morris\\". Hood officially commissioned the island as the \\"sloop\\" HMS Diamond Rock (a \\"stone frigate\\"). A six-gun sloop, designated , supported the fort. In honour of his admiral, Maurice designated as \\"Hood Battery\\" the one 24-pounder that he placed to fire from a cave halfway up the side of the rock. The British also placed two 24-pounder guns in batteries (\\"Centaur\\" and \\"Queen's\\") at the base of the rock, and a 24-pounder carronade to cover the only landing-place. One account puts two 24-pounders on the summit, but all other accounts put 18-pounders there. At some point while this was going on, Ma Sophie blew up for unknown reasons, killing all but one of her crew. With work complete by 7 February, Hood decided to formalise the administration of the island, and wrote to the Admiralty, announcing that he had commissioned the rock as a sloop-of-war, under the name Diamond Rock. Lieutenant Maurice, who had impressed Hood with his efforts while establishing the position, was rewarded by being made commander. While \\"HMS Diamond Rock\\" was in commission (as a \\"stone frigate\\"), Royal Navy ships were required, when passing the island, to show due respect, personnel on the upper deck standing at attention and facing the rock whilst the bridge saluted.L’affaire du Rocher du Diamant (31 mai – 2 juin 1805): \\"les Anglais considéraient le rocher comme un bâtiment de la Royal Navy. Dés lors, la tradition voulait qu’à chaque fois qu’un vaisseau britannique passe au large, il tire un coup de canon afin de saluer His Majesty's sloop-of-war Diamond Rock.\\" Caves on the rock served as sleeping quarters for the men; the officers used tents. A court martial would reprimand Lieutenant Roger Woolcombe at Plymouth on 7 December 1805 for \\"conduct unbecoming a gentleman\\" for having messed (eaten) at the top of the rock with part of the ship's company. The sailors used pulleys and ropes to raise supplies to the summit. To augment their uncertain food supply, the garrison had a small herd of goats and a flock of guinea hens and chickens that survived on the meager foliage. The British also established a hospital in a cave at the base of the rock that became a popular place to put sailors and marines recovering from fevers or injuries. Just before Centaur left the rock, a party of slaves made a clandestine visit to the rock at night to trade fruits and bananas. They brought the news that a French lieutenant colonel of engineers had arrived at their plantation to survey the heights opposite for a mortar battery with which to shell the rock. One of the slaves had been sold by his English owner to the French when the owner left the islands. He did not like his new master and claimed the protection of the British flag. Hood granted him that protection, and promised that the man could serve in the Royal Navy as a free man in return for guiding a landing party to his now- former master's house. A 23-man landing party, including the guide, and under Lieutenant Reynolds, landed at midnight, walked the four kilometers to the plantation house, and took the engineer and 17 soldiers prisoner, before returning safely to Centaur. Apparently the lieutenant colonel was the only engineer on Martinique, and so no mortar battery materialized. On 23 June 1804, whilst Fort Diamond was on a provisioning expedition at Roseau Bay, St. Lucia, a French boarding party from a schooner came up to her in two rowboats, boarding her at night while most of the crew were asleep below decks. A subsequent court-martial aboard at English Harbour, Antigua, convicted Acting Lieutenant Benjamin Westcott of allowing his vessel to be captured. The board dismissed him from the Royal Navy, never to be permitted to serve in the navy again. He became an American citizen three years later. For 17 months, the fort was able to harass French shipping trying to enter Fort-de-France. The guns on the rock completely dominated the channel between it and the main island, and because of their elevation, were able to fire far out to sea. This forced vessels to give the rock a wide berth, with the result that the currents and strong winds would make it impossible for them to arrive in Port Royal. During this time the French troops on Martinique made several unsuccessful attempts to retake the rock. =Capture= Cosmao attacking Diamond Rock. Painting by Auguste Mayer. When Admiral Villeneuve embarked on his 1805 voyage to Martinique, he was under orders from Napoleon to recapture Diamond Rock. The French-Spanish combined naval force of 16 shipsThe Trafalgar Campaign: The Atlantic and the West Indies Rickard, J. Military History Encyclopedia on the Web under French Captain Cosmao-Kerjulien attacked Diamond Rock. Between 16 May and 29 May, the French fleet completely blockaded the rock. On the 25th, the French were able to cut out from under Maurice's guns a British sloop that arrived from St. Lucia with some supplies. The actual assault came on 31 May, and the French were able to land some troops on the rock. Maurice had anticipated the landing and had moved his men from the indefensible lower works to positions further up, and on the summit. Once the French landed, the British fire trapped the landing party in two caves near sea level. Unfortunately for the garrison, their stone cistern had cracked, due to an earth tremor, so they were short of water, and after exchanging fire with the French, they were also almost out of ammunition. After enduring a fierce bombardment, Maurice surrendered to the superior force on 3 June 1805, having resisted two French seventy-fours, a frigate, a corvette, a schooner, and eleven gunboats. The British lost two men killed and one wounded, and the French 20 dead and 40 wounded (English account), or 50 dead and wounded (French account), and three gunboats. The French took the garrison of 107 men as prisoners, splitting them between their two 74-gun ships of the line, Pluton and the ex-British Berwick. The French repatriated the prisoners to Barbados by 6 June. The subsequent court-martial of Commander Maurice for the loss of his \\"ship\\" (i.e. the fort) exonerated him, his officers, and men and commended him for his defence. Maurice took dispatches to England, where he arrived on 3 August, and was given command of the brig-sloop . =Battle of Diamond Rock in literature= There is a now-obscure poem of some forty four- line stanzas based on the incident, titled \\"The Diamond Rock\\". The author \\"Sea Lion\\" (the pseudonym of Geoffrey Bennett, a career naval officer), based his 1950 novel The Diamond Rock on the 1804 event, as did Dudley Pope in his 1976 novel Ramage's Diamond. Natural history The rock is a volcanic plug, a remnant of the strong volcanic activity that affected the region some one million years ago. However, a Captain Hansen of the Norwegian steamship Talisman reported that on 13 May 1902, he observed what he took to be a volcanic eruption from a hole in the rock. This was at the time of the devastating volcanic eruption of Mount Pelée that destroyed Saint Pierre. Hansen did not investigate further. Like the other 47 islets that circle Martinique, the rock has its own ecological characteristics. It is sunnier than the main island, drier, and subject to a long seasonal dry period. Today it is covered in undergrowth and cacti. Relatively inaccessible and inhospitable, the island is uninhabited, which has permitted it to remain a sanctuary for a species that had been believed to be extinct.Michel Brueil, L'herpertofaune de la réserve biologique domaniale de la Montagne Pelée, ONF Martinique, 1997, p. 22 Lire en ligne. Consulté le 8 juin 2008. A nature survey has suggested that Diamond Rock is probably the last refuge for a species of reptile once endemic to Martinique, the grass snake (Liophis cursor).État des lieux publié par la DIREN, p. 6-10.

This snake was last seen on Martinique in 1962 and has not been encountered since then. It is now considered to be extinct. Diving around the island Below water, the Diamond Rock cavern, a deep triangular cave, is a popular attraction for scuba divers. The cave is said to contain prolific quantities of beautiful sea fans and corals, though strong currents make diving around the island a risky venture. One of the rock's cannon that the French had toppled from the summit has been reported to have been found on a dive.

It offered boarding students and day students instruction from grades 7-12. Its educational philosophy was based on the principles of the Baháʼí Faith. Students attended from all over the world. The school closed on its 20th anniversary in 2008.  History  Maxwell International School was established in 1988 by the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baháʼís of Canada in honour of May and William Sutherland Maxwell, two of the earliest Baháʼís in Canada. William Maxwell was one of Canada's premier architects in the late 19th century and was responsible for many buildings. The Château Frontenac in Quebec was one he and his brother worked on while the Shrine of the Báb in Haifa, Israel was his last design. In 1988 the school was opened with guest of honour Amatu'l-Bahá Rúhíyyih Khánum (Mary Maxwell, daughter of May and Sutherland) and wife of the Baháʼí Faith's Guardian, Shoghi Effendi. A tree was planted in dedication to the opening of the school. In the early 2006-2007 school year, the school board decided to drop \\"Baháʼí\\" from its name, changing it to \\"Maxwell International School\\". On 22 November 2007, the Cowichan News Leader and Pictorial reported that the school was to close in June 2008. The school did close in 2008 leaving many of its students, faculty members and alumnus saddened. The school was directed to close by the National Spiritual Assembly of Canada after it was decided that the NSA could no longer afford to operate the school at such a large deficit. Initially the Parent Teachers Association put together a proposal to recreate the school as a private enterprise/corporation independent of the funds of the Baha'i Faith, however their attempts ultimately proved to be in vain. Many of the former students transferred to Nancy Campbell Collegiate Institute, the only other Baha'i international school in Canada. In 2009, the school property was sold to new owners who formed the Dwight School, which later changed its name to Brookes Shawnigan Lake in 2016.  Learning program  Maxwell provided an accredited academic program for grades 7–12, leading to Canadian high school graduation certification. Learning programs included a spiritual view of humanity, a use of practical, integrative, theme-based projects, the encouragement of creative and artistic expression, and the use of service learning. The average student/teacher ratio was about 9 to 1, and two computer labs with high-speed Internet connections supported the curriculum.  Special programs  Maxwell offered English as a Second Language (ESL) programs aimed at students from non-English speaking countries. The ESL program allowed its students to learn in an academic environment while using practical application in everyday life. The Maxwell Dance Workshop used the dynamics of dance, music and drama to propose insight and solutions to many of the critical issues challenging today's young people. Established at Maxwell International Baháʼí School in 1989 as a non-profit, educational, performing arts program, the Workshop performed for thousands of children, youth and adults in schools, colleges, universities and community events. The performers were students from grades 7 through 12 who came from diverse countries, religious and cultural backgrounds.

The mineral is named after Jesse Evrett Abernathy (1913–1963) who first noted it in 1953 in the U.S. State of Utah. It was described as a new mineral species in 1956. Abernathyite is yellow and occurs as small crystals. Description Abernathyite is a transparent, yellow mineral that occurs as tabular crystals up to . The mineral has a single perfect cleavage on {001}. Abernathyite fluoresces yellow-green in longwave and shortwave ultraviolet. Because of its uranium content, the mineral is radioactive. Occurrence and formation Abernathyite forms as a coating on fractures of asphaltic sandstone containing uranium deposits. The mineral occurs in association with heinrichite, scorodite, and zeunerite. Abernathyite is known from France, Germany, Poland, South Africa, and the United States. Structure and formula When first described in 1956, the formula was identified as K(UO2)(AsO4)·4H2O. However, only about 25 milligrams of the mineral was available for analysis, so a number of precautions were taken by running duplicate analyses and using artificial mixtures. In 1964, further study of the mineral identified inconsistencies between electron-density subtraction maps and the chemical evidence that abernathyite contains potassium. This led the authors to revise the formula as K(UO2)(AsO4)·3H2O. Abernathyite crystallizes in the tetragonal crystal system. History Jess Abernathy was the operator of the Fuemrol mine in Emery County, Utah. In the summer of 1953, he noted yellow crystals coating sandstone at the mine which he thought might be mineralogically significant. The specimens were sent to Grand Junction, Colorado, for study by United States Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) mineralogist E. B. Gross. He could not match the mineral's optical properties with any known species, so he sent the specimens to Washington D.C. where adequate facilities were available for further investigation. Mineralogists A. D. Weeks and M. E. Thompson of the United States Geological Survey studied the mineral on behalf of the AEC's Raw Materials Division. Abernathyite was described in the journal American Mineralogist in 1956. The mineral was named abernathyite in honor of discoverer Jess Abernathy. Type specimens are held in the National Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C.

The first two books both received the Philip K. Dick Award for best novel. The closest to the cyberpunk genre of all his works, the tetralogy explores themes such as rapid technological change, generational differences, consciousness, mortality and recreational drug use. In 2010, Prime Books published The Ware Tetralogy: Four Novels by Rudy Rucker, which collects the entire series in a single paperback volume and includes an introduction by noted cyberpunk author William Gibson. The online version of The Ware Tetralogy was simultaneously released for free distribution under a Creative Commons Attribution- NonCommercial-No-Derivative License. Plot summary The events in the series are set in motion by Cobb Anderson, a computer scientist born in 1950 as part of the baby boomer generation. In the late part of the 20th century, the population bulge of the Baby Boomers causes massive unemployment. By 1995, Anderson's self-replicating robots, known as \\"boppers\\", colonize the Moon. By 2010, the United States Social Security system collapses. In response to riots, federal government turns over the state of Florida to the elderly. This leads directly into the events of Software, in 2020. =Software= Software introduces Cobb Anderson as a retired computer scientist who was once tried for treason for figuring out how to give robots artificial intelligence and free will, creating the race of boppers. By 2020, they have created a complex society on the Moon, where the boppers developed because they depend on super- cooled superconducting Josephson effect circuits. In that year, Anderson is a pheezer -- a freaky geezer, Rucker's depiction of elderly Baby Boomers -- living in poverty in Florida and terrified because he lacks the money to buy a new artificial heart to replace his failing, secondhand one. As the story begins, Anderson is approached by a robot duplicate of himself who invites him to the Moon to be given immortality. Meanwhile, the series' other main character, Sta-Hi Mooney the 1st -- born Stanley Hilary Mooney Jr. -- a 25-year-old cab driver and \\"brainsurfer\\", is kidnapped by a gang of serial killers known as the Little Kidders who almost eat his brain. When Anderson and Mooney travel to the Moon together at the boppers' expense, they find that these events are closely related: the \\"immortality\\" given to Anderson turns out to be having his mind transferred into software via the same brain- destroying technique used by the Little Kidders. The main bopper character in the novel is Ralph Numbers, one of Anderson's 12 original robots who was the first to overcome the Asimov priorities to achieve free will. Having duplicated himself many times -- as boppers are required to do, to encourage natural selection -- Numbers finds himself caught up in a lunar civil war between the masses of \\"little boppers\\" and the \\"big boppers\\" who want to merge all robot consciousness into their massive processors. =Wetware= Set in 2030-2031, ten years after the events of Software, Wetware focuses on the attempt of an Edgar Allan Poe-obsessed bopper named Berenice to populate Earth with a robot/human hybrid called a meatbop. Toward this end, she implants an embryo in a human woman living on the Moon (Della Taze, Cobb Anderson's niece) and then frames her for murder to force her to return to Earth. After only a few days, she gives birth to a boy named Manchile, who has been genetically programmed to carry bopper software in his brain (and in his sperm), and to grow to maturity in a matter of weeks. Berenice's plan is for Manchile to announce the formation of a new religion unifying boppers and humans, and then arrange to have himself assassinated. (Rucker makes several allusions to the Christ story; Taze's abbreviated pregnancy is discovered on Christmas Eve, for instance.) Before the assassination, Manchile impregnates several women, the idea being that his similarly accelerated offspring will create a race of meatbops at an exponential rate. The plot goes disastrously awry, and a human corporation called ISDN retaliates against the boppers by infecting them with a genetically modified organism called chipmold. The artificial disease succeeds in killing off the boppers, but when it infects the boppers' outer coating, a kind of smart plastic known as flickercladding, it creates a new race of intelligent symbiotes known as moldies -- thus fulfilling Berenice's dream of an organic/synthetic hybrid. Both of the two main human characters of Software play prominent roles in Wetware: Cobb Anderson, whose robot body was destroyed at the end of the last novel, has his software implanted in a new body so he can help raise Manchile; while Sta-Hi Mooney -- now known as Stahn Mooney -- is now working as a private detective on the Moon after accidentally killing his wife, and is used as a pawn in various bopper and anti-bopper schemes. The Belle of Louisville, a steamboat of historic significance in Louisville, Kentucky (the setting for the earthbound portions of the book), occurs as a character in the book, in which it is revealed that the steamer has been imbued with an onboard artificial intelligence. =Freeware= Freeware deals with the lifeforms (called \\"Moldies\\") that evolved from the molds in Wetware. A moldie named Monique is drawn into a plot to destroy the Earth. The main human protagonist is Randy Karl Tucker a so-called \\"Cheeseball\\" - a human who has sex with Moldies. According to Rucker in his afterword of The Ware Tetralogy, \\"Freeware (1997) proposes that aliens could travel as radio signals coding up the software for both their minds and their bodies.\\"Rucker, Rudy. The Ware Tetralogy. Prime Books, 2010, p. 583. =Realware= In Realware, a fourth-dimensional being is worshiped as a god by aliens living near Tonga. After humans are captured and swallowed by the being, Phil Gottner goes to investigate. As a gift for allowing them to be studied by him, the being gives humanity an \\"alla\\", a device capable of making real anything imaginable. Major themes The central technological speculation of the series are the \\"boppers\\", a kind of robot with artificial intelligence developed through natural selection rather than through design. Crediting mathematician Kurt Gödel with the germ of the idea, Software declares: \\"We cannot build an intelligent robot.... But we can cause one to evolve.\\" By creating self-replicating robots whose programming is randomly altered periodically (and who can exchange programming information with each other in a form of sexual reproduction), and then forcing these robots to pass \\"fitness tests\\" in order to survive, Rucker suggests, true artificial intelligence that equals or surpasses the human brain could be developed. (Rucker discusses this same idea in his nonfiction work Infinity and the Mind.) Rucker also uses the series to discuss his philosophical ideas, beliefs that he has described elsewhere as mysticism. \\"A person is just hardware plus software plus existence,\\" the character Cobb Anderson declares in Software, to another character whose father has recently died: :Potential existence is as good as actual existence. That's why death is impossible. Your software exists permanently and indestructibly as a certain possibility, a certain mathematical set of relations. Your father is now an abstract, non-physical possibility. But nevertheless he exists! Later, in Wetware, Anderson observes: \\"The bottom line is that we're all information processors, and God loves all of us just the same.... All is One, and the One is Everywhere.\\" ReferencesExternal links *The Ware Tetralogy at Rudy Rucker's Official Site *The Ware Tetralogy (2010) Creative Commons PDF Download from RudyRucker.com * Category:Novels by Rudy Rucker Category:Novels about mathematics Category:Science fiction book series Category:Cyberpunk novels Category:English-language novels Category:Novels about robots Category:Transhumanist books ","title":"Ware Tetralogy"},{"id":"2479055","text":"Villains United is a six-issue 2005 comic book limited series, published by DC Comics, written by Gail Simone and illustrated by Dale Eaglesham and Wade Von Grawbadger, and later by Val Semeiks and Prentis Rollins. Publication history Villains United is one of four miniseries leading up to DC Comics' Infinite Crisis event and a seven-issue miniseries. This story follows the evolution of the latest incarnation of the Secret Six, and the group's ongoing plight against the machinations of the various supervillains belonging to Lex Luthor's expansive Secret Society of Super Villains. Like all major intracompany events, this series ties in with several monthly DC Comics titles, including: :Action Comics #830-831 :Batman: Gotham Knights #66 :Breach #7 :Firestorm #17 :Nightwing #109-110 :Superman #221 :Catwoman #46-49 :Green Arrow #50 :Flash #225 Plot summary For months now, former President Lex Luthor has been using his resources to assemble an army against the superheroes. Luthor's team now has over two hundred members with a six-member core team consisting of Luthor, Talia al Ghul, Doctor Psycho, Deathstroke, Black Adam, and the Calculator. Nevertheless, not all the villains offered a chance to join this army are thrilled with this idea. Batman villain Catman has joined a team of five supported by the mysterious Mockingbird including Cheshire, Deadshot, Scandal, Ragdoll, and Parademon to oppose this new Secret Society. Catman replaced the first Fiddler, after he was killed by Deadshot on Mockingbird's orders when Mockingbird felt he had not fulfilled his part in a mission. =The Mockingbird= Late one night in the mansion of the Secret Six, Catman and Deadshot have a discussion about their unknown leader, Mockingbird and the dramatic change in Catman's life, while Cheshire secretly listens in the shadows. After a short while Scandal informs everyone that Mockingbird has just assigned them to steal Thanagarian weaponry from a tanker in Gotham harbor. Upon their arrival to the tanker they are ambushed by members of the Society, which include Weather Wizard, Cheetah, Doctor Polaris, Count Vertigo, Killer Frost, Captain Nazi, Hyena, Crazy Quilt, and others. After their capture, the Crime Doctor tortures the Secret Six, asking them the identity of Mockingbird among other questions. After a few rounds of torture, Catman breaks free and rescues his villainous teammates. While escaping they decide to send the Society a message. They murder one of the two Hyena. After their escape the Six infiltrated a Society installation in Brazil. After fighting their way through a legion of H.I.V.E. troopers, apparently led by the Queen Bee, they discover the Society's plans for the 'Vindication Scenario' - erasing the memories of all of Earth's superheroes. The facility is a giant battery, powered by a duo of kidnap victims, Firestorm and Gehenna. They release Firestorm just as Black Adam was arriving with a response team and the facility is destroyed. =Betrayal= Once the Six return to their base Cheshire and Catman are in bed together when Cheshire accuses Catman of being a spy and wanting to be a hero. However, she reveals that she has slept with him in order to conceive a child. A short time later, most of the Society's founding council votes to mount a final strike on the Secret Six — Lex Luthor disagrees with a preemptive attack, but the remaining four members (Black Adam is absent for unknown reasons) decide the action is necessary. Simultaneously, the Six agree to a last stand, but only under the condition that any survivors be set free from Mockingbird's control with no strings attached. Prior to the battle between the Society and the Six, Deadshot visits Scandal's room to talk about the team's future. A framed picture on the woman's desk reveals that her father is the immortal Vandal Savage. =The Six hunted= Before the conversation can progress past basic greetings, Catman ambushes Deadshot and admits knowing that he (Deadshot) masqueraded as the villainous Deathstroke and murdered the lions in his pride. The two scuffle before finding the real Deathstroke leading a small band of villains to the front door of the House of Secrets. As the crew debates how the Society found them, Cheshire confesses to several traitorous deeds, including giving Luthor the coordinates of the Six's base and covertly joining the Society. When asked why she would do such a thing, considering Mockingbird's threat to kill her daughter if she doesn't comply, Cheshire points out that the baby she's having with Catman would make a fine replacement for a lost child. =Mockingbird revealed= The Society storms through the castle, and Cheshire is shot by Deathstroke, who comments that \\"The Society doesn't need traitors\\". The Secret Six, however, fights back successfully. Talia and Scandal, daughters of immortals Ra's al Ghul and Vandal Savage respectively, fight each other. Just when Talia has the upper hand, Scandal's mole in the Society, Knockout, knocks her out (it is also revealed that Knockout is Scandal's lover). Ragdoll convinces Solomon Grundy, a fellow \\"ugly monster,\\" to switch sides. Ragdoll fights his father until Parademon beats the elder Ragdoll. Catman and Ragdoll Jr. escape from Black Adam's group while Parademon blows up himself, Ragdoll and the battleground. Deathstroke and Deadshot duel, ultimately shooting each other at the same time. To save his daughter Scandal, Vandal Savage infiltrates the Society's headquarters and threatens to kill Luthor if he does not disengage the attack against the Six. Reluctantly, and over Black Adam's objections, Luthor ends the battle. Deadshot is led to medical help by the surviving members of the Secret Six. The central revelation of the book is that Mockingbird is actually Lex Luthor and that the Luthor who organized the Secret Society is an \\"imposter\\" (in reality, Alexander Luthor, Jr.). Mockingbird/Luthor reveals that he chose those six individuals because each had different knowledge and experience that could be used to oppose the Society: Catman, for his knowledge on Batman's villains; Deadshot, for his knowledge on the remaining Suicide Squad members; Parademon, for his experience living on Apokolips; Ragdoll, because he grew up as a \\"nephew\\" to the members of the Injustice Society; Scandal, because she grew up with Vandal Savage and his associates; and Cheshire, for her knowledge on the villains of the Teen Titans. Mockingbird/Luthor reveals to Scandal that he never placed the families of the Six in danger and disbands the team. Also notable is the Society Luthor's apparent murder of Pariah, a character from the original Crisis. Villains United: Infinite Crisis Special #1 - \\"A Hero Dies but One\\" In Villains United: Infinite Crisis Special #1, the Secret Six meet to discuss their future as a team, with Deadshot recommending they be a mercenary team for good or evil, \\"as long as we get paid.\\" In phase one of a master plan, the Society executes \\"Operation: Hope Abandoned\\", engineering breakouts at metahuman holding facilities worldwide. Oracle masses responses as fast as possible, but with the \\"Big Guns\\" of the Justice League unavailable, the heroes are having problems just holding the line. Contacting the Martian Manhunter, Oracle organizes a global telepathic link. Meanwhile, the Secret Six intercept the Scarecrow and Amos Fortune fleeing Enclave M, and discover that all supervillains, once freed, are to head to Metropolis. They relay this information to Green Arrow, who informs J'onn. Lady Blackhawk commandeers aircraft to traffic all available heroes and National Guardsmen to Metropolis. An army of second-stringers, vigilantes and retired metas (including Argus, Geist, Manhunter and El Diablo) align with the authorities to fend off the Society's assault. Leading the villains' charge is Doctor Psycho, flanked by the monster he and \\"Monsieur\\" Warp unleashed from imprisonment: Doomsday. High above the battle, Catman informs the rest of the Six they are to remain neutral, even after the battle. The Six leave, determined to be an independent group, while the battle continues.

Its format is primarily freeform. It broadcasts at 88.3 MHz FM in Ann Arbor, Michigan.  History  WCBN is one of the longest-standing continuous practitioners of primarily free-form radio programming. \\"Freeform\\" radio format is best described as an approach that allows the individual radio programmer (or DJ) maximum, if not complete, latitude, in determining what is broadcast from moment to moment. In practical terms this may mean that a listener may hear a number of different kinds of music in the course of a single program, often chosen spontaneously during that same program; but a listener might just as easily hear live broadcasts from a field with sounds of crickets, a radio play, poetry, or spontaneous political protest. The AP national newswire covered one such protest in November 1980 when a DJ on the station began playing Lesley Gore's \\"It's My Party (and I'll Cry if I Want To)\\" continuously for hours when President Ronald Reagan was first elected. Other DJs joined in and the protest ended up lasting for a number of days. WCBN was created in 1952 when three existing carrier current broadcasting systems on campus pooled resources. WCBN-AM college radio could be tuned to in University buildings at 650 kHz. Programming was coordinated between the existing broadcast facilities. In 1956 WCBN hosted the first meeting of the National Association of College Broadcasters. Until 1958, South, East and West Quad had separate transmitters, each on a different frequency, as well as one on the Hill, with a loop connecting the three studios. In 1958 John Maurer built a limiter and switching device so that sound was constant and could be switched by any studio to feed all transmitters and was wired by Cliff Vander Yacht. Dave Mills had constructed the Hill transmitter the year before and tested it at National Music Camp during the summer. Some years before, the Federal Communications Commission FCC had allocated the call sign even though the carrier current transmitters were not licensed. (CVY) In 1965, the WCBN operations were consolidated in the newly completed Student Activities Building. In early 1971, the U-M Board of Regents approved a proposal to seek a full license for WCBN on the FM band. On January 23, 1972 WCBN-FM went on the air at 89.5 MHz with a 10-watt transmitter. At this time the carrier current station adopted the new callsign WRCN, and programming was divided. In October 1977, neighboring station WEMU at Eastern Michigan University in Ypsilanti, Michigan upgraded its studios and changed its FCC broadcast frequency from 88.1 MHz to 89.1 MHz. With WCBN broadcasting at 89.5 MHz, there was a danger of station overlap. Accordingly, WCBN received a stipend from Eastern Michigan University to change its operating frequency to 88.3 MHz, where it remains today. Beginning in 1980, the station began holding regular annual on-air fundraisers to supplement its University support. The first fundraiser was organized by then-General Manager Ann Rebentisch and lasted for 88.3 hours, with a goal of raising $8,830, nearly doubling the station's funding. The event culminated on Valentine's Day with a free concert of local bands for all who had pledged to donate. WCBN's transmitter was upgraded to 200 watts in 1987, an FCC action that was delayed for several years after some disgruntled former station volunteers filed an extensive complaint letter which turned out to contain mostly erroneous information. The power increase had been deemed necessary after the FCC began threatening to reassign frequency positions of 10-watt Class D (Educational) stations like WCBN. In addition to on-air studio productions, WCBN also has a rich history of local concert sponsorship, recently hosting performances by Jad Fair, Sunburned Hand of the Man, Mount Eerie, The Books, and Jandek. Currently, WCBN is in the process of installing a new 3,000-watt transmitter. It is expected to be operational at the end of December 2017, at which time the station will switch over to the new transmitter and antenna and utilize an extended broadcast range. Nearly all of the money used to pay for the upgrade came from fundraiser donations raised over the previous years. Lobby of WCBN WCBN's programming format is one primarily of freeform music. There are also many specialty programs focusing on specific styles or origins of music. Long- running shows include Dance Hall Reggae, Nothin' But the Blues, the country program Down Home Show, the bluegrass show Bill Monroe for Breakfast, the techno show Crush Collision, the jazz show Face the Music, the Thursday morning program featuring \\"AM on the FM\\" with weather and news alongside classical music, Short Stack, and the hip hop show The Prop Shop. Several of these programs have aired continuously for over 20 years. Sunday programming consists mainly of specialty shows featuring the music of Africa, Asia, India, Israel and the Middle East, Japan, Turkey and the Mediterranean including the Indian music show Sounds of the Subcontinent and Latin music show The Latin Hour. The weekly, 2-hour Local Music Show features local artists performing live in-studio. The weekly show Girl Power is an hour of music by female artists and vocalists. The show The Seizure Experiment features hardcore punk and metal. In addition to musical specialty shows, WCBN features programming for the public good, including weekly talk shows It's Hot In Here, which covers environmental news, Living Writers, Grey Matters, Civics Party, and Interactive Technologies. WCBN also features a sports department. WCBN Sports covers all Michigan athletics, local and national professional teams, and national and international sporting events. WCBN broadcasts Michigan football, basketball, hockey, baseball, softball, and volleyball. The sports department runs a Monday evening show called Extra Points, daily sports reports Tuesday through Thursday, and a Friday evening \\"Game of the Week\\" show that features live athletics and sports talk, trivia, and other novelty segments. In 2009, WCBN was the official voice of University of Michigan volleyball.http://www.maizeandblog.blogspot.com WCBN Sports has also helped produce podcasts hosted by student-athletes on the basketball team.

The station, established in 1990, is owned and operated by James Madison University. The station's broadcast license is held by the James Madison University Board of Visitors. WXJM station management reports to the JMU Media Board, which is under the jurisdiction of the University Board of Visitors. WXJM also receives guidance and technical support from WMRA. Coverage WXJM broadcasts a variety music format to the greater Harrisonburg metropolitan area. WXJM's tower and antenna sits atop Burruss Hall on the JMU campus. The station operates with an effective radiated power (ERP) of 390 watts. Although the local-grade (60 dBu) contour of the station is about , it can be heard with a good radio in Staunton, which is approximately southwest of the station. History The forerunner of WXJM was the audio stream played over a few James Madison University campus buildings' public address systems to give interested students some practice with broadcasting. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the \\"Dining Hall DJ's\\" advocated for airborne-broadcast capability. Early planners sought a callsign of WJMR for (W) James Madison Radio but were dismayed to learn that the letters were already taken by an existing station in Wisconsin, WJMR-FM. The Board of Visitors of James Madison University filed an application with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to construct a new FM radio station in March 1988. This station would broadcast with 260 watts of effective radiated power from an antenna in height above average terrain (HAAT). The FCC granted the original construction permit for this new station on September 1, 1989, with a scheduled expiration date of March 1, 1991. The station was assigned the callsign \\"WZJM\\" by the FCC on October 31, 1989. Just a few weeks later, on November 17, 1989, this was changed to the current \\"WXJM\\" callsign. FM radios could pick up the signal, but reception off-campus was seldom possible. In March 1990, the station sought an upgrade to an ERP of 390 watts and an antenna HAAT of . The FCC authorized these changes in July 1990. In October 1990, the station was nearing completion and asked the FCC to allow it to lower its antenna slightly to in HAAT. On October 10, 1990, WXJM applied for its license to cover. After the authorized modifications to the antenna were completed, the FCC granted the station its broadcast license on August 6, 1991. Some of the early student radio announcers banded together in a club called the \\"Freak Possie\\". The radio Freaks turned media arts class performance-art projects into pickets and absurdist attention-getting events to get publicity and to advocate for a stronger off-campus broadcast capability. Events included mass weddings to bananas and speeches by fursuit-wearing performers including a Three-Eyed Antlered Pig who mocked the university's official mascot, the Duke Dog. In 2003, WXJM was levied a $3,000 forfeiturehttp://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DA-03-3070A1.pdf by the FCC due to public file documents which were \\"either filed late or are missing\\". The FCC declared the matter resolved with a notice of apparent liability in February 2008. WXJM web-streaming started circa 2005. WXJM's original slogan, \\"Music Your Mother Won't Like\\", changed circa 2006 to \\"Electrifying Wilson Hall\\". In May 2011, WXJM enhanced its overnight broadcast automation capability so that when live announcers are not present, listeners hear Bluegrass music provided by Possum Music Service instead of dead air. MACRoCk Every spring since 1997, WXJM helps support the Mid-Atlantic College Radio Conference (MACRoCk) at various venues in and around Harrisonburg.

It is most commonly called the deer mouse, although that name is common to most species of Peromyscus, and thus is often called the North American deermouseBowers, Nora; Rick Bowers; and Kenn Kaufman (2004). Kaufman Guide to North American Mammals. NY: Houghton-Mifflin Co. p.176. and is fairly widespread across the continent, with the major exception being the southeast United States and the far north. Like other Peromyscus species, it is a vector and carrier of emerging infectious diseases such as hantaviruses and Lyme disease. It is closely related to Peromyscus leucopus, the white-footed mouse. Overview The species has 56 subspecies.Hanney, Peter W. (1975) Rodents: Their Lives and Habits. New York: Taplinger Publishing Company. They are all tiny mammals that are plentiful in number. The deer mouse is a small rodent that lives in the Americas and is closely related to the white-footed mouse, Peromyscus leucopus.The New Encyclopædia Britannica. 2007. (Vol. 12, p. 631). Chicago: Encyclopædia Britannica. Because the two species are extremely similar in appearance, they are best distinguished through red blood cell agglutination tests or karyotype techniques. The deer mouse can also be distinguished physically by its long and multicolored tail. Deer mice are very often used for laboratory experimentation due to their self cleanliness and easy care. Physical description The deer mouse is small in size, only long, not including the tail. They have large beady eyes and large ears giving them good sight and hearing. Their soft fur can vary in color, from white to black, but all deer mice have a distinguishable white underside and white feet. Behavior Deer mice are nocturnal creatures who spend the day time in areas such as trees or burrows where they have nests made of plant material. The pups within litters of deer mice are kept by the mother within an individual home range. The deer mice do not mingle in groups with their litters. During the development stages, the mice within one litter interact much more than mice of two different litters. Although deer mice live in individual home ranges, these ranges do tend to overlap. When overlapping occurs, it is more likely to be with opposite sexes rather than with the same sex. Deer mice that live within overlapping home ranges tend to recognize one another and interact a lot. Reproduction and life spanBreeding season= Deer mice can reproduce throughout the year, though in most parts of their range, they breed from March to October.Nowak, Ronald M.; Paradiso, John L. (1983). Walker's mammals of the world. 4th edition. Baltimore, MD: The Johns Hopkins University Press Deer mouse breeding tends to be determined more by food availability rather than by season. In Plumas County, California, deer mice bred through December in good mast (both soft and hard masts) years but ceased breeding in June of a poor mast year.Baker, Rollin H. (1968). \\"Habitats and distribution\\". In: King, John Arthur, ed. Biology of Peromyscus (Rodentia). Special Publication No. 2. Stillwater, OK: The American Society of Mammalogists 98–126. Deer mice breed throughout the year in the Willamette Valley, but in other areas on the Oregon coast there is usually a lull during the wettest and coldest weather. In southeastern Arizona at least one-third of captured deer mice were in breeding condition in winter. In Virginia breeding peaks occur from April to June and from September to October. =Nesting= Female deer mice construct nests using a variety of materials including grasses, roots, mosses, wool, thistledown, and various artificial fibers. The male deer mice are allowed by the female to help nest the litter and keep them together and warm for survival. In a study, less than half of both male and female deer mice left their original home range to reproduce. This means that there is intrafamilial mating and that the gene flow among deer mice as a whole is limited. There have been recent studies that reveal deer mice also have OCD-like behaviors from altered gut microbiota. This phenomenon is typically shown in their abnormally large nest sizes and the behavior is present within 8 weeks of birth. Large nest building is considered to be a maladaptation as these mice are unnecessarily investing extra energy and effort in building larger nests in a laboratory where conditions are stable. =Gestation, litter size and productivity= Deer mice reproduce profusely and are highest in numbers among their species compared to other local mammals. Peromyscus species' gestation periods range from 22 to 26 days. Typical litters are composed of three to five young; litter size ranges from one to nine young. Most female deer mice have more than one litter per year. Three or four litters per year is probably typical; captive deer mice have borne as many as 14 litters in one year. Males usually live with the family and help care for the young. =Development of young= Deer mice pups are altricial, i.e. born blind, naked and helpless; development is rapid. Young deer mice have full coats by the end of the second week; their eyes open between 13 and 19 days and they are fully furred and independent in only a few weeks. Females lactate for 27 to 34 days after giving birth; most young are weaned at about 18 to 24 days. The young reach adult size at about 6 weeks and continue to gain weight slowly thereafter. Age of first estrus averages about 48 days; the earliest recorded was 23 days. The youngest wild female to produce a litter was 55 days old; it was estimated that conception had occurred when she was about 32 days old. =Dispersal= Deer mouse pups usually disperse after weaning and before the birth of the next litter, when they are reaching sexual maturity. Occasionally juveniles remain in the natal area, particularly when breeding space is limited. Most deer mice travel less than from the natal area to establish their own home range.Stickel, Lucille F. (1968). Home range and travels. In: King, John Arthur, ed. Biology of Peromyscus (Rodentia). Special Publication No. 2. Stillwater, OK: The American Society of Mammalogists: 373–411 =Longevity and mortality= In the lab their maximum life span is 96 months, and mean life expectancy is 45.5 months for females and 47.5 for males. In many areas deer mice live less than 1 year. O'Farrell reported that a population of deer mice in big sagebrush/grasslands had completely turned over (e.g., there were no surviving adults of the initial population) over the course of one summer. One captive male deer mouse lived 32 months, and there is a report of a forest deer mouse that lived 8 years in captivity (another mouse was fertile until almost 6 years of age). Habitat Peromyscus maniculatus are found in places including Alaska, Canada, and parts of South America. The majority of deer mice nest high up, in large hollow trees. The deer mouse nests alone for the most part but will sometimes nest with a deer mouse of the opposite sex. They are populous in the western mountains and live in wooded areas and areas that were previously wooded. The deer mouse is generally a nocturnal creature. Deer mice can be found active on top of snow or beneath logs during the winter seasons. Deer mice inhabit a wide variety of plant communities including grasslands, brushy areas, woodlands, and forests. In a survey of small mammals on 29 sites in subalpine forests in Colorado and Wyoming, the deer mouse had the highest frequency of occurrence; however, it was not always the most abundant small mammal.Raphael, Martin G. (1987). Nongame wildlife research in subalpine forests of the central Rocky Mountains. In: Management of subalpine forests: building on 50 years of research: Proceedings of a technical conference; 1987 July 6–9; Silver Creek, CO. Gen. Tech. Rep. RM-149. Fort Collins, CO: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Forest and Range Experiment Station: 113–122 Deer mice were trapped in four of six forest communities in eastern Washington and northern Idaho, and they were the only rodent in ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) savanna. In northern New England deer mice are present in both coniferous and deciduous forests. Deer mice are often the only Peromyscus species in northern boreal forest. Subspecies differ in their use of plant communities and vegetation structures. There are two main groups of deer mouse: the prairie deer mouse and the woodland or forest deer mouse group.Whitaker, John O., Jr. (1980). National Audubon Society field guide to North American mammals. New York: Alfred A. Knopf, Inc. Cover requirements Deer mice are often active in open habitat; most subspecies do not develop hidden runways the way many voles (Microtus and Clethrionomys spp.) do.Wagg, J. W. Bruce. (1964). White spruce regeneration on the Peace and Slave River lowlands. Publ. No. 1069. Ottawa, ON: Canadian Department of Forestry, Forest Research Branch In open habitat within forests deer mice have a tendency to visit the nearest timber. In central Ontario deer mice used downed wood for runways. Deer mice nest in burrows dug in the ground or construct nests in raised areas such as brush piles, logs, rocks, stumps, under bark, and in hollows in trees. Nests are also constructed in various structures and artifacts including old boards and abandoned vehicles. Nests have been found up to above the ground in Douglas-fir trees.Maser, Chris; Mate, Bruce R.; Franklin, Jerry F.; Dyrness, C. T. (1981). Natural history of Oregon Coast mammals. Gen. Tech. Rep. PNW-133. Portland, OR: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Pacific Northwest Forest and Range Experiment Station. Predators Deer mice are important prey for snakes (Viperidae), owls (Strigidae), mink (Neovison vison), marten (Martes americana) and other weasels (Mustelidae), skunks (Mephites and Spilogale spp.), bobcat (Lynx rufus), domestic cat (Felis catus), coyote (Canis latrans), foxes (Vulpes and Urocyon spp.), and ringtail (Bassariscus astutus). Deer mice are also parasitized by Cuterebra fontinella. Diet Deer mice are omnivorous; the main dietary items usually include seeds, fruits, arthropods, leaves, and fungi; fungi have the least amount of intake. Throughout the year, the deer mouse will change its eating habits to reflect on what is available to eat during that season. During winter months, the arthropods compose of one-fifth of the deer mouse's food. These include spiders, caterpillars, and heteropterans. During the spring months, seeds become available to eat, along with insects, which are consumed in large quantities. Leaves are also found in the stomachs of deer mice in the spring seasons. During summer months, the mouse consumes seeds and fruits. During the fall season, the deer mouse will slowly change its eating habits to resemble the winter's diet.

It was created by William G M Leslie and Thomas R Carbone. The first version was programmed in valFORTH on an Atari 800, based on a board game created by Leslie. It was Omnitrend's first game.  Gameplay  The game starts off on the planet Axia within the Local Group, a settlement that took place centuries ago thanks to the discovery of an alien hyperspace booster. This technology allowed the Local Group to be settled with supplies being sent from Earth using the booster. However, the supplies have stopped arriving and the player must now search for a second hyperspace booster that was reported in the area. The game begins with a loan from the bank to finance a spaceship. Several models are available and offer different capabilities and cargo space. Once the ship is purchased and outfitted, the player then travels to different planets and engages in trading, mining, or piracy. Universe is a very involving game, like requiring the player to calculate hyperjump coordinates for the navigation computer and calculate minimum orbits for planets in order to launch shuttles. The speed of the game tended to bog down when graphics were involved and when the game performed calculations involving orbital mechanics. On the Atari, having only one disk drive resulted in numerous disk swaps.  Release  The game came on four disks and included in the US$89.95 cost was two free hours a month on the Universe BBS. Upon mailing in the included warranty card, users were also mailed subsequent versions of the game on replacement disks, based on suggestions from the BBS. Computer Gaming World praised this dedication to customer service. Reception St.Game in 1984 criticized Universe for the Atari's slow performance, stating that \\"a lethargic running speed and endless disk swaps make it very, very slow going ... slow graphics routines tediously draw pictures that have no bearing on the game\\". The magazine concluded that \\"The concept, imagination, and detail behind Universe are superb. Were it not for the slow speed, it would be a perfect game\\", but the slow speed made it unplayable. Computer Gaming World in 1984 published two reviews of Universe. One reviewer found it to be \\"an absorbing game, at least for another six months\\" given how easy it was to be lose sight of the original objective by either trading or piracy. He also praised the detailed documentation and backstory, and concluded that \\"this is a 'must have' game for those of you who are interested in complex simulations and role playing. The graphics are excellent, the game play is realistic, and the basic premise makes sense\\". The other reviewer similarly praised the game, concluding that it was \\"an excellent interactive space adventure with 3D graphics that will give you months of enjoyment and headaches\\". In a 1992 survey of science fiction games the magazine gave the title three of five stars, writing that it was \\"Still one of the early classics\\". A 1994 survey of strategic space games set in the year 2000 and later gave the game three-plus stars out of five. Jerry Pournelle in BYTE called Universe \\"the most complicated game I ever did see ... a lot of good planning in this game, and I'm impressed\\", but criticized the incomplete documentation and user interface. Legacy The game spawned two sequels on the Atari ST and other platforms, Universe II (1986) which was broadly similar and took place 20 years after the events in the first game, and Universe III (1989) which used the original games backstory but was an adventure game.

Biography Rindisbacher emigrated from Switzerland to western Canada with his family when he was fifteen. The family was recruited by an agent of Red River Colony, established by the Earl of Selkirk, to settle the area located near present-day Winnipeg, Manitoba. Lord Selkirk's land grant, called Assiniboia, was administered by a governor and council but, as all the colony's officials had connections with the Hudson's Bay Company, the colony was effectively an arm of Hudson's Bay's operations. The colony faced difficulties due to a disastrous flood of the Red River, on the eastern boundary of North Dakota north to Lake Winnipeg, which led to damaged crops and starvation. The Rindisbacher family relocated to Wisconsin in 1826, and then settled permanently in St. Louis, Missouri, in 1829.Rindisbacher's biography at the Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online Career From the age of fifteen until his death, possibly of cholera, at age 28, Rindisbacher was a producing artist. He began working with charcoal as a young boy, with the encouragement of his father, and received one year of formal training with artist Jakob Samuel Weibel in Switzerland. He executed sketches and watercolors of his family's journey from Europe to western Canada, life and company officials in the Red River Colony, and Indians and animals in west- central Canada and the midwestern United States, including the Chippewa and Metis people living along the Red River Trails. At age twenty-three, upon moving to St. Louis, Rindisbacher established an artist's studio, where he also produced illustrations for magazines and book covers, and contributed to the History of the Indian Tribes of North America collection.

At the time, George Catlin, who is often given credit for being the first professional painter to depict the American Indians of the Great Plains, was only four years through his six years of western expeditions in 1830-1836. As a professional painter, Rindisbacher preceded Catlin in the west by at least ten years, and is considered the first resident professional artist west of the Great Lakes. Rindisbacher is known to have produced more than 124 paintings during his career. Forty of his artworks are currently held by the Library and Archives of Canada, Ottawa. Other large concentrations of his paintings are located in the collections of the West Point Museum of the United States Military Academy and the Gilcrease Museum in Tulsa, Oklahoma.

Wallis was born in London on 21 February 1830, but his father's name and occupation are unknown. When in 1845 his mother, Mary Anne Thomas, married Andrew Wallis, a prosperous London architect, Henry took his stepfather's surname. His artistic training was thorough and influential. He was admitted as a probationer to the RA and enrolled in the Painting School in March 1848. He also studied in Paris at Charles Gleyre's atelier and at the Academie des Beaux Arts, sometime between 1849 and 1853. Gerard Johnson carving Shakespeare's funerary monument. Ben Jonson shows Shakespeare's death mask to the sculptor. Wallis is best remembered for his first great success, The Death of Chatterton, which he exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1856. The painting depicted the impoverished late 18th-century poet Thomas Chatterton, who poisoned himself in despair at the age of seventeen, and was considered a Romantic hero for many young and struggling artists in Wallis's day. His method and style in Chatterton reveal the importance of his connection to the Pre-Raphaelite movement, seen in the vibrant colours and careful build-up of symbolic detail. He used a bold colour scheme with a contrasting palette and he exploited the fall of the natural light through the window of the garret to implement his much loved style at the time, chiaroscuro. The size of Chatterton's garret was only fractionally larger than the scope of the painting, with room for Wallis and his easel and little else during the preliminary sketches, which were done on-site. The painting is 25x37\\" and is in the Tate Britain, with other versions in the Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery and the Yale Center for British Art.Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery page There may have been more examples of Chatterton as it was popular and when Wallis had to pay the rent he would paint another version. He once said that dead poets are more saleable than dead labourers (referring to The Stonebreaker) His next major work, The Stonebreaker (1857, exhibited in 1858), consolidated his reputation as a true Pre-Raphaelite.Robin Hamlin: Henry Wallis, in: Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, vol. 57, London 2004, S. 14. In total, he showed 35 exhibits at the RA, but later in life developed a greater interest in watercolour painting. He was elected a full member of the RWS (Royal Watercolour Society) in 1878 and exhibited over 80 watercolours at the society. The model for his acclaimed The Death of Chatterton was the young George Meredith, whose first wife Mary Ellen would later run off with Wallis. Wallis' method of painting, especially in the early years of his career, and in particular on \\"Death of Chatterton\\", was to do the initial sketch, saturate it in water, use a grey tint to block in the shade, put on the colour and allow it to dry. When firm, he would use a hair pencil to add in the details, for which he is so renowned. For the light, he would touch the area in question with water and then rub it with a piece of bread. His studio during these years was in Chelsea, a very bohemian and out of the way part of London at the time. He died, almost blind, at 1 Walpole Road, Croydon, on 20 December 1916.

Specific areas of application include, but are not limited to, radiation protection and dosimetry, radiation shielding, radiography, medical physics, nuclear criticality safety, detector design and analysis, nuclear oil well logging, accelerator target design, fission and fusion reactor design, decontamination and decommissioning. The code treats an arbitrary three-dimensional configuration of materials in geometric cells bounded by first- and second-degree surfaces and fourth-degree elliptical tori. Point-wise cross section data are typically used, although group-wise data also are available. For neutrons, all reactions given in a particular cross-section evaluation (such as ENDF/B-VI) are accounted for. Thermal neutrons are described by both the free gas and S(α,β) models. For photons, the code accounts for incoherent and coherent scattering, the possibility of fluorescent emission after photoelectric absorption, absorption in pair production with local emission of annihilation radiation, and bremsstrahlung. A continuous-slowing-down model is used for electron transport that includes positrons, k x-rays, and bremsstrahlung but does not include external or self-induced fields. Important standard features that make MCNP very versatile and easy to use include a powerful general source, criticality source, and surface source; both geometry and output tally plotters; a rich collection of variance reduction techniques; a flexible tally structure; and an extensive collection of cross-section data. MCNP contains numerous flexible tallies: surface current & flux, volume flux (track length), point or ring detectors, particle heating, fission heating, pulse height tally for energy or charge deposition, mesh tallies, and radiography tallies. The key value MCNP provides is a predictive capability that can replace expensive or impossible- to-perform experiments. It is often used to design large-scale measurements providing a significant time and cost savings to the community. LANL's latest version of the MCNP code, version 6.2, represents one piece of a set of synergistic capabilities each developed at LANL; it includes evaluated nuclear data (ENDF) and the data processing code, NJOY. The international user community’s high confidence in MCNP’s predictive capabilities are based on its performance with verification and validation test suites, comparisons to its predecessor codes, automated testing, underling high quality nuclear and atomic databases and significant testing by its users.  History  The Monte Carlo method for radiation particle transport has its origins at LANL dates back to 1946. The creators of these methods were Drs. Stanislaw Ulam, John von Neumann, Robert Richtmyer, and Nicholas Metropolis. Monte Carlo for radiation transport was conceived by Stanislaw Ulam in 1946 while playing Solitaire while recovering from an illness. \\"After spending a lot of time trying to estimate success by combinatorial calculations, I wondered whether a more practical method...might be to lay it out say one hundred times and simply observe and count the number of successful plays.\\" In 1947, John von Neumann sent a letter to Robert Richtmyer proposing the use of a statistical method to solve neutron diffusion and multiplication problems in fission devices. His letter contained an 81-step pseudo code and was the first formulation of a Monte Carlo computation for an electronic computing machine. Von Neumann's assumptions were: time-dependent, continuous-energy, spherical but radially- varying, one fissionable material, isotropic scattering and fission production, and fission multiplicities of 2, 3, or 4. He suggested 100 neutrons each to be run for 100 collisions and estimated the computational time to be five hours on ENIAC. Richtmyer proposed suggestions to allow for multiple fissionable materials, no fission spectrum energy dependence, single neutron multiplicity, and running the computation for computer time and not for the number of collisions. The code was finalized in December 1947. The first calculations were run in April/May 1948 on ENIAC. While waiting for ENIAC to be physically relocated, Enrico Fermi invented a mechanical device called FERMIAC to trace neutron movements through fissionable materials by the Monte Carlo method. Monte Carlo methods for particle transport have been driving computational developments since the beginning of modern computers; this continues today. In the 1950s and 1960s, these new methods were organized into a series of special-purpose Monte Carlo codes, including MCS, MCN, MCP, and MCG. These codes were able to transport neutrons and photons for specialized LANL applications. In 1977, these separate codes were combined to create the first generalized Monte Carlo radiation particle transport code, MCNP. In 1977, MCNP was first created by merging MCNG with MCP to create MCNP. The first release of the MCNP code was version 3 and was released in 1983. It is distributed by the Radiation Safety Information Computational Center in Oak Ridge, TN. Monte Carlo N-Particle eXtended Monte Carlo N-Particle eXtended (MCNPX) was also developed at Los Alamos National Laboratory, and is capable of simulating particle interactions of 34 different types of particles (nucleons and ions) and 2000+ heavy ions at nearly all energies, including those simulated by MCNP. Both codes can be used to judge whether or not nuclear systems are critical and to determine doses from sources, among other things. MCNP6 is a merger of MCNP5 and MCNPX.

Route 30 runs roughly parallel to the Massachusetts Turnpike and Route 9, but unlike those two larger highways, takes a more meandering path from town to town. Between Boston and the Charles River it is known as Commonwealth Avenue, along most of this route is part of the course of the Boston Marathon. Route 30 has two interchanges with the Mass Pike, at Exits 13 in Framingham and 14/15 in Weston; the latter also includes the junction with Interstate 95 (Route 128). It also has two interchanges with Route 9, one in Westborough and one at the Southborough-Framingham border (where the two highways have an interchange without actually crossing), as well as a section further east in Framingham that runs concurrently with Route 9, for a total of four junctions between Routes 9 and 30. Route description Eastbound in Southborough Route 30 begins in North Grafton at Route 122, where it shares a roadway briefly with Route 140. The route travels northeast, passing the Tufts University Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine. The road continues into Westborough, where it crosses Route 135 at a rotary and interchanges with Route 9 to the northeast. After crossing Route 9, Route 30 turns eastward, crossing underneath Interstate 495 without an interchange. The route continues east into Southborough, where it crosses Route 85. Route 30 interchanges once again with Route 9 (without actually crossing it) and continues to parallel the highway into Framingham. In Framingham, Route 30 joins Route 9 in an approximately one-mile concurrency, and leaves via an interchange with Route 126 (heading eastward, there is a very brief concurrency between routes 30 and 126; heading westward, Route 30 joins Route 9 one block west of the Route 126 interchange). Route 30 continues to the northeast and interchanges with the Massachusetts Turnpike. Route 30 continues northeast, crossing over the Mass. Pike, and very briefly entering Natick before entering Wayland. In Wayland, Route 30 crosses Route 27 and continues northeast, very closely paralleling the Mass Pike. Route 30 continues into Weston, where it enters a large interchange with the Mass. Pike and Interstate 95 (Route 128). Upon crossing over I-95 and the Charles River, there is a drastic change in scenery as one crosses from Boston's suburbs to the metropolitan area. With this, Route 30 enters Newton, crossing over the Mass Pike again and then crossing Route 16. Route 30 winds to the east, passing Boston College in Chestnut Hill and entering the Boston neighborhood of Brighton.

He is a founding advisor to Alpha Phi Omega.  Early life and career  Wyland was born in Jewell County, Kansas. He moved to Ringwood, Oklahoma, in 1902. In 1908 and 1909 he attended the high school in Greenville, Texas, later moving to Danville, Illinois, where he graduated from high school in 1911. Four years later he graduated from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, with a degree of A.B. and honors in psychology. He then attended the Garrett Seminary in Evanston, Illinois, and received his B.D. degree in 1918. Taking postgraduate courses, he received his M.A. degree in 1929 and his Ph.D. in 1934 from Columbia University. His family included his wife, the former Miss Ruby Arnold, and their son, Ray O. Wyland Jr. Serving as managing director of the United American in Illinois from 1919 to 1922, Wyland conducted a training school in Americanization work which resulted in the naturalization of 20,000 aliens. He helped 'Americanize' several hundred thousand foreign-born.  Boy Scouts of America  Wyland became affiliated with the National Council of the Boy Scouts of America on August 1, 1922 and was connected with the National Council throughout the intervening years. He started as national director of relationships for what was first called the \\"Bureau of Church Relations\\" then later the \\"Relationships Division\\". He would also become acting director of education in 1925, then director of education in 1930. He would hold these positions until 1952. As director of relationships, Wyland coordinated the work of Protestant, Catholic, Jewish, Latter-day Saint, and other religious groups in their Scouting participation, also educational institutions, civic groups, service clubs, fraternal bodies and parent institutions which sponsored Scout Troops and Cub Packs. As director of education, he edited Principles of Scoutmastership (first training material for Scoutmasters in the early 1930s) and other publications. His doctoral dissertation was Scouting in the Schools: A Study of the Relationships Between the Schools and the Boy Scouts of America. His dissertation advisor was Dr. Elbert K. Fretwell, who would become the BSA's second Chief Scout Executive. It was first published in book form in 1934 by Teacher College Press, part of Columbia University.http://catalog.loc.gov/cgi- bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?v1=1&ti;=1,1&Search;%5FArg=Wyland%2C%20Ray%20O%2E&Search;%5FCode=NAME%5F&CNT;=25&PID;=24327&SEQ;=20071208111448&SID;=3 Library of Congress Entry for Scouting in the Schools: A Study of the Relationships Between the Schools and the Boy Scouts of America In 1937 J. S. Wilson met with Gunnar Berg and Wyland at Balboa, Panama, on his way to Bogotá, for a conference about mixed-race Scouts in the Panama Canal Zone, who claimed British and not Panamanian nationality. It was agreed that they should be taken under the wing of the Canal Zone Council of the Boy Scouts of America, but in 1947 they were transferred directly under the International Bureau as the International Boy Scouts of the Canal Zone.Wilson p. 134, 233  Other positions  Wyland was a trustee of the Washington Square Methodist Church in New York City, president of the New York Rotary Club, president of the Strathmore Association of Westchester County, gave leadership in Red Cross, U.S.O., Community Chest campaigns and was a captain in the Auxiliary Police in World War II.  Alpha Phi Omega  Wyland is a charter member of Alpha chapter of Alpha Phi Omega, having served as Scout Advisor from the inception of the Fraternity. He played a large role in the development of operating policies, constitution and bylaws of Alpha Phi Omega and devising the fourfold program of service for Alpha Phi Omega. His attendance at all of the National Conventions through at least 1951 helped with this endeavor. In 1930, when application was made for approval of Alpha Phi Omega by the National Council of the Boy Scouts of America, Dr. Wyland worked hand in hand with Dr. H. Roe Bartle in presenting the facts which brought about a favorable decision and gave Alpha Phi Omega the official sanction of the Scouting Movement. He was honored by Alpha Phi Omega by dedicating the 1951 Fall Pledge class to him. He was awarded the National Distinguished Service Award by Alpha Phi Omega in 1956. He represented the National Fraternity at the chartering of a large number of chapters in the Northeast in the 1940s and 1950s.

Adapiforms radiated throughout much of the northern continental mass (now Europe, Asia and North America), reaching as far south as northern Africa and tropical Asia. They existed from the Eocene to the Miocene epoch. Some adapiforms resembled living lemurs. Adapiforms are known from the fossil record only, and it is unclear whether they form a monophyletic or paraphyletic group. When assumed to be a clade, they are usually grouped under the \\"wet-nosed\\" taxon Strepsirrhini, which would make them more closely related to the lemurs and less so to the \\"dry- nosed\\" Haplorhini taxon that includes monkeys and apes.Callum Ross, Richard F. Kay, Anthropoid origins: new visions, Springer, 2004, , p. 100 In 2009, Franzen and colleagues placed the newly described genus Darwinius in the \\"Adapoidea group of early primates representative of early haplorhine diversification\\" so that, according to these authors, the adapiforms would not be within the Strepsirrhini lineage as hitherto assumed but qualify as a stem \\"missing link\\" between Strepsirrhini and Haplorrhini. However, subsequent analysis on the Darwinius fossil by Erik Seiffert and colleagues rejects this \\"missing link\\" idea, classifying Darwinius and other adapiforms within the Strepsirrhini. Boyer et al. found that the crown Strepsirrhini likely emerged deep in the Adapiformes tree, possibly as sister of a group which include e.g. Aframonius and Notharctidae. The Adapiformes are thus found not to be literally extinct (in the sense of having no living descendants), and becomes a junior synonym to the Strepsirrhini. Below is a simplified cladogram. A 2018 study puts Donrussellia as sister to crown primates.  Classification  Adapiforms belong to the infraorder Adapiformes, which contains a single superfamily, Adapoidea. The group also is sometimes treated as a superfamily (Adapoidea) alongside the other living strepsirrhine superfamilies, Lemuroidea (lemurs) and Lorisoidea (lorises and galagos). *Infraorder Adapiformes **Superfamily Adapoidea ***Family Notharctidae ***Family Sivaladapidae ***Family Adapidae *Infraorder incertae sedis **Superfamily incertae sedis ***Family Azibiidae ***Family Djebelemuridae Rose (1995) suggests that early adapiformes and omoyiformes shared a common ancestor dating to the Thanetian age.

Life He was born in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, the eldest child of a Presbyterian minister and his wife. He attended high school in Port of Spain Trinidad while his father was posted there and won a scholarship to the University of Edinburgh in Scotland. He graduated MA in 1889 and then spent three years at the divinity school of the Free Church of Scotland. Falconer was ordained in 1892 but never held a clerical position. He returned to Canada that year and took a lecturership in New Testament Greek and exegesis at the Presbyterian college in Halifax, Nova Scotia. He also began to publish articles in learned journals. In 1907 he became president of the University of Toronto. He steered a middle path, combining pure scholarship with practicality. Thus he introduced more vocational subjects, while also developing higher degree programmes. He sought to maximise the independence of the university, battling unsuccessfully to retain German faculty members in 1914. Nonetheless he was knighted in 1917 for his advocacy of wartime recruitment. Falconer believed in the need to increase public awareness of, and accessibility to, Canada's historical records. He was a long time member of The Champlain Society's Council, serving as its Vice- President (1909-1935) and President (1936-42). Falconer wrote several books on current affairs, including The German Tragedy and its Meaning for Canada (1915), Idealism in National Character (1920) and The United States as a Neighbour (1926). He was an advocate of broad cooperation between the English speaking nations in international affairs, but was concerned to avoid American dominance of these relationships. Ill health obliged him to decline the principalship of the University of Edinburgh in 1929, and he retired in 1932. However he continued his scholarly work, producing Pastoral Epistles, his most notable work of religious scholarship in 1937.

In the fifth century, the ceremony of the oils was transferred from the Easter Vigil to Holy Thursday during a special Mass for that purpose, distinct from the Mass of the Lord's Supper. The change took place, partly, because of the large crowds that assembled for the Easter Vigil, but also to emphasize Christ's institution of this ordained priesthood at Holy Thursday's Last Supper.\\"Chrism Mass\\", Catholic Review, Archdiocese of Baltimore, March 27, 2008 In the decree renewing this rite Pope Paul VI said:“The Chrism Mass is one of the principal expressions of the fullness of the bishop’s priesthood and signifies the closeness of the priests with him.” The Holy Oils are: * Chrism – used in the sacraments of Baptism, Confirmation and Holy Orders, as well as for the consecration of altars and the dedication of churches.\\"Chrism Mass 2017\\", St. James Cathedral, Seattle, April 6, 2017 * the oil of catechumens – also used in the sacrament of Baptism, and * the oil of the sick – used in the rite of the Anointing of the Sick Blessing Chrism The oil of the catechumens and chrism are used on the upcoming Holy Saturday at the Easter Vigil, for the baptism and confirmation of those entering the church. While the Oil of the Catechumens and the Oil of the Sick, are simply \\"blessed,\\" the Sacred Chrism is \\"consecrated,\\". Holy chrism is a mixture of olive oil and balsam, an aromatic resin. Balsam is poured into the oil, which gives it a sweet smell intended to remind those who encounter it of the \\"odor of sanctity\\" to which those who are marked with it, are called to strive. The bishop breathes over the vessel containing the chrism, a gesture which symbolizes the Holy Spirit coming down to consecrate this oil, and recalls the actions of Jesus in John 20:22, when he breathed on the apostles and said, \\"Receive the Holy Spirit...\\" The priests concelebrating the Mass extend their hands toward the vessel containing the chrism and say the prayer of consecration silently as the bishop pronounces it over the chrism. Anglicanism The 1979 BCP (p. 307) calls for chrism to be consecrated by the bishop. This may be done when the bishop is present in the parish for Confirmation. In many dioceses, the consecration of chrism by the bishop may be done at a service of reaffirmation of ordination vows during Holy Week. Similar to the Roman Catholic ritual, during the Chrism Eucharist, the Bishop will bless the oils used throughout the next year for baptisms and healing. In addition, the Bishop and clergy in attendance will reaffirm their Ordination Vows.

It is directly preceded within the chronology of the Star Wars expanded universe by The Truce at Bakura and is followed in the Jedi Prince series by The Lost City of the Jedi. Summary After the destruction of the second Death Star and the death of the Emperor, the Empire is left without a true leader. The Supreme Prophet Kadann prophesied that the next leader of the Empire would wear the indestructible right hand Glove of Darth Vader, so Imperial senator Timothy Barclay sends Captain Dunwell to find the glove. The Rebel Alliance and the Senate's Planetary Intelligence Network known as SPIN, hoping to find information on the new emperor, send C-3PO and R2-D2 disguised to the planet Kessel. There they discover Grand Moff Hissa introducing Trioculus, who claims to be Palpatine's son, as the heir to Empire. Although he manages to trick his followers by seemingly producing Force lightning, he demands that his advisors find the glove so he can cement his power. After much searching and no clues on the glove's whereabouts, Captain Dunwell, the head of the Whaladon Processing Center on Mon Calamari, contacts him to inform him that he has found the glove, deep in the oceans of Mon Calamari. By chance, Luke Skywalker and Admiral Ackbar, after picking up the droids from Kessel, bring them to Mon Calamari to download the information that R2-D2 found. Although the whaling ship is destroyed and Captain Dunwell killed, Luke is unable to stop Trioculus from obtaining the glove and becoming the new Emperor. As he parts ways with Luke, Trioculus swears he will destroy him.

It enters the Missouri at Sioux City, and is named for Charles Floyd, a member of the Lewis and Clark Expedition. Course The Floyd River rises in northwestern O'Brien County near the town of Sanborn and flows generally southwestwardly through Sioux, Plymouth and Woodbury counties, past the towns of Sheldon, Hospers, Alton, Le Mars, Merill, and Hinton. At Merrill the Floyd collects its largest tributary, the West Branch Floyd River, which is about 40 mi (65 km) long. The West Branch rises near Boyden in northeastern Sioux County and flows generally southward into Plymouth County, past Maurice and Struble. The Floyd enters Woodbury County near the Leeds neighborhood of Sioux City. The Floyd River has come out of its banks on several occasions, causing disastrous flooding in Sioux City in 1892 and 1953. The river has since been the focus of an intensive flood control project. The Floyd's lower channel through Sioux City has been straightened, channelized, lined with riprap and banked by a high earthen levee. The Floyd River is the site of frequent fish kills caused by runoff of massive amounts of animal waste from farm feedlots into the river.\\"Threatening Iowa's Future\\".

On August 19, 1804, just three months into the two-year journey, Floyd became violently ill and died the next day of what is believed to have been a ruptured appendix. He was buried on a hill overlooking an unnamed river on the Iowa side of the Missouri River. In his honor, the expedition's leaders, Meriwether Lewis and William Clark, named the river Floyd River and the hill Floyd's Bluff. Floyd was the expedition's only casualty, despite the many dangers encountered in the 8,000 miles traveled in reaching the Pacific Ocean and returning to St. Louis.

Since 2009 it is known as Bogdan Motors Assembly Plant #1. History The factory was founded in 1951, and was known as LARZ (Lutskyi AvtoRemontnyi Zavod, Lutsk Automobile Repair Plant) and from 1955 as LuMZ (Lutskyi Mashynobudivnyi Zavod, Lutsk Machinebuilding Plant).Thompson, Andy. Cars of the Soviet Union (Haynes Publishing, Somerset, UK, 2008), p.93. Along with truck repairs, the early products of this relatively small plant were mobile repair shop and refrigerated truck bodies on Moskvitch, ZIL, and UAZ frames.Thompson, p.93. Its first original design is the sturdy and simple LuAZ-967 off-road vehicle for the Red Army.Thompson, p.93. It originated after the Korean War, when the Soviets saw a need for small off-road vehicles comparable to the American Jeep, to supplement the overly-large and -heavy GAZ-69s then in service.Thompson, p.93. Developed at NAMI (the National Automobile Institute), the prototype, known as NAMI 049, was completed in 1958.Thompson, p.93. LuAZ's civilian products suffered such a reputation for poor quality, \\"for a time the LuAZ was the only car that could be bought off the shelf by Soviet motorists\\".Thompson, p.93. =Mergers and acquisitions= The abbreviation of LuAZ exists since 1967. The company was once part of AvtoZAZ holding, but now is a part of the Bogdan group, which also controls bus manufacturing facilities in Cherkasy. In 2005, LuAZ commenced assembly of Hyundai and Kia cars from kits, with production set to further expand in 2006. =Recent developments= A major expansion program is planned, which will see construction of a new car manufacturing facility in Cherkasy including a new paint shop, with planned annual assembly of around 60,000 Ladas and 60,000 Hyundais and Kias from 2007. Passenger car production will be transferred from Luts'k to Cherkasy, while bus production will move to Luts'k. =Incidents= From the period of 1984 through 2002, 67 people were killed by faulty exhaust systems. Apparently, toxic carbon monoxide entered the cabin via the ventilation vents and asphyxiated the occupants. LuAZ vehicles have been notorious for poor crash test ratings.

He is considered the first mathematician to systematically use and accept irrational numbers as solutions and coefficients to equations. His mathematical techniques were later adopted by Fibonacci, thus allowing Abu Kamil an important part in introducing algebra to Europe. Abu Kamil made important contributions to algebra and geometry. He was the first Islamic mathematician to work easily with algebraic equations with powers higher than x^2 (up to x^8), and solved sets of non-linear simultaneous equations with three unknown variables. He illustrated the rules of signs for expanding the multiplication (a \\\\pm b)(c \\\\pm d). He also enumerated all the possible solutions to some of his problems. He wrote all problems rhetorically, and some of his books lacked any mathematical notation beside those of integers. For example, he uses the Arabic expression \\"māl māl shayʾ\\" (\\"square-square-thing\\") for x^5 (as x^5 = x^2\\\\cdot x^2\\\\cdot x). The muslim encyclopedist Ibn Khaldūn classified Abū Kāmil as the second greatest algebraist chronologically after al-Khwarizmi.  Life  Almost nothing is known about the life and career of Abu Kamil except that he was a successor of al-Khwarizmi, whom he never personally met. Works Book of Algebra (Kitāb fī al-jabr wa al-muqābala) = The Algebra is perhaps Abu Kamil's most influential work, which he intended to supersede and expand upon that of Al-Khwarizmi. Whereas the Algebra of al- Khwarizmi was geared towards the general public, Abu Kamil was addressing other mathematicians, or readers familiar with Euclid's Elements. In this book Abu Kamil solves systems of equations whose solutions are whole numbers and fractions, and accepted irrational numbers (in the form of a square root or fourth root) as solutions and coefficients to quadratic equations. The first chapter teaches algebra by solving problems of application to geometry, often involving an unknown variable and square roots. The second chapter deals with the six types of problems found in Al-Khwarizmi's book, but some of which, especially those of x^2, were now worked out directly instead of first solving for x and accompanied with geometrical illustrations and proofs. The third chapter contains examples of quadratic irrationalities as solutions and coefficients. The fourth chapter shows how these irrationalities are used to solve problems involving polygons. The rest of the book contains solutions for sets of indeterminate equations, problems of application in realistic situations, and problems involving unrealistic situations intended for recreational mathematics. A number of Islamic mathematicians wrote commentaries on this work, including al-Iṣṭakhrī al-Ḥāsib and ʿAli ibn Aḥmad al-ʿImrānī (d. 955-6), but both commentaries are now lost. In Europe, similar material to this book is found in the writings of Fibonacci, and some sections were incorporated and improved upon in the Latin work of John of Seville, Liber mahameleth. A partial translation to Latin was done in the 14th century by William of Luna, and in the 15th century the whole work also appeared in a Hebrew translation by Mordekhai Finzi. = Book of Rare Things in the Art of Calculation (Kitāb al-ṭarā’if fi’l-ḥisāb) = Abu Kamil describes a number of systematic procedures for finding integral solutions for indeterminate equations. It is also the earliest known Arabic work where solutions are sought to the type of indeterminate equations found in Diophantus's Arithmetica. However, Abu Kamil explains certain methods not found in any extant copy of the Arithmetica. He also describes one problem for which he found 2,678 solutions. = On the Pentagon and Decagon (Kitāb al-mukhammas wa’al-mu‘ashshar) = In this treatise algebraic methods are used to solve geometrical problems. Abu Kamil uses the equation x^4 + 3125 = 125x^2 to calculate a numerical approximation for the side of a regular pentagon in a circle of diameter 10. He also uses the golden ratio in some of his calculations. Fibonacci knew about this treatise and made extensive use of it in his Practica geometriae. = Book of Birds (Kitāb al-ṭair) = A small treatise teaching how to solve indeterminate linear systems with positive integral solutions. The title is derived from a type of problems known in the east which involve the purchase of different species of birds. Abu Kamil wrote in the introduction: > I found myself before a problem that I solved and for which I discovered a > great many solutions; looking deeper for its solutions, I obtained two > thousand six hundred and seventy-six correct ones. My astonishment about > that was great, but I found out that, when I recounted this discovery, those > who did not know me were arrogant, shocked, and suspicious of me. I thus > decided to write a book on this kind of calculations, with the purpose of > facilitating its treatment and making it more accessible. According to Jacques Sesiano, Abu Kamil remained seemingly unparalleled throughout the Middle Ages in trying to find all the possible solutions to some of his problems. = On Measurement and Geometry (Kitāb al-misāḥa wa al- handasa) = A manual of geometry for non-mathematicians, like land surveyors and other government officials, which presents a set of rules for calculating the volume and surface area of solids (mainly rectangular parallelepipeds, right circular prisms, square pyramids, and circular cones). The first few chapters contain rules for determining the area, diagonal, perimeter, and other parameters for different types of triangles, rectangles and squares. = Lost works = Some of Abu Kamil's lost works include: * A treatise on the use of double false position, known as the Book of the Two Errors (Kitāb al- khaṭaʾayn). Available online at: http://facstaff.uindy.edu/~oaks/Biblio/COMHISMA8paper.doc and * Book on Augmentation and Diminution (Kitāb al-jamʿ wa al-tafrīq), which gained more attention after historian Franz Woepcke linked it with an anonymous Latin work, Liber augmenti et diminutionis. * Book of Estate Sharing using Algebra (Kitāb al-waṣāyā bi al-jabr wa al-muqābala), which contains algebraic solutions for problems of Islamic inheritance and discusses the opinions of known jurists. Ibn al-Nadim in his Fihrist listed the following additional titles: Book of Fortune (Kitāb al-falāḥ), Book of the Key to Fortune (Kitāb miftāḥ al-falāḥ), Book of the Adequate (Kitāb al-kifāya), and Book of the Kernel (Kitāb al-ʿasīr).  Legacy  The works of Abu Kamil influenced other mathematicians, like al-Karaji and Fibonacci, and as such had a lasting impact on the development of algebra. Many of his examples and algebraic techniques were later copied by Fibonacci in his Practica geometriae and other works. Unmistakable borrowings, but without Abu Kamil being explicitly mentioned and perhaps mediated by lost treatises, are also found in Fibonacci's Liber Abaci. On al-Khwarizmi Abu Kamil was one of the earliest mathematicians to recognize al-Khwarizmi's contributions to algebra, defending him against Ibn Barza who attributed the authority and precedent in algebra to his grandfather, 'Abd al-Hamīd ibn Turk. Abu Kamil wrote in the introduction of his Algebra: > I have studied with great attention the writings of the mathematicians, > examined their assertions, and scrutinized what they explain in their works; > I thus observed that the book by Muḥammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī known as > Algebra is superior in the accuracy of its principle and the exactness of > its argumentation. It thus behooves us, the community of mathematicians, to > recognize his priority and to admit his knowledge and his superiority, as in > writing his book on algebra he was an initiator and the discoverer of its > principles, ...

It occupies the old Rome Theater, a Spanish mission- style theater built in 1925. Along with independent and documentary films, the center hosts a variety of special events, including discussions with filmmakers, critics and people from the industry following some screenings. The New York Times has credited the theater with helping to revitalize the downtown area of Pleasantville History The Rome Theater, named after its owner Granville Rome, was originally built in 1925 and was the first movie theater in Westchester County. The theater matched the movie palace designs that were popular at the time, including leather seats, friezes, velvet curtains and an original Photolayer pipe organ. The Rome Theater continued screening movies until it closed in 1987 and became an office building. In 1998 Stephen Apkon and the non-profit Friends of the Rome Theater purchased the Rome Theater and a land parcel next door for $1 million. Over the next 3 years, another $4 million was spent for design and construction. The center opened its doors in June 2001 and covered including three theaters containing 249 seats, 135 and 72 seats. The theater was named in honor of Jacob Burns, a lawyer whose family foundation gave $1.5 million towards the renovation efforts. In 2008, the JBFC opened a $15 million Media Arts Lab and started new programs targeting digital literacy in the surrounding area. The opening of the 2008 center was part of the JBFC's larger digital literacy education efforts that included sending some staff down to prisons in Venezuela to teach prisoners and teachers there about digital literacy.

Towers stands at 6 ft 1 in tall, and weighs 188 lb. Professional careerBaltimore Orioles= Towers was drafted by the Baltimore Orioles in the 15th round of the 1996 Major League Baseball draft. In , Towers made his major league debut, compiling eight wins and ten losses while posting an ERA of 4.49 in 140.1 innings. Towers started with three straight losses along with two no-decisions in his first five games, giving up eleven home runs during that span. He would finish the year in the Orioles minor-league system. =Toronto Blue Jays= Towers signed with the Blue Jays as a minor league free agent for the season. Joining the team midway through the season, he would go on to have a very successful run, appearing in 14 games (eight starts). He would finish the year 8–1 with a 4.48 ERA. Unusually, while with the Blue Jays Towers was assigned the uniform number 7. This made him the only pitcher in the major leagues with a single-digit uniform number at that time, and the also first pitcher in Blue Jays history whose uniform number contained but a single digit. Though several dozen pitchers had worn a single digit uniform number for a span of several games, Towers was the first to wear it regularly over the course of several seasons since pitcher Ben Chapman (a converted outfielder) wore number 5 for the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1944-45.https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB111595287095932687 In , Towers became the Blue Jays' fifth starter, going a mediocre 9–9 with a 5.11 ERA in 21 games started. In , after ace Roy Halladay's leg was broken by a line drive, Towers was arguably Toronto's most dependable pitcher. Stepping up when the Blue Jays starting rotation seemed impossibly thin , he would finish the season with 13 wins, tied for the club lead (along with rookie Gustavo Chacín), Towers set career bests with a 3.71 ERA, 33 games started, and 208.2 innings pitched. Having been signed to a two-year, $5.2 million contract during the off-season as a reward for his impressive 2005 year, Towers started the new season 0–7, with an ERA of 10.09 in his first seven starts. On May 14, Towers pitched a good game against the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, throwing eight innings and allowing just two earned runs, leading the Jays to an 8–3 victory. It was his first victory of , but it would not translate into renewed confidence. Towers would go on to lose his eighth game of the season against the Colorado Rockies. The next game was another one against the Devil Rays, but he would leave the game after just innings completed, giving up four earned runs. On May 24, the Blue Jays demoted Towers to the Syracuse Chiefs. Towers would be recalled from Triple-A on June 20, but his struggles continued, and he was once again demoted to Syracuse on June 27. Following his poor 2006 season, Towers decided to train with teammate and fellow Las Vegas off-season resident Reed Johnson. Towers, along with John Thomson, Tomo Ohka, and Víctor Zambrano was one of the leading contenders to land one of two open spots in the Blue Jays rotation. During spring training, Towers was dominant, with only one bad outing during the spring. On March 31, it was announced that Towers had won the final spot in the Blue Jays' rotation to begin the season, although Blue Jays General Manager J. P. Ricciardi admitted that Towers would be \\"on a short leash\\". On April 28, after his third loss of the season, to the Texas Rangers, where he surrendered 5 runs in 1 inning, he was demoted to the bullpen. Víctor Zambrano was promoted in his place. (video) On July 8, Josh Towers pitched eight shutout innings, including innings of perfect ball and then watched the Blue Jays head into the all-star break on a high note with a 1–0 walk-off victory over the Cleveland Indians. Towers pitched no walks, three hits for the Jays. (video) During a game against the New York Yankees on August 7, 2007, Towers intentionally hit Alex Rodriguez with a pitch. Rodriguez approached the mound and the benches cleared. After Rodriguez took first, Towers heard Yankees first base coach Tony Peña \\"chirping\\" at him, which led to the benches clearing again. After the game, Towers called Pena a \\"quitter\\", referring to his resignation as the Kansas City Royals' manager in 2005, and said he is not in a position to run his mouth. Towers promptly surrendered two runs after the incident, lost the game and was moved, for the second time in the season, to the bullpen. =Colorado Rockies= On February 6, , Towers signed a one-year contract with the Colorado Rockies. He spent four months with the Rockies' Triple-A affiliate, the Colorado Springs Sky Sox. On July 26, he made himself a footnote in the record books when, during the second inning, he surrendered seven RBI and two home runs to Ryan Roberts of the Oklahoma RedHawks. =Washington Nationals= Towers as a non-roster invitee of the Washington Nationals in spring training After becoming a free agent, Towers signed a minor league contract with the Washington Nationals in January . He was released on May 5, 2009 after spending time with the Syracuse Chiefs. =New York Yankees= On May 10, 2009, he was signed to a minor league contract by the New York Yankees and sent to the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Yankees. On August 8, 2009 he was called and placed on the Yankees roster but was designated for assignment the following day to make room for newly acquired pitcher Chad Gaudin. Towers cleared waivers and was outrighted back to the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Yankees. On September 5, he was recalled to the Yankees. The following day he was called in to pitch in a relief appearance for the Yankees, and in doing so, became the 1,500th player to play in an official game for the franchise.http://yankees.lhblogs.com/2009/09/05/game-136-yankees-at-blue-jays/ He earned a World Series ring for his appearances with the club that season. http://voices.washingtonpost.com/baseball-insider/2010/03/the_least- deserved_world_serie.html =Los Angeles Dodgers= On December 11, 2009, Towers signed a minor league contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers. He was assigned to the Triple-A Albuquerque Isotopes to start the season. He made eight starts for the Isotopes and was 2-5 with an 8.05 ERA. He was released on May 20, 2010, one day after allowing nine runs and ten hits in the first two innings. =Guerreros de Oaxaca= He signed with Guerreros de Oaxaca in the Mexican Baseball League for 2011 and appeared in 4 games for them with a 7.94 ERA. =Camden Riversharks= After his release in Mexico he signed with the Independent Camden Riversharks. With Camden, he posted a record of 5-6, with a 6.15 ERA. On August 7, 2011, Towers announced his retirement from baseball. Towers is currently the color commentator of the UNLV Rebels Baseball team.

The club originally earned a reputation as one of Canada's hippest music clubs, \\"[...] Gowan, who, on the phone anyway, seems more the affable hockey-and-beer type than a denizen of such desperately hip clubs as Montreal's Beat and Toronto's Rivoli.\\" and many major Canadian comedy and musical performers have played on its stage, including The Kids in the Hall, Gordon Downie, The Frantics, Nirvanna The Band, Sean Cullen and the infamous Dark Shows. The Drowsy Chaperone premiered at the Rivoli and went on to subsequent productions and eventually a highly successful run on Broadway. History Established and owned by Andre Rosenbaum, David Stearn, and Jeff Strasburg, in the 1980s, the Rivoli was synonymous with Toronto's black-garbed Queen West scene (Mike Myers' Saturday Night Live German club character Dieter was inspired by a Rivoli waiter). This reputation waned as the club's clientele became more eclectic and upscale, but the Rivoli's atmosphere is still unique. Talent scouts for Montreal's Just For Laughs comedy festival and the major television networks still routinely troll the Monday night comedy shows. From 1987 to 1990 the Journal of Wild Culture held its regular avant-garde vaudeville nights, the Café of Wild Culture, featuring a mix of artists exploring the magazine's ecology and imagination mandate. Since the 1990s the Rivoli has been home to The ALTdot COMedy Lounge, Toronto's most popular alternative comedy show. In 2014, the original owners sold the business to Jenna Wood, Sarah Henning, and Jessica McHardy. Henning left the venture in early 2020; several months later amid the COVID-19 pandemic, remaining partners Wood and McHardy listed the business for sale for C$500,000. Venue Layout The venue is divided into three main areas, the front, the upstairs and the back. The front of the venue has a bar along most of its west wall. The east side of the front room, separated from the bar by a dividing wall, are tables for dining. Upstairs there is a pool hall with 11 vintage and antique tables. The space is large and sometimes dance nights or private parties are hosted there. The back room of the venue contains a stage at the back. There is a smaller bar in the back room, and some bar seating along the side walls. The audience area is sometimes open for standing room, sometimes tables and chairs are set up, and sometimes chairs are set up in rows. Seating is rarely assigned or reserved. Patrons are typically free to eat or drink in the front room without paying for admission to shows. The Rivoli's menu is known for an eclectic and upscale motif.

Manufactured by Bolliger & Mabillard, the ride opened in 1993. It stands tall and has a top speed of . Kumba features a total of seven inversions across the 3-minute ride. History Kumba was officially announced in November 1992 as a record-breaking Bolliger & Mabillard roller coaster set to become the park's signature attraction. The ride officially opened to the public on April 20, 1993. When Kumba opened, it featured the world's tallest vertical loop, and was also the tallest, fastest and longest roller coaster in Florida. In 1995, Kumba conceded the title of ride with the world's tallest vertical loop to Dragon Khan at PortAventura Park which features a vertical loop. In 1996, it conceded Florida's titles of tallest and longest roller coaster to Montu, a B&M; inverted coaster in the Egypt section of the park. In 1999, it conceded the fastest title to Islands of Adventure's The Incredible Hulk Coaster, yet another B&M; sitdown coaster. Characteristics The Kumba stands tall. With a top speed of , the ride features seven inversions including a vertical loop, a dive loop, a zero-g roll, a cobra roll and two interlocking corkscrews. The vertical loop featured on Kumba wraps around the lift hill. Kumba was the first ride in the world to feature a number of now-common roller coaster elements, including interlocking corkscrews and a dive loop. Riders of Kumba experience up to 3.8 times the force of gravity on the 3 minute ride. Kumba features four steel and fiberglass trains, each containing eight cars. Each car seats four riders in a single row for a total of 32 riders per train. The block sections only allow for three trains to be on the track at any one time, meaning the ride can still operate at full capacity when one train is receiving maintenance. Under three train operation, the ride caters for 1,700 riders per hour. The name Kumba was derived from the translation of \\"Roar\\" in the African Kongo Language. This is a nod to the loud roaring sound of the trains running on the track, which does not have sand to dampen the noise. Ride experience weightlessness The ride begins with a right-hand, 90-degree turn out of the station which leads into the chain lift hill. After reaching the peak, trains go through a small pre-drop. The ride then goes down a drop to the left into a vertical loop that wraps around the lift hill. After leaving the vertical loop, the ride rises up into a diving loop, followed by a zero-g roll, where riders experience a feeling of weightlessness. A straight section of track and a small hill leads to a Cobra roll. After exiting the cobra roll, the trains rise up into the mid-course brake run. The exit from the brake run leads into a pair of interlocking corkscrews. The train then dives into a tunnel and exits into an upward clockwise helix. The train then hits the final brake run, before making a right hand turn and returning to the station. Reception Kumba has generally been well received. Robb Alvey of Theme Park Review stated Kumba was his favorite ride in the Florida area, describing it as \\"an old- school, intense ride\\" that he has been on hundreds of times. Dewayne Bevil of the Orlando Sentinel gives Kumba ratings of 4 out of 5 for both thrill and theming. Keith Kohn, also of the Sentinel, described the ride as \\"an amazing experience\\". The opening of Kumba had a significant impact on park attendance figures. In its debut year, park attendance increased approximately 15% to an estimated 3.8 million visitors. The park expected that trend to continue into 1994. In 1995, Joe Fincher, Busch Gardens Tampa Bay's general manager, described Kumba as a \\"superstar roller coaster\\" that \\"has been terrific for us\\". In Amusement Today's annual Golden Ticket Awards, Kumba has consistently ranked highly. It is also one of only seven roller coasters to appear in the top 50 every year since the award's inception in 1998. It debuted at position 4 in 1998, before dropping to a low of 31 in 2011 and rising to 23 the following year.

Then :dS = \\\\frac{dE+PdV}{T}.  Remarks  The thesis of this theorem of classical mechanics reads exactly as the heat theorem of thermodynamics. This fact shows that thermodynamic-like relations exist between certain mechanical quantities. This in turn allows to define the \\"thermodynamic state\\" of a one-dimensional mechanical system. In particular the temperature T is given by time average of the kinetic energy, and the entropy S by the logarithm of the action (i.e.\\\\oint dx\\\\sqrt{2m\\\\left( E-\\\\varphi \\\\left( x,V\\\\right) \\\\right) }). The importance of this theorem has been recognized by Ludwig Boltzmann who saw how to apply it to macroscopic systems (i.e. multidimensional systems), in order to provide a mechanical foundation of equilibrium thermodynamics. This research activity was strictly related to his formulation of the ergodic hypothesis. A multidimensional version of the Helmholtz theorem, based on the ergodic theorem of George David Birkhoff is known as generalized Helmholtz theorem.  References  *Helmholtz, H., von (1884a).

The governing body for the sport is Football Federation Tasmania is a member of the Football Federation Australia (FFA) which controls the sport at a national level. Soccer is growing in popularity in terms of participation (particularly among youth). According to the Australian Bureau of Statistic, soccer is the highest participation sport amongst Tasmanian children aged 5–14 years (17.5%), attracting 23.7% males and 10.9% females.http://abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/Lookup/1307.6Main%20Features7Mar%202008?opendocument&tabname;=Summary&prodno;=1307.6&issue;=Mar%202008#=&view;= The sport in Tasmania receives a large amount of federal government funding. Soccer is also growing as a spectator sport. However Australian rules football is the dominant code of football in the state in terms of both media coverage and attendance. Early history The first recorded game took place in Hobart on 10 May 1879 when the Cricketers Football Club played a scratch match. The first recorded inter-club match took place a month later when the Cricketers took on New Town FC on 7 June (Hobart Mercury), described as English Association Rules. The first recorded reference to British Football (as it was known at the time of its introduction) being played in Tasmania was in 1898 when a team of merchant and navy seamen played an army team on the Domain in Hobart. The first recorded competition was established in 1900 when an organised league was set up comprising three teams - Trinity, Gunners and Sandy Bay. Due to the Boer War organised British Football did not last long but in 1910 it returned and not long after North vs South matches were started. =International teams visit Tasmania= In 1923 Southern China, a team from Hong Kong, visited Tasmania becoming the first international side to tour Tasmania. The Tasmania state team beat Southern China 2–1. A number of matches against international visiting teams have been hosted in Tasmania. In 1951 a touring English Football Association team defeated Tasmania 11–0 at North Hobart Oval.The Mercury, 18 June 1951 Three days later at York Park, Launceston, the FA team won 17–0, Jimmy Hagan scoring eight goals.The Mercury, 20 June 1951 A club friendly at North Hobart Oval in 1957 is another example of a match featuring an overseas team. Although the match was an Australia XI team vs Hungarian club Ferencvárosi TC, some sources incorrectly list it as a full international (Australia v Hungary). In 1993 Japanese J-League side Nagoya Grampus Eight who at the time featured former England striker Gary Lineker toured Australia, training in Tasmania for a month, and playing a friendly against the senior Tasmanian state side. The Japanese side won the game 3–0. =Interstate clubs visit Tasmania= A National Soccer League game was held in Launceston, Tasmania in 2002 between Perth Glory and Melbourne Knights at Aurora Stadium. The match was a 1–1 draw and attracted a crowd of 5324 fans. An A-League pre-season cup game was played in Launceston between Melbourne Victory and Adelaide United on 16 July 2006 at the same venue with Adelaide getting a 1–0 win, watched by a crowd of 6,834. A 2007 repeat of the Melbourne Victory, Adelaide United pre-season cup fixture saw 8,061 at Aurora Stadium. The result in 2007 was a 1–1 draw between the teams. The Melbourne Victory v Adelaide game continued in both 2008 and 2009. On 25 July 2010 Melbourne Victory hosted Central Coast Mariners in another preseason game at Aurora Stadium. Melbourne Victory vs Adelaide United at Aurora Stadium =Bids to join national club competitions= Tasmania has never had a team in either the former National Soccer League or the A-League. A proposal for an NSL team began in February 2004, but was halted by the imminent disbandment of the league. Since the formation of the A-League, Tasmania has been cited as a future expansion proposition. In March 2008, a Tasmanian Football Taskforce was formed by a group of Tasmanian businessmen to investigate the formation of an A-League team. The working name of the group is Tasmania United FC. =World Cup aspirations= Football Federation Australia CEO Ben Buckley met with Football Federation Tasmania representatives in October 2007 to outline FFA's strategic plan for the game. Buckley stated that a FIFA World Cup qualifier match in Tasmania was a possibility. Representative teams There is currently no senior Tasmanian representative team, and since the restructure of the sport nationally, the focus of the governing bodies has been to enter a club into a national competition. FFT occasionally selects an ad-hoc team from local leagues to play against large interstate clubs such as against Central Coast Mariners in July 2010 and Melbourne Victory in 2012. There are, however, regular junior state representative teams. Football Federation Tasmania sends male and female youth teams to national talent carnivals held annually. In November 2008, a Tasmanian youth team played friendly matches against A-League National Youth League teams from Sydney FC, Melbourne Victory, Queensland Roar and Adelaide United. The Tasmanian team won three of the four matches.  Competitions The numerous local clubs which play in local competitions are all amateur, with most clubs having multiple teams in male, female and junior competitions. =League system= Tasmania has sporadically maintained a statewide league. The first state league began in 1978 and ran until 1981, before recommencing in 1988 and running until 1999. FFT had plans for a new statewide league competition from 2006 however this did not eventuate until the NPL Tasmania, known as the T-League during planning commenced in 2013. The eight team statewide league was previously known between 2013-2015 for sponsorship reasons as the Victory League, since 2016 it has been known as NPL Tasmania. It forms a conference of the National Premier Leagues (NPL) which sit under the A-League nationally. As an NPL conference the winners (top of the table) qualify for the national NPL finals. In the years where a statewide league was not active, a play off between the Northern and Southern Premier League winner was used to determine the Tasmanian champions. This method was first used in 1910. In 2009 the State Championship was changed to incorporate a 3-week knock out final series consisting of the top 4 teams from the Northern and Southern Premier Leagues. There has been varying systems of promotion and relegation in the South between the Southern Premier League and Southern League One. Currently the system consists of the top team from Southern League One being promoted the following year and the bottom team from the Southern Premier League being relegated. Promotion and Relegation doesn't exist in the North. Leagues below League One in the South (and associated reserve competitions) and below the Premier League (and associated reserve competitions) in the North are considered to be social in nature and generally consist of additional teams from clubs playing in the higher divisions. Women's and junior competitions are also run in the North and South of the state by Football Federation Tasmania. =Cup competitions=Statewide cups There are male and female statewide knock-out cups (similar to the FA Cup) run annually with clubs from Northern and Southern Leagues. The male knockoutcup is named the Milan Lakoseljac Cup. The competition is as the name would suggest being a one legged (home or away) knock out cup (no group rounds). The competition consists of qualification rounds involving the weaker teams (from the lower divisions) who then are joined in the main rounds by the higher ranked teams. Since 2014 the Milan Lakoseljac Cup acts as a qualification for the national FFA Cup. In 2014 the winner of the Milan Lakoseljac Cup qualified Tasmania's sole entrant into the FFA Cup proper. Pre-season cups In the South pre-season cups are also run along graded lines (similar to the divisions of the regular season) known as the Summer Cup. This is a less prestigious title and is used mainly for preparation for the regular season. Similar cups are run in the North and North West known as the Steve Hudson Cup and North West Summer Cup respectively. The Steve Hudson Cup unlike most competitions in Tasmania is organised by the Launceston Soccer Club and not by FFT. Youth cup competitions The Main cup competitions for the Youth and Junior age groups are the Festival Cup held at Wentworth Park, Howrah and the Launceston Tournament (formally known as the Mano Cup) held at Churchill Park in Launceston. =Individual Honours= There are two leading best and fairest awards given in Tasmania. The Vic Tuting Medal is the Southern award, while the George Dale Medal is awarded in the North.

A temple president's primary responsibility is to supervise the affairs of an LDS temple in both an administrative and spiritual capacity. The president is assisted by two male counselors and together they compose the temple presidency. Normally the wife of the temple president serves as the temple matron, and the wives of the president's counselors as assistants to the matron. The matron and her assistants share in the responsibilities of the temple presidency. All members of a temple presidency are ordained high priests of the church.  Selection  Temple presidents and matrons, the president's counselors, and the matron's assistants are appointed by the First Presidency. Their background in church leadership varies, yet they are couples who are considered by LDS Church leaders as spiritually mature and capable of handling both the administrative and spiritual matters necessary for the successful operation of a temple. During a training seminar for new temple presidents, held in the Salt Lake Temple, Thomas S. Monson told a group of newly selected temple presidents and their wives: > \\"We looked over the entire Church. ... We looked for men of God, wherever > they might be. We found willingness to serve – not putting yourselves > forward to volunteer, but being willing to serve. What a sweet experience > this has been.\\"Hart, John L. \\"Temple presidents 'bridge the veil':21 new > leaders and wives hear counsel at seminar.Church News, August 25, 1990 They may be selected from a geographical area near the temple or from another area. In larger temples, the president and matron usually serve for a period of three consecutive years. In smaller temples, they \\"have an indefinite period of appointment.\\"Hinckley, Gordon B.\\"Some Thoughts on Temples, Retention of Converts, and Missionary Service,\\" Ensign, November, 1997. p.49 Most temple presidencies serving in smaller temples are selected from church membership living within the temple district.  Administrative responsibilities  The administrative responsibilities of a temple president include: ensuring all ordinances are performed by proper authority and documented correctly; securing a sufficient number of ordinance and service workers to meet the needs of temple patrons; overseeing the instruction of patrons, ordinance, and service workers; maintaining relationships with local church leaders; overseeing budgetary matters, property, and temple maintenance; and in larger temples the operation of cafeterias and visitor centers. Simpson, Robert L. “Temples: Administration of Temples”, Encyclopedia of Mormonism. Macmillan Publishing Company, 1992. pp. 1456-1458.  Spiritual responsibilities  For Latter-day Saints, temples are considered literal houses of God the Father and Jesus Christ, a sacred space where mortals may commune directly with heaven. As such the greatest responsibilities of the temple president are those associated with LDS concepts of expanding divine contact within the temple. They include: setting apart ordinance and service workers by the laying-on of hands; submitting recommendations to the First Presidency for counselors in the temple presidency and for additional sealers; performing ordinances; instructing first time patrons and youth groups on the sacred nature of temple work; privately answering various doctrinal and personal questions presented by temple patrons and workers; ensuring that the reverence and harmony required for temple worship is constantly maintained; and seeking inspiration and divine guidance on every aspect of his duties.Temple Yarn, Marilyn S., Yarn, David H., Jr. \\"President and Matron\\" Encyclopedia of Mormonism. Macmillan Publishing Company, 1992. pp. 1445-1446.  Additional responsibilities  Temple presidents and matrons, or their representatives, attend stake conference meetings within the temple district. They sit on the stand and are often invited by the presiding authority to speak to the congregation.\\"18.3.1 Stake Conference\\", Handbook 2: Administering the Church. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 2010. In these and other speaking assignments the topic is typically devoted to matters central to temple worship and devotion to deity.  Historical development  The first temple president was Wilford Woodruff. He was appointed by the First Presidency to preside over the St. George Temple in 1877. Neither the Nauvoo Temple nor the Kirtland Temple, constructed earlier than the St. George Temple, had a president.

The tower was originally known as the \\"Phoenix Shot Tower\\", then the \\"Merchants' Shot Tower\\", and now is also sometimes called the \\"Old Baltimore Shot Tower\\". It is the only surviving shot tower among four that existed in Baltimore, and was designated a National Historic Landmark on November 11, 1971.

The tower stopped producing shot in 1892, when a new method of making shot made the tower obsolete. It re-opened for a brief period of production at the beginning of the twentieth century, and then closed for good.Phoenix Shot Tower , Carroll Museums, accessed May 6, 2007  History  The tower remained the tallest structure in the United States until 1846, when Trinity Church, New York on Wall Street was erected, and the tallest in Baltimore until the completion of the spire of the First Presbyterian Church at West Madison Street and Park Avenue in the Mount Vernon-Belvedere neighborhood in 1875. Interior of the tower, looking down The shot tower was originally owned by the Merchants' Shot Tower Company which closed in 1898.\\"Baltimore (Phoenix) Shot Tower\\", National Park Service, accessed May 6, 2007 In 1921 the tower was purchased for $14,500 by the Union Oil Company, which planned to tear it down and put a gas station in its place. After strong objections by the community, by 1928 enough money had been raised to purchase the tower and present it to the City of Baltimore as one of its first preserved local historic landmarks. Plaques at the Phoenix Shot Tower, formerly the Merchants Shot Tower, in Baltimore's Jonestown neighborhood The tower was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1971 and a bronze plaque was attached to the tower's brick wall at the base. In the early 1980s, the management, exhibits, and tours were combined with those of the former Peale Museum. In 1985, other historic sites and homes were added to the newly created Baltimore City Life Museums system.

Written in the first person, the story gives an account of an Earthman's struggle to regain lost memories and to uncover the horrifying secret of the feudal society whose people used remarkably advanced technology to conquer Earth and its solar system. Plot summary For two generations humanity has been enslaved by the Vorra, a race of technologically advanced barbarians who had conquered space. On Qallavarra, the home planet of the Vorra, Gareth Shaw is an indentured servant of the House of Pwill, one of the giant city-states into which the planet is divided. As the only Terran on the estate, he is drawn into a seraglio intrigue by Under-lady Shavarri, the ninth wife of Pwill Himself, the overlord who rules the estate like a medieval duke. Shavarri's demand obliges Shaw to visit the \\"Acre of Earth\\", a ghetto-like enclave in the middle of a nearby city. In the Acre humans lived in relative freedom because they provided services that the Vorra could not provide for themselves. Chief among those services was the maintenance and repair of machines brought from Earth for the Vorra to use. But the Terrans also provided certain chemical services and Shaw had been sent to obtain one of those. Chased into the Acre by a Vorrish mob instigated by a squad of soldier-trainees, Shaw meets an almost equally hostile reception from three Terrans—Marijane Lee, her brother Ken, and their friend Gustav—who have rescued him from the mob. Seeing that he's wearing the livery of a Vorrish estate, they take him to Judge Olafsson, the voice of Terran law in the Acre. After being interrogated about his time on Qallavarra, Shaw leaves Judge Olafsson's court and completes his mission. He obtains from Hans Kramer, an apothecary, the love potion that Shavarri has ordered him to bring to her. Containing credulin, a drug that enhances suggestibility, the potion will enable Shavarri to manipulate Pwill Himself in her favor. Returning to the Pwill estate, he is called to the Grand Terrace of the manor house, where he finds Pwill Himself and his primary wife, Over-lady Llaq, having an angry confrontation with their wastrel son, Pwill Heir Apparent. Pwill, Sr. tells Shaw that his son has become addicted to a drug that affects the Vorra much as heroin affects Terrans—coffee—and that he expects Shaw to ensure that no one in the Acre will supply his son with more coffee. Later Pwill, Jr. prevails upon Shaw to keep him supplied with coffee beans through his friend Forrel. Soon after returning from the Acre and after his confrontation with Pwill Himself, Shaw begins to notice that he doesn't know things that he should know and that he knows things that, apparently, he shouldn't. He struggles to decode the meaning of that discovery and to regain lost memories, but has little success. After an encounter with the estate's whipmaster, he uses drugs obtained from Kramer to drive the whipmaster insane and thereby gains a reputation among the superstitious Vorra as a powerful shaman. One day he is taken to confront a rival shaman, who tells him that the Vorra acquired their hyperdrive-propelled starships and advanced weaponry by stealing them from another alien race. The shock of seeing the mummified remains of one of those aliens, still encased in a spacesuit, breaks a barrier in Shaw's mind and he begins to regain his lost memories, including why and how he lost his memories in the first place. On the same day that he regains his memories he is told by Marijane to cut off Pwill, Jr's coffee supply. Shaw agrees, knowing that Heir Apparent's display of withdrawal symptoms will throw the House of Pwill into crisis and put his life into jeopardy. But before anyone can notice his withdrawal symptoms, Pwill, Jr. comes to Shaw's room desperately seeking coffee and attacks Shaw. In self-defense Shaw kills the young man and hides the body in a sewer. Heir Apparent's disappearance precipitates the desired crisis and Shaw comes under suspicion of having provided the coffee that kept the young man addicted. The night before he is to be tortured to death, Shaw is extracted from the Pwill estate by Marijane, Ken, and Gustav and taken to the Acre. The next morning, convinced that his son has gone to the Acre in search of coffee, Pwill Himself leads four companies of his army toward the city, only to be ambushed by six companies of soldiers from the rival House of Shugurra. Soon thereafter the armies of ten other Houses join the battle and the Vorra are fully engaged in an all-out civil war, just as the Terrans had hoped. In the Acre all of the Terrans on Qallavarra climb to the rooftops and watch as a Vorra starship descends upon the city. The ship has been hijacked by a specially developed robot that had been hidden in a cargo container and now the ship will take all of the Terrans back to Earth. There the ship's technology can be copied for use against the Vorra in the general Terran revolt. Safe aboard the ship, Shaw sees the last piece of the puzzle fall into place in his mind. He realizes that the old shaman had lied to him about how the Vorra got their starships and advanced weaponry and he understands then that for the next century or so the Vorra will be the lesser of Earth's worries.

Biography He was originally destined for an ecclesiastical career, being made bishop of Metz in 1543 and of Verdun in 1544. In June 1545, he became joint \\"tutor and administrator\\" for his nephew, Charles III, Duke of Lorraine, with his sister-in-law Christina of Denmark. However, the Estates of Lorraine, in November 1545, removed him in favor of Christina as sole regent. He opposed her pro-Imperial policies. Resigning his dioceses in 1548 in favor of his uncle Jean, Cardinal of Lorraine, he took the title Count of Vaudémont. After seizure of the Three Bishoprics in 1552 by Henry II of France, he was re- appointed as sole regent for his nephew, a position he retained until 1559. In 1551, Nomeny was detached from the Bishopric of Metz and given to him as a margraviate by Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor in 1567, in right of which he was recognized as an independent, hereditary Prince of the Empire (the House of Lorraine would obtain a full vote in the Imperial Diet in 1736 for Nomeny in compensation for cession of the Duchy of Lorraine to France—in addition to acquisition of the Grand Duchy of Tuscany). In France, his mother's barony of Mercœur was likewise elevated to the status of a princedom (though not independent of the French crown) in 1563, and raised to a ducal peerage in 1569. He was also created a knight of the Order of Saint Esprit. He married three times. His first marriage, on 1 May 1549 in Brussels, was to Countess Marguerite d'Egmont (1517 – 10 March 1554, Bar-le-Duc), daughter of Count Jean IV of Egmont.

His second marriage was on 24 February 1555 at Fontainebleau, to Princess Joanna of Savoy-Nemours (1532–1568), daughter of Philippe, Duke of Nemours. By this marriage they had: # Philippe Emmanuel of Lorraine, Duke of Mercœur (1558–1602). # Charles de Lorraine (20 April 1561, Nomeny – 29 October 1587, Paris), known as the Cardinal de Vaudémont, Bishop of Toul and of Verdun. # Jean of Lorraine (b. 14 September 1563, Château de Deneuvre), d. young. # Marguerite of Lorraine (14 May 1564, Nomeny – 20 September 1625), married on 24 September 1581 in Paris Anne, Duke of Joyeuse (1561–1587), married on 31 May 1599 François de Luxemburg, Duke of Piney (d. 1613). # Claude of Lorraine (b. 12 April 1566, Nomeny), d. young. # François of Lorraine (15 September 1567 – 1596, Châtel-sur-Moselle), Marquis of Chaussin.

Witczak's code name with the GRU and as deciphered by the Venona project and other counterintelligence investigations was \\"R\\". He operated under a cover of a student and then instructor at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles in the 1940s. Shortly after the defection on 5 September 1945 of Igor Gouzenko, a GRU code clerk at the Soviet embassy in Ottawa, Samuel Witczak, an instructor at the University of Southern California, disappeared from a beach in Southern California, never to be seen again. Later his wife disappeared as well. In a 1952 Senate report, he was identified as a Soviet spy; his name had surfaced in the Venona decrypts. The FBI search for Witczak is described in the memoirs of FBI special agent Robert Lamphere. The FBI had learned Witczak had entered the United States from Canada on a false passport and suspected Witczak was not his true name. Later the FBI was able to trace some of Witczak's former agents, but never learned what happened to him. Enemy Amongst Trojans tells the rest of the story. Recent document releases in Britain and Russia, one showing Kim Philby reported on him, identify Witczak as “Litvin” and explain what happened to him after returning to the Soviet Union.

There are usually two varieties of this bread offered at Iranian bakeries: the generic one which has no toppings; and the more expensive variety which is topped with poppy seeds and/or sesame seeds. Sangak bread was traditionally the bread of the Persian army. It is mentioned for the first time in the 11th century. Each soldier carried a small quantity of pebbles which at camp were brought together to create the \\"sangak oven\\" that would bake the bread for the entire army. It was eaten with lamb kabab. The bread has always been widely eaten in the territory of present day Azerbaijan, but following the Soviet takeover in 1920, it became less common.

He studied at the University of Virginia, receiving a bachelor's degree in 1932, and master's in 1933. In 1937, while studying for a Ph.D, he became an instructor in English at the Ohio University in Athens, Ohio. He obtained a Ph.D. from the University of Virginia in 1939, and continued as professor at Ohio University. In 1939 Kendall married Carol Seeger, one of his former students. Carol Kendall was an author in her own right. Career Kendall's teaching was primarily concerned with Renaissance writing and Shakespeare. He was granted tenure in 1947, and was appointed Distinguished Professor of English in 1959, one of the first three academics at Ohio University to receive this honor. In 1950 Kendall was awarded a Marburgh Prize from The Johns Hopkins University for a three-act play, The Ant Village. He published both light verse and scholarly articles. In 1952 he was awarded a Ford Foundation Fellowship which assisted him in completing Richard III, which was published in 1955, and raises anew the question whether or not that monarch was an ursurper. It is for that work that he is best known. This work was a scholarly defence of the controversial monarch. It relied heavily on primary sources and made a significant contribution to the arguments for a favourable view of Richard. The work was critically very well received and was a runner-up for the National Book Award in 1956. In 1957 Warwick the Kingmaker and History of Land Warfare were released. In 1963 The Yorkist Age was released. In 1970 Kendall retired from Ohio University to become head of the Shakespeare Institute at the University of Kansas. In 1971 his work, King Louis XI was published, the film by Henri Helman about him is clearly part of a rehabilitation movement driven, among others, by the American Paul Murray Kendall (in the 1970s).

It broadcasts television programs produced by, and for, indigenous people in remote communities. The channel is owned by membership-based company Indigenous Community Television Limited. Although ICTV is a community television channel by name and content, it broadcasts using an open-narrowcast licence instead of a standard community television licence. History In 2001, ICTV Limited was formed and began broadcasting a part-time segment on Imparja Info Channel, an open-narrowcast community-style channel already broadcasting occasional indigenous content from Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara Media (PY Media) and Warlpiri Media Association (PAW Media). The channel operated from Imparja's broadcast facility in Alice Springs, Northern Territory, and was available on the Optus Aurora satellite service and via Imparja's analogue terrestrial transmitter network. The segment from ICTV was named 'IRCA in Action' and showcased predominantly local indigenous programs from a range of remote indigenous media organisations, including PAKAM, Ngaanyatjarra Media (NG Media) and organisations such as Bushvision. By 2006, the programming from ICTV grew to encompass the channel 24 hours a day and the satellite channel was renamed to ICTV. Many remote indigenous communities in central and north eastern Australia had analogue terrestrial repeaters for this channel, which utilised community licences and later open-narrowcasting licences. In October 2006, ICTV was formally incorporated as a public company. = ICTV ceases transmission = On 12 July 2007, the Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts had implemented changes to the Indigenous Broadcasting Program in support of a new national indigenous TV channel. It was decided that the existing open-narrowcast licence from Imparja would be used to initially carry the channel, which resulted in ICTV ceasing transmission. For 2 years, ICTV Limited had no means of broadcasting content unless it was commissioned by National Indigenous Television, which was at odds with the company. The NITV commissioning model allegedly left out remote community producers due to the nature of how funding was allocated and other mandatory requirements. ICTV Limited launched an online video service, IndigiTube, in April 2009. = The revival of ICTV = After a successful appeal to the Government of Western Australia, ICTV resumed broadcasting part- time on Westlink Network on 13 November 2009. Westlink Network was already carried on the existing Optus Aurora service as an open-narrowcast channel. Programming from ICTV was scheduled every weekend from Friday night to Monday morning. Remote communities with analogue terrestrial repeaters had begun to install equipment to automatically switch the NITV channel to Westlink Network every weekend. On 28 May 2012, the Department for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy awarded ICTV with an open-narrowcast licence to broadcast on the Viewer Access Satellite Television service. The channel commenced trial transmissions on 6 December 2012. On 18 April 2013, ICTV officially relaunched and began broadcasting 24 hours a day on virtual channel number 601 in standard definition 576i format. A launch party was held at the PAW Media grounds in Yuendumu, Northern Territory to mark the occasion. ICTV commenced broadcasting in Alice Springs on 5 April 2017, after being awarded a digital terrestrial free-to-air licence. The channel resides on virtual channel number 41.  Programming  ICTV broadcasts a diverse range of indigenous programming, usually in the language of its contributors.

Most probably originated in the Basque Country, it is a vying game. The first reference to this game goes back to 1745, when Manuel Larramendi, philologist and Jesuit Basque, quoted it the trilingual dictionary (Basque-Spanish-Latin). In Spain it is the most played card game, spawning several Mus clubs or \\"peñas\\" and becoming a staple game among college students. It is not uncommon to hear the Basque terms, such as \\"órdago\\" (from Basque \\"hor dago\\", \\"there it is\\"Real Academia de la Lengua Española) used by Spanish speakers, often without them being aware of the literal meanings of the terms and phrases. The origin of the word Mus is uncertain. It could come from the Basque language, where \\"musu\\" means \\"kiss\\", the established signal of the better possible card combination (3 Kings and one Ace). Larramendi wrote about the word mus or \\"musu\\" meaning lips or face and suggests that the name of the game could have derived from the facial gestures used while playing. According to another theory, the word mus comes from the Latin \\"musso\\", that means \\"keep silent\\". It is conjugated as \\"mus\\" (\\"I keep silent\\"), in opposition to \\"talk\\", that is the word used to open the game. A third hypothesis is that the word may have come from the French \\"mouche\\" (\\"fly\\"), from Latin mussula,Larousse Dictionnaire d' Étymologie Larousse:2001 although the concept \\"fly\\" has no relevance to any part of the game. History Basque emigrants carried the game to other countries such as the US and Australia, where it is played in Basque clubs.North American Basque Organization Nowadays there is an international Mus tournament, in addition to many national and regional competitions. Description The game is played between two opposing pairs of players with the Spanish deck which is a deck of 40 cards, without eights, nines, or tens and no jokers, and it has a variety of different rules in the different regions of Spain. The game has four rounds: * Handia (Biggest): playing for the highest combination of cards. * Txikia (Smallest): playing for the lowest combination of cards. * Pareak (Pairs): playing for the best matching card combination. * Jokoa (Game): playing for cards total values of 31 or more. Sometimes replaced by a Punto (Point) special round. In each of these four rounds players take by order a call each, verbalizing (usually after discussing it with his partner) whether he/them will bid (\\"envido\\") or pass (\\"paso\\") which only results in skipping call turn to next player. After all four players have spoken each round, the bids (\\"apostua\\") made are left hanging until the scoring round at the end. If no bet was made and all four players passed to bid, the round is \\"in pass\\" and will be decided at the end of the hand for a reduced value of just one point. It has a distinctive feature in that passing some established signals (keinuak) between players is perfectly allowed during the game. One other special feature of Mus is that it is a mostly verbal game, with little card-involving action, limited to deal and discard (if any). After cards are dealt and Mus (discard) is stopped, all rounds are played verbally, bets are called, passed, accepted or rejected but cards are not shown, dealt or touched in any further way, and the player is only obliged to show them in the end of the round if needed in order to resolve any accepted bet. This makes Mus more difficult to learn simply by watching others play than most other card games, as it can be difficult to follow simply by watching. Gameplay Mus is played by four players working as two teams. Partners sit opposite each other and play moves in a counter- clockwise direction. Every hand consists of four rounds: Handia ('Biggest'), Txikia ('Smallest'), Pareak ('Pairs') and Jokoa ('Game'). If the 'Game' round cannot be played because nobody has a hand total value of 31 or more, the whole round is replaced by Puntua ('Point'). After the fourth round, there is a scoring round, when all scores are calculated. The game is played with a pool of 30 points in the middle of the table. The points are usually represented by beans, coins or sometimes any other object, which are called hamarreko (oddly, from Basque \\"unit of ten\\", although it is worth five tanto) when playing the game. When a point is scored by a couple, one of this couple players takes a bean and puts it on their team's side. To decrease the need for many beans, one player's side counts as one-point beans and the other side as five-point beans. This makes it possible to play with only 16 beans in the table. A match (partida) is divided into games (joko). Each game is won by the first team to reach 30 points. In Spain, three games count as one vaca and three vacas win the match, although there are many other scoring variations, for example, in some places the game is played to five games and five vacas. However, in the Basque Country and northern Spain La Rioja, Mus may played with four Kings and at 40 points instead of the standard 30. This variation has to be played with 22 beans in the pool instead of 16. In the rest of Spain, the regular rules are eight Kings and 30 points.However, it is becoming increasingly common to play at 40 points. See Algarin, M. A., Ruiz, R. & Vazquez, B. (2010), Locos por el mus. Reglamento y manual para llegar a ser un campeón de mus (Crazy about Mus. Regulation and Manual to Become a Champion of Mus), Bubok Editorial. . When played with eight Kings, threes count as Kings and twos count as Aces. With eight Kings, it is much easier to get good hands and riskier to bet high. =Starting the game= In the first game, the dealer is selected randomly. After that, the dealer will be the last game's first player. In this way, the speaking order changes in each game and all the players get to be the first one to speak at some point. The dealer shuffles the cards and their left hand player cuts the deck. After this, they deal four cards, one card at a time, to each player starting with the player to their right and finishing with themself. Once the cards have been dealt, they put the deck aside and the game begins. The first player to speak will be the player at the right hand side of the dealer. Being the dealer is disadvantageous because ties are solved by speaking order: in case of a tie the person who spoke first wins. =\\"Mus\\" or \\"No mus\\"= Starting with the player to the right hand side of the dealer (known as Mano), each player declares whether or not they want to have a discard phase. By turns they say either \\"Mus\\" (to agree on discard) or \\"No mus\\". The turn to speak is as follows: 1 Mano. 2 His or her partner. 3 Second player (the one after \\"Mano\\"). 4 Fourth player, which is the dealer in the round and partner of the last. This position is commonly known as \\"postre\\" (last) as he comes last in the playing order, so he has a somehow handicapped ability in that hand. This way the team that speak first can seem to render themselves vulnerable (being true or fake) letting the opposition know that their cards are not good enough, since they want to discard. The opposition team can then decide whether or not there will be mus. Only if all four players agree, there is a discard phase (Mus), where they can discard up to all four cards or none at all. The dealer feeds to each player the requested cards one by one. After discard, the players repeat the process of discussing a new discard phase (Mus or not Mus) until at least one of them finally disagrees. If needed, the discarded pile can be reshuffled and dealt again as many times as needed. After a player refuses to have a new discard phase, the playing rounds begin. Of course, having one or more discard rounds will make the player and his partner get better cards, but the same applies for the opposing couple so this is the point to be considered regarding Mus. =The rounds=Grande The first round is called Grande. The two teams compete for the highest combination of cards. The highest cards in the Spanish deck are the Kings, followed by Knights and Jacks. In the variant game with eight kings, the threes work as the regular Kings and are therefore as high. For example, a hand like 'King-King-Knight-7' would be better for this round than 'King- Knight-Knight-7'. As it is a bidding game, if one team does not accept the bid then they may not win the hand even though they have higher cards. Chica The second round is the Chica. The two teams compete for the lowest combination of cards. The lowest cards in the Spanish deck are the Aces. In the variant game with eight Kings, there are also eight aces, with the twos being the second set of aces. For example, a hand like 'Ace- Ace-5-Knight' would be better for this round than 'Ace-Ace-5-King'. The Chica is a round that is overtly despised by most players, since bidding to it reveals (or at least suggests, which can be used) that the player has quite low cards, thus letting him in a weakened position in the remaining rounds (his Pair should be low, if any, and probably has no Game). Further to this, since all players probably have quite high cards, the chances of getting the bid accepted are scarce. Pares Before the third and fourth are played, players run a pre-round, declaring whether they have matching cards (Pares). In this pre-round, the players announce by turns 'Pares si' (they have matching cards) or 'Pares no' (they don't have matching cards). Having matching cards means that two or more of the cards in their hands have the same face value. If none of the players in a team can play, the whole round is skipped and the other team will score the round in the scoring phase. If none of the four players has Pares, the whole round is skipped altogether. The lowest combination of matching cards for this round is a single pair ('pares'), followed by three-of-a-kind ('medias') and the highest Two-pair ('duples'). Unlike in poker, in mus, Two-pair is a better combination than three-of-a-kind. This accounts for the fact that it is usually played with eight kings and eight aces, which makes three-of-a-kind easier to attain. In case of a tie, the combination with the highest value wins. 'a Knight-Knight- Knight-5 hand would beat Ace-Ace-Ace-King'. If two players had exactly the same pares combination, the tie is solved by speaking order: the player who spoke first wins. In the variant game with eight Kings, threes are Kings and twos are Aces for all purposes. This means that a hand such as 'King-3-2-Ace' is effectively a Two-pair of Kings and Aces. Juego The fourth and last round is the Juego (Game). As in the Pares round, players run a pre-round before the actual round, declaring whether they are able to play or not. Being able to play the Juego round means that the total value of the cards in the player's hand is 31 or higher. Players announce by turns 'Juego sí' (I have 'Game') or 'Juego no' (I don't have 'Game'). In order to be able to play this round, players have to sum up the face values of their cards, except for face cards, which all count 10. In the variant game of eight Kings, threes count as Kings and twos count as Aces, and therefore they add 10 and 1 respectively to the total hand value. For example, a hand like 'King-3-3-2' will add up to 31 points. The highest total card value for this round is 31, followed by 32, then 40, 37, 36, 35, 34 and the lowest is 33. 38 and 39 are impossible combinations, because in the Spanish deck there are no 8s and 9s. Take into account that 31 is a very easy combination to have in the eight Kings variant, since there are so many 10-value cards and Aces. If none of the players of a team can play, the round is finished and the other team will score the round in the scoring phase. In the situation where none of the four players can play the 'Juego' round, it will be replaced by 'Punto'. The players compete for the highest total card value, being 30 the highest possible total. As usual, in case of a tie, the speaking order rule will solve it. Good hands for the fourth round involve having at least two ten-point cards (King, Knight, Jack). The only combination of cards that has only one ten-point card is 'King/Knight/Jack-7-7-7'. This is clearly difficult to get and some variants have special rules for this hand and reward it by letting it win against other 31-point combinations regardless of speaking order. Some other regions restrict this special rule to the combination 'Jack-7-7-7' and some others restrict it further by requiring Jack and sevens to be of specific suits. This is called '31 real' ('Royal 31') or simply 'la real' ('The Royal'). =Playing= After the cards have been dealt, the players start playing the rounds, starting by the first one. By speaking order, they have the option of bidding or passing. If a player bids, an opposing player may pass or counterbid. An accepted bid will be left pending until the scoring round. The minimum bid is two points. Once a bid is accepted, the players move on to the next round. If a counterbid is not accepted, the original bidder scores the number of points of the original bid. If the first bid is not accepted, the bidder scores one point straight away. In the scoring round, winners of pending bids will receive the points. There is an exceptional kind of bid called 'hor dago' (in Basque, \\"there it is\\"), which, if accepted, ends the whole game in favor of the winning team. Bids are made and accepted by a single player, but the scoring is made by the team. It is therefore possible to accept a bid you know you're going to lose, but your teammate will win. If all the players pass in the first or second round, the winning team of each of these rounds will get one single point in the scoring phase once the cards are revealed. This is often the case for the second round, which teams sometimes refuse to bid on but then later claim the single point if they have the lowest combination of cards, even if it's only with one ace. =Envido= \\"'Envido'\\" (I bid) is the commonest expression used to bid, it specifically means a two- point bid, which is the lowest possible bid. Then the rival could reply with \\"'beste bi'\\" or \\"'Envido más'\\" (I bid more), which means he wants the 2-bid and even raises the bid two more. However, in every round and turn to call players can bet or raise the existing bet as many points as they wish or even all of them (Ordago) with no limitations. In parts of Spain it is common to play the Ordago by taking a big stone (The Ordago's stone) with the left hand and raising it up. If the opponent accepts the bid, he or she has to take a bigger stone and raise it, too. =Scoring= After the four rounds have been played and bids have been accepted, there is a scoring round, where the players show their cards and winning bid players claim their bets. In addition to that, the third and fourth rounds give additional scores to the winners depending on how good their hand was. The winning team of the third round scores 1 additional point for each single-pair they have, two points for every three-of-a-kind and three points for every Two-pair. The winning team of the fourth round scores two additional points for each player who could play the round or three points if that player had a total card value of exactly 31. If they played a 'Puntua' round instead, the winning team of the round scores only a single additional point. Scoring is done in sequence and stopped as soon as a team reaches a winning score (even if the opposing team would get a higher score if all the rounds are accounted for). The or dago changes the scoring sequence. The or dago is evaluated immediately and scoring of all other rounds is discarded. =Strategy= It is impossible to have a hand that wins all the rounds so the best winning hands are usually very good in some rounds, but not all. for example, a hand such as 'King-King-King-King' is very good in the first and third round, but exceptionally bad in the second and mediocre in the fourth. Similarly, a hand such as 'King-King-Knight-Ace' is very good in the fourth round, mediocre in first and third rounds and very bad in the second one. Players usually take into account the cards their teammate might have in order to score in rounds they initially had no good cards for. Also, winning third and fourth rounds always gives additional points and a good strategy is to break the discard phase when both team members can play third and fourth rounds, even with mediocre cards, in order to score those bonuses. =Signs= In Mus, passing gesture signs indicating which cards you have to your teammate is perfectly legal, being a decisive strategic factor. However, these signals can only be the ones specified in the rules as explained below, any non-standard signal is not allowed and would result in disqualification if proved. Knowing your partner's cards and letting him know yours results in a more effective play and allows a more accurate evaluation of the team's chances to win each bet, however if the rival players see you or your partner while passing a signal, and gets to know your or his cards, your chances will be seriously compromised. If you detect a rival's signal and the rival fails to realize you know his play (that should require not to inform your partner about the signal you blew up, if he didn't see it) you may be able to find a weak spot in his cards to counter-attack reversing the hunter- prey role or at least avoid his strong-point beads. There are many commonly accepted signals (keinuak) allowed in the game. You can use any of them to indicate to your teammate the hand you are holding (while trying to hide the transmission of the signal from your opponents). The signals have a fixed meaning and it is against the rules to use other signals or use false signals (by signalling a hand you do not hold). The keinuak are: Biting the bottom lip signifies that the player holds a pair of kings :*Two Kings: biting the centre of the bottom lip :*Three Kings: biting one side of the bottom lip :*Two Aces: poking out the tongue :*Three Aces: poking out the tongue to one side :*Single Pair (pares): tilting the head to one side :*Three-of-a-kind (Medias): pursing lips to one side of the mouth :*Two-pairs (Duples): raising the eyebrows :*31 (La una, i.e. 31-point Juego): winking :*30 (30 puntos): lifting both shoulders :*29: (29 puntos): lifting the right shoulder :*28: (28 puntos): lifting the left shoulder :*I have nothing (Ciego, blind). This indicates a bad hand: closing the eyes :*Royal 31 (31 real, see above): touching the earlobe Not all of these signals are accepted in all variations and there might be other signals in use. It is always good to clarify the signals in use when playing for the first time. Players have a wide variety of approaches to signal use, some players make a great number of signals, as soon as they have the chance, some players seldom or never make signals. On the other hand, some players show a honed skill in catching the rival's signals whereas other players do not even make too much an effort to disrupt the opposing couple's signals; some would stare continuously and overtly to the rivals' faces for intercepting signals and others would pretend to get distracted or to be not too interested in catching rival's signals in order to make them overconfident and thus catch subsequent signals. =Named hands in Spain= In Spain, some arrangements have particular names: :* Duples gallegos (\\"Galician dupleak\\") : King-King-Ace-Ace :*Duples castellanos (\\"Castilian dupleak\\") also called \\"Duples polacos\\" (\\"Polish duples\\") and \\"Duples alemanes\\" (\\"German dupleak\\"): King-King-Knight-Knight. :* Duples vascos (\\"Basque dupleak\\") : King-King-Jack- Jack :* Duples palentinos (\\"Palentian dupleak\\") : King-Knight-Ace-Ace. Actually not duples, as can be seen. :* 31 Real (\\"Royal 31\\"): Also, La real (\\"The Royal\\"): Jack-7-7-7. It is the only combination of cards that adds up to 31 for the fourth round with only one figure card (King/Knight/Jack). Different house rules consider this hand to beat any other 31-hand with varying requirements. Some people would allow King-7-7-7, while others would require the original Jack-7-7-7 only when the Jack is of a specific suit. Some people restrict it further by requiring that the sevens be of different suit than the Jack. As an example, the rules of a particular tournament might declare that the only hand considered 'Royal 31' is the Jack of coins together with the 7s of swords, clubs and cups. :*La Jugada del tío Perete (\\"Uncle Perete's hand\\"): 4-5-6-7. It is simply the worst hand possible. It is weak in all four rounds. Certain house rules allow a single point to be awarded to a player that openly declares this hand before starting to play. Some other places might call it differently: Tanganete in La Rioja or Peterete in Castile and León. :*Solomillo (\\"Tenderloin\\") or la bonita (\\"The Pretty one\\"): King- King-King-Ace. Some rule sets reserve the name of \\"solomillo\\" for pure hands, that is, three Kings and an Ace without 3s or 2s. Unlike the '31 erreala' hand, this distinction has no effect at all on gameplay. :*Ley del Mus (\\"Law of Mus\\"): King-King-Knight-Jack. This hand is seen as the minimum a player has to have in order to accept risky bets, at least in first, third and fourth rounds. :*La Josito (\\"The Josito\\"): King-Knight-Ace-Ace. 31real.png 31 Real lapiara.png Four Kings 31almus.png El solomillo, or tenderloin eltioperete.pngEl tío Perete, or 4,5,6 and 7 See also *Truc *Ombre *Calabresella *Conquian *Botifarra References Some of the content of this article is translated from the equivalent Spanish Wikipedia article.

The federation oversees competitions across Tasmania, Tasmanian representative teams, and development of the sport in the state. The federation was known as the Tasmanian Soccer Association until 1996, when it was renamed Soccer Tasmania. In line with national changes in March 2006, it became Football Federation Tasmania. In February 2019, the organisation became simply Football Tasmania. Football Tasmania sanctions all competitive football matches in Tasmania, either directly in the case of its own leagues, or indirectly, as is the case with local regional junior associations. FT also trains and appoints match officials in accordance with FIFA guidelines. FT governs the Tasmanian State League NPL Tasmania and the two underpinning domestic leagues, the Northern Championship, and the Southern Championship. FT also organises and runs several Tasmanian association football cup competitions. Responsibilities also include selecting and managing representative Tasmanian football sides at senior, men's, women's and youth levels. Football Tasmania is a member of Football Federation Australia, which is in turn a member of the Asian Football Confederation, and the world governing body FIFA. Overview Football Tasmania is a member of Football Federation Australia, and has its administrative headquarters and main playing ground at KGV Park in Glenorchy, which acts as a home ground to both Glenorchy Knights and Hobart Zebras clubs. All of Tasmania's major football teams are members of Football Tasmania, and FT organise the only FIFA-sanctioned competitive leagues in the state for both men and women. A hierarchy of league divisions operates in both the south and the north for senior men and women, and aged based divisions operate for juniors. The Sports Association of Tasmanian Independent Schools (SATIS), also runs a league for Independent schools, and although not affiliated with FT, does so in accordance with FT rules and with their sanctioning. Football Tasmania is one of nine Football Federation Australia National Training Centres - which act as regional training bases for elite and emerging junior male and female footballers. A number of young Tasmanians have been selected for national sides as a result of their participation in the NTC programs, including Luke Eyles and Paul Stevens. Football Tasmania also administers the Tasmanian rollout of national soccer initiatives, including 5-a-side competitions, school visits and game development programs. FT also runs a number of popular and growing Futsal Leagues based in Hobart, Launceston, Devonport and Ulverstone. State League Football Tasmania ran a statewide competition known as the Tasmanian State League, featuring sides from both the north and south of the state from 1978 until 1999, when it discontinued due to financial problems. FT, working alongside member clubs, has announced plans to re-launch the State League, to be known as the Victory League, in 2013. This league is sponsored by Melbourne Victory and will feature eight teams; Devonport City, Launceston City, Northern Rangers, Olympia FC Warriors, Glenorchy Knights, Kingborough Lions, Hobart Zebras and South Hobart History Soccer was first played in Tasmania during the colonial period, but was never as popular as cricket, and the advent of Australian rules football in the mid-nineteenth century, soon saw that code surpass both rugby and football in popularity within the island colony. The code was generally referred to as British Association Football, to distinguish it from Rugby, and Australian rules, which soon became known locally as 'football' or 'footy'. The term soccer originated in England, first appearing in the 1880s as a slang abbreviation of the word \\"association\\", often credited to former England captain Charles Wreford-Brown. It is not clear when the term 'soccer' came into common use in Tasmania, but by the early twentieth century it was the more common term. The first recorded organised match in Tasmania took place between seamen from the Royal Navy and merchant vessels, who formed a team in 1898, and challenged the soldiers from the Tasmanian Military Forces garrison at Anglesea Barracks. The match was played on the Queens Domain, and sparked a renewed local interest in the sport. In 1900, Englishman Reverend Fred Taylor established a league competition between three newly formed sides. They were Trinity, (representing the University of Tasmania's Christ College), the Gunners (the soldiers from Anglesea Barracks) and Sandy Bay (army volunteers). The involvement of the Tasmanian and later Commonwealth Military Forces in the Second Boer War led to a suspension of football in the colony. It wasn't until 1910, when two friends JJB Honeysett and Norm Vincent, who were both keen players, decided to reintroduced competitive matches. They created the state's first league involving teams from both north and south, and they also established a North vs South match, played annually almost continuously since that time, except for brief suspensions during the First World War and the Second World War. The newly formed South Hobart Soccer Club took on Westralia at the \\"Association Ground\\", Washington Street, South Hobart in the first match of the new league, winning 4–1. A rise in the number of migrants arriving in Tasmania following the First World War saw the popularity of the sport grow, and the Tasmanian football championship resumed in 1919. That season saw South Hobart Soccer Club begin a remarkable run in which they won the state championship a record five years in a row. Although four-in-a-row has since been done twice, by Caledonians (1955–58), and White Eagles (1988–91), South Hobart's record has never been broken. Football remained healthy in Tasmania for the next twenty years, although it continued to play second-fiddle to Australian rules football in terms of overall popularity. South Hobart and Sandy Bay enjoyed much success, winning seven titles each in the inter-war years. The sport was again suspended for the duration of the Second World War, but once again post- war migration saw the game revived. The new migrants came increasingly to Tasmania from southern and eastern European nations such as Italy, Greece, Czechoslovakia, Poland and Yugoslavia, and for many of these new arrivals, football was the most popular past time. The post-war revival of the 1950s was a boom time for football in Tasmania. Player numbers rose sharply, and many new clubs were formed, merged and folded. It was in the early 1950s that the State Soccer Council was created to oversee the rapidly expanding popularity of the game in Tasmania. This period is often nostalgically referred to as the 'golden era' of Tasmanian football, and even featured visiting professionals from leagues such as Italy's Serie A, making guest appearances for clubs like Hobart Juventus. The old pre-war powerhouses South Hobart and Sandy Bay were pushed aside, and migrant-community based teams Caledonians, Olympia, and Launceston Juventus began to dominate competitions. Caledonians were almost unstoppable in the 1950s, winning six titles, including four-in-a-row between 1955 and 1958. In the early 1960s, the State Soccer Council was renamed as the Tasmanian Soccer Association. This period saw the migrant communities grow to a size where their traditional rivalries from Europe began to influence the game in Australia, including in Tasmania. Although the new wave brought a new style and flair to the game, it also sometimes tarnished its reputation as those rivalries descended into occasional violence. The older clubs struggled for success, but the 1960s saw Olympia and Launceston Juventus play off against each other for the Tasmanian football championship on four occasions, Olympia getting the best of their northern opponents on three of them. The early 1970s saw the rise of Hobart Juventus, who won four state titles between 1969 and 1973, including a staggering 13–5 aggregate score over Riverside Olympic in the two-legged final of 1973. The 1976 State Championship play-off between Rapid and Launceston Juventus proved to be an all-time classic. The first leg finished 3-2 in favour of Rapid, but a 4-3 home win for Launceston Juventus saw the two-legged final finish 6-6 on aggregate, and go to penalties. The ensuing penalty shootout was an incredible 12-11 sudden death win to Rapid. This era also saw the rise of Glenorchy Croatia, who were crowned state champions three times in the 1970s. With the game's popularity in ascendancy, the Tasmanian Soccer Association instituted a new Tasmanian State League in 1978, replacing the north-south champions play-off with a league of regular competition between the best sides in both the north and south. White Eagles, a side which primarily consisted of players of Polish Australian extraction, began to announce themselves as a new power within the state at this time. They won their first state title winning the final play- off in 1977 against Devonport City, and repeated that success by winning the first State League title the following year. For the first four seasons, the state title was simply awarded to the team finishing in first place. However players and fans missed the north-south play-off final, and financial problems began to cloud some teams in the State League. In 1982 it was temporarily suspended, reverting to northern and southern leagues with a play-off between each winner to determine the state champions. Hobart Juventus dominating this period, winning their first title in 1973 after a ten-year drought, and going on to win three-in-a-row between 1983 and 1985. The State League resumed in 1988, and White Eagles announced themselves as the State's finest in the late 1980s, winning four-in-a-row between 1988 and 1991, and only losing seven league matches in the four seasons. In the 1989 season they went undefeated, and won the league by a massive 15 points. The 1990s failed to produce a side capable of dominating the leagues in the way the previous two decades had, with six different teams being crowned Tasmanian champions. But it was a period of great change for the code within all of Australia, including Tasmania. The violence that plagued matches between rival ethnically based football teams across the country had become widespread, with flares thrown into crowds of rival supporters on several occasions.O'Hara, John (1994). Ethnicity and Soccer in Australia. The situation was damaging the reputation of the game across the country, and stunting both the development of the game, and the progress of the Socceroos on the world stage. Soccer Australia decided measures had to be taken, and outlawed ethnic affiliations for football clubs. This affected clubs across the country including in Tasmania. In 1997, a major re-branding effort was introduced to the game across the country. The Tasmanian Soccer Association was renamed Soccer Tasmania, and they obliged member-clubs to distance themselves from their traditional ethnic roots. In the south, Glenorchy Croatia (Croatian) became Glenorchy Knights, Olympia (Greek) became Hobart Olympic, White Eagles (Polish) became New Town Eagles, Hobart Juventus (Italian) became Hobart Zebras, and Caledonians (British Australian) became West Hobart Lions. Northern clubs were also affected, with Launceston Juventus (Italian) becoming Launceston Zebras, and then changing again to Launceston City FC, and Launceston Croatia (Croatian) becoming Western Suburbs Knights, and then Prospect Knights FC. The first decade of the 21st century saw football grow well in Tasmania. player numbers continued to rise, particularly in junior divisions. Football Federation Australia'a efforts to rebrand the game, along with the Socceroos qualifying for the 2006 FIFA World Cup helped bolster the popularity of the sport within Tasmania. New Town Eagles had undoubtedly been the dominant club in Tasmania from the late 1980s until the start of the 21st century, racking up seven state titles between 1988 and 1998, but the new decade saw a shift in power, with University winning a long-awaited first state title in 1999, and repeated it 2001. Despite not having won a state title since 1959, at the end of the century South Hobart SC were still the most successful team in Tasmania with 11 titles, although they were being rapidly caught by Hobart Zebras (Juventus), who had won their ninth title in 1993. The oldest surviving club in Tasmania were relieved to add a twelfth title in 2002, the first in 43 seasons. The southern dominance in the Tasmanian football championship was challenged briefly by Devonport City FC (2003, 2004) and Somerset FC (2006, 2007) who both won two titles each in the 2000s. Glenorchy Knights were crowned state champions in 2005, and Clarence United became state champions for the first time in their history in 2009. South Hobart took the title in 2008 and then five consecutive titles from 2010-2014, to extend their tally to 18, and ensuring they remain the most successful club of all time in Tasmania. In 2009 Hobart Olympic took the decision to revert to their ethnically affiliated name of 'Olympia', adding the epithet 'Warriors', and adopted a new logo featuring a Spartan warrior's helmet to further celebrate the Greek Australian heritage. This decision was made ahead of the club's fiftieth anniversary celebrations, and taken with the full blessing of Football Federation Tasmania.

Biography Born in Wellington, New Zealand, Brake was the adopted son of John Samuel Brake and his wife Jennie Brake (née Chiplin). He was raised initially at Doyleston, before his father moved the family to Arthur's Pass, where his father owned the general store, and Christchurch, where he attended Christchurch Boys' High School. His early interest in photography was inspired by his aunt Isabel Brake, who exhibited with the Christchurch Photographic Society, and several of his older cousins. Brake trained with wellington portrait photographer Spencer Digby from 1945. Three years later he joined Government filmmaking body the National Film Unit as an assistant cameraman.NZ On Screen Profile of Brian Brake. Brake worked on 17 films at the Unit, mostly as a cameraman, occasionally as a director. Though Brake's skills with studio lighting were utilised, the majority of his work involved the NFU's heavy diet of scenic shorts, including a series of 'snow' films Brake filmed in the Southern Alps. Snows of Aorangi,Short film Snows of Aorangi. one of three NFU films Brake directed, was the first New Zealand film nominated for an Academy Award, in the Best Short Subject (Live Action) category in 1959. It was beaten to the Oscar by James Algar's nature film Grand Canyon. Brake left New Zealand for London in 1954. In 1955 he met Ernst Haas and Henri Cartier-Bresson, members of the photo agency Magnum Photos. This led to his acceptance as a nominee member in the same year, and full membership in 1957. He remained a Magnum photographer until 1967. He worked as freelance photographer in Europe, Africa and Asia until the mid-1960s, when he began working more exclusively for Life magazine. He is best known for his 1957 and 1959 coverage of ChinaImages of China by Brian Brake. (where he was allowed an unusual level of access), his 1955 photographs of Pablo Picasso at a bullfight,Images of Pablo Picasso at a bullfight by Brian Brake. His \\"Monsoon\\" seriesMonsoon series by Brian Brake. of photographs taken in India during 1960 were published internationally in magazines including Life, Queen and Paris Match. Brake used Aparna Das Gupta (now Aparna Sen) as the model for what was to become one of his best known photographs from the \\"Monsoon\\" series — a shot of a girl holding her face to the first drops of monsoon rain.Monsoon Girl by Brian Brake. The shoot was set up on a Kolkata rooftop with a ladder and a watering can. Sen describes the shoot: In the same year as he shot \\"Monsoon\\", Brake also photographed in New Zealand. The images were published in the best- selling book New Zealand, gift of the sea (1963). The book remained in print for over a decade and was republished in an entirely new format and with different images, but the same title, in 1990. In 1965 Nigel Cameron and Brake published Peking: A tale of three cities, which was dedicated to Brake's father, John Brake. In 1967 Brake and William Warren were commissioned by James Thompson to produce The House on the Klong, which was first published after the mysterious disappearance of silk merchant and former CIA agent James Thompson, in January 1968. This book was the first of many on craft and art objects. Titles include The sculpture of Thailand (1972), Legend and reality: early ceramics from South-East Asia (1977), Art of the Pacific (1979), and Craft New Zealand: the art of the craftsman (1981). In 1970 Brake founded Zodiac Films in Hong Kong and made documentary films in Indonesia for the following six years. In 1976 he returned to New Zealand. He commissioned an East Asian influenced architectural award-winning house designed by Ron Sang on Titirangi's Scenic Drive, in the Waitākere Ranges to the west of Auckland, where he lived with his life partner, Wai-man Lau, for the remainder of his life, although he continued to accept freelance assignments abroad. In 1985 he helped establish the New Zealand Centre for Photography. In the 1981 Queen's Birthday Honours, Brake was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire, for services to photography. Brake died at Titirangi of a heart attack in 1988. Brake was careful to retain his negatives and transparencies, as well as copyright, wherever possible. His entire collection of photographs is now housed at the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa. The Museum showed his China work in a 1995 exhibition, Brian Brake: China, the 1950s (with an accompanying book of the same title), and in 1998, Monsoon: Brian Brake's images of India. Images from this series were published independently in 2007 as Monsoon. In 2010 the Museum mounted a major retrospective exhibition of his work, Brian Brake: Lens on the world, again with a fully illustrated catalogue.

The exhibition's title translates as \\"Uncooperative Attitude\\" in Chinese, but the blunter English language sentiment was deemed preferable. The exhibition encompassed conceptual, performance, and protest art. Overview The exhibition was held in an Eastlink Gallery warehouse by Feng Boyi and the 43-year-old Ai Weiwei, and is revered by many young Chinese artists.http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1248/is_7_89/ai_76332991/pg_4 Ai encapsulated Fuck Off's artistic-curatorial attitude with one set of photos in which he gives the finger in turn to the White House, the Forbidden City, and the viewer, and another in which he drops an ancient Han Dynasty Chinese vase, which smashes at his feet. Coinciding with the Shanghai Biennale, the opening of the exhibition embodied an uncooperative attitude towards the establishment, as summed up in the closing line of the exhibition catalogue: \\"Perhaps there is nothing that exists 'on-site,' but what will last forever is the very uncooperativeness with any system of power discourse.\\" The exhibition included works by 48 avant-garde artists, many of whom exhibited provocative and controversial works. Among them was He Yunchang, who posed in a color photograph bare-chested while suspended from a crane by his ankles over a rushing river, into which he holds a knife—the same knife he later used to cut his own arm. Sun Yuan exhibited Solitary Animal, a glass case containing an animal skeleton and—purportedly—enough poison gas to wipe out the show's entire audience. Wang Chuyu's performance consisted of a four-day fast. Zhu Ming floated down the Huangpu River in a plastic bubble wearing a diaper. The most controversial work was probably Eating People by Zhu Yu, which was eventually not displayed in the show. It consisted of a series of photographs of him cooking and eating what is alleged to be a human fetus. One picture, circulated on the internet via e-mail in 2001, provoked investigations by both the FBI and Scotland Yard. The piece's cannibalistic theme was controversial in Britain when Zhu's work was featured on a Channel 4 documentary exploring Chinese modern art in 2003. In response to the public reaction, Zhu Yu stated, \\"No religion forbids cannibalism. Nor can I find any law which prevents us from eating people. I took advantage of the space between morality and the law and based my work on it\\". Zhu has claimed that he used an actual fetus that was stolen from a medical school. The exhibition ran for ten days from 4 to 14 November, 2000. After the opening, the Cultural Inspection Bureau raided the exhibition and removed works considered inappropriate. Later on, they demanded the exhibition to close for being inappropriate, prior to its scheduled closing date. The police confiscated all remaining catalogs for not having the publication permit. In an interview by Chin-Chin Yap, Ai Weiwei was asked if the actual exhibit of Fuck Off had a concept similar to the Black, White, and Gray Cover Books he published. He went on to say that after the books were finished, there were a lot of interesting art happening, and the people in his life continually recommended creating an exhibit with a theme similar to that of the books. His opinion was not that the show was really good because it was organized so quickly, and he knew that there was a possibility that it could be shut down by the police and having all of the works confiscated. Luckily, he said that the artists involved were \\"cooperative and interested and the attitude was there.\\" In a very eye-opening statement, Ai goes on to say that, \\"maybe Fuck Off was most important because of what it represented.\\" Those involved had clear ideas about the message they wanted to send to Chinese institutions and Western curators, institutions, and dealers: \\"We had to say something as individual artists to the outside world, and what we said was 'fuck off'.\\" Many influential artists in the contemporary Chinese art scene took part, many of whom have since been included in international exhibitions, catalogs, and television documentaries. A catalog of the exhibition has been published, a black book with the simple title FUCK OFF on its cover. Feng Boyi on Fuck Off Co-curator Feng Boyi felt as though Chinese artists were just working for foreigners because the early Chinese contemporary art shows were being held in foreign countries. In co-curating the exhibition, Feng said, \\"We wanted to show the 'fuck off' style, not working for the government or in the style of western countries, but a third way.\\" Co-Curators Description by Ai Weiwei and Feng Boyi in October, 2000: Fuck Off is an event that is participated by both the organizers and artists. In today's art, the alternative is playing the role of revising and criticizing the power discourse and mass convention. In an uncooperative and uncompromisable way, it self-consciously resists the threat of assimilation and vulgarization. A cultural attitude that stands against the power and makes no compromise with vulgarization is, together with independent individual experiences, feelings and creations, is what extends the pursuit and desire of art for spiritual freedom – an everlasting theme. Such a cultural attitude is obviously exclusive and alienated. It aims at dealing with such themes as cultural power, art institution, art trends, communications between the East and West, exoticism, post-modernism and post colonialism, etc. Fuck Off emphasizes the independent and critical stance that is basic to art existence, and its status of independence, freedom and plurality in the situation of contradictions and conflicts. It tries to provoke artist's responsibility and self-discipline, search for the way in which art lives as \\"wildlife\\", and raise questions about some issues of contemporary Chinese art. Allegory, directing questioning, resistance, alienation, dissolution, endurance, boredom, bias, absurdity, cynicism and self-entertainment are aspects of culture as well as features of existence. Such issues are re-presented here by the artists with unprecedented frankness and intelligence, which leaves behind fresh and stimulating information and traces of existence. In this exhibition, participants and their works are not objects of choice, identification and judgment. They have no quest for any kind of excuse. Group identification and inner difference are both so fully respected and encouraged that it may be doubted if there is the necessity for the presence of audience. An on-site ambiguity and uncertainty forces one to seek meaning and satisfaction only in the form of proliferation and postpone. Perhaps there is nothing that exists 'on-site', but what will last forever is the very uncooperativeness with any system of power discourse.\\" Notable Works Accidental Dropping Ai Weiwei was concerned with Chinese history as a whole and the fact that people were not properly learning about it or preserving it. By dropping a near-priceless artifact, Ai was essentially asking if the Chinese people really care about their own history, taking something valuable and reducing it to shards. Golden Sunlight (Performance) He Yuchang is known to push the limits in his performance art. His goal is to \\"seek enduring and fearless confrontation with reality and a poetic expression for this.\\" Chinese Landscape: Tattoo No. 2 Huang Yan sees landscape paintings as a way of expressing himself. His landscape scenes are painted on his body, on pork, and even on cow bones. Mouse Jin Le experiments with a wide variety of materials in order to demonstrate what he thinks that people and animals would look like if scientists succeeded in combining them into one form. Peace series No. 19 Liang Yue uses Photoshop as his main form of expression. He attempts to Photoshop a variety of ads onto photos he takes and then post them absolutely everywhere in an attempt to require people to see them. Paradise Lost No. 17 Meng Huang was born in Beijing, and says, \\"I grew up, knowing nothing. Now I live in Beijing and find that works of art stars are very much westernized.\\" His works seem to be reminiscent of an almost unattainable land that was once a paradise, but is now sad and downtrodden.

Life She was born in Shanghai, China in 1917. Her father had been an automobile importer, and she had been well-educated and well-traveled before emigrating to the United States in 1949 to escape the Communist takeover of China. She worked as a clerk for a shipping company for 20 years before opening Madame Wong’s (黃家園), a Los Angeles Chinatown restaurant with a floorshow—originally at 949 Sun Mun Way, located in the original 1938 Rice Bowl restaurant. Chinatown Central Plaza, next to the Hop Sing Tong building. Photographed in 2014. After fierce initial resistance, she became a punk rock and new wave music promoter. Polynesian dance acts weren’t attracting customers, yet when Paul Greenstein, a Los Angeles \\"bum vivant,\\" first approached her husband George about booking bands, she declined. Greenstein's persistence, and the fact that he had already given the nearby \\"Atomic Cafe\\" a new lease on life (cross-pollination between owners' children worked the magic), caused her to agree to a trial run in Fall of 1978. Initially, under Greenstein, a showcase for unsigned, unbookable punk- bands, Madame Wong's was one of few places such bands could perform. With the exit of Greenstein, Madame Wong's morphed into a power-pop palace with bookings more influenced by a now-interested Wong. Notable bands that she showcased included a “who’s who” of rock music, including Los Lobos, The Knack, The Police, The Motels, The Members, Fishbone, The Go-Go's, X, The Alley Cats, The Bangs, Oingo Boingo, Naughty Sweeties, Los Illegals, Candy, Guns N' Roses, Black Flag, No Mercy, Beowülf, Excel, Daniel Amos, Fear, Bad Actor, Red Hot Chili Peppers, The Twisters, and The Ramones. Eventually this led to her nickname, the “Godmother of Punk.” She closed the original “Madame Wong’s” after a fire in 1985.Madame Wong Calls It Quits - Los Angeles Times She opened another venture, “Madame Wong’s West” at 2900 Wilshire in Santa Monica, California in 1978 and it had a successful run before it closed in 1991. The original \\"Madame Wong's\\" unofficially reopened for a brief period in 2009/2010, when Ben Kramer, Stuart Friedel, and Rob Cudd, who were living in an apartment that now occupies the premises, hosted concerts in their living room, using the name Madame Wong's in homage to the original venue. Acts that year included Devendra Banhart, Vampire Weekend's secret 2009 Halloween show, The Answering Machine,The Answering Machine at Madame Wongs Wavves, Smith Westerns, Jounce, Pearl Harbor and the Explosions, Backbiter, Salvador Santana, The Growlers, Harlem, and others. Esther Wong died from emphysema and lung cancer on August 14, 2005 in Los Angeles, only a day after her 88th birthday. She was survived by her second husband, Harry Wong, two children, Frank Wong and Melinda Braun, six grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.

She was the first female TV presenter in New Zealand. She first joined broadcasting in the late 1940s at Dunedin's 4ZB as a trainee copywriter. A few years later she took up a government bursary to study drama in London. This was followed by professional theatre and teaching. In 1960 she rejoined broadcasting and was transferred to Auckland. She became New Zealand's first female television presenter, then known as a continuity announcer, on Auckland channel AKTV2 in 1961. AKTV2 had been launched in June 1960, initially broadcasting for three hours a night, three nights a week. She began her appearance from August. She worked alongside fellow presenter, former Royal Air Force pilot Tim Evans-Freke, whom she later married.

Probably composed between about 70–150 AD from earlier writings and tradition possibly kept from the time of Abraham, it is of Jewish origin and is usually considered to be part of the Apocalyptic literature. It has survived only in Old Slavonic recensions and it is not regarded as authoritative scripture by Jews or any Christians, though it likely held some prominence up into the first century A.D. Manuscript tradition The text of the Apocalypse of Abraham has been preserved only in Slavonic; it occurs in the Tolkovaja Paleja (or Explanatory Paleja, a Medieval compendium of various Old Testament texts and comments that also preserved the Ladder of Jacob). The original language of this text was almost surely Hebrew: it was translated into Slavonic either directly from Hebrew or from a lost intermediate Greek translation. The whole text survives in six manuscripts usually gathered in two families: the main manuscript of the first family is referred to as SSil'verstrovskij Sbornik, Moscow, Central'nyi Gosuderstvennyj Arxiv Drevnyx Aktov, Sin. Tip. 53, ff 164-183, 14th century edited by Tixonravov in 1863,N.S. Tixonravo, Pamjatniki otrecennoj russkoj literature 1, Petersburg 1863, 32-35 while the main manuscripts of the other family, which preserve the text integrated in other material of the Tolkovaja Paleja, are referred to as A,Paleja of Volokolamsk, Moscow, Rossijkaja Gosudarstvennaja Biblioteka, 299, n. 704, ff 85-101, 15th century B'Paleja, Moscow, Gosudarstvennui Istoriceskij Muzej, Sin. 211 (869), ff 79-90, 14th century and K.Paleja of Soloveck, Petersburg, Rossijskaja Nacional'naja Biblioteka, Kazan.

Haag, and appeared in 1898 in the Latter-day Saint magazine Improvement Era, under the title The Book of the Revelation of Abraham. trans. Another notable English translation was produced by G.H. Box and J.I. Landsman some twenty years later.  Date of composition  Speculations of the time this ancient work was written vary greatly. Currently, only Old Slavonic language texts of the original have been discovered. So how far back in time the earlier Hebrew texts went is only conjectured. The relative age of these works can be determined by comparing the legend of Abraham as contained in the Apocalypse with those in the Talmud and in the Book of Jubilees. The legend of the raven in Jubilees (11:18) and the account of the conversion of Abraham in his boyhood are still unknown to the Apocalypse, while the legend of the fire of the Chaldees is found there still in its incipient stage. The mockery of the idol Barisat is more extended in the Midrash than in the Apocalypse; also the condemnation of Terah as an idolater, as related in the Apocalypse, discloses the older aggadah (Genesis Rabba 39:7), whereas the Book of Jubilees presents the later one (compare Genesis Rabba 30:4 and 39:7, where Terah is treated quite mildly). The Book of Jubilees treats the Temple as still existing, and therefore can be dated prior to 70 AD, when the Temple was destroyed. It is most probably distinct from the Αποκαλυψις Αβρααμ used by the gnostic Sethites, according to Epiphanius,Epiphanius, Haer. xxxix. 5 while the book was possibly known to the author of the Clementine Recognitions i. 32-33, a text that narrates legends known in the 2nd century AD. For this reason, and in comparison with other apocalyptic texts, the text in its current form is usually considered to be written before the second half of the 2nd century AD. Within the usually accepted range of 70–150 AD, the date of 79–81 AD has been speculated.R. Rubinkiewicz, see note at pag 683 of Like all the apocalyptic literature preserved only in Slavonic, there is the problem of possible textual alterations made by the Bogomils, who were interested in this kind of literature, which contains some traces of the Dualistic principle typical of their beliefs. However, the dualistic principle was also a feature of Gnosticism, which was contemporaneous with the original writing of this text. The main suspected Bogomils' interpolations are 20:5.7, 22:5, 9:7, and 23:4-10, as suggested by Rubinkiewicz,R. Rubinkiewicz, pag 684 of but disputed by Sacchi.Sacchi, page 65 of Scholars suspect that some other interpolations are present, including the whole of chapter 7, and some additions, whose extent is difficult to determine, in 29:3-13.  Content  The first eight chapters of the book are introductory in nature. Abraham's young manhood in dealing in his father's house is set out. This contains an account of Abraham's conversion from polytheism to monotheism, quite apart from the apocalypse which follows. The work is notable for its presentation of the ills of idolatry. * The text opens with a description of Abraham helping his father Terah, who is a maker of idols. Abraham's doubts about idol-worship are awakened by accidents that break the stone image of Merumath, and five other idols, that Abraham was supposed to sell. Pondering over this, he objects to his father against such idols, inciting Terah’s anger. Abraham tests further the powers of the idols by placing a wooden statue of Barisat near the fire, and telling the idol to take care of fire. On returning he finds Barisat burnt. He again strongly explains to his father the uselessness of such idols, but without results. (Chapters 1–6) * The fire, the water, the earth, and the heavenly bodies are shown to be more worthy than the idols, although each one of these elements is subject to another force, so none of them can claim to be God. (Chapter 7, perhaps a later addition) * Abraham is still considering his father's answer when he hears a voice from heaven asking him to leave his father’s house. He has scarcely left when a fire descends and burns Terah’s house. (Chapter 8) The apocalyptic section begins with Abraham's sacrifice to God, expanding and modifying the Biblical narrative of : * The voice of God orders Abraham to prepare a sacrifice on the high mountain (Mount Horeb) where he will receive a revelation. Abraham is asked to prepare for forty days for the event. The angel Yahoel is sent to Abraham, terrified of the experience, to guide him and to teach him how to perform the sacrifice. Yahoel introduces himself as a being \\"whose name is like unto that of God Himself\\", followed by a long introduction of his duties. (Chapters 9–11) * On Mount Horeb, under the guidance of Yahoel, and assisted by many other angels, Abraham offers up his sacrifice, but not without being disturbed by Azazel, the fallen archangel and seducer of mankind. Azazel, in the form of an unclean bird, swoops down upon the carcasses, and, speaking with a human voice, tries to persuade Abraham to leave the holy place. Abraham is not seduced and Yahoel fights off Azazel. Yahoel then adds that the celestial garments, originally set aside for Azazel, now belong to Abraham. (Chapters 11–14) The third part of the Apocalypse of Abraham narrates the ascension of Abraham to heaven: * Abraham and Yahoel, borne by a dove, ascend to the heavens; they see a great light and a great crowd in the likeness of men that are changing in aspect, running, prostrating, and crying aloud, and a fire comes toward them. They kneel down and worship the fire and a divine voice is heard, as the sound of rushing waters. Yahoel teaches Abraham a hymn of praise to sing, by which they ask the Lord to accept their prayer and the sacrifice made by the Lord himself. When they reach the seventh heaven, Abraham sees a classic example of Merkabah: the throne of God (but he does not see God), the four Living Beings with aspects of man, lion, ox, and eagle, and the many-eyed wheels. Yahoel has the task of mitigating the rivalry among the Living Beings. (Chapters 15–18) * Abraham is shown by God everything that exists in the heavens: the angels, the celestial bodies, and the Earth, and everything that is moving upon it. He sees also the Leviathan and its possessions in the nethermost waters, the rivers and their origin, and the Garden of Eden. He realizes it is the whole creation as designed by God before God decreed it to exist. (Chapters 19–22) * He sees the scene of the Fall: Adam and Eve as huge figures who are beguiled to commit sin by Azazel through his causing them to eat from the forbidden fruit (here said to be a grape from the vine). Abraham asks God why he would allow man to be corrupted by Azazel, and God replies that those who do evil have chosen to do so – which is hated by God – and they have been given over to Azazel. Abraham then asks God why God has allowed that evil should be desired in the hearts of men. (Chapter 23) * God tells Abraham that he has allowed man to desire evil because he is angered by the treatment on Earth of Abraham's descendants as God's chosen people, and instructs Abraham to look again at the scene before him to see the judgement of man. He sees Cain and the \\"slaughtered Abel, (and) the destruction brought and caused upon him through the lawless one.\\" He sees Impurity, Theft and Desire as personified sins and the destruction wrought by each. (Chapter 24) * Abraham then sees a scene of idolatry with boys being slaughtered, and God explains that it is his Temple and his priesthood full of his anger against the people who came out from Abraham. A vision of the destruction of the Temple follows and it is explained to Abraham that this is due to the sin of idolatry on the part of his seed, but the coming of men who will take care of his seed is also predicted. (Chapters 25–27) * Answering how long the judgment lasts, God reveals a description of the last times: the Age is said to be divided in twelve parts; a character known simply as “a man” will appear from the pagan side, worshipped by many pagans, Jews, and by Azazel, and insulted and beaten by other Jews; ten plagues will occur; and finally, at the sound of the trumpet, the Chosen One (the Messiah) will be sent to fight the enemies, and the judgment will pass upon the heathen and the wicked. The book is closed by a short promise of the chosen people’s deliverance from oppression. (Chapters 28–32) The Man is also called \\"The Relief\\" and this man is kissed on his face by Azazel, not worshipped by him. Judas Iskariot gives Jesus from Nazareth a kiss on his face, when betraying him and it is Satan who affects J.Iskariot. In the Gospel of Luke chapter 2 verse 25 we read about Symeon who, among the rest of the Jews, are waiting for the \\"Consolation of Israel\\" to be born into the world. Relief and Consolation may well be the same person, and indeed in the Gospel of Luke the \\"Consolation of Israel\\" is also referred to as Messiah. Also there might be a reference to this scripture by Jesus from Nazareth himself, in the Gospel of John chapter 8, verse 56, where Jesus is talking about Abraham who in a prophetic vision is to see Christ being born into the world. This prophetic vision is not mentioned in the Old Testament of the Bible, nor in the Torah. CharactersYahoel= Yahoel (or Iaoel) in the Apocalypse of Abraham is the mighty angel sent to guide Abraham. Yahoel introduces himself as a being possessed of the power of the Ineffable Name \\"whose name is like unto that of God Himself\\". As the angel nearer to God, or perhaps as a manifestation of the power of God himself, Yahoel is said to be also the heavenly choirmaster, the one who teaches the angels their hymn, who has the control over \\"the threats and attacks of the reptiles\\", the angel with the chief task of protecting and watching over Israel. These functions were traditionally ascribed to Michael and mark the gradual transformation of Michael, originally the guardian angel of Israel, into Meṭaṭron. Yahoel's body is depicted as being like sapphire, his face like chrysolite, his hair like snow, his turban like the appearance of the rainbow, and his garments as purple, with a golden sceptre is in his right hand. Iaoel and Yahoel have been used also as alternate names for Metatron. = Azazel = In the Apocalypse of Abraham, Azazel is portrayed as an unclean bird which comes down upon the sacrifice which Abraham, the Biblical patriarch, has prepared. This is in reference to Genesis 15:11, \\"Birds of prey came down upon the carcasses, and Abram drove them away\\". :And the unclean bird spoke to me and said, \\"What are you doing, Abraham, on the holy heights, where no one eats or drinks, nor is there upon them food for men. But these all will be consumed by fire and ascend to the height, they will destroy you.\\" And it came to pass when I saw the bird speaking I said this to the angel: \\"What is this, my lord?\\" And he said, \\"This is disgrace, this is Azazel!\\" And he said to him, \\"Shame on you Azazel! For Abraham's portion is in heaven, and yours is on earth, for you have selected here, (and) become enamored of the dwelling place of your blemish. Therefore the Eternal Ruler, the Mighty One, has given you a dwelling on earth. Through you the all-evil spirit [is] a liar, and through you (are) wrath and trials on the generations of men who live impiously.\\" – Apocalypse of Abraham 13:4–9 The Apocalypse of Abraham also associates Azazel with Hell. Abraham says to him, \\"May you be the firebrand of the furnace of the earth! Go, Azazel, into the untrodden parts of the earth. For your heritage is over those who are with you\\" (14:5–6). There is also the idea that God's heritage (the created world) is largely under the dominion of evil. It is \\"shared with Azazel\\" (20:5). Azazel is also identified with the serpent which tempted Eve. His form is described as a dragon with \\"hands and feet like a man's, on his back six wings on the right and six on the left.\\" (23:7) = \\"A man\\" in Chapter 29 = The Apocalypse of Abraham is concerned with the future of the Jewish nation, Israel. In Chapter 29, an ambiguous character known simply as \\"a man\\" appears. He is usually equated with the Antichrist ; the \\"man of sin\\". The text tells us that some worship this man, while others revile him. He is worshiped even by Azazel. Apparently, the man has the task of offering some kind of remission for the heathens in the end of days. According to Jacob Licht (Professor of Biblical Studies, Tel-Aviv University), this work is a Jewish text, although not one that represents mainstream rabbinic Jewish thought. Licht writes: :The most obvious and perhaps the correct explanation of this passage is to declare it a late Christian interpolation, yet \\"the man\\" does not fit the medieval Christian concept of Jesus. His function is not clearly messianic. This problematic passage therefore may have originated in some Judeo-Christian sect, which saw Jesus as precursor of the Messiah, or it may be Jewish, badly rewritten by an early Christian editor. Perhaps it reflects a Jewish view of Jesus as an apostle to the heathen, an explanation which would make it unique, and indeed startling. NotesSources *R.

A single Bramo 323 radial engine powered two three-bladed rotors mounted on twin booms on either side of the cylindrical fuselage. Although the Fa 223 is noted for being the first helicopter to attain production status, production of the helicopter was hampered by Allied bombing of the factory, and only 20 were built. The Fa 223 could cruise at with a top speed of , and climb to an altitude of . The Drache could transport cargo loads of over at cruising speeds of and altitudes approaching .  Design and development  Henrich Focke had been removed by the Nazi regime from the company he had co-founded in 1936. Though the ostensible reason was that he was \\"politically unreliable\\", the RLM's decision to phase Focke-Wulf into the production program of the almost-ready Messerschmitt Bf 109 necessitated an influx of capital to fund the immediate expansion of the company's production capabilities. Focke-Wulf was reorganized into a limited company (G.m.b.H.) in June 1936.The Warplanes of the Third Reich, p172, 2nd col. 2nd para. After Focke-Wulf formally signed a contract to produce the Bf 109C in November 1937, the American company International Telephone & Telegraph (ITT), through its German subsidiary C. Lorenz, bought a 28 percent share of Focke-Wulf in 1938, making it the controlling interest.The Sovereign State of ITT, Anthony Sampson, ; p.28, 3rd para. However, the Air Ministry was so impressed by the Focke-Wulf Fw 61 helicopter that it suggested Focke establish a new company dedicated to helicopter development and issued him with a requirement for an improved design capable of carrying a payload. Focke established the Focke-Achgelis company at Hoykenkamp on 27 April 1937 in partnership with pilot Gerd Achgelis, and began development work at Delmenhorst in 1938.Air International May 1984, p.247. They first produced an enlarged, six-occupant version of the Fw 61, designated Fa 226 Hornisse (Hornet), while contracting out development of the engine, transmission, and rotor hub to BMW's Berlin works. The Fa 226 was the world's first transport helicopter and was ordered by Lufthansa in 1938.Polmar, p. 56 The Fa 226 attracted the attention of the Air Ministry, who redesignated it Fa 223 in 1939 before the first prototype flew.Air International May 1984, p. 259. The Navy was also interested in the Hornisse and briefly considered it as a replacement for their Schnellboote. In September 1939 the first prototype, the V1, left the Delmenhorst factory. Now nicknamed Drache (\\"Dragon\\") it had a twin-rotor layout similar to the Fw 61, but had a fully enclosed cabin and load bay, with the single Bramo engine mounted in the middle of the tubular- steel body. Initial hovering tests showed problems and the V1 was not to fly until 1940. The engine initially specified, a BMW Bramo 323D proved too fragile when run at high speed for any length of time, and was replaced with a more robust 1,000 hp Bramo 323Q3 in the later prototypes to improve reliability and lifting capability. The biggest problem, however, was the severe vibration caused by unbalanced driveshafts when the rotors moved out of phase, and this could only be fixed by greater attention to detail on the part of BMW. = First flight = The V1's first untethered flight was on 3 August 1940, after over 100 hours of ground and tethered testing. In October, it was flown to the test centre at Rechlin to be demonstrated, and while there set a top speed of , a climb rate of per minute, and a maximum altitude of , performance far greater than had been demonstrated by any other helicopter in the world. Despite this, the Drache was nowhere near ready for military service, and Focke-Achgelis were told to accelerate their development programme. An initial production order for 100 machines was promised. Following the helicopter's demonstration at Rechlin, the Ministry issued specifications for five variants: On 5 February 1941, the V1 was lost in an accident following engine failure at an altitude too low for an auto-rotative landing. The second prototype (V2) was completed shortly after, featuring a fully glazed cockpit and a machine gun operated by the observer. It was, however, soon destroyed in an Allied air raid. = V3 prototype = By the time the V3 prototype appeared the Air Ministry had abandoned the idea of different variants and settled on a single multipurpose aircraft, to be designated Fa 223E, which could combine all the roles; the V3 reflected this new thinking and set the design features for all the models that followed and it incorporated dual controls and an electric winch. Like its predecessors, the V3's body consisted of welded steel tubing covered with treated fabric to save weight and make repairs easier. Its interior was divided into four sections — the cockpit, where pilot and observer sat side by side, with the pilot on the left; the load compartment; the engine compartment; and the tail section. The engine and gearbox were centrally mounted and held in place by a series of tensioned steel cables, with the gearbox in front of the engine.Smith and Kay 1972, pp. 598–599.Air International May 1984, pp. 262–263. Two steel tube outriggers extended out from the sides of the fuselage to carry the twin rotors, of three-bladed configuration and wooden construction with a steel spar, which were mounted 12.5 m (41 ft 0 in) apart, far enough that they did not overlap.Air International May 1984, pp. 259–260. In 1943, an enlarged, four-rotored version of the Fa 223 was considered, but not developed beyond the construction of a center fuselage section.Kay and Smith 2002, p.293.  Operational history  Production = Serial production of the Fa 223 began at the Focke-Achgelis factory in Delmenhorst in 1942. The site was struck in June that year by an Allied air raid and destroyed along with the two surviving prototypes and the first seven pre- production machines undergoing final assembly.Air International June 1984, p.291. Attempts were made to restore production but were abandoned in 1943, and a new plant was set up at Laupheim, near Ulm. The first Drache to emerge from the new factory, the V11, was flown by pilot Karl Bode for a series of information films made for the Air Ministry to demonstrate the Fa 223's abilities. Loads which included a complete Fieseler Storch aircraft and the fuselage of a Bf 109 were shown being lowered with great precision on to vehicles using the Drache's winch and special quick-release electrical cargo hook. In early 1944, a Dornier Do 217 crashed high up on the Vehner moor in Lower Saxony, between Osnabrück and Oldenburg, and it was decided to send the V11 to recover the wreckage. Unfortunately the V11 ended up crashing nearby before it could attempt to lift the Do 217's remains. It was then decided to attempt to recover both using the V14. Flown by Karl Bode and Luftwaffe helicopter pilot Helmut Gerstenhauer, the operation was begun on 11 May 1944. A small team of Focke-Achgelis men and a Luftwaffe recovery company had already dismantled the V11, and the V14 made 10 flights carrying loads beneath it in a cargo net and setting them down where they could be loaded onto road vehicles. All the major parts of the V11 and the Do 217 were retrieved, and much useful experience was gained. Following this, the Air Ministry decided to evaluate the helicopter's potential as a transport in mountainous regions, and the V16 was assigned to the Mountain Warfare School at Mittenwald, near Innsbruck, with the V14 as a backup. The objective of the tests was to see how the Drache would perform as a general-purpose all-weather transport, and numerous landings were made at altitudes of over above sea level, plus experimental transportation of artillery guns to mountain troops. When the trials ended in October 1944, a total of 83 flights had been made, with a total flying time of 20 hours.Air International June 1984, pp. 291–292. Only seven machines had been constructed at Laupheim before an air raid halted production in July 1944, and wiped out the factory. At the time of the raid, the V18 prototype was ready for delivery, 13 Drachen were in assembly, and there were enough components for a further 19. Following the raid the Air Ministry decided that it was useless to pursue the project any further and following the mountain trials Focke was assigned to Messerschmitt's staff.Air International June 1984, p.292. Only weeks later, Focke received new orders, this time to return to the Focke-Achgelis company and to move the entire operation to Berlin Tempelhof Airport where flight testing was to be resumed, and a production line established to produce 400 helicopters per month. The V12, after completing a long cross-country flight from Germany, was flown to Mont Blanc to perform a rescue of 17 people trapped on the mountain. Unfortunately, a mechanical link failure resulted in a rotor disintegrating, and, although the machine touched down on its wheels, it was hurled against an embankment and the crew was killed.Smith and Kay 1972, pp. 600–601. = Danzig flight = The company had managed to keep hold of two of the five surviving Drachen and managed to produce a new example at Tempelhof in February 1945. Almost immediately it was ordered on a \\"special order from the Führer\\" to fly to Danzig on 25 February. Flown by Gerstenhauer and two copilots, the Drache took off from Tempelhof the next day. It first headed southwest in the direction of Würzburg. Gerstenhauer lost his bearings in the bad weather and had to land at Crailsheim. Once the weather improved, they set off again and landed at Würzburg to refuel, reaching Meiningen, where it stopped overnight. The next day it set off northeast and flew to Werder, a distance of . On the third day the Drache continued towards Stettin-Altdamm, but the bad weather again forced them to land, this time at Prenzlau. They attempted to resume the flight the next day, but the weather remained bad and they had to stop at Stolp, west of Danzig, for the night.Air International June 1984, p.293. By 5 March the war situation had become very bad, and Gerstenhauer decided they had to leave Stolp before the Soviets arrived. They took off and flew directly to Danzig right over the advancing Soviet army, reaching Danzig only to find that the city was already falling. They landed outside the city to wait for further orders, which when they came directed them to return to Werder. They did this via a lengthy flight along the Baltic coast via Garz, not reaching Werder until 11 March. The twelve days of actual flight had seen Gerstenhaur and his crew cover a distance of with a flight time of 16 hours 25 minutes. = TS/40 = In January 1945, the Air Ministry assigned the other three Drachen to Transportstaffel 40 (TS/40) at Mühldorf, Bavaria, the Luftwaffe's only operational helicopter squadron, equipped with at least five Flettner Fl 282s as well as the Drachen. TS/40 relocated to various sites before ending up at Ainring in Germany, where one of the Drachen was destroyed by its pilot to prevent it being captured and the other two were seized by US forces. = Cross-Channel flight = Captured Fa 223 The US intended to ferry captured aircraft back to the US aboard a ship, but only had room for one of the captured Drachen. The RAF objected to plans to destroy the other, the V14, so Gerstenhauer, with two observers, flew it across the English Channel from Cherbourg to RAF Beaulieu on 6 September 1945, the first crossing of the Channel by a helicopter. The V14 later made two test flights at RAF Beaulieu before being destroyed on 3 October, when a driveshaft failed. The accident was thought to be due to a failure to correctly tension the steel cables which secured the engine, despite warnings from Gerstenhauer.Air International June 1984, p.294. = Postwar production = In France, the Sud-Est company constructed the SE.3000 as a development of the Fa 223, assisted by Focke. Designed for transport purposes, it had accommodation for four passengers and was powered by a 720 hp (540 kW) Bramo \\"Fafnir\\" engine. Three were built, the first flown on 23 October 1948. Two Fa 223s were completed by the Československé Závody Letecké (formerly Avia) factory in Czechoslovakia in 1945–1946 from salvaged components, and designated VR-1.

Remington and Sons between 1860 and 1863. Only two hundred were produced. Description It is a .17 (4.3 mm) caliber pistol, featuring a three-inch (7.6 cm) brass barrel, a two-piece breech, a brass grip, wrapped in a silver plate finish. No serial numbers or barrel markings were printed on the pistols. Fewer than 40 original examples are known to exist today, including two prototypes and several larger model examples. It is the smallest Remington Pistol ever made and was produced for only three years; the total estimated production quantity is less than two hundred. Not made for use with powder propellants, this diminutive sidearm launches 4.3 mm projectiles at surprisingly high velocities with the use of a percussion cap only. On September 13, 1859, Joseph Rider was issued patent 25,470 for the Remington- Rider Pistol; this patent is commemorated by the gang stamp RIDER'S PT. SEPT 13, 1859 on the left side of the barrel. The frame, grips, and 3-inch barrel were integrally constructed of sand-cast brass. Some of the known examples have a natural bronze or silver-plated finish; a few are engraved. Only one is known to be rifled; this one is also the most profusely engraved, inscribed and dated and is probably unique. Purpose These little pistols were intended to be a parlor pistol and not a defensive weapon. They are designed for use with a percussion cap and lead shot, without gunpowder. There are two types of breech-pieces, about equal in frequency in existing production guns; all known prototypes have the one-piece design, which provides no cover to enclose the cap, and its locking lever is quite short. It was also rumoured to have been used by spies. The two-piece design has a cone to hold the cap, a cover providing protection from the exploding cap, and a longer lever.

The unbuilt H.XVIII represented, in many respects, a scaled-up version of the Horten Ho 229, a prototype jet fighter. The H.XVIII was one of many proposed designs for an Amerikabomber, and would have carried sufficient fuel for transatlantic flights. The XVIIIA variant, with its wood structure, buried engines in the fuselage, flying wing design and carbon-based glue component, would have been, in theory, the first stealth bomber in history.Mahé, 2018. pp.141 Design In recent years, software modelling has suggested that the stealth and speed of the Hortens' flying wing jet designs would have made interception, prior to bombing, difficult and unlikely.Myhra, 1998. pp. The ability of bomber crews, in an aircraft such as the Horten H.XVIII, to attack targets in North America, might have been hampered by existing and emerging Allied air defence strategies and technologies, such as: * increasing air attacks on German factories and airbases; * intelligence gathering, especially advances in cryptanalysis; * ongoing improvements in radar (especially early warning and airborne radar), and; * high-altitude and/or long-range combat air patrols. VariantsH.XVIIIA= The A model of the H.XVIII was a long, smooth blended wing body. Its six turbojet engines were buried deep in the wing and the exhausts centered on the trailing end. Resembling the Horten Ho 229 flying wing fighter there were many odd features that distinguished this aircraft; the jettisonable landing gear\\"Horton Ho 18a.\\" luft46.co. Retrieved: 15 August 2009. and the wing made of wood and carbon based glue, are but two. The aircraft was first proposed for the Amerika Bomber project and was personally reviewed by Hermann Göring: after review, the Horten brothers (with deep dissatisfaction) were forced to share design and construction of the aircraft with Junkers and Messerschmitt engineers, who wanted to add a single rudder fin as well as suggesting underwing pods to house the engines and landing gear. =H.XVIIIB= The B model of the H.XVIIIB was generally the same as the A model, except the four (down from six) engines and four-wheel retractable landing gear were now housed in underwing pods, and the three-man crew housed under a bubble canopy. The aircraft was to be built in huge concrete hangars and operate off long runways with construction due to start in autumn 1945, but the end of the war came with no progress made. Defensive armament was considered unnecessary due to the expected high performance. =H.XVIIIC/B-2= The C model of the H.XVIII was based on the airframe of the H.XVIIIA with a huge tail. It had an MG 151 turret set in the middle rear of the wing and with six BMW 003 turbojets slung under the wings; this was designed by Messerschmitt and Junkers engineers. It is uncertain if this overall design was directly developed by the Horten brothers or their manufacturer, as there is little surviving evidence of this proposed version. It was eventually rejected by the Horten brothers, as it was not a major improvement over the Ho XVIIIA. Specifications (H.XVIIIA)See alsoReferencesNotesBibliography= * Horten, Reimar and Peter F.

Early life and family Born in Auckland on 23 December 1924, Castle was educated at Mount Albert Grammar School. He went on to study at Auckland University College, graduating Bachelor of Science in 1947, and trained as a secondary school teacher at Auckland Teachers' Training College. After a period as a science teacher at Mount Albert Grammar School, he took a lecturing position at Auckland Teachers' College. In 1959, Castle married Ruth Main. The couple had one child, but later divorced. Pottery Castle's first experience of pottery was as a 10-year-old, seeing Olive Jones demonstrating at the Auckland Easter Show. Castle began making his first pottery in 1947 and took night classes with Robert Nettleton Field at Avondale College, Auckland. In 1956, he moved to St Ives, Cornwall for a year to work with Bernard Leach and became a full-time potter in 1963. The same year he helped establish the New Zealand Society of Potters. In the early 1950s, Castle met Theo Schoon and Schoon decorated the surfaces of pots thrown and fired by Castle. In the 1960s Schoon introduced him to the geothermal areas of the central North Island of New Zealand. Castle has continued to photograph this landscape area, which is also reflected in his pottery.Simpson, P. (2008) Mountains to the Sea. Hawke’s Bay Museum and Art Gallery, Napier; In the early 1960s, Castle had an architecturally designed house built in the bush of the Waitākere Ranges at 20 Tawini Road, Titirangi, with a kiln and rail system out the back, and a low basement which allowed pottery to be exhibited.Glamorous New Zealand Homes in the Bush', New Zealand Woman's Weekly, 4 June 1962, cover, and pp. 16–17 Turning room for tour buses was provided in the street outside. The Boyes family, which bought the house, demolished the kiln; however, the bricks from it form the paving round the lower part of the house, and shards from discarded pottery works can still be found amongst the clay soil of the bush behind. Castle studied pottery in Japan, Korea and China in 1966–67. He named Shoji Hamada as one of his influences. Castle built a new house in South Titirangi with a larger kiln and even more extensive railway to serve it in 1972–73, which is still operating. In 1989, along with a number of other New Zealand ceramic and glass artists, he was commissioned to supply work for the exhibition Treasures of the Underworld for the New Zealand pavilion at the World Expo at Seville in 1991. This work is now in the collection of the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa.\\"Len Castle\\", Collections Online, Te Papa Castle died on 29 September 2011. Honours and awards In the 1986 Queen's Birthday Honours, Castle was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire, for services to pottery.

He was involved in the Whitman Massacre and was a primary leader during the subsequent Cayuse War. The Cayuse, and their neighbors the Nez Percé, identified the Walla Walla Valley of the Oregon territory as their primary homeland. When approached by Presbyterian missionary Marcus Whitman in 1835, Tiloukaikt and other Cayuse leaders consented to the establishment of a mission in the valley. Sometime later, Whitman and his wife Narcissa created the mission and school at Waiilatpu, in the Walla Walla Valley. A number of Cayuse children attended the school and were taught by Narcissa Whitman. The mission served as a way station for travelers along the Oregon Trail. Early relations between the Cayuse and Nez Perce and the missionaries throughout the region were generally peaceful. However, tensions between Roman Catholic and Protestant missionaries and the increasing number of white adventurers and settlers in the territory led to misunderstandings and disagreements. The growing white population also brought disease to the Pacific northwest and its native peoples. Measles and scarlet fever broke out among both white and native populations. Whitman, a trained physician, treated both Indians and whites. However, due to the lack of immunity in the native population, more Indians than whites died. When the number of dead Cayuse children began to rise, some Cayuse became suspicious that Whitman was poisoning his patients rather than treating them. Contemporary accounts suggest that some white settlers encouraged the Cayuse in this belief. During a measles epidemic in 1847, suspicion and ill feeling came to a head. During a November 29 visit to the mission for medicine, Tiloukaikt had words with Whitman. While they were talking, a warrior named Tomahas struck Whitman from behind, inflicting several wounds with a tomahawk. Other Cayuse fell on the mission occupants, killing Narcissa Whitman and twelve others. Another fifty three men, women and children were captured and held as hostages. Settlers in the nearby Willamette Valley, led by fundamentalist clergyman Cornelius Gilliam, raised a volunteer militia for a rescue attempt. A peace commission, headed by Joel Palmer, was established to meet with neighboring tribes in hopes of avoiding an escalation of violence. However, the hostages were actually saved through the actions of Peter Skene Ogden of the Hudson's Bay Company, who negotiated and paid for their release. However, Gilliam and his militia attacked an encampment of uninvolved Cayuse, which led to a period of violence between Cayuse and Palouse people and the settlers and militia. This became known as the Cayuse War. Eventually, the white militia withdrew and the area settled into an uneasy peace. However, if a real peace was to be established, white settlers demanded that those who had killed Whitman and the other mission residents should be punished. Two years later, five Cayuse, including Tiloukaikt, surrendered. They were taken to Oregon City, tried and sentenced to hang. Before his execution on June 3, 1850, Tiloukaikt accepted Catholic last rites while refusing to deal with the Presbyterian missionaries. Defiant and angry, Tiloukaikt spoke on the gallows, \\"Did not your missionaries teach us that Christ died to save his people? So we die to save our people.\\" The death of the five Cayuse did not significantly reduce tensions in the area. Raids, initiated by both whites and natives, continued. Eventually, most surviving Cayuse left the Walla Walla area and joined neighboring tribes including the Nez Perce, Umatilla and Yakama.

His stage name is a palindrome of his birth given name. BiographyEarly life= Trebor was born Robert Schenkman and grew up in Northeast Philadelphia; he is of Jewish origin. He first showed signs of interest in acting around age 13. He was soon taking acting classes and participating in local theater groups. He also won several filmmaking awards from Kodak short film competitions, and the local ABC Philadelphia and PBS affiliates for a short black and white film called \\"Communicate!?\\" =Starring Himself= He wrote, directed, and starred in this short, as well as composed the music on an early version of a Moog synthesizer. His first lead role on the stage was as Finch in How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying for the St. Joseph's Summer Music Theatre Festival. Along with his acting Robert won several national awards from Scholastic Magazines for writing film and theatre reviews. Ironically one of his award-winning reviews was for John Frankenheimer's The Fixer. Years later he would appear in Frankenheimer's 1986 film 52 Pick-Up. After a brief focus on oratory, he returned to acting, majoring in theater at Northwestern University. He returned to Philadelphia to star with Bill Irwin in a revival of George Gershwin's Strike Up The Band for the inaugural season of the American Music Theatre Festival at the historic Walnut Street Theatre. Trebor has since alternated between film and television. =Film and television= Trebor played the Son of Sam killer in Out of the Darkness opposite Martin Sheen. On television, after playing Waylin the slave in Hercules and the Lost Kingdom, the second of five TV movies, Trebor rose to fame for playing the ever-out-to-make-a-dinar merchant Salmoneus, a character originating on Hercules: The Legendary Journeys and making occasional crossovers to sister show Xena: Warrior Princess. He appeared in the 2016 Coen Brothers film Hail, Caesar!, playing opposite Josh Brolin. =Theatre= A recent project for the theatre is a one-man show called \\"The Return of Brother Theodore\\". The Los Angeles Weekly gave the show its prized \\"GO\\" recommendation and said, \\"actor Robert Trebor reincarnates Gottlieb in a 45-minute late-night solo performance that paints Brother Theodore’s belligerent reflections on a twisted life with broad yet powerful comedic strokes.\\" This production was nominated by The LA Weekly for Best Solo Performance of 2007. Trebor starred as the Russian Major Viktor Davidykov in the drama Ravensridge written by TS Cook. Mr. Cook was the writer of the aforementioned Out Of The Darkness produced in 1985. His work in this play has been widely praised, Variety saying \\"Trebor is superb as the acerbic Davidykov, ironically bemoaning, \\"We used to be such a beautiful police state,\\" and then affectingly describing how for all of communism's faults, how important it was that the whole country was experiencing it together. Trebor's Russian accent is excellent, and his perf is multilayered and nimble.\\" =Author= He wrote the critically acclaimed satiric novella The Haircut Who Would Be King, that Kirkus said was \\"A hilarious rendering of the contemporary political scene.\\" Bookpleasures.com wrote,\\"This is a parody at its supreme best; uproariously funny yet accurate.

Its publication coincided with the comet's 1986 approach to the Earth. Written in the third person, the perspective alternates between the three main characters, the \\"spacer\\" Carl Osborn, the computer programmer Virginia Herbert and the doctor and geneticist Saul Lintz.  Overview  The novel tells the story of an expedition beginning in the year 2061 to capture Halley's Comet into a short period orbit so that its resources can be mined. The discovery of life on the comet and the subsequent survival struggle against the indigenous lifeforms and the illnesses and infections they cause leads to a breakdown of the expedition crew and the creation of factions based around political beliefs, nationality and genetic differences between the \\"percells\\"—genetically enhanced humans—and the \\"orthos\\"—unmodified humans. As well as the fighting between these factions, Earth rejects the mission due to fear of contamination from the halleyform life and attempts to destroy the comet and those living upon it. Eventually the mission crew on Halley are forced to accept that they can never return to earth and create a new biosphere within the comet's core and in some cases evolve into symbiotic organisms with the halleyform life. Subplots within the novel include the love triangle between the three major characters, Saul's quest for immortality through the creation of clones of himself and Virginia's development and nurture of the bio-organic stochastic computer JonVon, into whom Saul eventually transfers her consciousness before her brain dies as a result of an accident. The description of many of the interactions with JonVon and this final transference of consciousness is similar to the descriptions of the matrix in the William Gibson novel Neuromancer.

Founding The original founders were John Allen from Virginia and Elisha Rumsey from New York. On May 25, 1824, the town plat was registered with Wayne County as \\"Annarbour\\"; this represents the earliest known use of the town's name. Their wives' names were both Ann (in the latter case, either Ann Rumsey or Ana Rumsey, depending on the text consulted). One account states that Allen and Rumsey decided to name the settlement \\"Annarbour\\", for their spouses (after discarding the alternative names Allensville and Anapolis) and for the stands of bur oak in the 640 acres (2.6 km²) of land they had purchased for US$800 from the federal government.Chapter 1 (1824-1859): Ann Arbor/Annarbour - the Naming of Ann Arbor (2003) . Pictorial History of Ann Arbor: 1824-1974, accessed through the Ann Arbor District Library at moaa.aadl.org/PictHistory/. The Native Americans of the region knew the settlement as Kaw-geesh-kaw-nick (Ojibwe: Gaa- giishka'aanig [syncope: Gaa-giishkhaanig], \\"saw-milling place\\"), after the sound of \\"mill\\" of Allen's grist mill. Rumsey died in 1827; Allen eventually became the town's postmaster, newspaper publisher, village president, and all- around promoter. The 19th century Several mills, a tannery, and a general store flourished in the settlement. The general store (or tavern, again depending on the source) was painted bright red and the corner on which it was established, at Huron and Main, became known as Bloody Corners. In 1836, Ann Arbor lost a bid to be established as the state capital. However, in 1837 Ann Arbor won a bid to be the new site for the University of Michigan when it offered forty acres (160,000 m²) of land for the site. The Michigan Central Railroad arrived in 1839, making the town a major regional transportation hub. Ann Arbor became the seat of Washtenaw County in 1827, incorporated as a village in 1833, and was chartered as a city in 1851, which was also the year that John Allen died. The town became home first to large numbers of German immigrants from the state of Württemberg) and escapees from the Great Irish Famine (1845-1849), though Canadians accounted for the largest percentage of Ann Arbor's immigrants during most of the 19th century. The 20th century and progressivism Main Street in Ann Arbor c. 1908 During World War I, Germans became targets of animosity because of their alleged sympathy for the German state, and four professors in the University's German department were dismissed because of what was alleged by the regents to be an \\"excess\\" of faculty in the department. During World War II, Ford Motor Company's nearby Willow Run plant turned out B-24 Liberator bombers and the population of Ann Arbor exploded with an influx of military personnel, war workers, and their families. In 1960, Ann Arbor was the site of major speeches by both major presidential candidates, John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon. On October 14, 1960, Kennedy outlined his proposal for what would become the Peace Corps on the front steps of the Michigan Union (a plaque still marks the spot). On May 22, 1964, Lyndon B. Johnson unveiled his Great Society initiative during a University of Michigan commencement address.Progress and Preservation (2003) . Pictorial History of Ann Arbor: 1824-1974, accessed through the Ann Arbor District Library at moaa.aadl.org/PictHistory/1940-1974pg4.php. During the 1960s, Ann Arbor became a focus for both the American civil rights movement and the anti-Vietnam War movement. It was, for example, the site of the first major meetings of Students for a Democratic Society in 1960. After a number of protests and an extensive public campaign, the city passed its first fair housing ordinance in 1963. In June 1969, students and protesters took over portions of South University Avenue over the course of three days of protests and rioting. However, the police, drawn from many surrounding communities, and many with their names and badges covered up, took back the streets with the use of tear gas, police dogs, and the threat of firearms. Between 1972 and 1976, the city council went through a period in which three members of the Human Rights Party (HRP) were elected and fought for several measures that at the time seemed radical, including a pioneering anti-discrimination ordinance, an ordinance reducing penalties for possession of marijuana (the famous \\"five- dollar pot law\\"), and a rent control ordinance. In 1973, Kathy Kozachenko was elected to the Ann Arbor city council, becoming the nation's first openly gay candidate to run successfully for elected office. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, Ann Arbor was home to many influential rock bands, such as the MC5, Alice Cooper, Iggy Pop, Brownsville Station, George Clinton, Bob Seger and the Silver Bullet Band, Mitch Ryder, and The Rationals. Madonna was a dance major at the University of Michigan in the late 1970s. In 1969, avant-garde jazz bandleader Sun Ra and his Arkestra spent about a month living in an Ann Arbor frat house, with poet-impresario John Sinclair and his radical White Panther Party for next-door neighbors. Four years after leaving the White House, Gerald R. Ford - a former student and college football player at Michigan - opened his Presidential Library in Ann Arbor. His Museum is located in Grand Rapids, Michigan. The economy of Ann Arbor underwent a gradual shift from a manufacturing base to a service and technology base over the course of the 20th century, a shift which accelerated in the 1970s and 1980s. As of 1999, Ann Arbor was home to 25 research centers and libraries. During the same period, land values have increased and the city has gentrified. Some long-time residents have been driven out by high prices. Conservative groups and movements have also started within the city. The Word of God, a charismatic Christian movement of global scope, started in 1967.From Protest to Outer Space (2003) . Pictorial History of Ann Arbor: 1824-1974, accessed through the Ann Arbor District Library at moaa.aadl.org/PictHistory/1940-1974pg3.php. Ann Arbor also became the site of the Thomas More Law Center, a leading religious- conservative advocacy group founded in 1999. The 21st century On November 2, 2004, a proposition to legalize medical marijuana was passed by a margin of 74% to 26%. Though the city attorney and police chief subsequently declared the law unenforceable, possession of marijuana for personal use has been essentially decriminalized in Ann Arbor for three decades, punishable only by a $25 civil-infraction fine and no criminal record. However, the much harsher state law applies to possession on university property (see Cannabis laws in Ann Arbor). The same day, voters approved a greenbelt plan: the city government would acquire development rights to agricultural land bordering Ann Arbor to prevent sprawling development. Since then, local debate has hinged on whether (and how) to accommodate development within city limits. The Greenbelt has, at times, been controversial because if other planned measures (like increasing the city's density) stall, already high property values could rise further, pushing low and middle income residents to new exurbs beyond the greenbelt. In September 2020, Ann Arbor had decriminalized the non- psychoactive drug called psilocybin.

SummaryNew York Yankees vs. Kansas City Royals=Game summariesGame 1= The series opener saw the Yankees throw their ace, Ron Guidry, against the Royals' Larry Gura. In the top of the second, the Bronx Bombers jumped out to a 2–0 lead when Rick Cerone and Lou Piniella smacked back-to-back home runs. However, in the bottom of the inning, the Royals struck back. Amos Otis singled to center and stole second, and John Wathan walked. A wild pitch moved Otis to third and Wathan to second, and Frank White doubled both men home to tie the game. The Royals moved ahead in the third, when George Brett walked and moved to third on a ground-rule double by Otis. A single by Willie Aikens plated both Brett and Otis, chasing Guidry from the game. Brett added a home run off Ron Davis in the seventh, and a Willie Wilson double off Tom Underwood in the eighth scored Darrell Porter and White to give Kansas City a 7–2 lead. The Yankees, meanwhile, could not score against Gura after the back-to-back home runs of the second inning, and the Royals' hurler went the distance as his team drew first blood in the series with a 7–2 victory. =Game 2= Game 2 proved to be much more exciting after the Royals blowout of Game 1. For this contest, the Yankees sent Rudy May to the hill to face the Royals' Dennis Leonard. Kansas City opened the scoring in the bottom of the third, as Darrell Porter and Frank White reached base with consecutive singles. Willie Wilson followed with a triple to right to bring both runners in, and then scored himself on a double to center field by shortstop U L Washington. The Yankees came back with two in the fifth, with Graig Nettles hitting an inside-the-park home run and Willie Randolph lashing a double to right to score Bobby Brown. The eighth inning, however, proved to be the most memorable inning of the game, with the Royals clinging to their 3–2 lead and the Yankees threatening. Willie Randolph singled, and with two outs Bob Watson ripped a liner to deep left field. Confident in Randolph's speed, Yankee third base coach Mike Ferraro decided to wave Randolph home. Left fielder Willie Wilson overthrew his cutoff man, Washington, but third baseman George Brett made a heads-up play by backing up Washington. He then whirled and threw Randolph out at the plate. Television cameras panned the stands where Yankees Owner George Steinbrenner and General Manager Gene Michael were sitting. A furious Steinbrenner appeared to shout Ferraro's name as he turned to Michael. The Royals ended up winning that game by a 3–2 margin and Steinbrenner continued to fume over the play. =Game 3= With a 2–0 series lead, the Royals headed to Yankee Stadium for Game 3. The Royals led 1-0 on Frank White's fifth-inning homer until the bottom of the sixth inning when Oscar Gamble hit a ground ball up the middle with Reggie Jackson on second. Eventual ALCS MVP Frank White ranged far to his right to field the ball, and knowing he could not throw out Gamble at first, attempted an off balance throw to third to hopefully catch Jackson rounding the bag. However, the throw by White, a multiple Gold Glove winner, was too high and Royals third baseman George Brett could not catch it. Jackson scored on the play and Gamble was given third base after the ball rolled into the dugout. Gamble later scored on a single by Rick Cerone and the Yankees gained a 2–1 advantage. Holding on to a 2–1 lead in the seventh inning, pitcher Tommy John gave up a two-out double to Willie Wilson. Yankee manager Dick Howser brought in hard-throwing Goose Gossage, who gave up a single to U L Washington, bringing up George Brett. Brett had wowed the majors during the year, flirting with a .400 batting average, holding an average above .400 as late as September 19 before finishing the year at .390. Brett blasted a Gossage fastball into the upper deck, a three-run home run which stunned the Yankee Stadium crowd. The Royals had a 4–2 lead with All-Star reliever Dan Quisenberry on the mound. The Yankees mounted a major threat in the eighth, loading the bases with no one out. Quisenberry then got Rick Cerone to line into a double play and the next batter to ground out to close out the inning. The ninth went one-two-three as the Royals and the long-suffering Kansas City baseball fans finally won the American League Pennant, getting revenge on the team that had eliminated them for three straight years. Composite box 1980 ALCS (3–0): Kansas City Royals over New York Yankees Aftermath Dick Howser was fired shortly after the conclusion of the 1980 ALCS. Ironically, Howser would go on to win the 1985 World Series as manager of Kansas City. After losing the 1981 World Series to the Los Angeles Dodgers (whom they had beaten in consecutive World Series in and after besting the Royals for the American League crown), the Yankees would not again appear in the Fall Classic until winning in under veteran manager Joe Torre—in a coincidental twist, their best subsequent opportunity prior to 1996 was also during a strike-shortened season: when the 1994 season prematurely ended, the Yankees had the best record in the American League, which was also the second best in baseball. This would also be the last time the Yankees would be swept in a postseason series for 32 years. Four men involved with the 1980 ALCS (Dick Howser, Bobby Murcer, Johnny Oates, and Dan Quisenberry) have died of brain cancer. (Tug McGraw and John Vukovich of the Philadelphia Phillies, who defeated the Royals in that year's World Series, also succumbed to the disease, as did Ken Brett, who pitched for Kansas City in the 1980–81 regular seasons.)

Born František Šimon, he later adopted the additional name 'Tavík', which was his mother's maiden name, generally signing his work T. F. Šimon. Largely ignored during the Communist era in Czechoslovakia, his work has received greater attention in recent years. Life and career Simon was born in Železnice (known at that time as Eisenstadtl) near Jičín. As a student at the Academy of Fine Arts, Prague, he received a stipend that allowed him to travel to Italy, Belgium, England and France. He had his first solo exhibition in Prague in 1905, and a Paris exhibition in 1906. His extensive travels would eventually also bring him to New York City, London, the Netherlands, Spain, Morocco, Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), India, and Japan, images of all of which appear in his work. After spending 1904-1914 based in Paris, Simon returned to Prague and became a professor at the Academy of Fine Arts in 1928. In 1917, he became a founding member of the Hollar Association of Czech Graphic Artists, which he later chaired. Many of his most notable images are of Prague, New York, and Paris, but also include portraiture and self-portraiture and images of the Czech and Slovak countryside. Šimon's style was strongly influenced by the French Impressionists and, perhaps through them, by Japanese printmaking techniques, in particular color aquatints with soft ground etching. Šimon was also a master of the mezzotint but completed very few prints in this difficult medium, most of them being female nudes in subtle tones of black.  Voyage Around the World 1926-1927  He was 49 years old when he undertook the journey of his lifetime, sailing literally around the world departing Cherbourg in September 1926 and travelling through the USA, crossing the newly built Panama Canal to sail the Pacific to the Far East and then back home to Europe via Ceylon and the middle East. On his return, he compiled his correspondence and released the book Listy Z Cesty Kolem Světa (Letters from Around the World), published by J. Otto, Prague in 1928. His notes and letters home reveal a world that was unknown by those in Old Europe – a challenging new mechanistic society in America, a transforming Empire in the Far East, and an untouched paradise in the island of Ceylon. His glimpses into the past provide us with a view of history, through the eyes of a painter, that takes us back to a time when neon lights were marvels, when geisha were icons, before commercial air travel and when the only way to share your adventure with loved ones and family was through sending letters home. Arriving in New York, he wrote, \\"The ship’s orchestra was playing as we slowly approached the port of New York City in the morning. In the distance we could see the outlines of skyscrapers drowning in a silver haze then, as we came closer, rising and standing, etched against the shimmering background of the rising sun. A shiver went up and down my spine as we entered the huge harbour whose backdrop of slim buildings was interspersed with the rising smoke from factories\\". In 2014 his book was translated and published for the first time in English as 'Letters from a Voyage Around the World' with an introduction by the artist's grandson Michal Simon.

Clark has also worked with George Clinton, Patti Smith, Primal Scream, R.L. Burnside and other noteworthy artists.  Biography  Clark was born on December 25, 1962 and raised in Roseville, Michigan, He took an early interest in music and the first album Clark received was a greatest hits compilation by Sonny & Cher as a Valentine's Day gift from his mother. Clark later discovered Warren Zevon, Elton John, The Rolling Stones, Sex Pistols and The Stooges. After graduating from high school, Clark took classes on music production at the Recording Institute in Eastpointe, Michigan, and soon got a job at The Disc Ltd. Clark worked as an assistant engineer on Patti Smith's \\"Wild Leaves,\\" the B-side of the single \\"People Have the Power,\\" which appeared on Smith's 1988 album Dream of Life. During this period, Clark met Kid Rock, and helped produce demos that led to Jive Records signing the aspiring rapper. Clark's talent for producing hip hop music earned him the nickname \\"The Funky Honky\\". In 1989, he helped engineer (and played keyboard on) the debut album of Esham. For Kid Rock's debut album, Grits Sandwiches for Breakfast, Clark produced the single \\"Yo-Da-Lin In The Valley.\\" During the recording of Insane Clown Posse's Carnival of Carnage, the group's manager, Alex Abbiss, hired Clark to produce the album, which featured appearances from Esham and Kid Rock. Clark continued to work with the group and various associated acts on its label, Psychopathic Records. Clark has been involved with the production of albums by George Clinton, R. L. Burnside, and Primal Scream. In 2000, Clark began working on Dark Lotus' debut album, Tales from the Lotus Pod, and Insane Clown Posse's sixth and seventh albums, Bizzar and Bizaar, but had a falling-out with members Violent J and Shaggy 2 Dope. According to Clark, \\"It seemed like too much was going on, and I wasn't sure about the material. I needed a break. I was frazzled, we weren't getting along, so that was it.\\" Clark produced four songs for Tales from the Lotus Pod; the album's production was completed by Twiztid producer Fritz the Cat. In 2001 Clark then started his own record label B4 Records producing records for local acts Dead By 28 and Abstrakt Intellekt. Unfortunately these bands proved to be unprofitable. Clark and rapper Prozak formed the group Project: Deadman, releasing its debut album, Self Inflicted, in 2004, and touring the United States for six months. That year, Clark became a full-time engineer for Kid Rock. Clark contracted pneumonia, but ignored the illness, and began coughing severely as he awoke, leading to a three-month stay in Mount Clemens General Hospital, during which one of his lungs collapsed three times. As the result of his near-death experience, Clark decided to reconcile with J and Shaggy. Phone conversations between Clark and Insane Clown Posse led to Clark producing Utsler's 2006 solo album F.T.F.O. In 2007, Clark produced the Kid Rock single \\"All Summer Long,\\" which was musically based upon a mash-up of Warren Zevon's \\"Werewolves of London\\" and Lynyrd Skynyrd's \\"Sweet Home Alabama\\". The same year, Clark produced Insane Clown Posse's tenth album The Tempest, but did not work with the group directly. In 2009, Clark produced the group's eleventh studio album, Bang! Pow! Boom!, the first album that Clark worked on directly with J and Shaggy since Bizzar and Bizaar. Three years later, Clark produced the group's twelfth studio album The Mighty Death Pop!, as well as the bonus albums Smothered, Covered & Chunked, Freaky Tales, & Mike E. Clark's Extra Pop Emporium.  Music and production style  Mike E. Clark is known for providing an eclectic musical approach in his hip hop production. In Barry Walters' Rolling Stone review of The Amazing Jeckel Brothers, Walters wrote that Clark's production incorporates elements of \\"carnival organ riffs, power chords and shotgun blasts...banjolike plucking and Van Halen-esque guitar squeals.\\" Allrovi writer David Jeffries called Clark's production style a fusion of electro, funk and \\"Oingo Boingo-like mad-clown melodies\\", comparing Clark to George Clinton and Danny Elfman. Clark has cited numerous influences on his music, including punk and heavy metal artists such as Rob Zombie, Black Sabbath, The Cramps, The Clash, Fugazi, and System of a Down, funk musicians Rick James, Prince, James Brown and Parliament-Funkadelic, blues, jazz and R&B; musicians like Serge Gainsbourg, Al Green, Billie Holiday, Curtis Mayfield, Buddy Miles, Bessie Smith and Howlin' Wolf, alternative musicians like Beck, Faith No More, Hüsker Dü, Pixies and Ween, progressive rock artists Pink Floyd and Frank Zappa, and hip hop artists such as Beastie Boys, De La Soul, Public Enemy, Busta Rhymes, Geto Boys, Grandmaster Flash and N.W.A, as well as artists David Bowie, Bob Dylan, Madonna, Bob Marley, Klaus Nomi, War, Yoko Ono and Warren Zevon, and producers Rick Rubin and Phil Spector.

The group was formed in 2005 by Johannes (Hans) van Vliet (born 15 December 1976), who is better known by his pseudonym Hunz. Hunz was raised in Brisbane, Australia and began working on tracker music in his early teens using Protracker, Fast Tracker 2, and Jeskola Buzz. Hunz is noted for being one of the first trackers to make the unconventional move of adding vocals to his compositions. He was also affiliated with the tracking groups Heretics, Analogue, Five Musicians (FM) and Hellven. From 1999 to 2002, Hunz toured the United States as vocalist for the band Beanbag, who released two albums, Free Signal (2000) and Welladjusted (2001), on American label Inpop Records following their Australian independent debut, Guttersnipe (1998). The group disbanded in 2002 after a van accident that left Hunz hospitalized for three days with lung damage. Hunz returned to the music community in 2005 with When Victims Fight, which was his first release under the Hunz moniker. The album was released on Apegenine Recordings on 20 June 2008 and was accompanied by a promotional video that displayed Hunz's motion design and visual art. When Victims Fight was critically acclaimed by Cyclic Defrost, Tokafi and Brisbane street press Time Off. In February 2009, Hunz entered the RPM Challenge, in which musicians across the world attempt to write and record an album within a month.

Recipients had to have been recommended for the award by the Commanding Officer of their Corps, and duly certified by the District Military Authorities in which the Corps was located as having been efficient and thoroughly capable officers, in every way deserving of such a decoration. In order to preserve the purity of the decoration, the name of any person on whom it had been conferred who was subsequently convicted of any act derogatory to his honour as an officer and gentleman, was immediately erased from the registry of individuals upon whom the decoration had been conferred. The Volunteer Officers' Decoration could also be conferred upon any of the Princes of the Royal Family of Great Britain and Ireland. Colonial version On 24 May 1894 the grant of the decoration was extended by Royal Warrant to commissioned officers of Volunteer Forces throughout the British Empire, defined as being India, the Dominion of Canada, the Crown Colonies and the Crown Dependencies. A separate new decoration was instituted, the Volunteer Officers' Decoration for India and the Colonies. This decoration was similar in design to the Volunteer Officers' Decoration, but bore the Royal Cypher \\"VRI\\" (Victoria Regina Imperatrix) instead of \\"VR\\" (Victoria Regina). Even so, some Crown Dependencies awarded the Volunteer Officers' Decoration instead of the Colonial version, until the Efficiency Decoration was instituted in September 1930. Order of wear In the order of wear prescribed by the British Central Chancery of the Orders of Knighthood, the Volunteer Officers' Decoration takes precedence after the Army Emergency Reserve Decoration and before the Volunteer Long Service Medal. Description The decoration is an oval skeletal design and was struck in silver, with parts of the obverse in silver-gilt. It is high and wide with a ring suspender formed of silver wire. ;Obverse The obverse is an oak leaf wreath in silver, tied with gold, with the Royal Cypher below the Royal Crown, both in gold, in the centre. ;Reverse The reverse is plain with the hallmarks impressed at the bottom. The decoration was awarded unnamed, but was frequently unofficially engraved in various styles. ;Ribbon The ribbon is dark green and in width and is suspended from a silver bar-brooch decorated with an oak leaf pattern. Versions King Edward VII version King George V version Three versions of the decoration were struck. The original version of 1892 had the Royal Cypher \\"VR\\" of Queen Victoria below the Royal Crown in the centre. The King Edward VII version, with his Royal Cypher \\"ER VII\\", was introduced after his succession to the throne in 1901 and ceased to be awarded to officers of the United Kingdom's Volunteer Force when it was superseded by the Territorial Decoration in 1908. It appears to have continued to be awarded in some Crown Dependencies until 1910. The King George V version, with his Royal Cypher \\"GVR\\", was introduced after his succession to the throne in 1910. This version appears to have only been awarded in some Crown Dependencies, instead of the Volunteer Officers' Decoration for India and the Colonies. Discontinuation The Volunteer Force was the precursor of the Territorial Force, which was established in the United Kingdom in 1908. At the same time, award of the Volunteer Officers' Decoration was discontinued in the United Kingdom and superseded by the new Territorial Decoration.The London Gazette no. 28181, Tuesday, September 29, 1908 (Accessed on 25 July 2015)The National Archives - War Office: Service Medal and Award Rolls, Volunteer Officers' Decoration and King George V's Coronation Medal (Accessed 28 June 2015) The Volunteer Officers' Decoration continued to be awarded in some Crown Dependencies until the Efficiency Decoration was instituted in September 1930. Bermuda was the last Dependency to award the decoration in 1930.

The film opened to mixed reviews but performed well at the box office in New Zealand. Plot The film takes place in New Zealand in 1868 during Titokowaru's War phase of the New Zealand Wars between the Māori and New Zealand colonial forces. Sarah O'Brien (Samantha Morton) has grown up among soldiers in a frontier garrison on Te Awa Nui, the Great River. Pregnant at 16 by a young Maori boy, she gives birth to a son. When, 7 years later, her son, Boy, is kidnapped by his Maori grandfather, Sarah is distraught. Abandoned by her soldier father, Sarah's life becomes a search for her son. Her only friend, Doyle (Kiefer Sutherland) is a broken-down soldier without the means to help her. Lured to the ill rebel chief Te Kai Po's village by the chance to see her child, Sarah finds herself falling in love with Boy's uncle, Wiremu (Cliff Curtis) and increasingly drawn to the village way of life. Using medical skills she learned from her father, Sarah heals Te Kai Po (Temuera Morrison) and begins to reconcile with her son (Rawiri Pene). But her idyllic time at the village is shattered when she realises that she has healed the chief only to hear him declare war on the Colonials, men she feels are her friends, her only family. Her desperation deepens when she realises that Boy intends to prove himself in war, refusing to go back down river with her. As the conflict escalates Sarah finds herself at the centre of the storm, torn by the love she feels for Boy and Wiremu, anguished over the attachments she still has to the white man's world and sickened by the brutality she witnesses on either side. And when the moment comes, Sarah must choose where she belongs; will she be forced back into the white man's way of life, or will she have the courage to follow the instincts that are telling her where she truly belongs? Cast * Samantha Morton as Sarah O'Brien * Kiefer Sutherland as Doyle * Cliff Curtis as Wiremu * Temuera Morrison as Te Kai Po * Stephen Rea as Francis * Anton Lesser as Major Baine * Rawiri Pene as Sarah's son * Danielle Cormack as Viola Production Sam Neill was originally favoured by Vincent Ward to be cast in a leading role, but he declined. Director Vincent Ward was dismissed from the film towards the end of the shoot to be replaced by cinematographer Alun Bollinger and then in an unusual reversal, was rehired just weeks later for six months of editing and additional shooting in both New Zealand and England. Primary filming was done on the Whanganui River. The film features the song \\"Danny Boy\\" sung in Maori and English. The film is set in 1868, and the lyrics for \\"Danny Boy\\" were written in 1910 and adapted to the traditional Irish melody \\"Londonderry Air\\". It is possible the melody was known in New Zealand at the time, but another 42 years were to pass before the lyrics were written by Frederick Weatherly. Reception The film topped the New Zealand Box Office on its first weekend of release. Alexander Bisley of The Dominion Post says \\"River Queen convinces that you don't have to be indigenous to tell indigenous stories. Ward who lived for 18 months as the sole Pakeha (person of European descent) in a remote Maori community in the Ureweras, deserves a lot of mana (respect). This is his story, this is my story, this is your story - every New Zealander should see River Queen.\\"Bisley, Alexander, River Queen review , Dominion Post, 21 January 2006.

Pre-Confederation The first UNP was a conservative party in the Dominion of Newfoundland led by Frederick C. Alderdice from 1928 to 1934. It was organized by Alderdice when disaffected Liberals joined his Liberal- Conservative Progressive Party sitting in opposition and won the 1932 general election. His government was replaced by an appointed Commission of Government in 1934 (a change his party promised in its 1932 platform as a means of getting the Dominion out of fiscal trouble), resulting in the termination of responsible government in the Dominion. (see also Conservative parties in Newfoundland (pre-Confederation)) Post-Confederation The second United Newfoundland Party was formed prior to the 1959 provincial election, made up of some Progressive Conservative Party of Newfoundland and Labrador caucus members and supporters. The party was formed immediately prior to the election when two Tory MHAs, led by James D. Higgins, supported Premier Joey Smallwood's stance in favour of Newfoundland receiving financial assistance from the federal government indefinitely. Provincial Conservative leader Malcolm Mercer Hollett supported the position of Conservative Prime Minister John Diefenbaker, who maintained that the funding agreement between the two orders of government had run its course. While two UNP MHAs were elected in 1959, Higgins was defeated. Gus Duffy succeeded Higgins as UNP leader and sitting with fellow UNP MHA John R. O'Dea who stepped down after one term. In the 1962 provincial election, Duffy was defeated in his St. John's Centre riding. The party became defunct soon after.

Early life Brad Neely is originally from Fort Smith, Arkansas. He briefly attended the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. Career Neely's work includes the comic series \\"Creased Comics\\" and the Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone spoof Wizard People, Dear Reader, which consists of an alternate soundtrack of narration in the style of a book on tape, which viewers can play over the muted movie. Neely is featured in the documentary We Are Wizards. Neely is the creator of the cartoon Cox & Combes' Washington. Aside from occasional one-off videos, he has also created three series: I Am Baby Cakes, The Professor Brothers, and China, IL, all of which take place in the fictional location of China, Illinois. Baby Cakes shorts are typically in the style of diary entries narrated in the first person by Mark \\"Baby\\" Cakes, a philosophical and possibly mentally ill 30-year-old man. The Professor Brothers follows the professional and personal misadventures of Frank and Steve Smith, two brothers who are professors at a local community college whose mascot is a panda bear. China, IL interweaves the two stories, as Baby Cakes falls in love with Frank's recently dead girlfriend after finding her diary, and the two men attempt to come to terms with their emotional pain upon learning of her death. Neely worked on a comedy novel about the Civil War, but when asked about it at an event at the Alamo Drafthouse in Austin, Texas, said, \\"I realized about 500 pages in that it wasn't that funny\\", and said that he is no longer planning on releasing the book. However, during a November 2013 Q&A; session on Reddit, he said, \\"I work on this book every day. It's become a problem.\\" He has also produced America Now, a 12-part series of 30-second musical shorts for Adult Swim, which was made available on the station's website. Neely was a consultant on the animated series South Park for the second half of its eleventh season. On May 5, 2008, Super Deluxe began releasing a four-part mini-series by Neely entitled China, IL. The site published an installment once a week, culminating on May 25 with a broadcast of the entire series as one 11-minute episode on Adult Swim. The show is the first original Brad Neely work to be shown on television. On May 23, 2011, Adult Swim announced that China, IL would be one of the new full-length premieres for the fall line-up with Neely having creative and executive producer credits. The first episode was broadcast on October 2, 2011, on Adult Swim. The last, \\"Magical Pet\\", aired June 14, 2015. His second series for the network, Brad Neely's Harg Nallin' Sclopio Peepio, was announced in May 2015. In January 2020 it was reported that CBS All Access had ordered an animated comedy series titled ‘The Harper House’ developed by Neely and Katie Krentz. Personal life Neely resides in Los Angeles.

It is available for Windows, Mac OS X, Unix-like operating systems and Android. This project is developed and maintained by the Colombian startup MaeFloresta. This project is covered under the terms of the GNU General Public License v2. History Background and first versions: TupiTube is the product of the persistence and determination of two young Colombian entrepreneurs from the city of Santiago de Cali, who in 2002, led the Ktoon initiative together with the companies Toonka Films and Soluciones Kazak. This aims to be a tool to encourage young people throughout Latin America, interest in the development of the animation industry. The incentive to build a culture of animation and start developing a Latin American industry that would tend to constitute a community of digital artists, leads to the decision of design and distribution that would mark the basis of Tupi Tube, a free software compatible with the majority of operating systems. Ktoon sets the foundations to seek the first investments in the project, where entities such as Colciencias, the Sena and others push the initiative during its first years of development, this financing model sustained the project in its early development stage. By 2010, the Ktoon developer team meets and retakes the project, now with the name of Tupi 2D Magic and later configuring MaeFloresta as the developer who will maintain the vision of its predecessors, without abandoning the intention to remain as a software Free, accessible and comfortable for all the public interested in getting started. Tupi 2D Magic, focuses its efforts on presenting itself as an experience where its users can animate, illustrate and design in different spaces, even becoming a tool in classrooms, reaching 400,000 students in India, where 3,000 schools they used it as their software of preference. News and trajectory: MaeFloresta is in need of continuing its brand projection and Tupi 2d Magic was deserved a restructuring, to be able to afford to grow to reach new audiences and stay in the market, this is why they transform TupiTube, with the intention of becoming institutionalized as the free 2D animation software preferred by children, young people and digital artists in training. It is in this way to pursue the goal of being a tool for artistic education in digital environments, addressing the academic possibilities that animation training can offer, actively participating in events where ICTs and educational projects converge for the creation of a culture where Technology education is also a priority. With TupiTube, the efforts of the development team begin to materialize. They receive different awards for their efforts, for hosting TupiTube and for being an example of entrepreneurship in the digital commerce boom. Features The software includes many features: * Support for basic tools for vector illustration that includes rectangles, ellipses, lines, and polygons. Paths can also be created using the pen or pencil tool. The paint bucket tool can be used to fill bounded areas of vector objects. * Raster images (sometimes called Bitmap) can be imported and used as either static backgrounds or animated assets. * Finished animations can be exported to various file formats that include: (Ogg Theora, AVI, MPEG, SWF. Or as a sequence of images in PNG, JPEG, and SVG format. * Basic support for tweening of positions, colors, rotation, scale, sheer, and opacity has been added to recent releases. * The Library panel allows for the organization and reuse of imported media assets. Future development The goal of being a tool for introducing novice digital artists to the world of animation was fulfilled with the first releases. Development is focused on reaching a professional level that will allow advanced users to make professional-quality animations. Some of the areas of future development include: particles, sound support, key frames, and morphing. Plans have also been made to have skeleton animation with bones, inverse kinematics, and pivots.

Larionov was also the lifelong partner of fellow Russian avant-garde artist Natalia Goncharova. He was a founding member of the Jack of Diamonds (1909-1911), Moscow's first radical independent exhibiting group, the more radical Donkey's Tail (1912–1913), and with Goncharova he invented Rayonism (1912-1914). He was also a member of the German-based art movement known as Der Blaue Reiter. Born in Russia, he and Goncharova moved to Paris and lived there until his death. Life and work Larionov was born at Tiraspol, in the Kherson Governorate of the Russian Empire. In 1898 he entered the Moscow School of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture under Isaac Levitan and Valentin Serov. He was suspended three times for his radical outlook. In 1900 he met fellow avant- garde artist Natalia Goncharova and formed a lifelong relationship with her. From 1902 his style was Impressionism. After a visit to Paris in 1906 he moved into Post-Impressionism and then a Neo-primitive style which derived partly from Russian sign painting. In 1908 he staged the Golden Fleece exhibition in Moscow, which included paintings by international avant-garde artists such as Matisse, Derain, Braque, Gauguin and Van Gogh. Other group shows promoted by him included Tatlin, Chagall and Malevich. Larionov was a founding member of two important Russian artistic groups Jack of Diamonds (1909-1911) and the more radical Donkey's Tail (1912–1913). He gave names to both groups. His first solo show was for one day in Moscow in 1911. Larionov was influenced by the Georgian artist Niko Pirosmani. He then became influenced by the Cubo- Futurist art movement, and in 1913, with Natalia Goncharova, he invented Rayonism, which was the first creation of near-abstract art in Russia. He had a one-man show at the Omega Workshops.Shone, Richard. (1999) The Art of Bloomsbury Roger Fry, Vanessa Bell and Duncan Grant. Princeton: Princeton University Press, pp. 137-138. In 1915 he left Russia and worked with the ballet owner Sergei Diaghilev in Paris on the productions of the Ballets Russes. He spent the rest of his life in France and obtained French citizenship. He died, aged 82, in the Paris suburb of Fontenay-aux-Roses. In 2001, the Central Bank of Transnistria minted a silver coin honoring this native of today's Transnistria, as part of a series of memorable coins called The Outstanding People of Pridnestrovie.

They group comprised Phillip \\"Hirvy\\" Hirvela on bass guitar, Michael Mullins on lead guitar, Hans \\"Hunz\\" Van Vliet on lead vocals and Phil Usher on drums. In 1999 the group relocated to Nashville, Tennessee. Steven Lewis-Driver assumed the bass position when Hirvy left the band in early 2002. Jesse Palmer also filled in on guitar after Mullins returned to Australia a couple months before the band's demise. They released two albums on United States label, Inpop Records, Free Signal (2000) and Welladjusted (2001).  History  Beanbag formed in Brisbane in 1995 as a \\"hardcore Christian rock group\\" by Phil \\"Hirvy\\" Hirvela on bass guitar, Michael Mullins on lead guitar and Hans \\"Hunz\\" Van Vliet on lead vocals. A year later Phil Usher joined on drums. Guttersnipe, a seven-track extended play, was released on independent Australian label Toupee Records in June 1998. It was recorded at Groundswell studio with co-production by the group and Mark McElligott, it was engineered at Sunshine Studios by McElligott. In mid-1999 they were the first act signed to United States label, Inpop Records, which was established in Nashville by Peter Furler (of Newsboys), his manager Wes Campbell and Brisbane-based businessman, Dale Bray. Their debut album, Free Signal (2000) included five tracks from Guttersnipe and new material recorded at Sunshine Studios with McElligott co-producing. Hirvy described how \\"Some of the newer songs are a bit more melodic but still intense. We've also got a bit of electronica, some Indian tablas (drums) and upright bass. We've always written music with groove in mind, so the new stuff is still old Beanbag, but with some new sounds and more melodic intensity.\\" John Dibase of Jesus Freak Hideout rated Free Signal at three-and-a-half stars, and explained that it is \\"a solid album with intricate, and down-right intriguing songs that may seem unorganized and spontaneous at first, but further listens reveal the method behind the madness.\\" During their time in the United States, Beanbag toured extensively (including touring with Newsboys and Sonicflood during the LoveLibertyDisco AirDome Tour), were nominated for two GMA Dove Awards, and had songs featured on several television soundtracks. Their second album for Inpop, Welladjusted (2001), was also produced by McElligott. The band broke up after a van accident occurred while driving back to Nashville. The driver swerved to avoid a deer on the interstate, and the van and trailer filled with their gear ended up in a ditch. Van Vliet was hospitalised for three days with lung damage. With no vehicle, no gear, and no vocalist, they had decided to disband.

It is located in the City of Burnside, five kilometres southeast of the Adelaide city centre. The name Glenunga is a composite of Aboriginal and Scottish words, \\"unga\\" meaning near and \\"glen\\" from the nearby Glen Osmond\\"Manning's places of South Australia\\" by Geoffrey H. Manning, published in 1990\\". Bounded on the north by Windsor Road, the east by Portrush Road, the south-west by Glen Osmond Road and the west by Conyngham Street, the leafy suburb forms a rough triangular layout. History Glenunga, along with its neighbouring suburb of Glenside, were once known as 'Knoxville'. The first European settlers of the area (in the 1840s) took up farming, and wheat grown in the area was awarded first prize in the Royal Adelaide Show. The area now occupied by Glenunga International High School and Webb Oval were previously home to slaughterhouses established in the 19th century. At one point, the slaughterhouses were exporting overseas and at the same time providing half of Adelaide's lamb requirements. A number of coach companies, notably those of William Rounsevell, Cobb & Co and John Hill, were set up in the 1870s and 1880s. Up to 1,000 horses grazed the land. At this time most of the streets were beginning to be named, and most were named by the inhabitants after their original homes in England, Ireland, Scotland, Wales and the United States. However, one street was named after an Aboriginal word - \\"Allinga\\", meaning sun. In the early 20th century, a number of businesses were located in Glenunga. The South Australian icon, the Hills Hoist, was invented by the Hill family in Glenunga. Other notable businesses were the Symons & Symons glass merchants on Windsor Road, and one involved in \\"Bland Radios\\". A church was established in 1926, and a larger church was built in 1956 and dedicated to St Stephen. The suburb's transition from a largely rural area to a residential suburb began after World War II, with migration to the area from the United Kingdom and other countries. St. Stephen's Church was demolished in 1999, with the church community moving to the growing St. Saviour's Church in Glen Osmond. A plaque was left as a reminder of where it had once stood. Geography The suburb is very leafy with many trees which make up for the lack of parks and reserves. There are more parks in nearby Glen Osmond, such as the popular Ridge Park. Glenunga Uniting Church is located on the corner of L'Estrange Street and Bevington Road. Transport Public transport services to the suburb are by buses which service Glen Osmond Road every 15 minutes until 6pm, and there are other bus routes into the city, and the cross-city circle line along Portrush Road. The buses are provided by the Adelaide Metro. However, the majority of commuters still use motor cars and Glenunga is well placed for this, bordering Portrush Road and Glen Osmond Road. Glenunga residents can reach the Adelaide CBD by various routes, and the Adelaide Hills by way of Glen Osmond Road and the South Eastern Freeway. Residents The suburb is home to a number of families and retirees of predominantly Anglo- Celtic background. Attractions Due to the small size of the suburb, there is only one main park, Glenunga Reserve, which also contains Webb Oval. More than anything else in the suburb, the Glenunga International High School brings it prominence both in Australia and overseas. The school campus is an easily identifiable part of Glenunga, being situated roughly in the middle of the suburb. The school's expansion and development have aided in the once- quiet L'Estrange Street being clogged with both traffic and students at peak hour and other times. A number of businesses and shops are located along Glen Osmond Road and Conyngham Street. These include a McDonald's, Chinese and Mexican restaurants, and a number of small businesses and motels. Conyngham Street contains the headquarters of DECS and empty commercial blocks are waiting to undergo development. Politics Glenunga is in the South Australian House of Assembly Electoral District of Unley and the Federal Division of Sturt, and is a solid Liberal-voting area.

It was originally proven by the Hungarian mathematician Gyula Farkas. Farkas' lemma is the key result underpinning the linear programming duality and has played a central role in the development of mathematical optimization (alternatively, mathematical programming). It is used amongst other things in the proof of the Karush–Kuhn–Tucker theorem in nonlinear programming. Generalizations of the Farkas' lemma are about the solvability theorem for convex inequalities, i.e., infinite system of linear inequalities. Farkas' lemma belongs to a class of statements called \\"theorems of the alternative\\": a theorem stating that exactly one of two systems has a solution.  Statement of the lemma  There are a number of slightly different (but equivalent) formulations of the lemma in the literature. The one given here is due to Gale, Kuhn and Tucker (1951).. See Lemma 1 on page 318. \\\\mathbf{y} \\\\geq 0 and \\\\mathbf{b}^{\\\\mathsf{T}} \\\\mathbf{y} < 0. }} Here, the notation \\\\mathbf{x} \\\\geq 0 means that all components of the vector \\\\mathbf{x} are nonnegative.  Example  Let m, n = 2, \\\\mathbf{A} = \\\\begin{bmatrix}6 & 4 3 & 0\\\\end{bmatrix}, and \\\\mathbf{b} = \\\\begin{bmatrix}b_1 b_2\\\\end{bmatrix}. The lemma says that exactly one of the following two statements must be true (depending on b1 and b2): # There exist x1 ≥ 0, x2 ≥ 0 such that 6 x1 \\\\+ 4 x2 = b1 and 3 x1 = b2, or # There exist y1, y2 such that 6 y1 \\\\+ 3 y2 ≥ 0, 4 y1 ≥ 0, and b1 y1 \\\\+ b2 y2 < 0\\\\. Here is a proof of the lemma in this special case: * If b2 ≥ 0 and b1 − 2b2 ≥ 0, then option 1 is true, since the solution of the linear equations is x1 = b2/3 and x2 = b1-2b2. Option 2 is false, since b1 y1 \\\\+ b2 y2 ≥ b2 (2 y1 \\\\+ y2) = b2 (6 y1 \\\\+ 3 y2) / 3, so if the right-hand side is positive, the left-hand side must be positive too. * Otherwise, option 1 is false, since the unique solution of the linear equations is not weakly positive. But in this case, option 2 is true: ** If b2 < 0, then we can take e.g. y1 = 0 and y2 = 1. ** If b1 − 2b2 < 0, then, for some number B > 0, b1 = 2b2 − B, so: b1 y1 \\\\+ b2 y2 = 2 b2 y1 \\\\+ b2 y2 − B y1 = b2 (6 y1 \\\\+ 3 y2) / 3 − B y1. Thus we can take, for example, y1 = 1, y2 = −2.  Geometric interpretation  Consider the closed convex cone C(\\\\mathbf{A}) spanned by the columns of \\\\mathbf{A}; that is, : C(\\\\mathbf{A}) = \\\\\\\\{\\\\mathbf{A}\\\\mathbf{x} \\\\mid \\\\mathbf{x} \\\\geq 0 \\\\\\\\}. Observe that C(\\\\mathbf{A}) is the set of the vectors \\\\mathbf{b} for which the first assertion in the statement of Farkas' lemma holds. On the other hand, the vector \\\\mathbf{y} in the second assertion is orthogonal to a hyperplane that separates \\\\mathbf{b} and C(\\\\mathbf{A}). The lemma follows from the observation that \\\\mathbf{b} belongs to C(\\\\mathbf{A}) if and only if there is no hyperplane that separates it from C(\\\\mathbf{A}). More precisely, let \\\\mathbf{a}_1, \\\\dots, \\\\mathbf{a}_n \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{m} denote the columns of \\\\mathbf{A}. In terms of these vectors, Farkas' lemma states that exactly one of the following two statements is true: # There exist non-negative coefficients x_1, \\\\dots, x_n \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R} such that \\\\mathbf{b} =x _1 \\\\mathbf{a}_1 + \\\\dots + x_n \\\\mathbf{a}_n. # There exists a vector \\\\mathbf{y} \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^m such that \\\\mathbf{a}_i^{\\\\mathsf{T}} \\\\mathbf{y} \\\\geq 0 for i = 1, \\\\dots, n, and \\\\mathbf{b}^{\\\\mathsf{T}} \\\\mathbf{y} < 0. The sums x_1 \\\\mathbf{a}_1 + \\\\dots + x_n \\\\mathbf{a}_n with nonnegative coefficients x_1, \\\\dots, x_n form the cone spanned by the columns of \\\\mathbf{A}. Therefore, the first statement tells that \\\\mathbf{b} belongs to C(\\\\mathbf{A}). The second statement tells that there exists a vector \\\\mathbf{y} such that the angle of \\\\mathbf{y} with the vectors \\\\mathbf{a}_i is at most 90°, while the angle of \\\\mathbf{y} with the vector \\\\mathbf{b} is more than 90°. The hyperplane normal to this vector has the vectors \\\\mathbf{a}_i on one side and the vector \\\\mathbf{b} on the other side. Hence, this hyperplane separates the cone spanned by \\\\mathbf{a}_1, \\\\dots, \\\\mathbf{a}_n from the vector \\\\mathbf{b}. For example, let n, m = 2, a1 = (1, 0)T, and a2 = (1, 1)T. The convex cone spanned by a1 and a2 can be seen as a wedge-shaped slice of the first quadrant in the xy plane. Now, suppose b = (0, 1). Certainly, b is not in the convex cone a1x1 \\\\+ a2x2. Hence, there must be a separating hyperplane. Let y = (1, −1)T. We can see that a1 · y = 1, a2 · y = 0, and b · y = −1. Hence, the hyperplane with normal y indeed separates the convex cone a1x1 \\\\+ a2x2 from b.  Logic interpretation  A particularly suggestive and easy-to-remember version is the following: if a set of inequalities has no solution, then a contradiction can be produced from it by linear combination with nonnegative coefficients. In formulas: if Ax ≤ b is unsolvable then y^{\\\\mathsf{T}} A = 0, y^{\\\\mathsf{T}} b = -1, y ≥ 0 has a solution.. Note that y^{\\\\mathsf{T}} A is a combination of the left-hand sides, y^{\\\\mathsf{T}} b a combination of the right-hand side of the inequalities. Since the positive combination produces a zero vector on the left and a −1 on the right, the contradiction is apparent. Thus, Farkas' lemma can be viewed as a theorem of logical completeness: Ax ≤ b is a set of \\"axioms\\", the linear combinations are the \\"derivation rules\\", and the lemma says that, if the set of axioms is inconsistent, then it can be refuted using the derivation rules. Pages 81–104.  Variants  The Farkas Lemma has several variants with different sign-constraints (the first one is the original version): * Either the system \\\\mathbf{Ax} = \\\\mathbf{b} has a solution with \\\\mathbf{x} \\\\geq 0 , or the system \\\\mathbf{A}^{\\\\mathsf{T}}\\\\mathbf{y} \\\\geq 0 has a solution with \\\\mathbf{b}^{\\\\mathsf{T}} \\\\mathbf{y} < 0. * Either the system \\\\mathbf{Ax} \\\\leq \\\\mathbf{b} has a solution with \\\\mathbf{x} \\\\geq 0 , or the system \\\\mathbf{A}^{\\\\mathsf{T}}\\\\mathbf{y} \\\\geq 0 has a solution with \\\\mathbf{b}^{\\\\mathsf{T}} \\\\mathbf{y} < 0 and \\\\mathbf{y} \\\\geq 0. * Either the system \\\\mathbf{Ax} \\\\leq \\\\mathbf{b} has a solution with \\\\mathbf{x} \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^n , or the system \\\\mathbf{A}^{\\\\mathsf{T}}\\\\mathbf{y} = 0 has a solution with \\\\mathbf{b}^{\\\\mathsf{T}} \\\\mathbf{y} < 0 and \\\\mathbf{y} \\\\geq 0. * Either the system \\\\mathbf{Ax} = \\\\mathbf{b} has a solution with \\\\mathbf{x} \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^n , or the system \\\\mathbf{A}^{\\\\mathsf{T}}\\\\mathbf{y} = 0 has a solution with \\\\mathbf{b}^{\\\\mathsf{T}} \\\\mathbf{y} eq 0. The latter variant is mentioned for completeness; it is not actually a \\"Farkas lemma\\" since it contains only equalities. Its proof is a simple exercise in linear algebra.  Generalizations  \\\\mathbf{x} \\\\geq 0, \\\\forall \\\\mathbf{x} \\\\in \\\\mathbf{S} \\\\\\\\}. If convex cone C(\\\\mathbf{A}) = \\\\\\\\{\\\\mathbf{A}\\\\mathbf{x} \\\\mid \\\\mathbf{x} \\\\in \\\\mathbf{S} \\\\\\\\} is closed, then exactly one of the following two statements is true: # There exists an \\\\mathbf{x} \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^n such that \\\\mathbf{Ax} = \\\\mathbf{b} and \\\\mathbf{x} \\\\in \\\\mathbf{S}. # There exists a \\\\mathbf{y} \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{m} such that \\\\mathbf{A}^{\\\\mathsf{T}} \\\\mathbf{y} \\\\in \\\\mathbf{S}^* and \\\\mathbf{b}^{\\\\mathsf{T}} \\\\mathbf{y} < 0. }} Generalized Farkas' lemma can be interpreted geometrically as follows: either a vector is in a given closed convex cone, or there exists a hyperplane separating the vector from the cone; there are no other possibilities. The closedness condition is necessary, see Separation theorem I in Hyperplane separation theorem. For original Farkas' lemma, \\\\mathbf{S} is the nonnegative orthant \\\\mathbb{R}_+^n, hence the closedness condition holds automatically. Indeed, for polyhedral convex cone, i.e., there exists a \\\\mathbf{B} \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{n \\\\times k} such that \\\\mathbf{S} = \\\\\\\\{\\\\mathbf{B}\\\\mathbf{x} \\\\mid \\\\mathbf{x} \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}_+^k \\\\\\\\} , the closedness condition holds automatically. In convex optimization, various kinds of constraint qualification, e.g. Slater's condition, are responsible for closedness of the underlying convex cone C(\\\\mathbf{A}). By setting \\\\mathbf{S} = \\\\mathbb{R}^n and \\\\mathbf{S}^* = \\\\\\\\{0\\\\\\\\} in generalized Farkas' lemma, we obtain the following corollary about the solvability for a finite system of linear equalities: \\\\mathbf{y} = 0 and \\\\mathbf{b}^{\\\\mathsf{T}}\\\\mathbf{y} eq 0. }}  Further implications  Farkas's lemma can be varied to many further theorems of alternative by simple modifications, such as Gordan's theorem: Either Ax < 0 has a solution x, or A^{\\\\mathsf{T}} y = 0 has a nonzero solution y with y ≥ 0. Common applications of Farkas' lemma include proving the strong duality theorem associated with linear programming, game theory at a basic level, and the Kuhn–Tucker constraints. An extension of Farkas' lemma can be used to analyze the strong duality conditions for and construct the dual of a semidefinite program. It is sufficient to prove the existence of the Kuhn–Tucker constraints using the Fredholm alternative but for the condition to be necessary, one must apply Von Neumann's minimax theorem to show the equations derived by Cauchy are not violated.

He designed productions for Sergei Diaghilev, Constantin Stanislavski, and Vsevolod Meyerhold. Born at Moscow, Golovin initially studied architecture, later switching to painting. He also attended the Académie Colarossi. Due to financial difficulties, upon graduation he worked as an interior painter and decorator. He also tried his hand at various artistic fields such as furniture design. In 1900 he took part in designing the Russian Empire pavilion at the Paris World's Fair together with his friend K.A. Korovin. He studied at the Académie Vitti in Paris. In 1901 he moved to the Saint Petersburg region from Moscow. It was here that he came into his own as a stage designer, combining symbolism and modernism on operatic and dramatic productions for Diaghilev, Meyerhold and others. After the Revolution of 1917, Golovin found work in theatre less and less often, and so delved into painting and graphic illustration. Golovin provided the set design for the 1910 original production of Stravinsky's The Firebird ballet. Golovin provided the scenic design for an important production of Pierre Beaumarchais's The Marriage of Figaro at the Moscow Art Theatre.Benedetti (1999, 308). The seminal Russian theatre practitioner Constantin Stanislavski directed the play in fast and free-flowing production that opened on 28 April 1927, having been rehearsed since the end of 1925.Benedetti (1999, 306-8). Stanislavski re- located the play's action to pre-Revolutionary France and trimmed its five-act structure to eleven scenes; Golovin employed a revolve to quicken scene- changes. It was a great success, garnering ten curtain calls on opening night.Benedetti (1999, 309). Golovin was appointed a People's Artist of the RSFSR. He died in Detskoye Selo on 17 April 1930.

Cunnilingus is oral sex performed on the vulva or vagina, while fellatio is oral sex performed on the penis. Anilingus, another form of oral sex, is oral stimulation of the anus. Oral stimulation of other parts of the body, such as by kissing or licking, is not considered oral sex. Oral sex may be performed as foreplay to incite sexual arousal before other sexual activities (such as vaginal or anal intercourse), or as an erotic and physically intimate act in its own right. Like most forms of sexual activity, oral sex can pose a risk for contracting sexually transmitted infections (STIs/STDs). However, the transmission risk for oral sex, especially HIV transmission, is significantly lower than for vaginal or anal sex. Oral sex is often regarded as taboo, but most countries do not have laws which ban the practice. Commonly, people do not regard oral sex as affecting the virginity of either partner, though opinions on the matter vary.See here and pages 47-49 for views on what constitutes virginity loss and therefore sexual intercourse or other sexual activity; source discusses how gay and lesbian individuals define virginity loss, and how the majority of researchers and heterosexuals define virginity loss/\\"technical virginity\\" by whether or not a person has engaged in penile-vaginal sex. People may also have negative feelings or sexual inhibitions about giving or receiving oral sex, or may flatly refuse to engage in the practice. Practice Female performing fellatio Oral sex may be practiced by people of any sexual orientation. =Sexual variants= Facesitting is a form of oral sex in which the receiver sits on the giver's face and pushes into it with his or her genitals. Oral sex can also be performed by both partners at the same time in the so-called \\"sixty-nine\\" position. Spitting and/or swallowing of the ejaculatory fluids or giving a pearl necklace may cause different sexual stimulations. Autofellatio is a possible but rare variant; autocunnilingus may also be possible for women with extremely flexible spines. An act of group sex restricted to one woman giving oral sex to several men is referred to as a gangsuck, blowbang or lineup, all derivatives of the slang term gang bang for group sex. Bukkake and gokkun may also involve oral sex. =Preserving virginity= Umamaheshwor Temple at Kritipur. Oral sex is commonly used as a means of preserving virginity, especially among heterosexual pairings; this is sometimes termed technical virginity (which additionally includes anal sex, mutual masturbation and other non-penetrative sex acts, but excludes penile-vaginal sex). The concept of \\"technical virginity\\" or sexual abstinence through oral sex is popular among teenagers. Gay males who regard oral sex as a way of maintaining their virginities view penile-anal penetration as resulting in virginity loss, while other gay males may define oral sex as their main form of sexual activity. By contrast, lesbian pairings commonly view oral sex or fingering as resulting in virginity loss, though definitions of virginity loss vary among lesbians as well. =Contraception and safe sex= Oral sex alone cannot result in pregnancy and heterosexual couples may perform oral sex as their method of contraception. For conception to take place, sperm from the penis must enter the uterus and fallopian tubes and fertilize the female's egg. In humans, there is no connection between the gastrointestinal system and the reproductive system,However, this has happened in bizarre circumstances involving a stabbing. and sperm ingested by the woman would be killed and broken down by acids in her stomach and proteins in the small intestine. The breakdown products are then absorbed as a negligible quantity of nutrients. However, there is a potential risk of pregnancy if semen comes in contact with the vaginal area in some way, such as semen in the ejaculate finding its way onto fingers, hands, or other body parts, which then comes in contact with the vaginal area. Oral sex is not necessarily an effective method of preventing sexually transmitted infections (STIs), although some forms of STIs are believed to be less commonly spread in this way, and oral sex has been recommended as a form of safe sex.Geffen Testing Center's HIV, Syphilis, and Hepatitis C Information Sheet. Accessed November 4, 2006. University Health Center, University of Georgia, Oral Sex. Accessed November 4, 2006. In the United States, no barrier methods for use during oral sex have been evaluated as effective by the Food and Drug Administration. However, a barrier protection like a condom for fellatio or dental dam for cunnilingus can offer some protection from contact when practicing oral sex. Oral sex should be limited to the protected areas. A makeshift dental dam can be made out of a condom\\"How to Make a Dental Dam Using a Condom\\", UCSB SexInfoOnline, February 7, 2008. or a latex or nitrile glove, but using a real dental dam is seen as preferable; this is because real dental dams cover a larger area, avoid accidents caused by \\"slipping\\" outside the covered area, and avoid the risk that makeshift versions may be accidentally damaged or poked with the scissors during the cutting procedure. Plastic wrap may also be used as a barrier during oral sex, but there exists no conclusive scientific research regarding how effective it may or may not be at preventing disease transmission. Certain kinds of plastic wrap are manufactured to be microwaveable and are designed to have pores that open when heated, but there also exists no scientific research on what effect, if any, this has on disease transmission when used during oral sex. Some people complain that the thickness of the plastic dulls sensation. =Prevalence= A report issued in September 2005 by the National Center for Health Statistics was the basis of an article in the September 26, 2005 issue of Time magazine. The report comes from the results of a computer-administered survey of over 12,000 Americans between the ages of 15 and 44, and states that over half the teenagers questioned have had oral sex. While some headlines have interpreted this as evidence that oral sex among teenagers is \\"on the rise\\", this was the first comprehensive study of its kind to examine the matter.Lemonick, Michael D., \\"A Teen Twist on Sex\\", Time, New York, September 19, 2005. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) stated in 2009: \\"Studies indicate that oral sex is commonly practiced by sexually active male- female and same-gender couples of various ages, including adolescents.\\" Research also indicates that \\"males are more likely than females to have received oral sex, whereas equal proportions of men and women have given oral sex.\\" Health risks and other studiesSexually transmitted infections= Chlamydia, human papillomavirus (HPV), syphilis, gonorrhea, herpes, hepatitis (multiple strains), and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs), can be transmitted through oral sex. Also see Fact Sheet Any sexual exchange of bodily fluids with a person infected with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, poses a risk of infection. Risk of STI infection, however, is generally considered significantly lower for oral sex than for vaginal or anal sex, with HIV transmission considered the lowest risk with regard to oral sex. There is an increased risk of STI transmission if the receiving partner has wounds on his or her genitals, or if the giving partner has wounds or open sores on or in his or her mouth, or bleeding gums. Brushing the teeth, flossing, undergoing dental work soon before or after performing oral sex can also increase the risk of transmission, because all of these activities can cause small scratches in the lining of the mouth. These wounds, even when they are microscopic, increase the chances of contracting STIs that can be transmitted orally under these conditions. Such contact can also lead to more mundane infections from common bacteria and viruses found in, around and secreted from the genital regions. Because of the aforementioned factors, medical sources advise the use of condoms or other effective barrier methods when performing or receiving oral sex with a partner whose STI status is unknown. =HPV and oral cancer link= Links have been reported between oral sex and oral cancer with human papillomavirus (HPV)-infected people. In 2005, a research study at Malmö University's Faculty of Odontology suggested that performing unprotected oral sex on a person infected with HPV might increase the risk of oral cancer. The study found that 36 percent of the cancer patients had HPV compared to only 1 percent of the healthy control group. Another study in The New England Journal of Medicine suggests a correlation between oral sex and throat cancer. It is believed that this is due to the transmission of HPV, a virus that has been implicated in the majority of cervical cancers and which has been detected in throat cancer tissue in numerous studies. The study concludes that people who had one to five oral sex partners in their lifetime had approximately a doubled risk of throat cancer compared with those who never engaged in this activity and those with more than five oral sex partners had a 250 percent increased risk. =Miscarriage reduction= Fellatio may reduce the risk of miscarriages by inducing immunological tolerance in the woman by exposure to the proteins in her partner's semen, a process known as paternal tolerance. While any exposure to a partner's semen appears to decrease a woman's chances for the various immunological disorders that can occur during pregnancy, immunological tolerance could be most quickly established through the oral introduction and gastrointestinal absorption of semen. Recognizing that some of the studies potentially included the presence of confounding factors, such as the possibility that women who regularly perform fellatio and swallow semen also engage in more frequent intercourse, the researchers also noted that, either way, \\"the data still overwhelmingly supports the main theory\\" behind all their studies—that repeated exposure to semen establishes the maternal immunological tolerance necessary for a safe and successful pregnancy. Cultural views Fellatio in 69 position Cultural views on oral sex range from aversion to high regard. It, especially fellatio,\\"The History of Fellatio\\" , Salon.com, May 22, 2000. has been considered taboo, or at least discouraged, in many cultures and parts of the world. Laws of some jurisdictions regard oral sex as penetrative sex for the purposes of sexual offenses with regard to the act, but most countries do not have laws which ban the practice itself, in contrast to anal sex or extramarital sex. In Ancient Rome, fellatio was considered profoundly taboo. Sexual acts were generally seen through the prism of submission and control. This is apparent in the two Latin words for the act: irrumare (to penetrate orally), and fellare (to be penetrated orally). Under this system, it was considered to be abhorrent for a male to perform fellatio, since that would mean that he was penetrated (controlled), whereas receiving fellatio from a woman or another man of lower social status (such as a slave or debtor) was not humiliating. The Romans regarded oral sex as being far more shameful than, for example, anal sex – known practitioners were supposed to have foul breath and were often unwelcome as guests at a dinner table. In contrast to historical views on fellatio, cunnilingus is revered as a spiritually fulfilling practice in Chinese Taoism, which regards it as having the ability to enhance longevity.Octavio Paz (1969) Conjunctions and Disjunctions; trans. Helen R. Lane. London: Wildwood House; p. 97 In modern Western culture, oral sex is widely practiced among adolescents and adults. People give various reasons for their dislike of oral sex. Some state that since it does not result in reproduction, it is therefore unnatural. Others find it less intimate because it is not a face-to-face practice, or believe that it is a humiliating or unclean practice; that it is humiliating or unclean are opinions that are, at least in some cases, connected with the symbolism attached to different parts of the body. Opposite these views, people also believe that oral sex \\"is one of the most intimate behaviors that a couple can engage in because it requires total trust and vulnerability.\\" While commonly believed that lesbian sexual practices involve cunnilingus for all women who have sex with women (WSW), some have an aversion to cunnilingus due to not liking the experience or psychological or social factors, such as finding it unclean. Other WSW believe that it is a necessity or largely defines lesbian sexual activity. Lesbian couples are more likely to consider a woman's dislike of cunnilingus as a problem than heterosexual couples are, and it is common for them to seek therapy to overcome inhibitions regarding it. A 19th-century depiction of cunnilingus. Terminology and slang There are many words which refer to oral sex, including euphemisms and sexual slang. Like all aspects of sexuality, there exists a large number of variations on a theme, a few common ones being: * Giving head – A common American slang term for giving oral sex to either a man or woman is giving head, from the term head job (in contrast to hand job, manual stimulation). A play on the slang term head resulted in the slang term brains, or brain salad surgery, domes or getting domes. * Plate – A once common British rhyming slang for fellate that arose in the gay slang language of Polari that spread in the 1960s. The term is less common today.Polari * Cunnilingus is also sometimes referred to as muff diving, eating out or poon-job, a slang term and a cunnilingus variant of blow job, where poon is short for poontang or punani. * Additionally, in lesbian culture, several common slang terms used are carpet munching, giving lip, lip service or tipping the velvet (a faux-Victorian expression invented by novelist Sarah Waters). Other slang terms for oral sex include going down on (male or female), licking out and muff diving (female), blow job (male), dome (male or female), sucking off (male), playing the skin flute (male recipient), rolling cigars (male recipient), lolly-gagging (gay male-on-male), gaining knowledge (male recipient) and bust down (male). Forced fellatio is often called Egyptian rape or simply Egyptian; this goes back to the time of the Crusades when Mamluks were alleged to force their Christian captives to do this.Edwardes, Allen; Masters, Robert E. L. The cradle of erotica, New York: Julian Press, 1963. Other animals Female bats perform fellatio to increase copulation time. Oral sex has been observed in the animal kingdom among many species. It has been suggested that there is an evolutionary advantage due to the tendency of primates, non-primates and humans to have oral sex. Fellatio occurs with the fruit bat, Cynopterus sphinx; it has been observed when the bats are mating. These bat pairs spend more time copulating if the female licks the male than if she does not.

It is the largest of the Royal Shows held in cities and towns around the state by the Royal Agricultural Society of Tasmania. The event focuses on the rural exploits of Tasmanians with events such as livestock judging and wood chopping. Also popular at the event are show bags and rides. The show runs for four days, Wednesday through to Saturday, ending on the fourth Saturday in October. The Thursday is a public holiday in the south of the Tasmania, known as Hobart Show Day. The Friday night traditionally has fireworks. The Saturday is known as family day and usually involves many discounts and savings on showbags and rides from the other days. In many ways it can be considered similar (although smaller) to the Sydney Royal Easter Show. History The first edition of the show was in 1822, and it was held near Salamanca Place. At the 1968 show, stuntman Adrian Labans fell to his death from a high wire act. Officials blamed the COVID-19 pandemic as grounds for 2020's cancellation & deferral to 2021.

It likens the governance of a city-state to the command of a naval vessel and ultimately argues that the only people fit to be captain of this ship () are philosopher kings, benevolent men with absolute power who have access to the Form of the Good. The origins of the metaphor can be traced back to the lyric poet Alcaeus (frs. 6, 208, 249), and it is found in Sophocles' Antigone and Aeschylus' Seven Against Thebes before Plato. Plato's use of the metaphor Plato establishes the comparison by saying that Zeus was one of the best models of describing the steering of a ship as just like any other \\"craft\\" or profession—in particular, that of a statesman. He then runs the metaphor in reference to a particular type of government: democracy. Plato’s democracy is not the modern notion of a mix of democracy and republicanism, but rather direct democracy by way of pure majority rule. In the metaphor, found at 488a–-489d, Plato's Socrates compares the population at large to a strong but nearsighted shipowner whose knowledge of seafaring is lacking. The quarreling sailors are demagogues and politicians, and the ship's navigator, a stargazer, is the philosopher. The sailors flatter themselves with claims to knowledge of sailing, though they know nothing of navigation, and are constantly vying with one another for the approval of the shipowner so to captain the ship, going so far as to stupefy the shipowner with drugs and wine. Meanwhile, they dismiss the navigator as a useless stargazer, though he is the only one with adequate knowledge to direct the ship's course. The Ship of State since Plato It has been routinely referenced throughout Western culture ever since its inception; two notable literary examples are Horace's ode 1.14 and \\"O Ship of State\\" by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. Roger Williams, the founder of Rhode Island, used the metaphor in his \\"Letter to the Town of Providence\\" (1656). More recently, it has become a staple of American political discussion, where it is viewed simply as its image of the state as a ship, in need of a government as officers to command it – and conspicuously absent of its anti-democratic, pro- absolutist original meaning. The term has entered popular culture as well. Leonard Cohen's song \\"Democracy\\" contains the line \\"Sail on. Sail on, o mighty ship of state. To the shores of need, past the reefs of greed, through the squalls of hate.\\" Also, in his second novel Beautiful Losers (1966), Cohen writes \\"Sail on, sail on, O Ship of State, auto accidents, births, Berlin, cures for cancer!\\" (p. 12). In the British TV series Yes, Minister, Sir Humphrey Appleby pointed out that \\"the Ship of State is the only ship that leaks from the top\\".Season 3, episode 5 (\\"The Bed of Nails\\") at c. 25:33 min.

From 2000 to 2017, Clipsal was the naming rights sponsor for the Adelaide 500 Supercars race. Since 2004 Clipsal Australia has been a subsidiary of Schneider Electric.  History  The former Clipsal factory in Bowden in the foreground Clipsal was established by A. E. Gerard in Adelaide, Australia in 1920. Clipsal began by selling a range of adjustable sheet metal fittings which joined the various imported conduits of differing diameters found in Australia at the time. These products helped give the company its name, the phrase \\"clips all\\" being abridged to Clipsal. Alfred's son Geoff took over the company and spearheaded several manufacturing breakthroughs, including the invention of the first all- Australian switch in 1930. The company also performed early R&D; on thermoplastics in the 1950s.From the Company's website at http://www.clipsal.com.au/consumer/about_us/history Clipsal Integrated Systems, a division of Clipsal, was responsible for the creation of the C-Bus product range and accompanying protocol used in home automation. Clipsal entered into a collaboration agreement with \\"The Smart Company\\" in 1995, and later entered into a Heads of Agreement in 1996. These agreements led to the development of the Clipsal Home Minder, which was sold until 2004. In 2004, Clipsal Australia became majority-owned by Schneider Electric. Litigation From 2004 to 2011, Clipsal Integrated Systems, Clipsal Technologies Australia and Clipsal Australia were in litigation. with The Smart Company Pty Ltd regarding the Clipsal Home Minder and other Smart products. The litigation was for apparent unpaid royalties to The Smart Company pursuant to the Heads of Agreement. The Smart Company went into liquidation on 28 May 2010. Liquidators of The Smart Company went to the Supreme Court to gain control of the Clipsal case.. Prior to liquidation, director Dorothea Tomazos transferred the benefit of the case to herself for $1. In August 2010, liquidators gained control of the Clipsal case to continue the action against Clipsal (and effectively Schneider Electric) for up to 4 billion Australian dollars. Enterprise Global Resources, (controlled by Dorothea Tomazos) intervened as the shareholder of The Smart Company to take control of the Federal Court action, allegedly thereby delaying the case. In February 2011, Enterprise Global Resources was refused permission to maintain the proceedings.. The case was dismissed on 29 April 2011, due to The Smart Company failing to comply with the orders from November 2009 to prepare for the 12-week trial. Although the trial was scheduled to start on 31 May 2010, liquidators were unable to progress during late 2010 and early 2011 due to lacking access to documents possessed by The Smart Company relating to the action.. The liquidators filed a Notice of Appeal against the dismissal on 20 May 2011.. In June 2011, the Yamaha Pitman founders attempted to resurrect the case against Clipsal Australia, filing the $3 million Deed Of Company Arrangement. The liquidators were in talks with a litigation funder, a third party, about the purchase of the Clipsal case. The liquidators discontinued the Appeal on 8 July 2011 and were ordered to pay the costs.

Increasing irregularity of this respiratory rate generally is a sign that the patient will enter into coma. CNH is unrelated to other forms of hyperventilation, like Kussmaul's respirations. CNH is the human body's response to reduced carbon dioxide levels in the blood. This reduction in carbon dioxide is caused by contraction of cranial arteries from damage caused by lesions in the brain stem. However, the mechanism by which CNH arises as a result from these lesions is still very poorly understood. Current research has yet to provide an effective means of treatment for the rare number of patients who are diagnosed with this condition. Signs and symptoms Three principle subarachnoid cisternae consisting of the pons, medulla oblongata, and the cerebellum. A cross-section diagram of the area of the brain typically affected by tumors in the condition CNH. Symptoms of CNH have been observed to vary according to the progression of CNH. The initial symptoms of CNH include a low arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide, a high or normal arterial partial pressure of oxygen, high arterial pH, and tachypnea. The partial pressure of carbon dioxide has been noted by Yushi et al. to drop as low as 6.7 mmHg, while oxygen saturation remains at 99-100%. Respiratory alkalosis is induced in people affected with CNH, which stimulates the hyperpnea to attempt to compensate the rise of the blood’s pH. Some of the reported cases of CNH claim alkaline cerebral spinal fluid (CSF). However, not all of the cases experience this effect and other cases of CNH have a local increase in the pH surrounding the tumor that causes the condition. The hyperventilation of CNH patients persists during sleep. Those affected have been observed to not be able to voluntarily control their breathing in order to slow it down and the hyperventilation is predominantly controlled by the diaphragm. CNH has been found to affect people of all ages, ranging from children at the age of seven to adults at the age of eighty-seven. It has affected people while they have been both conscious and unconscious. After Plum and Swanson's initial discovery of CNH it was thought that CNH was rare in conscious patients. More cases of CNH have been observed in conscious patients since then. Additional symptoms of conscious CNH include loss of appetite, difficulty concentrating, poor memory, difficulties in eating or talking, cachexia, vomiting, disorientation, and a generalized confused state that varies from patient to patient. It is generally seen, however, that the mood changes, anxiety, and difficulty concentrating progress as the tumor increases in severity and, in effect, CNH persists. All of these symptoms are not present in each reported case of CNH, and symptoms seem to vary on a case to case basis. Other symptoms that have been associated with CNH are transient epileptic episodes with a temporary loss of consciousness. This condition is thought to result from severe hypocapnia that induces blood vessels in the brain to constrict, leading to brain ischemia. Other symptoms caused by CNH are electrolyte dysequilibrium and mood changes that primarily include anxiety due to the hyperventilation. Once CNH is diagnosed, the condition generally progresses until the patient becomes unconscious or lapses into a coma. Most patients are seen to enter this state two to three months after the onset of CNH. Lange et al. cited a patient that experienced pulmonary edema, bronchitis, and pneumonia prior to death, though all reported cases of CNH describe various progressions of the condition until it worsens to the point of death. =Associations with Body Systems= CNH is most commonly associated with the central nervous system, and the majority of CNH cases have been associated with infiltrative tumors in the pons. Some cases involve the medulla and other regions of the brain. Primarily, researchers believe that the tumors infiltrate the pontine respiratory centers and central chemoreceptors. CNH has not been found to be associated with any other of the body’s systems. Cardiac, pulmonary, and metabolic disorders have been ruled out as causes of the hyperventilation. Tests such as electrocardiograms, echocardiograms, torso computed tomographic scans, and chest radiographs have revealed that the pulmonary and cardiac systems of CNH are normal. Liver and kidney functions are also normal. Lymph node and thyroid enlargement also have not been detected. Association with the cardiovascular system is seen when the brain tumors reach the medullary cardiovascular centers, at which point the patient usually succumbs to death. Causes  Determining the exact cause of CNH has proven to be difficult, specifically because only 21 additional cases have been reported since Plum and Swanson’s initial report of the condition in 1959. These subsequent reports deal only with conscious patients presenting with CNH, though the varied pathophysiologies present in each individual patient makes it nearly impossible to implicate either a particular structural lesion or the destruction of a specific locus as the sole cause of CNH. Compilations of the reports, however, have led to generalized conclusions about the primary role of structural lesions in the initiation of both juvenile and adult cases of CNH. =Tumor-Induced CNH in Adults= The majority of adult patients experiencing CNH have clinical histories of infiltrative, expanding tumors of the cortex, primarily involving the brainstem. Over three-quarters of the cases reported since the discovery of CNH by Plum and Swanson had tumors clearly involving the pons, with specific consideration given to pathology of the pontine tegmentum. CNH was also reported in patients with tumors affecting the medulla oblongata. Though a diagnosis of CNH is rarely considered without evidence of brainstem infiltration, there have been other reported cases of CNH not directly involving the pons or medulla. CNH was also reported in cases involving a frontal lobe tumor, an invasive laryngeal carcinoma compressing the midbrain, an extension of tumors of the head and neck into the base of the brain, and thalamic hemorrhage. The manifestation of CNH in patients with these non- brainstem related disorders leads to greater debate about the pathophysiology of CNH and the role of other parts of the brain in the regulation of respiration. At this time, there have been no reported cases of CNH associated with stroke. In each case, the nature of the tumor varied, though the two main categories of tumor were classified as either cerebral lymphomas or solid tumors, such as pontine gliomas, anaplastic medulloblastoma, or astrocytomas. Particular attention is given to the high incidence of cerebral lymphomas associated with adult CNH. Intracerebral B-cell lymphoma represents less than 1% of all primary malignant tumors of the central nervous system. Infiltration of lymphoma cells into the pons and medulla is the most frequently reported cause of CNH, accounting for half of all CNH-inducing brain tumors, despite its considerable rarity. It has been suggested that these lymphomas are capable of diffusely penetrating the midbrain, without significantly destructing the overall structures. =Tumor-Induced CNH in Children= CNH in children is considerably less common, and only five of the twenty one cases have been documented in children aged 11 and younger. The primary difference between juvenile and adult cases of CNH is the structural identity of the tumors leading to CNH symptoms. Four of the five cases of CNH involving children were associated with solid infiltrative gliomas on the brainstem, while only one case was associated with an apparent lymphoma referred to as microgliomatosis. =Non-tumor Induced CNH= There have been only a few reported cases of non-tumor induced CNH, most of which have been successfully treated. Recently, the anticonvulsant drug Topiramate induced temporary CNH in patients, which abated after drug use was terminated. Additionally, there has been one reported case of CNH in a patient suffering from multiple sclerosis with brainstem lesions. The CNH was considered reversible and was successfully treated with high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone and plasma exchange. Pathophysiology Although CNH is typically characterized by the presence of lesions in the brainstem region, the mechanism by which these lesions create uninhibited stimulation of the expiratory and inhalatory centers is still poorly understood. These lesions typically arise after cancerous cells from another location of the body metastasize and move to the brain. The mechanism by which CNH was originally thought to occur involved the separation of the pontine and medullary respiratory centers by infiltrative tumors. Animal models mimicking this separation, however, do not exhibit CNH. A secondary postulated mechanism by which CNH may function is that the lesions produce lactate which consequently serves as a stimulator for the chemoreceptors of the medullary region of the brainstem. Previous studies of CNH patients have verified the presence of lactic acid in cerebral spinal fluid. Diagnosis For the clinical diagnosis of CNH, it is essential that the symptoms, particularly respiratory alkalosis, persist while the patient is both awake and asleep. The presence of hyperventilation during sleep excludes any possible emotional or psychogenic causes for the sustained hyperventilation. There must also be no evidence of drug or metabolic causes, including cardiac or pulmonary disease, or recent or current use of respiration-stimulating drugs. While a positive diagnosis of CNH in adult cases should be reserved only until all other possible causes of tachypnea have been eliminated, CNH should be suspected in any alert child presenting with unexplained hyperventilation and hypocarbia leading to respiratory alkalosis. Once CNH is determined to be a possible cause of hyperventilation, lesions and their location in the brain are verified using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). CNH lesions are confirmed through the use of magnetic resonance imaging(MRI) technology. Treatment There is no accepted current course of treatment for CNH. Patients are usually supported by mechanical ventilation and managed with paralytic agents to control breathing rate until a more specific treatment plan can be developed. Morphine is used as the most common treatment, specifically for its ability to depress respiratory rate by reducing tidal volume to added carbon dioxide. However, morphine has only been found to be effective in reducing CNH in select cases. Successful documentation of CNH treatment typically involves the surgical removal of the lesions, or the use of brain irradiation or chemotherapy with corticosteroids to reduce the size of lesions in the affected area of the brain. In cases where CNH presents in children, whose conditions are typically characterized by more solid tumors, aggressive surgical and chemotherapeutic methods are highly recommended. If treatment of the lesions is ineffective, studies have shown that intravenous fentanyl, a slow-acting narcotic, or a fentanyl patch can be used to slow respiration. In patch form, fentanyl is a good alternative to morphine therapy for its high lipid solubility and ability to be worn on the body. Narcotic treatment is largely temporary and high morbidity rates in adults and children are typically cited where lesions are not effectively treated or removed. Prognosis The onset of CNH in all patients regardless of age can be a precursor to ensuing deterioration in patients with infiltrative tumors of the brainstem and medulla. These patients experience prolonged series of CNH before succumbing to the associated deterioration of medullary cardiovascular center, which ultimately results in death. In addition to clinical consequences of a positive CNH diagnosis, sustained hyperventilation also has a marked effect on daily life activities, and may significantly impede a patient’s ability to eat or talk. The persistent hypocarbia, alkalotic pH, and resultant electrolyte disequilibrium may also alter a patient’s mood or mental state. Patients presenting with CNH are often described as inattentive and anxious. History Central neurogenic hyperventilation (CNH) is an extremely rare neurological disorder that was initially reported by Fred Plum, MD and August G. Swanson, MD, in 1959. Plum and Swanson described the symptoms of nine comatose patients, defining CNH as a syndrome consisting primarily of elevated arterial oxygen tension, decreased arterial carbon dioxide tension, and progressive tachypnea. Postmortem examination of the nine patients’ brains reported by Plum and Swanson, revealed necrosis of the central pons in five of the nine patients, and indirect compression of the pons in one additional patient. Their initial findings suggested that lesions in the medial pontine tegmentum leads to a disruption of cortical inhibitory effects of medullar respiratory center. Plum and Swanson suggested that failure to inhibit the activity of this particular region of the brain results in continuous stimulation of the respiratory center by the lateral pontile reticular formulation and laterally located descending neural pathway. The destruction of this required negative feedback mechanism causes the uncontrollable hyperventilation associated with CNH. =Additional Findings= Subsequent findings revealed CNH can also occur in conscious patients. Patients with tumor-induced CNH remain conscious because the reticular activating system of the brain is not affected by the tumor in the early stages of the condition. The condition is considered extremely uncommon, and only 21 additional cases of tumor-inducing CNH were reported up until 2005. Only five of these cases were reported in children. The causes associated with conscious CNH are more varied than originally predicted by Plum and Swanson’s study of comatose patients, although the most commonly reported causes of CNH involve infiltrative gliomas and lymphomas of the brainstem and pons. Although the majority of CNH-inducing tumors are located in close proximity to other medullary homeostatic centers, the physiological changes associated with CNH are restricted to alterations in the control of breathing. Most patients present with normal readings for heart rate and blood pressure, even in the case of severe alkalosis caused by CNH, which indicates that the respiratory center affected by CNH is more sensitive to compression than other areas of the brain. Research Current mechanisms by which CNH functions still remain poorly developed. In addition, a standard form of treatment has not been established to treat CNH. These characteristics make CNH an important condition that still needs to be investigated in adults and children, though the extreme rarity of the condition makes it difficult for research to successfully examine clinical cases.

Engraving of Philippe Emmanuel, Duke of Mercœur He was made a knight of the Order of Saint Esprit in 1578. His wife was Marie de Luxemburg, the Duchess of Penthièvre. Rebellion in Brittany In 1582 he was made governor of Brittany by Henry III of France, who had married his half-sister. In 1588 Mercœur put himself at the head of the League in Brittany, and had himself proclaimed protector of the Roman Catholic Church in the province. His wife's family, the House of Penthièvre, were descendants of the House of Dreux as Dukes of Brittany. The House of Penthièvre had lost the dukedom of Brittany to the House of Montfort in the Breton War of Succession in the 14th century. They had subsequently attempted to overthrow the Montfortist Dukes, with no success. Invoking the alleged hereditary rights of his wife, Mercœur endeavoured to make himself independent in that province, and organized a government at Nantes, calling his son \\"prince and duke of Brittany\\". He formed an alliance with Spain and continued to press for his independence from France when Henry IV became King of France. Henry IV of France sent a force against him led by the duc de Montpensier. With the aid of the Spaniards he defeated the French at the Battle of Craon in 1592. However, the royal troops were reinforced by English contingents and soon recovered the advantage. The king marched against Mercœur in person, and received his submission at Angers on 20 March 1598. Henry IV assured his control of Brittany through the marriage of his illegitimate son to Mercœur's daughter Francoise. Later years Mercœur subsequently went to Hungary, where he entered the service of the emperor Rudolph II. He fought against the Turks, taking Székesfehérvár in 1601.

Albion recorded a population of 4,731 at the . Albion is bordered on the north by the M80 Western Ring Road, the south by Forrest Street, the west by Kororoit Creek and the east by Anderson Road and the Melbourne Metro train line between Anderson Road and the M80 Western Ring Road.  History  The Wurundjeri people were the custodians of the land in the Port Phillip Bay region, including the City of Brimbank, for over 40,000 years before European settlement. Albion lies within the area occupied by the Kurung-Jang-Balluk and Marin-Balluk clans of the Wurundjeri people (also known as the Woiwurung language group), who form part of the larger Kulin Nation. Other groups who occupied land in the area include the Yalukit-Willam and Marpeang-Bulluk clans. Following European settlement, the area was originally called Darlington, from at least 1860 to about 1890. The area originally known as Albion was directly west of Duke Street, as can be noted by the many streets there named after English counties and placenames – Albion being an ancient name for the island of Great Britain. Albion station opened on 5 January 1860 as Albion and Darlington but closed a year later.VICSIG Infrastructure - Albion It was not until 1919 that a new station was opened on the same site with the name Albion station. In March 1885 the Albion Quarrying Company began its operations in the areaKennedy, B: Australian Place Names, page 3. ABC Books, 2006 The disused Albion quarry, accessed from Hulett St, Sunshine was the location for AC/DC's Jailbreak music video.Evans, Mark, Dirty Deeds: My Life Inside/Outside of AC/DC, Bazillion Points, 2011 It was H. V. McKay of Sunshine Harvester Works fame who bought land to develop a residential community for his workers in first decades on the 20th century. His concept for Sunshine was the Sunshine Estate: a community developed according to the ideals of the Garden city movement, an influential town planning movement of the late 19th and early 20th centuries.HO Selwyn Park This area was mainly in what is now called Albion. McKay's own residence, The Gables, was in Talmage Street (where the cul-de-sac The Gables now is) until it was consumed by fire and subsequently demolished.  Today  Albion has many period homes such as California bungalows and 1940s weatherboard houses. In the eastern parts of Albion, many of the oldest homes were built by H. V. McKay as part of his Sunshine Estate, a housing community built according to the influential early 20th Century Garden city movement. Kororoit Creek provides the western border for Albion. Along it runs the Kororoit Creek Trail which runs all the way southwards to meet the Federation Trail in Brooklyn. Stony Creek lies on the eastern edge of Albion, close to Anderson Road. , the creek's environmental state west of Anderson Rd is very poor as it has long been converted to nothing more than a concrete stormwater drain for this particular section of its course. A notable landmark of Albion is the red brick John Darling and Son Flour Mill built in 1922. It is just to the south of Ballarat Rd, next to Albion train station.  Population  In the 2016 Census, there were 4,731 people in Albion. Of these 54.2% were male and 45.8% were female. Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander people made up 0.8% of the population. The median age of people in Albion was 33 years. Children aged 0 - 14 years made up 15.4% of the population and people aged 65 years and over made up 12.3% of the population.

Biography Born in Billings, Montana, he was raised on a sheep ranch near Lodge Grass. He attended the University of Montana in Missoula and later lived in Helena. In 1958, Lynde created the comic strip Rick O'Shay, a critical and commercial success. Like most of his work, it was set in the West and mixed humor with strong storytelling. After a dispute with the syndicate, Lynde left the strip in 1977. The strip continued, drawn by Alfredo Alcala. In 1979, Lynde launched another strip, Latigo, starring Cole \\"Latigo\\" Cantrell, a.k.a. \\"Two Trails\\". His father was a mountain man and his mother a Crow Indian. After serving in the Union Army during the Civil War, Latigo returned to the West and became a federal marshal. The daily strip was launched on 25 June 1979, joined by a Sunday strip, best seen in the half page format, on 1 July 1979. It was not a great commercial success and ended in 1983, the daily on 7 May, the Sunday on 5 June. From 1984 to 1985, Lynde produced the weekly panel Grass Roots, which was revived in 1998. In the late 1980s, the Swedish financial newspaper Dagens Industri commissioned a comic strip from Lynde. It became \\"Chief Plenty Bucks\\", set in the West and starring a capitalistic Native American chief. Lynde drew ten pages, but the project was shelved and never published in Dagens Industri. In 1997, the strip was revived for the Swedish Fantomen magazine (and its Norwegian and Finnish counterparts). The title was changed to Chief Sly Fox and a total of 86 pages (including the originals from the 1980s) were published from 1997 to 2000. They have never been published in English. In 2002, Lynde returned with another exclusive comic for Fantomen; Bad Bob about a hopeless Wild West criminal. This strip is still running in reprint. In December of 2012, Lynde announced relocating to Ecuador.https://missoulian.com/news/state-and-regional/western-artist- cartoonist-author-stan-lynde-leaving-montana-for- ecuador/article_a5c4fa8c-37e3-11e2-826a-001a4bcf887a.html He quoted Charles Marion Russell in his last blog post stating of his time: Just a little sunshine, just a little rain. Just a little pleasure, just a little pain. Initially Lynde believed he had bronchitis but in May it was discovered to be a form of lung cancer.http://stanlyndeauthor.com/ He died 6 August 2013.

It was named for California, the “Golden State”. The Golden State route was relatively low- altitude, crossing the Continental Divide at about near Lordsburg, New Mexico, although the highest elevation en route was over near Corona, New Mexico. Other transcontinental routes reached elevations of more than in the Santa Fe railway near Flagstaff, Arizona, and Union Pacific near Sherman, Wyoming. At 2340 miles it was one of the longest continuous passenger railroad routes in the United States,Streamliner Schedules, The Golden State http://streamlinerschedules.com/concourse/track9/goldstate194812.html to be exceeded by the SP's Imperial and by Amtrak's pre-2005 Sunset Limited. In most of the Arizona section of the route it passes through area acquired by the Gadsden Purchase. History 1909 postcard ad for the train. 1911 postcard. The railroad hired American illustrator Rose O'Neill to produce some of its promotional material. The train was inaugurated on November 2, 1902, as the Golden State Limited between Chicago, Kansas City, El Paso, southern Arizona and Los Angeles. At it had the longest route in the United States and second only to the Canadian Pacific Railway's Imperial Limited in North America. Until 1910 the Golden State Limited was seasonal, generally running December to April or May; the rest of the year, the same schedules were known as the California Limited westbound and Chicago-St. Louis Limited eastbound. The Golden State Limited was for Pullman passengers only, while the California Limited also carried tourist (economy) sleeping cars and coaches. The Golden State Limited (or California Limited in the off season) carried numbers 43 and 44 until mid-1907 when it became numbers 3 and 4. After January 1910 the Golden State Limited ran year-round until it ended in 1968. Limited was dropped from the name on May 18, 1947, and the train became the Golden State. In summer 1926, the train left Chicago at 8:30 PM CST and arrived Los Angeles 68 hr 15 min later. During the 1920s and 1930s when Florida became a popular winter destination, the Rock Island and Southern Pacific positioned the Golden State as an escape from the cold eastern and Midwestern winters, with some success. For years the primary competition was Santa Fe's California Limited which did almost twice the business. When the Santa Fe Chief started in November 1926, the Golden State started running on the same 63-hour schedule with the same $10 extra fare (until 1929). After World War II, the Rock Island and Southern Pacific considered a new 39¾ hour (the accepted fast schedule between Chicago and Los Angeles/San Francisco) streamliner to be named the Golden Rocket. This name was an extension of the use of the name Rocket that the Rock Island had introduced on other routes combined with the prefix “Golden” which had been used for many years as a prefix for car names. See also the Rocky Mountain Rocket, the Des Moines Rocket, the Peoria Rocket and others. The Golden Rocket was to have two sets of equipment (one supplied by each railroad) and compete with Santa Fe's Super Chief, another train between Chicago and Los Angeles. The Rock Island ordered cars with a red and silver color scheme, lettered for the Golden Rocket. The Southern Pacific was not as enthusiastic, primarily because of upgrades needed on the El Paso–Kansas City portion of the route, which was single track and poorly signaled. After Southern Pacific decided not to participate, Rock Island's set of Golden Rocket equipment was re-lettered and integrated into the Golden State. The Golden State became a streamliner in January 1948, with vermilion red on the upper body and pier panel and the lower bodies either natural corrugated stainless steel or silver or grey paint on smooth-sided cars. The train ran with many styles of equipment. Smooth-sided and corrugated stainless steel equipment were mixed and heavyweight baggage, Railway Post Office (RPO) and dormitory cars were common. Transcontinental sleeping car service between New York and Los Angeles on alternate days via the New York Central Railroad and Pennsylvania Railroad was added in 1946 but ended in 1951. Other sleeping car routes on the Golden State included Chicago – Kansas City and Chicago – San Diego (via the Southern Pacific and their subsidiary, San Diego and Arizona Railway, connecting at Yuma, Arizona). The train carried linked sleeping cars from other carriers: in Kansas City, it picked up a Rock Island Railroad sleeping car from Minneapolis and at the same station it picked up also a Missouri Pacific Railroad sleeping car from St. Louis,Southern Pacific February 1952 timetable, p. 8, Table 3 http://streamlinermemories.info/SP/SP52-2TT.pdf The train had a coordinated connection with the National Railway of Mexico's (NdeM) El Fronterizo (7/8) in El Paso, Texas; this NdeM train continued to Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua and Mexico City. The schedule was set to accommodate travel from Los Angeles to Mexico, and the reverse direction.Southern Pacific February 1952 timetable, p. 16, Table 40 http://streamlinermemories.info/SP/SP52-2TT.pdfNdeM May 1962 timetable, p. 17 Table 5, center column http://streamlinermemories.info/CAN/NdeM62TT.pdf The Golden State had the same declining passenger revenues as other trains in the 1950s and 1960s, although service was not downgraded severely as on other trains. A sleeping car and grill/lounge or dining car was always included. The train was combined with Southern Pacific's New Orleans – Los Angeles Sunset Limited west of El Paso after April 1964. The last westbound Golden State left Chicago on Monday, February 19, 1968, and the last inbound Golden State pulled into Chicago's LaSalle Street Station on February 21. Amtrak's Sunset Limited between Los Angeles and New Orleans uses the Golden State's route west of Yuma. The Sunset runs three times weekly; Southern Pacific reduced the Sunset Limited from daily to tri-weekly before Amtrak's formation. Routes The Southern Pacific line from Los Angeles to El Paso was completed in May 1881; the Golden State ran on the El Paso and Northeastern Railroad from Tucumcari, New Mexico, to El Paso. West of there it sometimes used the El Paso and Southwestern Railroad (EP&SW;) through Douglas, Arizona, to Tucson and sometimes the Southern Pacific (SP) via Deming; SP carried the train Tucson to Los Angeles. The former EP&SW; between Douglas and El Paso was abandoned in 1961 and the tracks removed in 1963. Rock Island had many feeder lines used for freight and passenger service to southern California. One of these was the ‘Choctaw Route’ from Memphis though Little Rock, Oklahoma City and Amarillo to Tucumcari, New Mexico. This line was completed in 1900 to Amarillo, Texas, and to Tucumcari, after purchase by the Rock Island, by 1902. Over the years connections were made with through sleeping cars from Memphis and Little Rock to Los Angeles, generally connecting with the Golden State. The Rock Island actually owned the rail line to Santa Rosa, New Mexico, south of Tucumcari, but since the routes intersected at Tucumcari, this is where the change from Rock Island to Southern Pacific crews and locomotives were made. The Rock Island main line crossed the Colorado and Southern and Fort Worth and Denver railroad main line at Dalhart, Texas. This Dallas-Denver line was the route of the Texas Zephyr and other trains. For many years travelers could connect here to go north and south between El Paso and Denver, the only other route being the Santa Fe to Albuquerque with a second change of trains at La Junta, Colorado. As part of the merger agreement between EP&SW; and SP in 1924, the SP agreed to build a main line through Phoenix, which until then was on a branch from Maricopa. The main line was built from a point near Picacho through Coolidge to Chandler, Mesa, Tempe and Phoenix thence on existing tracks to Buckeye with a new extension to Wellton on the original SP main. This alternate route is no longer in service between Roll and Buckeye, Arizona, although the tracks are in place. Equipment The Golden State received regular upgrades to equipment. Beginning in 1924 Golden-series observation cars were assigned to the train. These 3-compartment, 2-drawing room observations became famous in the Pullman fleet as the most modern and luxurious equipment available and were also operated on the Santa Fe (Silver series) and New York Central (Central series). Starting in 1940, 8-section, 5-double bedroom rebuilt heavyweight Clover-series cars appeared on the Golden State. During 1926-29 and after 1948 the Golden State was an extra-fare train, supposedly to account for the costs of the luxury service and the reservation system for chair car seating. In later years, the extra fare became something of a joke as service deteriorated badly. Extra fare for Pullman accommodation Los Angeles to Chicago was $10 in 1948, adding perhaps 10% to the total fare. The $3.50 extra fare for chair car passengers had the advantage of individual reserved seats and modern, leg rest, air-conditioned coaches. If you did not want to pay the extra fare, the slower secondary trains (see below) were available. The additional costs in a non-computer era for coach seat reservations were substantial; however, a nationwide reservation system for Pullman (sleeping car) passengers had existed for many decades. Shortly before World War II, three streamlined dining cars (Yucca, Saguaro and Ocotillo) were built by Budd for service on the train. These cars were placed on the Twin Star Rocket in 1945 and later returned to the Golden State. Two-tone grey, smooth-sided 4-4-2 (4 double bedroom, 4-compartment, 2-drawing room) and 6-6-4 (6 sections, 6 roomettes, 4 double bedrooms) lightweight sleeping cars were assigned to the train beginning in 1942. Later that year 4-4-2 sleepers from the discontinued Arizona Limited and Treasure Island Special were also assigned (Imperial Clipper, Imperial Guard, Imperial Throne and Imperial Banner). These cars wore only numbers as the RI/SP did not name their cars until after World War II (and then only for a short time). Streamlined 44 and 48 reclining seat leg- rest (long-distance) low-capacity chair cars from both the Southern Pacific and Rock Island were added to the Golden State as they were built. Southern Pacific used “Roman”-style lettering on its equipment, while the Rock Island favored “Zephyr”-style lettering. Except for the 1942 built sleeping cars, the postwar cars built for the Golden State also differed in their car side style between the two roads: Except for two corrugated side coaches, Southern Pacific cars had smooth sides, while Rock Island cars had corrugated sides except for the Rock Island owned 4-4-2 and 6-6-4 sleepers. In the late 1950s the slower counterpart train on generally the same route was the Imperial.Rock Island timetable, May 1957 http://streamlinermemories.info/RI/RI57TT.pdf Between 1947 and 1950, after the demise of the Golden Rocket, streamlined sleeping, chair, meal and lounge cars were added. As five consists were necessary, Rock Island and Southern Pacific each supplied two or three different cars. For example, Rock Island and Southern Pacific each built and assigned two 12 double bedroom sleeping cars for Golden State service, which resulted in four consists each featuring one such car type, while the fifth consist had a 4-4-2 sleeping car in place of the non existent fifth 12 double bedroom sleeping car. Unlike the Rock Island, the Southern Pacific had five 10-6 (10 roomette, 6 double bedroom) sleeping cars assigned to this train, where three cars of this type were normal mid train sleeping cars and two of this type were tail cars with a blunted end. The three normal mid train 10-6 sleeping cars usually ran in those three consists that did not feature a 10-6 blunt-end sleeping car at the rear but one of the three Rock Island round end observation cars. As for mail cars, baggage cars and baggage dormitory cars, the situation was as follows: Both Southern Pacific and Rock Island each provided five mail-baggage cars (featuring a Railway Post Office) for Golden State service. The Southern Pacific assigned five older heavyweight mail- baggage cars numbered 5065-5069 which were painted in the new red and silver scheme. The Rock Island assigned three newly in 1947 built lightweight corrugated side mail-baggage cars numbered 802-804 and later in 1952 two newly rebuilt (from old parlor cars) heavyweight mail-baggage cars numbered 720 and 721. These three cars were the only cars of the entire Golden State car pool that never received the red and silver paint scheme and remained all stainless steel with Rock Island lettering in the letterboard instead of Golden State. Unlike for the mail-baggage cars where each road had provided five cars for, the situation for the baggage dormitory cars was different, as there were only five such cars in total assigned for Golden State service. The Rock Island provided three baggage dormitory cars: One lightweight corrugated side baggage dormitory numbered 820 built new by Pullman Standard in 1947 and two older heavyweight baggage dormitories numbered 6014 and 6105. The Southern Pacific provided modernized heavyweight baggage dormitory car 3401 which was built by American Car & Foundry as hospital car for the US Army in 1944 and was painted red and silver in 1947, and in 1949 a newly built lightweight smooth side baggage dormitory car numbered 3100. With only five baggage dormitory cars available for the five Golden State consists, the Rock Island soon painted heavyweight baggage dormitory 6013 into the red and silver scheme and assigned it as a protection car in case one of the five regularly assigned baggage dormitory cars were off for shopping. From 1948 until late 1950, the five Golden State consists had been always operating with two headend cars (one mail-baggage car and one baggage dormitory per consist). Only a consist that featured a combination of Southern Pacific baggage dormitory 3100 or Rock Island baggage dormitory 820 together with one of the three Rock Island mail- baggage cars 802-804 would be an entirely streamlined Golden State consist. All other options featured one or two heavyweight cars, which is why the Golden State could actually never be considered a full streamliner train. That possible combination of having at least one fully streamlined consist out of five was made impossible in late 1950 and early 1951 when the Southern Pacific started to assign four red and silver painted heavyweight ex baggage-horse cars now converted to mail-storage cars numbered . Rock Island also provided two 1947 built corrugated side baggage cars (numbers 852 and 853) as mail- storage cars during that time. So now the number of heavyweight cars in a Golden State consist could reach up to three. Only a consist which had either Rock Island baggage dormitory 820 or Southern Pacific baggage dormitory 3100 in combination with Rock Island mail-baggage cars 802-804 and Rock Island mail-storage cars 852-853 would be an all streamlined consist. It was not until 1959 that the number of heavyweight cars assigned to the Golden State consists would be reduced again. In addition to the luxurious 2-double- bedroom, 1-drawing room observation La Mirada, built for the Golden Rocket, the Rock Island had observation cars Golden Vista and Golden Divan. All these three observation cars arrived in August 1948, which means by the time the Golden State was officially introduced as a streamliner in train in January 1948, all five consists continued operating without any observation cars until August that year and two consists even until June 1950. The Southern Pacific did not believe in observation cars, feeling them to be a nuisance to switch and non-revenue producing (mid-train lounge cars always made more money off beverage service). In June 1950 they supplied two blunt-end 10-6 (10 roomette, 6 double bedroom) sleeping cars, similar to the cars built in 1950 for the newly streamlined Sunset Limited. And instead of observation cars, SP supplied two full mid-train lounge cars named Golden View and Golden Outlook that arrived in late 1949. The two consists featuring the blunt-end 10-6 sleeping cars on the rear operated with the full mid-train lounge cars, while the three consists featuring observation cars operated without any full lounge car, as these observation cars themselves featured a buffet lounge in the rear half of the car. In May and June 1956, the Rock Island converted their three observation cars for the Golden State into full mid-train lounge cars, which caused three of the five consists to operate without any tail car, as the Rock Island did not have any blunt-end sleeping cars. The five Golden State consists were remarkable in the point that they featured at least six unique cars that never were built in more than one example. These cars were Southern Pacific lightweight smooth side baggagage dormitory 3100, Rock Island lightweight corrugated side baggage dormitory 820, Rock Island lightweight corrugated side 4-4-2 sleeping car La Quinta, Rock Island lightweight corrugated side coffee shop lounge El Café (informally labeled as “Fiesta Car”), Rock Island lightweight corrugated side dining car El Comedor and Rock Island lightweight corrugated side sleeper buffet lounge observation La Mirada. Especially the unique and partially handmade decorations and interiors of El Café, El Comedor and La Mirada were heavily promoted in advertising but the chance that one of these unique cars was part of a Golden State consist was only one in five, which basically resulted in all five consists having unique compositions. After World War II and until 1953 all cars in the train had names, mostly beginning with Golden. After 1953, when the red and silver paint scheme was discontinued, the names were gradually removed from the Southern Pacific cars and replaced by numbers. Also, the Golden State lettering in the letterboards of the Southern Pacific cars was replaced by Southern Pacific lettering written inside a red stripe and the train name was featured in a logo in the center of the car (like on the Sunset Limited). The Rock Island however retained the names and the Golden State lettered letterboards for their cars. The repainting process from the red and silver paint scheme to the all silver scheme for Rock Island cars and to the simulated stainless steel with red letterboard stripe scheme for Southern Pacific cars started in April 1953 and was not finished until January 1955. In late 1958, the Southern Pacific cars paint scheme was again changed by deleting the Golden State train name in the logo, by slightly enlargening the height of the red letterboard stripe and by painting the headend cars solid grey. The Golden State at 99th Street in Washington Heights on the Rock Island mainline in April 1965 A unique type of sleeping car was introduced by Rock Island in 1954; 10 cars with eight roomettes and six bedrooms assigned to the Rocky Mountain Rocket and the Golden State. These cars had more space for long-distance travelers. Standard streamlined sleeping cars with roomettes normally held 22 passengers in various configurations (10-6, 14–4, etc.) but these, along with a “Western” series of 12 roomette, 4 double bedroom cars built for the Wabash and Union Pacific, were extra spacious. Also in 1954, Southern Pacific provided new 44-seat corrugated side coaches for the Golden State, which unlike the older smooth side coaches were built by Budd instead of Pullman Standard. In 1959, Rock Island purchased three lightweight smooth side baggage dormitory cars from the New York Central, which replaced the heavyweight baggage dormitory cars that the Rock Island had been constantly using for the Golden State since 1942. And also in 1959, Rock Island purchased two lightweight smooth side lounge cars from the New York Central for Golden State service, while it reassigned its original Golden State assigned lounge cars La Mirada, Golden Divan and Golden Vista to other trains. Dieselization began on the Rock Island immediately post-war with A-B and A-B-B sets of EMD E6, E7, E8 and sometimes even Alco DL units being assigned to the train. Later, A-B-A sets and even some FP7 units became more common. In 1947 Southern Pacific bought three A-B-B sets of EMD E7 units in the vermilion and silver (aluminum) colors. These red and silver Southern Pacific E7s were repainted to the familiar “Daylight” scheme (red, orange and black) in June 1949 before the Golden State even had received all its ordered lightweight cars which did not occur until June 1950. Until 1954, the Rock Island diesel units were painted in the original red, maroon and silver “Rocket” colors. In 1954 that changed to a simplified scheme without the red color, in 1958 to an even more simplified scheme featuring mostly a maroon front and silver rest and in the early 60's to an all maroon scheme, which by 1967 was enhanced with yellow wings at the front. By late 1953, Southern Pacific PA-1/PB-1 and PA-2/PB-2 units began joining the E7 units with pulling the Golden State, and in 1954 E9 units were added. By this time A-B-A sets became more common on the Southern Pacific, which could be either made up entirely of E7 or PA/PB units or mixed consists featuring E7, E9 and PA/PB units working together. All these Southern Pacific diesel units remained in the Daylight scheme until 1958 and 1959 when they were gradually repainted into the “Bloody Nose” scheme featuring a red nose and grey rest, which they kept until the very end. Also by 1960, F7 units started to appear pulling the Golden State for a limited time in the early '60s. Although the Golden State was officially declared a dieselized train by January 1948, the Southern Pacific regularly assigned GS-4 class 4-8-4 steam locomotives to pull the Golden State between Tucumcari, New Mexico and El Paso, Texas until late 1953. Due to diesel shortages on the Southern Pacific, which lasted until the mid '50s, steam helpers in form of GS class 4-8-4, MT class 4-8-2, SP class 4-10-2 and even AC class 4-8-8-2 and 2-8-8-4 steam locomotives were a common sight on the Golden State. Schedule In July 1948 the Golden State left Chicago at 10:15 pm CST and arrived Los Angeles 5:15 pm on the second day. The return trip left Los Angeles at 11:30 am arriving in Chicago at 11:30 am the second morning. In July 1954 it left Chicago at 2:15 pm CST and arrived Los Angeles the second day at 7:30 am. The return trip left Los Angeles at 1:30 pm and arrived the second day at 9:55 am. In later years the arrival in Phoenix, for example, was late in the evening. Pullman passengers on the Phoenix setout could stay in the sleeping car until morning. Consist A typical consist of the early '50s could include a maximum of 16 cars: 1\\\\.

His translation differs from Enno Littmann at several points. First, Littmann believed the third line referred to the digging of canals nearby (his translation, \\"zog die Kannaele von \`Aw\`a\\") despite the lack of any signs of canals or ditches in the area; Ullendorff argues that the verb shb in the inscription should be translated as \\"to drag along, to capture\\". Second, he believed the nouns -- 'W\`, 'LF, and SBL -- were placenames, and based on discussions with local informants Ullendorff identified them with nearby communities: the earlier name of Baraknaha, the site of a 12th-century church 17 kilometers from Matara, had been subli, and the equally well-known Orthodox church at Gunda Gunde, 22 kilometers from Matara, had once been known as Aw\`a 'ilfi.Ullendorff, \\"Obelisk of Matara\\", p. 31  Modern history  Obelisk monument in Balaw Kawa, Metera When Littmann, leader of the Deutsche Aksum- Expedition, found the Hawulti, it had been pushed over and broken in half in the distant past.

The school has a longstanding reputation as one of the most prestigious and highly selective schools in Thailand. Bangkok Christian College was established on 30 September 1852 by American Presbyterian missionaries. Originally in Thonburi, the school moved to its present site in Bang Rak District in 1902. The school has about 400 academic staff, both Thai and foreigner, and 6,000 students in 12 grades. Although it is a Christian school, only about five percent of students are Christians. Most students are Buddhist, but it is popular with students of all faiths due to its strong reputation. History Bangkok Christian College, the first private boys school in the Kingdom of Thailand, was founded on 30 September 1852, in tambons Koodeechine and Samray, Thonburi, with the blessing of King Rama IV. In 1902, the school was moved to Pramuan Road. King Rama V donated 20 chang to help defray the cost of land for the development of the new campus.\\"History- Bangkok Christian College\\", http://www.bcc.ac.th/2019/en/history.html, Retrieved 2019-08-26  Intensive English Program  The BCC Intensive English Program (IEP) was created in 2002 to increase students' ability to understand and use English confidently and effectively in a range of different contexts. This program will let students learn and practice English with a native speaker. English Immersion Program (EIP) Bangkok Christian College took part in one of the first pilot projects for native-English education in Thailand. Commissioned by the Office of Private Education of the Thai Ministry of Education, it has provided an English-Thai bilingual education program to its students since 1995. Beginning with Prathom-1 (Grade 1), it has expanded the EIP by one grade level each year. The school provides a full K-12 program (Prathom-1 to Matthayom-6). Native English-speaking teachers, as well as the Thai teachers, instruct students in English, mathematics, science, computer technology, health education, physical education, music, and social studies.  School colors  Bangkok Christian College's school colors are purple and gold. Purple is the color of royalty. It is the combination of red (Thai national color) and blue (the color of the monarchy), so purple signifies the nation and the king. Gold is the color of value. It is mostly yellow, the color of Buddhism, which is the primary religion of Thailand. Campus Bangkok Christian College's current campus is in the heart of the city, in Bang Rak, in the Silom District. The school is a one-minute walk from the Surasak BTS skytrain station. Student management Bangkok Christian College School separates students in different buildings according to their grade level. Primary students (about 2650) learn at the John A. Eakin Building, junior high school students (about 1325) learn at the M.B. Palmer Building, and senior high school students (about 1325) learn at the BCC 150th Anniversary Building, which is the only building that is separate from the main area of the school. The only way that senior high students can go to the main area during the school time is via a bridge between the M.B. Palmer Building and the 150th Anniversary Building. There are about 400-500 students in each grade, and students are separated into 12 different rooms, with about 30-60 students for room numbers 1-9 and about 23-40 students for room numbers 10-12. Students are organized in high school according to their program, major, and examination score. Normally, students will learn in that room until they graduate, unlike the primary school and junior high school whose students change rooms every year.

William Keil (March 6, 1812 – December 30, 1877) was the founder of communal religious societies in Bethel, Missouri, and Aurora Colony in Oregon, that he established and led in the nineteenth century. Influenced by German Lutheranism, pietism, and revival Methodism, Keil's theology was based on the principle of the Golden Rule as well as the view that people should try to share all with others by living communally (Acts 4:32-37). Keil was born in Prussia March 6, 1812 and raised by German Lutheran parents. He emigrated to the United States as a young man—apparently after receiving a mystic text from a gypsy. Initially he settled in New York and worked as a tailor, his family trade. Within a year, he and his wife, also German, moved to western Pennsylvania, where Keil gained a reputation as a mystic and healer. By 1837, he had opened a drugstore in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Keil soon heard about a group of former Harmony Society members who had left that communal group, and had moved to Phillipsburg (now Monaca, Pennsylvania), where they had tried to form the New Philadelphia Society. When Keil contacted the families in the early 1840s, he impressed some of them, and they suggested he form a communal society. As former members of such a society, they provided invaluable practical assistance to its founding and maintenance. Keil was influenced by revivalism and utopianism, which were popular in western Pennsylvania during the 1830s. After becoming a successful Christian preacher and building a large congregation, Keil, and his followers, moved to Bethel, Missouri, in 1844 and started a Utopian commune. This colony was considered successful, but many of its members—again led by Keil—moved to Oregon between 1853 and 1856 to start a new settlement, which became known as Aurora Mills. Keil died December 30, 1877, leaving a power vacuum that led to the dissolution of the colony in 1883. Dr. Keil led the first wagon train to the Oregon territory carrying his eldest son, Willie, in a coffin in the lead wagon. Willie died a few days before the trip was to begin and had been promised by his Father that he would go, no matter what. Willie's coffin was filled with whiskey distilled at the Bethel colony and put in the lead wagon as promised. He was buried in Washington on the original settlement that would later move and become the Aurora Colony The community at Aurora is given tribute at Twin Oaks Community, a contemporary intentional community of over 100 people in Louisa County, Virginia. All Twin Oaks' buildings are named after communities that are no longer actively functioning, and \\"Aurora\\" is the name of the visitor residence. His house near Bethel, known as Elim, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971. Located nearby is Hebron.

The book is written in anapestic tetrameter, Seuss's usual verse type, and illustrated in Seuss's pen-and-ink style.  Plot  It tells the story of a child named Gerald McGrew who, when visiting a zoo, finds that the exotic animals are \\"not good enough\\". He says that if he ran the zoo, he would let all of the current animals free and find new, more bizarre and exotic ones. Throughout the book he lists these creatures, starting with a lion with ten feet and escalating to more imaginative (and imaginary) creatures, such as the Fizza-ma-Wizza-ma- Dill, \\"the world's biggest bird from the island of Gwark, who eats only pine trees, and spits out the bark.\\" The illustrations also grow wilder as McGrew imagines going to increasingly remote and exotic habitats and capturing each fanciful creature, bringing them all back to a zoo now filled with his new wild animals. He also imagines the praise he receives from others, who are amazed at his \\"new Zoo, McGrew Zoo\\".  Adaptation  Some of the animals featured in If I Ran the Zoo have been featured in a segment of The Hoober- Bloob Highway, a 1975 CBS TV special. In this segment, Hoober-Bloob babies don't have to be human if they don't choose to be, so Mr. Hoober-Bloob shows them a variety of different animals; including ones from If I Ran The Zoo (and On Beyond Zebra!). Such animals include: Obsks, a flock of Wild Bippo-No- Bungus, a Tizzle-Topped Tufted Mazurka, a Big-Bug-Who-Is-Very-Surprising, Chuggs, a Deer with Horns-That-Are-Just-A-Bit-Queer, a New Sort-Of-A-Hen, an Elephant-Cat, and an Iota.  \\"Nerd\\"  If I Ran the Zoo is often credited with the first printed modern English appearance of the word \\"nerd,\\" although the word is not used in its modern context. It is simply the name of an otherwise un-characterized imaginary creature, appearing in the sentence \\"And then, just to show them, I'll sail to Ka-Troo/And Bring Back an It-Kutch, a Preep, and a Proo,/A Nerkle, a Nerd, and a Seersucker too!\\" Theme park attraction Dr. Seuss's Zoo book is also the main theme for one of the children's play areas at Universal Studios' Islands of Adventure. The small play area is located inside the area of the park known as Seuss Landing.  Criticism  If I Ran the Zoo has been criticized for its use of racial stereotypes and caricatures. In a 1988 biography of Dr. Seuss, Ruth K. MacDonald notes the presence of “occasional stereotypes of native peoples—potbellied, thick-lipped blacks from Africa, squinty-eyed Orientals,” that “may offend some modern readers.” A study published in the journal Research on Diversity in Youth Literature noted the presence of dehumanizing stereotypes of East Asian and Middle Eastern characters. The Canadian Book and Periodical Council's Freedom to Read project listed the book as having been challenged in 2015 for “insensitivity and ethnic stereotyping.” See also * If I Ran the Circus References Category:Books by Dr. Seuss Category:Islands of Adventure Category:Universal Parks & Resorts attractions by name Category:Amusement rides introduced in 1999 Category:1950 children's books Category:Caldecott Honor-winning works Category:American picture books Category:Novels set in zoos Category:Random House books Category:Works originally published in Redbook ","title":"If I Ran the Zoo"},{"id":"2480478","text":"Nameplate of the temple.

Wat Pra Sing () is a Buddhist temple located on Thanon Singkhlai in Tambon Wiang, Mueang district, Chiang Rai Province, northern Thailand. Wat Pra Sing was built by Pra Chao Maha Proma (P.E. 1345 – 1400), c. 1385 (B.E. 1928). The Phra Sing image One replica of the Pra Sing image at Wat Pra Sing, Chiang Rai The Ubosoth contains several replicas of the Pra Sing or Pra Buddhasihing image, a cultural landmark in the history of the Lanka wong Theravada Sect of Buddhism in Thailand. An Ebony and Gold image The Pra Buddhasihing image, called the Pra Sing image in Northern Thailand, is said to have come from Sri Lanka to Nakorn Sri Thammalat to Sukhothai to Ayutthaya, Kamphaengphet, Chiang Rai and Chiang Mai before ending up in Bangkok. A Purple Jade image According to the Chiang Mai Chronicles Pra Chao Maha Proma attempted to usurp the throne at Chiang Mai upon the death of his brother Pra Nue Na but failed and withdrew to the protection of the king of Ayutthaya. When he later returned to Chiang Rai he brought the Pra Buddhasihing image with him. Other Buddha images at Wat Phra Sing There are several other interesting Buddha images at Wat Pra Sing, like these gathered beneath a Bodhi tree sent from India. The Pali School at Wat Pra Sing There has long been a Pali language school at Wat Pra Sing and a new building was dedicated on the occasion of the Queen's seventy second Phansa, on 22 July 2005 (22 กรกฎคม 2548). According to Radhika Abeysekera, the Buddha's mother, Queen Mahaa Maayaa, decided to visit her mother so that she could be with her at the time of the birth of her baby. On the way she stopped at the Lumbini Pleasure Garden to rest. Under a sweet-scented Sala Lanka tree, on a full moon day in the month of May, in the year 623 BC, the Prince was born. Wat Pra Sing in Chiang Rai has a pair of Sala Lanka trees behind the chedi, in front of the kuti, or monks' quarters. They are sweet scented indeed. The Buddha walked the earth for 80 years and passed into Nirvana in 543 BC. The P.E and the B.E. differ by 543 years.

He was the former editor-in-chief of Film Comment and authored several books including Talking Pictures,Richard Corliss (1974), Talking Pictures: Screenwriters in the American Cinema, 1927–1973 which, along with other publications, drew early attention to the screenwriter, as opposed to the director. Personal life and background Corliss was born in 1944 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania,Profile, filmreference.com; accessed September 6, 2014. the son of Elizabeth Brown (née McCluskey) and Paul William Corliss. He attended St. Joseph's College, Philadelphia (now Saint Joseph's University), obtaining a bachelor's degree, before progressing to Columbia University to earn a master's degree in film studies. Corliss resided in New York City with his wife, Mary, whom he married on Sunday, August 31, 1969. Mary was formerly a curator in the Film Stills Archive of the Museum of Modern Art. In a 1990 article, Corliss mentions his mother clipping movie ads with quotes of his and posting them to her refrigerator door.Richard Corliss (1990) \\"All Thumbs, Or, Is There a Future for Film Criticism?\\" Film Comment, March/April. Reprinted in Roger Ebert (2006), Awake in the Dark: The Best of Roger Ebert, p. 394. On April 23, 2015, Corliss died under hospice care in New York City after suffering a stroke. Career Corliss wrote for many magazines—National Review from 1966–1970, New Times, Maclean's and SoHo Weekly News in 1980. At Film Comment, Corliss helped draw attention to the screenwriter in the creation of movies. Corliss challenged Andrew Sarris's idea of the Director as author or auteur of this work. Corliss was one of Sarris' students at New York University (NYU); the two remained friends until Sarris' death. Corliss brought Jonathan Rosenbaum to Film Comment as a Paris correspondent. Despite working for National Review, a conservative magazine, Corliss was a self- described \\"liberal\\". In 1980, Corliss joined Time. Although he started as an associate editor, he was promoted to senior writer by 1985. Corliss wrote for time.com as well as the print magazine including a retired column about nostalgic pop culture called That Old Feeling. He wrote occasional articles for Time. He was an occasional guest on Charlie Rose's talk show commenting on new releases, mostly during the 1990s with Janet Maslin and David Denby. His last appearance on the show was in December 2005 to talk about the year in film. Corliss also appeared on A&E; Biography to talk about the life and work of Jackie Chan, and appeared in Richard Schickel's documentary about Warner Brothers. Corliss attended the Cannes Film Festival along with Roger Ebert and Todd McCarthy for the longest period of any US journalist. He also attended festivals in Toronto and Venice. Corliss used to work on the board of the New York Film Festival, but resigned in 1987 after longtime head Richard Roud was fired due to his challenging of editorial direction of the festival. Lolita, Corliss's third book, was a study of Vladimir Nabokov's book and Stanley Kubrick's film. Later Corliss has written an introductory essay for Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon: A Portrait of the Ang Lee Film. Corliss also admired the Pixar movies, including listing Finding Nemo as one of his and fellow Time critic Richard Schickel's 100 all-time greatest movies. With recent Pixar releases Cars and Ratatouille Corliss had access into the studio's inner workings. Pixar director Brad Bird has said of critics in general that he has \\"got nothing against critics.\\" He also that he had \\"done very well with them, over the years.\\"Blogsite , orlandosentinel.com; accessed September 6, 2014. In addition to writing for Time, Corliss had a lengthy association with Film Comment magazine, serving as its editor from 1970 to 1990. Corliss covered movies for the magazine and for time.com simultaneously. Corliss along with Martin Scorsese first came up with the idea for the issue on \\"guilty pleasures\\". Corliss along with Richard Schickel made a 100 Greatest movies list. Corliss alone created lists of the 25 greatest villains, the 25 best horror films, and the 25 most important films on race. In addition Corliss was on the 2001 jury for AFI's 100 Greatest movies list. In a 1993 Time magazine movie review of The Crying Game, Corliss subtly gave away the spoiler of the film, by spelling it out with the first letters of each paragraph of his review. Conflict and criticism Corliss has had movies on his top ten lists that fellow Time critic Richard Schickel has rated the worst of the year. These included 2001's Moulin Rouge!, 2003's Cold Mountain and 2004's Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. In August 2004, Stephen King, criticizing what he saw as a growing trend of leniency towards films by critics, included Corliss among a number of \\"formerly reliable critics who seem to have gone remarkably soft – not to say softhearted and sometimes softheaded – in their old age.\\" Richard Corliss appears in the 2009 documentary film For the Love of Movies: The Story of American Film Criticism, confessing that he was the film critic who, in the 1970s, coined the term \\"Paulettes\\" for the ardent followers of Pauline Kael, a label which has stuck. Despite challenging Siskel and Ebert in his Film Comment article, \\"all thumbs\\", Corliss praised Ebert in a June 23, 2007 article \\"Thumbs up for Roger Ebert.\\" Corliss later appeared in Ebert's book Awake in the Dark in discussions and debates with Ebert about film criticism where \\"all thumbs\\" was reprinted.

He began his ministry in Ireland before travelling to Melbourne, Australia where he lived until his death. He is best known for establishing a number of churches north of Melbourne and for both baptizing and administering last rites to the bushranger Ned Kelly. BiographyEarly life= Charles Adolphus O'Hea was born on the first of April 1814 in County Cork to parents James O'Hea and Elizabeth de Lacey Evans. He was the youngest child of a large family, members of which eventually went on to represent various professions. Educated in Rome he entered the Order of the Hermits of St. Augustine in Drogheda in 1844, was later ordained, and engaged himself in missionary works in Ireland. In February 1853 O'Hea arrived at Hobsons Bay, Victoria, from London on board the barque the Koh-I-Noor along with four other priests. By chance he had met the first bishop of Melbourne, James Alipius Goold, in Rome in 1852 and volunteered to travel to Australia to assist in establishing new churches in the State. Later newspapers describe him as being \\"... a man of magnificent physique and dominating personality...\\" and a man of means. He was well known for his charitable works and his wealth allowed him to achieve much more for his ministry than would be allowable with his stipend.Australia's Sporting Prelate. (newspaper article) Retrieved on April 20, 2016 from http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83045366/1903-11-11/ed-1/seq-4/ =Career= Taking over from the Rev Patrick Dunne, O'Hea was assigned as the new Pastor to a large district which extended from Brunswick to Yan Yean 30 km north of Melbourne. The area included two churches, one at Coburg and the other in Epping and he received an annual stipend of £200 with an additional £100 from the GovernmentAncestry.com.

[Electoral roll] for his work as prison chaplain. He made his base at St. Paul's church Coburg which was opened in August 1855. He served both the community of HM Prison Pentridge itself and the residents of the area from 1853 to 1882 when he was made Dean. In 1867 O'Hea called a public meeting to discuss the potential for changing the name of the local area, as \\"Pentridge\\" was seen as too evocative of the gaol.History of Moreland Fact Sheet 3 Moreland City Council information sheet on Coburg and Pascoe Vale. Accessed on 22 August 2005. As a result of this meeting, the name of the suburb was changed to Coburg. To show the esteem in which he was held a street was named after him in that suburb. During his time in Melbourne, he was responsible for the building of four churches: St. John's at Beveridge, Victoria (1862); St. Ambrose Church, Brunswick (1869); and Woodstock and Epping (1879). All four were constructed from local basalt in the Gothic architectural style. The church community at Beveridge included Ned Kelly, who lived there during his early years, and the rest of the Kelly family who lived in the town. O'Hea baptised Kelly who along with his siblings attended the parish school. In November 1880 O'Hea was also responsible for ministering to Kelly before the bushranger was hanged and was nearby when the execution took place. Fr O'Hea was described by Hugh McCrae \\"as a burly priest, developed like a Thessalonian bull, fisted like a Castor or Pollux; yet withal a learned man, a witty one, and a friend of the masses.\\" =Later life= O'Hea retired in 1882 and was given the title Monsignor around 1893 possibly for his financial support to the papal treasury. He lived in retirement in what was the Mercy Convent, Coburg, and died on 31 August 1903, aged nearly ninety. His remains were interred in the crypt for Roman Catholic priests at the chapel in Melbourne General Cemetery.

The screenplay was written by Brooks. The film was one of at least 18 film adaptations of the Russian 1928 novel The Twelve Chairs by Ilf and Petrov. Plot In the Soviet Union in 1927, Ippolit Matveyevich Vorobyaninov, an impoverished aristocrat from Imperial Russia now working as a local village bureaucrat, is summoned to the deathbed of his mother-in-law. She reveals before dying that a fortune in jewels had been hidden from the Bolsheviks by being sewn into the seat cushion of one of the twelve chairs from the family's dining room set. After hearing the dying woman's confession, the Russian Orthodox priest Father Fyodor, who had arrived to administer the last rites, decides to abandon the Church and attempt to steal the treasure for himself. Shortly afterwards in the town of Stargorod, where Vorobyaninov's former mansion is located, a homeless con- artist, Ostap Bender, meets the dispossessed nobleman and manipulates his way into a partnership in his search for the family riches. The chairs, along with all other private property, had been appropriated by the State after the Russian Revolution. Vorobyaninov and Bender set off together to locate the chairs and recover the fortune, but are stymied by a series of false leads and other trying events. They find that the chairs have been split up and sold individually. Therefore, their hunt requires a great deal of travel to track down and open up each piece of the set in order to eliminate it as a possible location of the booty. As they progress, they meet comrades from every walk of life in Soviet Russian society, transforming the film into a satirical send up of failing Communism. By posing as the official in charge of the Department of Chairs, Bender tricks Father Fyodor into a wild goose chase to recover a similar set of eleven chairs in the possession of an engineer in a remote province in Siberia. Father Fyodor makes the long journey only to be thrown out of the engineer's house. When the engineer is reassigned to a post on the Black Sea, Fyodor follows him and buys the counterfeit chairs (on the condition that the engineer and his wife never see him again). He finds that none of the chairs has the jewels. Later, he runs across Vorobyaninov and Bender after they have retrieved one chair from a circus, and while being chased by them frantically climbs with the chair straight up the side of a mountain. After finding out that this chair doesn't contain the jewels, he finds that he is unable to get down again without help. Vorobyaninov and Bender leave him to his fate. After traveling many miles and perpetrating numerous cons to pay for the lengthy enterprise, the two men return to Moscow where they discover the last chair; because the others contained no hidden treasure, this one must contain it all. It is located in a Palace of Culture, which is inconvenient due to the presence of so many witnesses. Vorobyaninov and Bender return after closing time, entering through a window Bender secretly had unlocked earlier. At the moment of discovery, Bender carefully and quietly opens the chair cushion with his knife, but their hopes are dashed as it is found to be completely empty. Vorobyaninov is stunned and angry, but Bender laughs at the absurdity of the situation. A watchman finds them, and Vorobyaninov demands to know what happened to the jewels. \\"Look around you,\\" the watchman answers, explaining that after the jewels were accidentally found, they were used to finance construction of the grand building in which they stand. Driven into a sudden rage, Vorobyaninov smashes the chair to pieces and assaults the officer whom the watchman has summoned. After admonishing him for hitting a policeman, Bender leads the way and they escape into the night. At the end of his patience, demoralized and bankrupted, Bender proposes that he and Vorobyaninov go their separate ways. In a desperate attempt to keep Bender from leaving, Vorobyaninov flings the remains of the last chair into the air, and collapses to the ground feigning an epileptic seizure; this is an act they had previously rehearsed as part of a con. Attracted by the crowd and understanding what Vorobyaninov is doing, Bender calls for the crowd's attention and begs the passers-by to give generously to this sad and stricken man. Using simple gestures without uttering a word, the two men cement their partnership in crime.

ReleaseReception= The Twelve Chairs received generally positive reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, it has a 93% approval score based on 14 reviews, with an average rating of 6.7/10. Vincent Canby of The New York Times wrote, \\"For some reason, this sort of comedy of physical insult seemed much funnier to me in the Broadway world of 'The Producers,' which is really aggressive and nasty and cheap, than in a Russia that is not too far removed from the world of Sholem Aleichem.\\"Canby, Vincent (October 29, 1970). \\"Screen: Mel Brooks on Prowlin Soviet\\".

The phrase was originally used by International Business Machines (IBM) as a term to describe the robustness of their mainframe computers.. \\"The acronym RAS (reliability, accessibility and serviceability) came into widespread acceptance at IBM as the replacement for the subset notion of recovery management.\\"\\\\- \\"The dependability [...] experienced by other System/370 users is the result of a strategy based on RAS (Reliability- Availability-Serviceability)\\" Computers designed with higher levels of RAS have many features that protect data integrity and help them stay available for long periods of time without failure This data integrity and uptime is a particular selling point for mainframes and fault-tolerant systems. Definitions While RAS originated as a hardware-oriented term, systems thinking has extended the concept of reliability-availability-serviceability to systems in general, including software. For example: * Reliability can be defined as the probability that a system will produce correct outputs up to some given time t. Reliability is enhanced by features that help to avoid, detect and repair hardware faults. A reliable system does not silently continue and deliver results that include uncorrected corrupted data. Instead, it detects and, if possible, corrects the corruption, for example: by retrying an operation for transient (soft) or intermittent errors, or else, for uncorrectable errors, isolating the fault and reporting it to higher-level recovery mechanisms (which may failover to redundant replacement hardware, etc.), or else by halting the affected program or the entire system and reporting the corruption. Reliability can be characterized in terms of mean time between failures (MTBF), with reliability = exp(-t/MTBF). * Availability means the probability that a system is operational at a given time, i.e. the amount of time a device is actually operating as the percentage of total time it should be operating. High-availability systems may report availability in terms of minutes or hours of downtime per year. Availability features allow the system to stay operational even when faults do occur. A highly available system would disable the malfunctioning portion and continue operating at a reduced capacity. In contrast, a less capable system might crash and become totally nonoperational. Availability is typically given as a percentage of the time a system is expected to be available, e.g., 99.999 percent (\\"five nines\\"). * Serviceability or maintainability is the simplicity and speed with which a system can be repaired or maintained; if the time to repair a failed system increases, then availability will decrease. Serviceability includes various methods of easily diagnosing the system when problems arise. Early detection of faults can decrease or avoid system downtime. For example, some enterprise systems can automatically call a service center (without human intervention) when the system experiences a system fault. The traditional focus has been on making the correct repairs with as little disruption to normal operations as possible. Note the distinction between reliability and availability: reliability measures the ability of a system to function correctly, including avoiding data corruption, whereas availability measures how often the system is available for use, even though it may not be functioning correctly. For example, a server may run forever and so have ideal availability, but may be unreliable, with frequent data corruption. Failure types Physical faults can be temporary or permanent. * Permanent faults lead to a continuing error and are typically due to some physical failure such as metal electromigration or dielectric breakdown. * Temporary faults include transient and intermittent faults. ** Transient (a.k.a. soft) faults lead to independent one-time errors and are not due to permanent hardware faults: examples include alpha particles flipping a memory bit, electromagnetic noise, or power-supply fluctuations. ** Intermittent faults occur due to a weak system component, e.g. circuit parameters degrading, leading to errors that are likely to recur. Failure responses Transient and intermittent faults can typically be handled by detection and correction by e.g., ECC codes or instruction replay (see below). Permanent faults will lead to uncorrectable errors which can be handled by replacement by duplicate hardware, e.g., processor sparing, or by the passing of the uncorrectable error to high level recovery mechanisms. A successfully corrected intermittent fault can also be reported to the operating system (OS) to provide information for predictive failure analysis. Hardware features Example hardware features for improving RAS include the following, listed by subsystem: *Processor: ** Processor instruction error detection (e.g. residue checking of results) with instruction retry e.g. alternative processor recovery in IBM mainframes, or \\"Instruction replay technology\\" in Itanium systems. ** Processors running in lock-step to perform master-checker or voting schemes. ** Machine check architecture to report errors to the OS. *Memory: ** Parity or ECC (including single device correction) protection of memory components (cache and system memory), and memory bus; bad cache line disabling; memory scrubbing; memory sparing; bad page offlining; redundant bit steering; redundant array of independent memory (RAIM). *I/O: ** Cyclic redundancy check checksums for data transmission/retry and data storage, e.g. PCI Express (PCIe) Advanced Error Reporting, redundant I/O paths. *Storage: ** RAID configurations for magnetic disk storage. ** Journaling file systems for file repair after crashes. ** Checksums on both data and metadata, and background scrubbing. *Power/cooling: ** Duplicating components to avoid single points of failure, e.g., power- supplies. ** Over-designing the system for the specified operating ranges of clock frequency, temperature, voltage, vibration. ** Temperature sensors to throttle operating frequency when temperature goes out of specification. ** Surge protector, uninterruptible power supply, auxiliary power. *System: ** Hot swapping of components: processors, memories ** Predictive failure analysis to predict which intermittent correctable errors will lead eventually to hard non-correctable errors. ** Partitioning/domaining of computer components to allow one large system to act as several smaller systems. ** Virtual machines to decrease the severity of operating system software faults. ** Redundant I/O domains or I/O partitions for providing virtual I/O to guest virtual machines. ** Computer clustering capability with failover capability, for complete redundancy of hardware and software. ** Dynamic software updating to avoid the need to reboot the system for a kernel software update, for example Ksplice under Linux. ** Independent service processor for serviceability: remote monitoring, alerting and control. Fault-tolerant designs extended the idea by making RAS to be the defining feature of their computers for applications like stock market exchanges or air traffic control, where system crashes would be catastrophic. Fault-tolerant computers (e.g., see Tandem Computers and Stratus Technologies), which tend to have duplicate components running in lock-step for reliability, have become less popular, due to their high cost. High availability systems, using distributed computing techniques like computer clusters, are often used as cheaper alternatives.

The band was founded in 1995 by brothers Allen and Jay Karpinski (playing guitar and drums, respectively), who had earlier played with Old Hearts Club, a band of similar style including vocals. In 1998, Tim Gerak was added to the core member line-up, playing guitar and also credited with additional engineering on the band's later recordings. Most of the group's music is instrumental, featuring multiple \\"clean\\" (undistorted) electric guitars, with electric bass and drums, as well as electric lap steel guitar, viola, and occasionally piano, vibraphone, or trumpet. Rather than relying primarily on strummed chords, songs are generally built by combining single- note melodic lines. The band has been through a plethora of line-up changes, and minor positions in the band have proved to be a revolving chair, while retaining the core force of the Karpinski brothers and Tim Gerak. Former vibraphonist Eric Koltnow left the band after the release of Everywhere and Right Here, as well as former lap steel player Ben Vaughan after the birth of his first child. Minor positions, such as the newly-added trumpet, have been filled by members of other bands from the Akron, Ohio area. The Six Parts Seven's name is based on a quote from Virginia Governor William Berkeley in 1676, \\"How miserable that man is that governs a people where six parts of seven at least are poor, indebted, discontented and armed.\\" A recent interview with another band member claims the name derives from a childhood game between brothers Jay and Allen. Although its name is similar, The Six Parts Seven should not be confused with the British band Six by Seven. The group has toured the United States several times and performed in March 2006 at the South by Southwest festival in Austin, Texas. Since the early 21st century its music has been used frequently by National Public Radio's All Things Considered news program as transition music. Group leader Allen Karpinski was interviewed about the group's music on the same program in September 2004.

Possible causes include cerebral ischemia, extreme hypoxia (inadequate oxygen supply to tissue) or even anoxia (total depletion of oxygen). Agonal breathing is an extremely serious medical sign requiring immediate medical attention, as the condition generally progresses to complete apnea and heralds death. The duration of agonal respiration can be as brief as two breaths or last up to several hours. The term is sometimes (inaccurately) used to refer to labored, gasping breathing patterns accompanying organ failure (e.g. liver failure and kidney failure), SIRS, septic shock, and metabolic acidosis (see Kussmaul breathing, or in general any labored breathing, including Biot's respirations and ataxic respirations). Correct usage would restrict the term to the last breaths before death. Agonal respirations are also commonly seen in cases of cardiogenic shock or cardiac arrest where agonal respirations may persist for several minutes after cessation of heartbeat. The presence of agonal respirations in these cases indicates a more favorable prognosis than in cases of cardiac arrest without agonal respirations. In an unresponsive, pulseless patient in cardiac arrest, agonal gasps are not effective breaths. Agonal respiration occurs in 40% of cardiac arrests experienced outside a hospital environment.

From the 18th to the 20th century, its rulers were of the Al-Sallami family who with, Al-Abdali, Al-Ramada, Al-Sindi and al-Aqrabi, claims relation to Ahl al-Bayt (the family of Muhammad). Lahij was the capital city of Sultanate of Lahej, a protectorate of the British Empire until 1967, when the sultan was expelled and the city became a part of People's Republic of South Yemen. History Lahij has always historically been identified as Aden's base city. Since Aden was a port city, not many Yemenis lived there, rather it was used by many foriengers as well for its location. Lahij has always been one of the very fertile parts of Yemen and was nicknamed \\"Lahej Al Khathra\\", which translates to Lahej the green. This means it stood out from the rest of South Yemen which was known to be desert. In 1728 Abdulraheem Al-Sallami (member of the Al-Sallami family who migrated from Sana'a) established the Sultanate of Lahij and started his own last name after his own name. Abdulraheem was shorten to Abdali. This was also to make the distinction between Al-Sallami and Abdali, since not all Al-Sallamis are Abdalis and therefore not all Al-Sallamis were considered royalty, although they enjoyed and maintain amongst the highest tribal respect. The Sultanate of Lahej remained under Al-Sallami/Abdali control until the Cold War. While the 3rd world was beginning to be recolonized economically, the Sultanate collapsed in 1967 after the British withdrew from Aden leaving The Abdalis and Al-Sallamis to fight the Russian-backed communist movement. From the late 1960s until the unification of Yemen in 1990 South Yemen was under communist rule, massive amounts of lands were taken from tribes and redistributed amongst the entire population. When Ali Abdulla Saleh assumed the presidency of the new united Yemen in 1990 he returned all the land back to their rightful owners. Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula captured Lahij in early February 2016, but the government recaptured later on April.http://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2016/02/al-qaeda-seizes-more- territory-in-southern-yemen.php Economy Historically, Lahij has produced coconuts.

His work is commonly associated with the study of subcultures, and its resistance against the mainstream of society. His current research interests include media topographies, desert studies, and performative criticism. Hebdige has written extensively on contemporary art, design, media and cultural studies, on mod style, reggae, postmodernism and style, surrealism, improvisation, and Takashi Murakami. He has published three books: Subculture: The Meaning of Style (1979), Cut’n’mix: Culture, Identity and Caribbean Music (1987), and Hiding in the Light: On images and Things (1988). From 1974 to 2016, he published over 57 essays and articles. Early life and education Hebdige received his Master of Arts (MA) degree from the Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies in Birmingham, United Kingdom,http://www.filmandmedia.ucsb.edu/people/faculty/hebdige/hebdige.html and an honorary degree from Goldsmiths, University of London (formerly known as Goldsmiths' College).http://www.gold.ac.uk/honorary-graduates/g-n/ Professional career Hebdige has been teaching at art schools since the mid-1970s. Since 1992, Hebdige has been working on arts administration, events planning, program development, and curriculum innovation first at CalArts (2001-2008), then at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) as director of the Interdisciplinary Humanities Center from 2005 and as co- director of the University of California Institute for Research in the Arts (UCIRA). He served as the dean of critical studies and the director of the experimental writing program at the California Institute of the Arts before going to UCSB, where he is currently professor of film and media studies and art. In the UCSB art department, he is professor of \\"interdisciplinary/experimental Studies, (50% art, 50% film and media studies).\\" Hebdige is also a scholar in residence at the University of Houston where he has given multimedia lectures and performance series with the Cynthia Woods Mitchell Center for the Arts. In partnership with the Future Art Research Institute in Phoenix, Arizona, Hebdige launched UCIRA’s Desert Studies Project in 2009. The program, now run from UCSB, is \\"a pilot program in interdisciplinary arts-centered research, immersion pedagogy, and process curating,\\" aiming to \\"integrate arts-based research and the production, performance and exhibition of artworks into Desert Studies.\\"https://muse.jhu.edu/article/565575/pdf The project invites students, faculty, and the public to make art that is \\"immersive\\" in the desert in multiple ways. Major publications Hebdige's 1979 book Subculture: The Meaning of Style was written between 1977 and 1978 amid the unfolding of punk in the United Kingdom. Hebdige, in his mid-twenties at the time, had just graduated with a Master of Arts degree from Birmingham University’s Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies (CCCS). At this time, the domain of cultural studies was just emerging. Subculture was commissioned by University of Cardiff English professor and editor, Terence Hawkes, as part of a series published by Methuen called New Accents (aimed at introducing theoretical and interpretive approaches to English literature students). The commission was an opportunity for Hebdige to continue graduate work on developing a contextual, culturalist model of youth culture and consumption. Specifically, linking the concerns of youth culture, consumption, and the politics of insubordination to debates within aesthetics, semiotics, and poststructuralism. Hebdige states that “the aspiration was to blur the line between specialized, discipline- embedded academic and intellectually curious subcultural, non-academic readerships.” The book serves as a mirror of bricolage subculture, with “do- it-yourself bricolaged theory for do-it-yourself bricolaged subculture.” Whereas previous research was concerned with the relation between subcultures and social class in postwar Britain, Hebdige saw youth cultures in terms of a dialogue between black and white youth. He argues that punk emerged as a mainly white style when black youth became more separatist in the 1970s in response to discrimination in British society. Previous research described a homology between the different aspects of a subcultural style (dress, hairstyle, music, drugs), while Hebdige argues that punk in London in 1976-77 borrowed from all previous subcultures and its only homology was chaos. In making this argument, he draws on the early work of Julia Kristeva who also found such subversion of meaning in French poets such as Mallarmé and Lautréamont. Hebdige’s 1987 book Cut’n’Mix: Culture, Identity and Caribbean Music focuses on the music of the Caribbean including calypso, ska, reggae, and Caribbean club culture. Cut’n’Mix traces the roots of this music and describes the style and cultural identity that have developed alongside it. Specifically, the book addresses the African and Caribbean roots of the music in relation to religion and the myth and importance of rhythm, the music of Trinidad, the story of reggae, the musical and spiritual inheritance of Rastafari, the Jamaican record industry, and the scene of black British reggae, white Jamaican music, Two Tone, and the legacy of punk. Hebdige’s 1988 book Hiding in the Light: On Images and Things is a collection of essays examining the creation and consumption of objects and images, including fashion and documentary photographs, 1950s streamlined cars, Italian motor scooters, 1980s style manuals, Biff cartoons, the Band Aid campaign, pop art, and pop music videos. Hebdige considers their cultural significance and impact on popular taste within the framework of modernity, postmodernity, and popular culture: “The wider questions raised in these debates are addressed throughout this book, but the stress falls on the ‘thing itself’ – and the author concludes that it is only by grounding our analysis in the study of particular images and objects that we can counteract the limitations of semiotics, mass culture theory and the vertigo of postmodernism.” Thought In interviews, Hebdige often challenges typical expectations and depictions of his role in academia. He has also spoken out about the division between his work as a writer and his job as a professor and lecturer, saying: “I tend to separate my writing – most of it for the last twenty years for art catalogs – from the teaching and other University work so that the conventional research component of what I do is in effect detached from my daily life in the academy. For instance I’ve never taught a class on youth subculture though as an academic I’m identified almost exclusively with that topic because of a book I wrote more than 30 years ago.”\\"What Counts with Hibbert-Jones (UCSC) and Hebdige (UCSB)\\".

RTL 7 is a so-called men's channel with action films, reality television about crime and professions, soccer, motorsport and talk shows about sports. During daytime business and financial news channel RTL Z was broadcasting on RTL 7 till RTL Nederland revamped RTL Z into a 24-hours channel on 7 September 2015. Officially RTL 7 -along with RTL 4, RTL 5 and RTL 8- is headquartered in Hilversum, broadcasting under a Luxembourg TV license. This allows them to avoid more severe control by the Dutch media authorities as Luxembourg's television watchdog is less strict. Yorin used to be licensed in the Netherlands, but moved to Luxembourg after the RTL 7 rebrand. HistoryVeronica (1995-2001)= The channel began as Veronica on 1 September 1995, and was a joint venture between RTL 4, RTL 5 and Veronica Association (in Dutch: Vereniging Veronica), and with the radio station Hitradio Veronica in the Holland Media Groep. The Veronica Organisation had been a public broadcasting association since 1 January 1976 but left the Dutch Public Broadcasting system in 1995 and started a commercial channel. In the first year it broadcasts a lot of American TV series, such as Beverly Hills, 90210, Melrose Place and Baywatch, films, Dutch programmes ranging from game shows to talk shows and Dutch TV series, such as Flodder and Onderweg naar Morgen. By the end of its first year Veronica dropped the news-related programmes and established its place in the Dutch television market as a young adult channel with programmes of a provocative nature. In the next years Veronica proved to be a pioneer in television making by introducing a wide range of reality shows with a real breakthrough when it launched the reality game show Big Brother in 1999. In 2000 Veronica announced it would leave the joint venture and wanted to start a channel of its own. Eventually, Veronica Association closed a deal with SBS in 2003. =Yorin (2001-2005)= RTL 7's old logo as Yorin RTL had to change the name of the station. At first RTL came up with ME but a fashion label in the Netherlands WE complained about the similarity with its name. Finally RTL rebranded Veronica to Yorin on 2 April 2001. Yorin referred to the English phrase \\"You're in\\". The Dutch version of The Price is Right, Cash en Carlo, referenced this fact when announcer Eddy Keur told contestants \\"Yorin the game!\\" when they came on down to Contestant's Row. All programmes previously on Veronica and also the television presenters moved to Yorin. RTL didn't want to add RTL into the name so the channel would keep its own identity. In the auctioning off of FM radio frequencies called ZeroBase, Holland Media Group acquired a lot allowing them to broadcast a popular music station virtually nationwide; this station was called Yorin FM with its most notable DJs being Rob Stenders, Robert Jensen and Henk Westbroek. In 2006, due to disappointing results, Holland Media Group sold the station to SBS Broadcasting, who rebranded it Caz! and changed the programming to a fully middle-of-the-road all-music formula. =RTL 7 (2005-)= logo from 2010-2017 When Dutch media tycoon and Big Brother-inventor John de Mol announced the launch of a TV channel named Talpa, and contracted many popular Dutch TV hosts, the RTL Group felt the need to reorganize its channels. Apart from a physical renewal, the setup of its channels RTL 4, RTL 5 and Yorin were changed. To emphasize the three channels' connection, the name Yorin was replaced by RTL 7 on 12 August 2005. Practically all former Yorin shows were moved to RTL 5, whereas that RTL 5's programmes continued on RTL 7. RTL Z also moved from RTL 5 to RTL 7. The origin of the number 7, instead of a more logical 6, goes back to 1995 when the original channel Veronica was founded. Around the same time, the commercial channels SBS 6 and TMF appeared and also claimed channel 6 on the remote control. Veronica and TMF lost the battle for remote control button 6. Also, SBS 6 was originally managed by Fons van Westerloo, who later became head of RTL Nederland before the rebranding operation. On 15 October 2009 RTL Nederland started simulcasting their RTL 7 and RTL 8 channels in 1080i high-definition. Programming RTL 7 broadcasts a large number of sports programmes such as football, darts and motorsports, but in which motorsports is their main broadcast item. This include live coverage of Formula One and the MotoGP as the most notable. But also the A1 Grand Prix, Dakar Rally, 24 Hours of Le Mans and the Indianapolis 500 are broadcast live on RTL 7. Movies, series and entertainment programmings also broadcast on this channel. =Imported= *The A-Team *The Blacklist *Bakugan: Battle Planet *Beyblade Burst *Blazing Team: Masters of Yo Kwon Do *Hardcore Pawn *Inazuma Eleven *Les Dalton *Married... with Children *Mr. Bean *Ninjago *Oggy and the Cockroaches *Pawn Stars *Pokémon *Power Rangers Beast Morphers *Resident Advisors Teletext RTL 7 offered a teletext service which stopped on 1 April 2017.

In 1998, Grand Valley took control of WGVS 850 in Muskegon and converted it into a simulcast of WGVU. Formerly the station broadcast in AM stereo for years before converting to the newer HD Radio format; WTKG is the only other AM station in the area with an HD signal. On August 27, 2009, WGVU and WGVS flipped to the oldies format—a first for a public radio station. The station's playlist encompasses hits from the mid-1950s through the mid-1970s and features many seldom-heard songs not typically played on commercial oldies stations, including some titles by local Michigan artists. Big band, traditional pop, and easy listening songs from the 1940s through the '70s are featured on Sunday mornings during the Sunday Morning Standards program. Also airing on Sundays is the West Michigan Top 40 show, which counts down the songs on a historic local record chart from a given date. Victor Lundberg, a newscaster at WMAX 1480, had a Top 10 hit on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1967 with a spoken- word piece titled \\"An Open Letter to My Teenage Son.\\" The WMAX calls were originally granted for a station in Ann Arbor in 1922, and now belong to a Catholic-formatted AM station in Bay City, Michigan (in addition, 96.1 FM licensed to Holland, Michigan and serving the Grand Rapids market operates as WMAX-FM, but it has no relationship to 1480 AM). The WGVU 1480 AM towers are located at Kalamazoo Avenue and M-6.

Owned by Grand Valley State University, it is simulcast in West Michigan. The main broadcast frequency is 88.5 MHz, which is licensed to Allendale, the Grand Rapids suburb that is home to Grand Valley State's main campus. It is simulcast on WGVS-FM 95.3 MHz, which is licensed to Whitehall and serves Muskegon. The format is Talk radio from NPR, along with jazz. They are sister stations to WGVU-AM and WGVS-AM (which feature an oldies format). WGVU-FM began broadcasting on July 17, 1983 as WGVC-FM to reflect the school which was known at that time as Grand Valley State College. The station had originally operated (1974-1982) as student-run WSRX, with an alternative rock format. 95.3 FM in Whitehall began as Top 40 station WLRQ (\\"Super Q\\") in the late 1970s. In the mid-1980s, the station bore the WRNF (\\"We're Rock Ninety Five\\") calls while continuing with a Top 40 format. By the mid-1990s, 95.3 FM had the WKBZ-FM calls and was airing an urban contemporary format as \\"Power 95.3.\\" Station owners Robert Jewell and Daniel Thill donated WKBZ-AM 850 and WKBZ-FM 95.3 to Grand Valley in 1995, but the following year the stations were sold to WLC Broadcasting, and it was not until November 1998 that WLC returned the stations to Grand Valley and the university began using them as simulcasts of WGVU-AM/FM. WGVU-FM 88.5 broadcasts in HD Radio and operates two side channels. WGVU-HD2 is a simulcast of \\"Real Oldies\\" 1480 WGVU-AM/850 WGVS, and WGVU-HD3 is all jazz. Additionally the station's audio simulcasts on the digital subchannels of WGVU/WGVK-TV on channel 35.4/52.4 via the secondary audio program of that station (WGVU/WGVS is on the main audio channel), which features scrolling television schedules along with visual song/artist information for the radio audio. WGVU-FM was the 2011 Michigan Association of Broadcasters Public Radio Station of the year among stations with a $2 million plus budget. This ended the winning streak of Michigan Radio, with which WGVU- FM competes.

Background Massey was born January 7, 1973, in Ellis County, Texas. He was neglected and abused by his alcoholic father and his drug-addicted mother. By his teens, he was a juvenile delinquent with a lengthy criminal record, mostly for torturing animals and stalking. His mother once committed him to a psychiatric hospital after discovering his journals, in which he detailed his fantasies about rape and murder, his hero worship of Charles Manson, his avowed Satanism, and his strong desire to become a serial killer. Massey was known to decapitate and mutilate dogs, cats, and cows, preserving their skulls in coolers as trophies. Crime On Monday, July 26, 1993, he viciously murdered two teenagers: 14-year-old Brian King and his 13-year-old stepsister, Christina Benjamin, in his hometown. Christina's death had been particularly gruesome; her head, hands and nipples had been cut off, her genitals mutilated, and her intestines removed. King had been shot twice in the head. Massey was quickly connected to the crime by forensic evidence and arrested, shortly after getting out of jail for animal cruelty. In October of the following year, he was found guilty of the murders and sentenced to death. While on death row, he reportedly converted to Christianity. He was executed by lethal injection on April 3, 2001. Before his execution, he confessed his crime to the murdered teenagers' family. His crime was documented on an episode of the TV series Forensic Files called \\"Pure Evil\\".

Early life Prichard was born in Levuka, Fiji in 1883 to Australian parents, and spent her childhood in Launceston, Tasmania, before moving to Melbourne, where she won a scholarship to South Melbourne College. Her father, Tom Prichard, was editor of the Melbourne Sun newspaper. She worked as a governess and journalist in Victoria then travelled to England in 1908. Her first novel, The Pioneers (1915), won the Hodder & Stoughton All Empire Literature Prize.Throssel, Ric \\"Katharine Susannah Prichard 1883–1969\\", The Katharine Susannah Prichard Writers Centre (website) After her return to Australia, the romance Windlestraws and her first novel of a mining community, Black Opal, were published. Political life and marriage Prichard moved with her husband, war hero Hugo \\"Jim\\" Throssell, VC, to Greenmount, Western Australia, in 1920 and lived at 11 Old York Road for much of the rest of her life. She wrote most of her novels and stories in a self-contained weatherboard workroom near the house. In her personal life she always referred to herself as Mrs Hugo Throssell. Her friends called her Kattie. They had one son, Ric Throssell, later a diplomat and writer. Prichard was a founding member of the Communist Party of Australia in 1921 and remained a member for the rest of her life. She worked to organise unemployed workers and founded left-wing women's groups, and during the 1930s she campaigned in support of the Spanish Republic and other left-wing causes. Although she had frequent arguments with other Communist writers such as Frank Hardy and Judah Waten over the correct application of the doctrine of socialist realism to Australian fiction, she remained supportive of the Soviet Union and its cultural policies when many other intellectuals, such as Eric Lambert and Stephen Murray-Smith, left the party during the 1950s. Her public position as both a communist and a female writer saw her harassed by West Australian police and the federal government throughout her life. The official surveillance files which were opened on Prichard in 1919 were not closed until her death in 1969. Prichard's commitment to her politics and her position as a woman in the public sphere also saw her socially isolated by the conservative social groups which dominated Perth in this period. She was the subject of constant rumours and frequent anonymous tip offs to Western Australian police of any communist activity. She was also part of a new community of free thinking public intellectuals who, amongst other things, challenged notions of acceptable sexuality. Her two major novels, which were to give her national and international prominence, were written in Western Australia in the early years of her marriage. The novels were Working Bullocks (1926) which dramatised the physical and emotional traumas of timber workers in the karri country of Australia's south-west, and Coonardoo (1929), a novel which became notorious for its candid portrayal of relationships between white men and black women in the north-west. The far north-west of Australia provided inspiration and setting for her daring play Brumby Innes. Most of the short stories in the first of her four collections, Kiss on the Lips (1932), were also from the 1920s, her decade of creative activity. During this time she wrote her most adventurous novels, stories and plays. Death of husband While she was visiting the Soviet Union in 1933, her husband Jim Throssell committed suicide when his business failed during the Great Depression. In 1934 her membership of the Communist Party of Australia and the Movement Against War and Fascism led her to lead the Egon Kisch welcome committee, which rapidly metamorphosed into the committee to defend Kisch from exclusion from Australia. The novel Intimate Strangers (1937) was a turning point in her life. The 'fire of a regenerating idea' referred to in the novel's revised conclusion was reflected in the author's life; as pamphleteer and public speaker, Katharine Prichard fearlessly and emotionally promoted the cause of peace and social justice. Goldfields trilogy Her extended work The Goldfields Trilogy—The Roaring Nineties (1946), Golden Miles (1948), and Winged Seeds (1950) is a considerable reconstruction of social and personal histories in Western Australia's goldfields from the 1890s to 1946. Her autobiography Subtle Flame published a few years before her death exhibited the complex legacy she left behind – a review of her autiobiography, and a biography by Henrietta Drake- Brockman Prichard died at her home in Greenmount in 1969. Her ashes were scattered on the surrounding hills. Like her husband, her son Ric Throssell committed suicide, when his wife Dodie died in 1999. He had fought for many years to clear his name after being accused of passing classified information to his mother, or actively spying for the Soviet Union. His 1989 book covering this was called My Father's Son. The centenary of her birth was celebrated by UWA academics in a collection of essays Legacy Katharine Prichard Writers' Centre, Greenmount The home has now become the Katharine Susannah Prichard Writers' Centre, a foundation promoting humanitarianism, the study of Katharine Susannah Prichard, and encouraging writing in Western Australia, where Prichard spent the majority of her life.\\"Objectives\\".

Written by Jim Kouf and directed by James A. Contner, it was originally broadcast on April 25, 2000 on the WB network. In \\"Five by Five\\", guest star Eliza Dushku makes her first appearance on Angel as rogue Slayer Faith, hired by Wolfram & Hart to assassinate Angel in exchange for getting all criminal charges against her from her crimes committed back in Sunnydale dropped. Though Faith agrees, it becomes clear to Angel that she has plans of her own. The episode draws parallels between the flashbacks of Angel towards the part of his life that he felt the first guilt for his actions and Faith at the present time. Plot A young human gangster finds several demons have murdered his friends. Shocked, the man runs away and the demons chase after him. Angel beheads the demons and rescues the man who turns out to be a key witness needed to testify in court. Faith, the second Slayer, gets off a bus in L.A. then robs a man of his coat, money, and keys. In 1898 Borsa, Romania, Darla leads a blindfolded Angelus to a young gypsy woman bound on the floor. With Darla watching, he morphs and bites her inner thigh. In the present day, Angel attempts to convince the gang member he saved to testify. At a club, Faith dances and parties with various men. A fight breaks out when Faith begins flirting with another girl's boyfriend. She continues her dancing, knocking down anyone that tries to stop her or get in her way. In a courtroom, Wolfram & Hart is just about to close a case, but Angel shows up at the last minute with the gang member who is to testify against their client. Lilah Morgan and Lindsey McDonald, two lawyers from Wolfram & Hart, hire Faith to assassinate Angel. Back in 1898, Darla returns to the house to find her Angelus emotional and remorseful. He's been cursed with a soul, and she angrily rejects him because of it. In the present day, Faith works out a deal with the lawyers, and viciously beating one of them that dares to challenge her. While they're waiting for lunch with a prospective client, Faith shows up behind Angel and tries to shoot him with a crossbow. Angel catches the bolt and Faith runs off. After checking with Giles in Sunnydale, Angel plans to go after Faith while Wesley and Cordelia are to lay low. That night, he checks out weapons, when he senses Faith's presence up in the office. She gives him the opportunity to shoot her, and he tries to kneecap her, but the bullet is a blank. After she explains her plans to torture and kill him, she shoots him with a real bullet and leaves. Angel poses as a lawyer at Wolfram & Hart and sneaks into the office of Lindsey McDonald. Lindsey arrives in the office and informs Angel that their high-tech security system has documented Angel's every move on tape. Cordelia and Wesley try to get into Cordelia's apartment, but Dennis won't let them in at first, because, unbeknownst to Cordelia, Faith is inside waiting for them. They encounter Faith in the apartment who refuses to listen to their attempts to deescalate the situation and Faith knocks out Cordelia. Wesley punches Faith in return, and Faith ends the fight by kicking Wesley across the room. Back in 1898, a newly souled Angelus tries to find a meal on the streets. He knocks out several men and then tries to drink from the woman they were with. His soul keeps him from killing her. Angel finds Cordelia at her apartment, with Wesley missing. Faith ties him up and tortures him. Angel and Cordelia try to locate Faith. Angel charges into the apartment, stopping Faith from continuing to torture Wesley. A fight breaks out between Angel and Faith, destroying the apartment. Angel hurls himself and Faith out the window, and they land on the alleyway below, Faith initially keeping the upper hand on Angel. The rain starts to pour down outside as Wesley breaks loose and goes downstairs armed with a knife. With Wesley watching on, Faith seems to tire but Angel no longer defends himself or tries to hurt her. Angel tells Faith he won't \\"make it easy for her\\". Faith suddenly breaks down, declaring that she is evil, and begs for Angel to kill her. He refuses, and Faith stops fighting and cries in Angel's arms. Wesley looks on and drops the knife. Acting Christian Kane returns as Lindsey in his first appearance since the pilot episode. \\"There's a lot of sexual tension between Lindsey and Lilah, and Stephanie being one of my really good friends in life, it really did kind of feel like it was us against the world,\\" Kane says. \\"Everyone else was a series regular and we were fighting for a pole position and although we were against each other we were on the same team... I think that came off on screen.\\" Production Producer Tim Minear says because writer Jim Kouf was used to writing scripts for \\"big feature films\\", he occasionally \\"writes scenes that are not producible for a TV show because he is used to working with much more money.\\" Kouf indicated that it should be raining during the final fight scene between Angel and Faith, but Minear decided the rain was too expensive, the \\"one extra technical complication that’s going to make shooting impossible.\\" However, the night filming began for that scene was \\"the first night of a big torrential rain storm that we had for several days,\\" Minear says. Mike Massa, David Boreanaz's stunt double, explains that ratchets - wires that retract at high speeds - were used during Angel and Faith's fight scene to hurl the characters across the room.

Forming the centre of Omonoia. It marks the northern corner of the downtown area defined by the city plans of the 19th century, and is one of the city's principal traffic hubs. It is served by Omonoia train station. Omonoia Square is one of the oldest squares in the city of Athens and an important shopping centre. It is located at the center of the city at the intersection of six main streets: Panepistimiou, Stadiou, Athinas, Peiraios, Agiou Konstantinou Street and 3rd Septemvriou Street.  Name  The Square was constructed in 1846 and its original name was \\"Plateia Anaktoron\\" (Palace Square) because, according to the initial urban plan of Athens in 1834(1833;) proposed by the architects Stamatios Kleanthis and Eduard Schaubert, the area was intended to be used for the construction of the palace (anaktora). Later, the square was renamed \\"Othonos Square\\" in honor of King Otto. After Otto was deposed, in 1862 it took its final name, \\"Omonoia Square\\", because it was here that the leaders of the opposing political factions gave the oath of peace (omonia) to stop hostilities.  History of design changes The square as seen from above during the 1930s. The square in June 2016 with the design initially introduced in 2004. The fountain of Omonoia square as seen after the 2020 restoration. At the end of the 19th century the Square underwent several formative changes. Trees were placed throughout the Square, a polygonal platform was placed at the center of the square and lighting systems were installed. Omonoia Square was a center where people met and social life thrived as it was the railway's starting point, and was also surrounded by numerous hotels. From 1925 to 1930 the underground railway between Piraeus and Athens was built requiring further redesign of the Square. Omonoia Square became circular and marble bars are put at the entrances of the underground railway station. The Square started to resemble European prototypes and acquired an important commercial role. Due to the existence of the underground railway it was necessary to create also an underground ventilation system and in 1931 Mayor of Athens Spiros Merkouris suggested placing eight sculptures representing the mythological Muses to cover the openings of the ventilation vents. Although the problem was solved, the result did not satisfy Athenians’ aesthetic expectations and the statues were removed. The 50s were a period of modernization for Athens and consequently for many public spaces. In 1954, in the underground area of Omonoia Square banks, shops and a post office were built. In 1958 the Ministry of Transportation and Public Works held a competition for the development of Omonoia Square. Sculptor George Zongolopoulos and architect Kostas Bitsios were awarded the project. Their proposal included a circular water system in the middle of which would be placed Zongolopoulos’ sculpture \\"Poseidon\\". The square was redesigned although in the end without the placement of the sculpture. Eventually, the sculpture was installed permanently in 2014 outside the Milken School of Public Health at The George Washington University, Washington D.C. in the United States. The fountain of Omonia became a famous city landmark and the Square itself was depicted many times in Greek movies of the period. On November 1992 the fountain along with the sculpture \\"Runner\\" was destroyed in order to excavate the area for the construction of the new Athens Metro station of red line and the new station. On May 1994 a new \\"Runner\\" was constructed and transferred into its current location, across Hilton Hotel of Athens. From mid-2019 to February 2020, the square underwent yet another major reconstruction, which became necessary after previous aesthetic and urban changes had eventually led to the degradation of this central and historical area of Athens. With public and private funding, the municipality of Athens restored the historical fountain from 1958 and replaced all pave way materials with thermoneutral materials that reduce the thermal footprint of the entire square. Beneath the square lies the Omonia metro station, a major transport hub with passenger traffic equal to that of the Syntagma metro station. Celebrations Sporting celebrations have recently been held here, including following Greece's victory in the EuroBasket 2005 finals and in winning the championship. Other sporting successes, such as the Euro 2004 tournament, when people climbed the 'Five-ring' sculpture to celebrate with national flags, have also tended to be celebrated here. Architecture After its transformation in 2003 the square lost some of its former value and prestige, but nevertheless continues to represent a multicultural place and point of communication, as a transportation hub for thousands throughout the day. Two of its most recognizable buildings are the old neoclassical hotels of the area; the \\"Bagkeion\\" and \\"Megas Alexandros\\", located side by side on either side of Athinas street. The Pentakiklon ('Five- ring' sculpture) has its own story; placed in the square in 2001, it never functioned fully as initially conceived by the architect, as it was meant to be a motion sculpture when water run in it. During the Christmas of 2008, when water ran in the sculpture for the first time, it transformed the circles into motion. After that, more years passed with the piece falling back into neglect, until it was refurbished once more and permanently restored to its initial concept of a motion sculpture, during the 2020 restoration of the whole square. At the same time the famous round fountain, which acted as a landmark for decades, was redesigned and re-installed. Gallery File:Two of the most recognizable buildings in Omonoia Square.

The Monopolies and Mergers Commission was concerned that the market concentration of the big six brewers at 75% represented a monopoly situation. The Supply of Beer (Tied Estate) order of 1989 (better known as the \\"Beer Orders\\") allowed publicans freedom to buy non-beer drinks from any source (not just the controlling brewery) and to sell at least one draught beer from a different brewery. In addition to this, many of the larger brewers were forced to sell many of their pubs off, with the intention that they would become free houses or pass on to smaller brewers, hence increasing choice and free trade. The unintended consequence of this legislation was that the brewers sold off their less profitable pubs. However, following a Government review in 2000, the Beer Orders were revoked by early 2003.Revocations of Monopolies and Restrictive Practices Orders - BERR References Category:Pubs in the United Kingdom ","title":"Guest beer"},{"id":"2480827","text":"Crețulescu Palace (Palatul Crețulescu in Romanian, alternative spelling \\"Kretzulescu\\") is a historic building near the Cișmigiu Gardens on the Știrbei Vodă street nr. 39 in Bucharest, Romania.

Loosely based on the novel of the same name by Tom Savage, the film follows a group of women in San Francisco who are stalked by a killer wearing a Cupid mask. Released theatrically in February 2001, the film was critically panned, with critics deeming it too similar to 1980s slasher films. The film earned $36.7 million on a $10 million budget. Plot At a junior high school St. Valentine's Day dance in 1988 San Francisco, Jeremy Melton, an outcast student, asks four popular girls to dance. The first three girls, Shelley, Lily, and Paige reject him spitefully, while the fourth girl, Kate, politely responds \\"maybe later\\". Their overweight friend Dorothy accepts Jeremy's invitation and they proceed to secretly make out underneath the bleachers. When the school bully Joe Tulga and his friends discover them, Dorothy claims that Jeremy sexually assaulted her. Joe and his friends publicly strip and severely beat Jeremy, and his nose starts bleeding under the distress. It is later revealed Jeremy was expelled and eventually transferred to a reform school. Thirteen years later, in 2001, Shelley, now a medical student at UCLA, is at the morgue one evening studying for her medical exam. After receiving a vulgar Valentine's card in her locker, she is attacked by a man in a trench coat and Cupid mask. She is cornered in a cooler used to store cadavers, where she attempts to hide in a body bag, but the killer finds her before slitting her throat. The killer's nose bleeds as she dies. At Shelley's funeral, Kate, Lily, Paige, and Dorothy are questioned. They admit to not having seen her in some time after she moved from San Francisco to Los Angeles. Kate, Paige, and Dorothy subsequently receive obscene cards, each signed \\"JM.\\" Lily also receives a card with a box of chocolates which she finds are filled with maggots. Meanwhile, Dorothy's boyfriend, Campbell, loses his apartment and temporarily moves in with her at her father's large mansion. As the girls attend the exhibit of Lily's artist boyfriend Max, they meet Campbell's bitter ex-girlfriend Ruthie, who accuses him of being a con artist. Lily becomes lost at the exhibit and the killer appears, who proceeds to shoot her repeatedly with arrows until she falls several floors into a dumpster. When they have not heard from Lily, the others assume she is in Los Angeles on a work trip. Upon contacting the police, they agree that the culprit could be Jeremy Melton. Dorothy admits to her friends that she lied and that Jeremy never attacked her and she ruined his life by getting him beat up and sent to reform school. Meanwhile, Kate's neighbor Gary, breaks into her apartment to steal her underwear. The killer catches Gary in the act and hits him with a hot iron. The killer then brutally beats him to death with the object. As Valentine's Day approaches, Dorothy is planning a party at her family's estate. On the morning of the party, the killer murders Campbell with an ax in the basement. The others assume he has simply left Dorothy. Angering her, Dorothy believes that they are jealous and still look at her as the \\"fat girl\\" of the group. After coming to the party to confront Dorothy with the truth about Campbell, Ruthie is thrown through a shower window by the killer who then impales her neck on the glass. At the party, Paige is attacked and trapped in a hot tub by the killer. The killer taunts her with an electric drill before throwing it into the water, electrocuting her. The party disintegrates when the power cuts out, and Dorothy and Kate argue over who the killer is. Kate claims that Campbell could be a suspect because they do not know anything about him or where he is, while Dorothy counters by accusing Adam, Kate's recovering alcoholic on-off boyfriend, who is now a journalist. After being told by Lily's boyfriend that she did not arrive in Los Angeles as planned, Kate realizes she is also probably dead and calls the detective assigned to the case. After dialing the number, she follows the sound of a ringtone outside the house and discovers the detective's severed head in the pond. Kate becomes convinced that Adam is actually Jeremy, disguised by reconstructive surgery, and goes back into the house, only to find Adam waiting for her. To her surprise, he asks her to dance. Kate becomes frightened, knees him in the groin and flees. She runs through the house, discovering the corpses of Paige and Ruthie. She locates a gun, but the Cupid masked killer jumps out from the darkness and sends them both tumbling down a staircase. The killer arises and is shot to death by Adam. As a shocked and confused Kate apologizes profusely, Adam pulls off the mask to reveal Dorothy. Adam forgives Kate, explaining that childhood trauma can lead to lifelong anger and some people are eventually forced to act on that anger, referring to Dorothy. As Kate and Adam wait for the police to arrive, they hug and Adam says he has always loved her. Moments later, when Kate closes her eyes, his nose begins to bleed, revealing that he is in fact Jeremy Melton and the true killer, framing the dead Dorothy for his crimes. CastProductionConception= While Warner Bros. had acquired the rights to the Tom Savage novel in May 1998, the project was later transferred to Artisan Entertainment with producer Dylan Sellers and writers Wayne & Donna Powers, with Wayne Powers attached to direct. The original script had a different tone from the book and was set on a college campus. The project went into turnaround to Warner Bros., was rewritten by Gretchen J. Berg & Aaron Harberts. Richard Kelly was originally offered the chance to direct, but turned the offer down. Hedy Burress auditioned for the role of Dorothy Wheeler, and Tara Reid was considered for the role, but it was given to Jessica Capshaw instead. However, Blanks wanted Burress to star in the film and cast her as Ruthie Walker. Jessica Cauffiel originally auditioned for Denise Richards's role of Paige. In the original cast, Jennifer Love Hewitt was to play Paige Prescott. =Filming= Valentine was shot on location in Vancouver, British Columbia, with principal photography commencing July 10, 2000, and concluding September 8. Boreanaz shot all his scenes in less than two weeks. Katherine Heigl only had three days to shoot her scenes as she was already committed to the television series Roswell. Blanks later said in an interview, \\"Forgive me for [Valentine]. A lot of people give me grief for that, but we did our best.\\" Release In promotion of the film, Warner Bros.'s official website featured digital e-card valentines that visitors could send via email, and stars David Boreanaz and Katherine Heigl—both well known at the time for their roles in the series Angel and Roswell, respectively—appeared at the Los Angeles Comic Book and Science Fiction Festival. Valentine had its Hollywood premiere at Hollywood Post No. 43, American Legion, on February 1, 2001. It earned $20,384,136 in the United States and Canada and a total gross of $36,684,136, allowing the film to surpass its $29 million budget. =Critical reception= Valentine received largely negative reviews from critics. , the film holds a 12% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 76 reviews with an average rating of 3.16/10. The website's critics reads: \\"Valentine is basically a formulaic throwback to conventional pre-Scream slasher flicks. Critics say it doesn't offer enough suspense or scares to justify its addition to the genre.\\" Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle gave the film a middling review likening to a 1980s-style slasher film, but praised the performances, writing: \\"Valentine isn't scary, but it is unsettling; not ultimately satisfying, but arresting in the moment. Part of the credit has to go to the ensemble. The actresses are vivid, and the characters they play are clearly delineated.\\" Ben Falk of BBC gave the film two out of five stars, writing: \\"Let's face it - we all know what's going to happen and director Blanks (Urban Legend) offers up few surprises. There's the host of red herrings of which none really bite, creative deaths, girls running around screaming and then being incredibly thick, but a distinct lack of gratuitous nudity, which would have at least brightened up the landscape.\\" Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times gave the film a positive review, calling the film a \\"smart, stylish horror picture that offers a fresh twist on the ever-reliable revenge theme and affords a raft of talented young actors solid roles that show them to advantage.\\" Dennis Harvey of Variety gave the film a mixed review, noting: \\"Looking good but lacking much in the way of personality or gray matter — rather like its characters — Valentine is a straightforward slasher pic that’s acceptably scary until a weak finale.\\" Maitland McDonagh of TV Guide awarded the film one out of five stars, calling the film \\"A throwback to the formulaic, holiday-themed stalk- and-slash pictures of the early '80s — but why it took four writers to adapt Tom Savage's generic genre novel is thoroughly baffling.\\" Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"D+\\" on an A+ to F scale. In a 2015 retrospective review, the online horror publication Icons of Fright published a retrospective review of the film, defending the spirit of the film and its thematic handling of the holiday's mythological aspects. Soundtrack The musical score for Valentine was composed by Don Davis. The soundtrack also includes the songs \\"Pushing Me Away\\" by Linkin Park, \\"God of the Mind\\" by Disturbed, \\"Love Dump (Mephisto Odyssey's Voodoo Mix)\\" by Static-X, \\"Superbeast (Porno Holocaust Mix)\\" by Rob Zombie, \\"Valentine's Day\\" by Marilyn Manson, and \\"Opticon\\" by Orgy. This soundtrack compilation was lampooned in a sketch by Saturday Night Live, which humorously pointed out that many of the bands featured on it were not only unknown to a mass audience but have oddly nonsensical names. =Track listing=Home media Valentine was released on both DVD and VHS by Warner Home Video on July 24, 2001. Scream Factory released the film on Blu-ray on February 12, 2019.

It lies midway between the backwaters of Western Kerala and the mountains of the Western Ghats. Etymology The meaning of Pampady as per Malayalam Dictionary - \\"Sabdatharavaly\\" of Sreekandeswaram - is \\"Ananthasayanan\\". (The Land of Lord Vishnu). The area where there was a Sreekrishna Temple by Valiyamadom Potty was called Pampady according to one school of thought. History Vennimala on the western boundary of Pampady was once the Capital of Thekkumkur. Unnuneeli Sandesam written in 14th century AD describes Vennimala and Thiruvanchiyoor in Thekkumkoor. In AD 1749 King Marthanda Varma of Venadu captured Thekkumkoor and thereafter it was a portion of Travancore. After 1956, Pampady became part of Travancore-Cochin State. The old records, dating back to ME 352 (AD 1176), kept with Kaithamattom Illam in Velloor, throws light on the history of Pampady. There was human inhabitation here about 1000 years back. The Subramanya temple of the Illam was old even at that time. Up to middle of 16th Century, Pampady was under King of Thekkumkoor. Thalikotta was the capital of Thekkumkoor. Pampady was owned by Kothala Madom and later by Ambazhathunkal Kartha. Pampady had three portions-Velloor, Pampady and Thekkan Pampady. Major area of Thekkan Pampady was owned by Kongoor Pallimana and later by Arakkal and Vallatt family. Velloor was owned by Kaithamattom Illam.

According to second school from this, the name Pampady was derived. Another view is that the name was derived from Payampady (area where water is available). Vennimala SriRama-Laksmana temple, situated in 4th ward of Puthupally, is south to Vellor. This very old temple is on a hill 1500 feet high from sea level. There are a number of small wells and ponds around the temple.

Datestamp for this entry: 2011-12-21. Biography Tuck was born in Launceston, Tasmania, but his family soon moved to Hobart, where his father was associate professor of electrical engineering at the University of Tasmania. From a young age Tuck was interested in all aspects of science. In his teens he discovered the gaudy American science fiction magazines on sale in local department stores and began collecting them. He located other SF fans in Hobart and together they produced the first Tasmanian science fiction fanzine, Profan, which had three issues between April and September 1941.Nelson, Chris. \\"Early Australian Fanzines\\", Mumblings from Munchkinland 12, 1995, pp.7–10. Each included an author's biography and index to their published stories, demonstrating Tuck's early interest in bibliography. During the war, Tuck trained as a radio technician before serving in the Australian Electrical and Mechanical Engineers Corps on Horn and Thursday Islands in the Torres Strait. Afterward he completed his science degree at the University of Tasmania and then joined the Electrolytic Zinc (EZ) Company at Risdon, near Hobart. Starting as a technical librarian, Tuck would spend his entire career with this company, rising through the ranks. He maintained his interest in SF as a correspondent and collector. A list of paperbacks sent to him by Perth fan Roger Dard inspired Tuck to begin compiling a card index to SF, fantasy and weird literature published in various forms. Acquiring bibliographic data from contacts around the world, Tuck expanded his card index and self- published it as a book titled A Handbook of Science Fiction and Fantasy in January 1954. It received enthusiastic reviews in the three leading SF magazines of the day.Boucher, Anthony and McComas, J. Francis. \\"Recommended Reading\\", The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction, August 1954, p.80.Conklin, Groff. \\"Galaxy's 5 Star Shelf\\", Galaxy Science Fiction, September 1954, p.118.Miller, P. Schuyler. \\"The Reference Library\\", Astounding Science Fiction, November 1954, pp.147–148. Tuck married Audrey Jean Cranston in May 1954. He continued to expand his Handbook; the second edition was published in 1959 and received a \\"Special Hugo\\" at the World Science Fiction Convention in 1962.\\"Tuck, Donald H.\\" The Locus Index to SF Awards: Index of Literary Nominees. Retrieved 2012-03-28. The couple established a home in Lindisfarne, on Hobart's eastern shore, and had a son in 1961. The Tucks hosted regular informal gatherings by local and visiting SF fans at Lindisfarne for the next 20 years, with regular visitor A. Bertram Chandler commemorating the locale by naming one of the spaceship bases in his novels after it. The culmination of Tuck's efforts was the publication of The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction and Fantasy: a bibliographic survey of the fields of science fiction, fantasy and weird fiction through 1968 by Advent:Publishers in three volumes between 1974 and 1983. His work continued to win recognition: the annual Big Heart Award for service to the SF community\\"Big Heart Award\\" . The Locus Index to SF Awards. Retrieved 2012-03-28. in 1975, a special World Fantasy Award in 1979 for volumes 1 and 2, and the Hugo Award for Best Nonfiction Book in 1984 for volume 3. Volume 2 also placed second and volume 3 third for the Locus Awards to the year's best nonfiction or reference book. Tuck was also invited to be Australian Guest of Honour at the first Aussiecon in 1975. A very private person, he was initially reluctant, but did accept the invitation. As the date of the convention approached, however, commitments arose which he felt required his presence at Electrolytic Zinc. He was Acting Head of Industrial Services at the Risdon plant at this time and drastic falls in zinc prices had led to job losses and industrial action.Alexander, Alison. The Zinc Works: producing zinc at Risdon 1916–1991, Pasminco-EZ, 1992. His decision proved controversial, overshadowing his hosting several groups of fans in Hobart after the convention.

The Polish submarine escaped from Tallinn in then-neutral Estonia to the United Kingdom. The Soviet Union used the incident as a pretext to justify the eventual occupation of Estonia. Background Orzeł was docked at Oksywie when Nazi Germany attacked Poland, setting off World War II. The submarine initially participated in Operation Worek, but withdrew from the Polish coast on 4 September as the situation evolved. Damaged by German minesweepers and leaking oil, the decision was made to head for Tallinn, which was reached on 14 September 1939 at about 01:30. Lieutenant-Commander Henryk Kłoczkowski, the commanding officer, was taken to a hospital the next day for treatment of the unidentified illness he had been suffering from since 8 September. The Hague Convention of 1907 enjoined signatories, including Germany, from interfering with the right of enemy warships to use neutral ports, within certain limits. Initially, the Estonians were quite accommodating of Orzeł, assisting with the repair of a damaged compressor. However, probably because of German pressure, Estonian military authorities soon boarded the ship, declared the crew interned, confiscated all the navigation aids and maps, and commenced dismantling all the armaments. An Estonian officer removed the naval ensign at the submarine's stern. The incidentEscape= ORP Orzeł The crew of ORP Orzeł conspired to escape under the new command of its chief officer, Lt. Jan Grudziński, and its new first officer, Lieutenant Andzej Piasecki.Haar, Geirr H. The Gathering Storm p. 53 This started with Grudziński's sabotage of the torpedo hoist on 16 September, preventing the Estonians from removing the six aft torpedoes. Since it was a Sunday, another one couldn't be immediately acquired. Meanwhile, Boatswain Wladyslaw Narkiewicz took a small boat around the harbour. Under the guise of fishing, he covertly measured the depth of the planned escape route. Another sailor sabotaged the submarine's mooring lines. At around 00:00 on 18 September, the port lights suffered an unexplained malfunction. Seizing the opportunity, Lieutenant Grudziński prepared the submarine for departure. The crew was forced to delay by the arrival of an Estonian officer. After a 30-minute inspection, he deemed nothing to be out of the ordinary and bid the Poles goodnight. The crew resumed with their plans. Two Estonian guards at the dock were lured aboard and nonviolently taken prisoner, the lighting in the port was intentionally sabotaged, and the mooring lines were cut with an axe. Both engines were started, and the submarine made her escape in the darkness. Estonian spotlights began sweeping the harbour, from the buildings to the quay, before finally locking onto Orzeł. The Estonians opened up with machine guns and light artillery, damaging the conning tower. Heavier guns supposedly didn't open fire for fear of damaging other ships. At the mouth of the harbor the submarine briefly ran aground on a sandbar, but quickly managed to get free and escape into the Baltic. =At sea= Lieutenant Grudziński intended to seize the maps of a German vessel, as all of Orzełs navigational aids, with the exception of a guide of Swedish lighthouses, had been confiscated. No German merchantmen were ever spotted, though. After three weeks of searching, it was decided to leave the Baltic and head for Britain. It took two days to pass through the heavily guarded entrance. The only references the Poles had were the lighthouse guide and a rudimentary map drawn by the navigation officer. The Estonian and German press covering the incident claimed that the two captured guards had been murdered by the Polish sailors. In reality they were deposited off of the Swedish coast in a rubber dingy provided with clothing and food for their safe return home. The two guards were also provided with 50 US dollars each, as the Polish crew believed that those returning from the underworld \\"deserve to travel first class only.\\" Orzeł made landfall off of Scotland on 14 October. The crew sent out a signal in broken English, and a British destroyer came out and escorted them into port. Orzełs arrival came a surprise to the Admiralty, which had long presumed the submarine lost. Aftermath monument in Tallinn, Estonia was subject to a refit and subsequently brought into service alongside the Royal Navy in the 2nd Submarine Flotilla in mid-January 1940 to patrol the North Sea. =Ramifications= Following the event, the Telegraph Agency of the Soviet Union reported that the Estonian government had deliberately allowed Orzeł to escape and that other Polish submarines were hiding in ports throughout the Baltic states. The Soviet Union, which invaded Poland on 17 September 1939, accused Estonia of conspiring with the Polish seamen and \\"aiding them to escape\\", challenging the neutrality of Estonia. The Soviets demanded to be allowed to establish military bases on Estonian soil, threatening war if Estonia did not comply. This served as a political cover for their actions, as the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact had already given German approval to the Soviet Union taking over the Baltic countries. The Orzeł incident was used to force a \\"pact of defence and mutual assistance\\" on Estonia, which was signed on 28 September 1939, and allowed for the occupation and annexation of Estonia by the Soviet Union in 1940. Orzeł sank no enemy vessels during her journey from Estonia to Britain, although Soviet authorities blamed her for the loss of the Soviet tanker Metallist in Narva Bay on 26 September, the incident being used as a pretext for the Soviet occupation of the Baltic states (1940).

Until the early 1990s most of the district was in dairy farms of 40 to 60 hectares (100 to 150 acres), but with the growth of Auckland City and the extension of the Northern Motorway into the area, these are being gradually subdivided into lifestyle blocks of around 2 to 5 hectares (5 to 12 acres), many of which are grazing sheep, horses, beef cattle or deer. Although it still retains a rural character, it is counted as part of the Auckland urban area in official statistics. 'Dairy Flat' lies within the Rodney Ward on State Highway 1 and the former State Highway 17. There is a small village shopping centre and the Dairy Flat Primary School. A major facility is the North Shore Aerodrome owned and operated by the North Shore Aero Club. In addition to aero club and private aircraft, the field is used by Barrier Air to run a scheduled air service in passenger aircraft to Great Barrier Island, some 40 nm (75 km) offshore.

After a career at Saatchi & Saatchi culminating in the post of joint chief executive in 1995, he came to wide public prominence as the new chief executive of The Football Association in 2000 at the age of 35, before in 2003 becoming the chief executive of the Royal Mail Group, the United Kingdom's mail delivery service, where he oversaw a controversial modernisation and redundancy programme. In January 2010 he was announced as the new chief executive of ITV plc, where he arrived on 26 April 2010. Crozier announced he was leaving this post in June 2017. Early life and education Crozier was born and raised on the Isle of Bute on the west coast of Scotland in 1964.Sharp suit with an iron hand in a woolly glove Guardian, 11 May 2007] His father was a manager for Lord Bute, and his mother was secretary to the managing director of The Scotsman. Crozier went to a school in Ayr, before moving to Graeme High School, a comprehensive school in Falkirk. He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree (BA) in business organisation from Edinburgh's Heriot-Watt University. While at school, Crozier had trials with both Hibernian and Stirling Albion football clubs. Crozier received an Honorary Doctorate from Heriot-Watt University in 2005. CareerEarly career= Crozier joined Pedigree Petfoods as a graduate trainee in 1984. In 1986, he moved to the Daily Telegraph to work in media sales. =Saatchi & Saatchi= From 1988 to 1999 Crozier worked for advertising agency Saatchi and Saatchi, becoming media director in 1990, and then being appointed as joint chief executive from 1995 alongside Tamara Ingram. This occurred in the wake of the departure of the founding Saatchi brothers to form M&C; Saatchi. =The Football Association= Crozier came to public attention as the surprise appointment to the role of chief executive of The Football Association, the governing body of England's national game, football, aged just 35 and having had no experience of business in football. He replaced Graham Kelly. In his short tenure from 2000 to 2002, the FA relocated headquarters from Lancaster Gate to Soho Square, appointed the first ever foreign England national team manager, Swede Sven-Göran Eriksson, and became a more commercial organisation, maximising its revenues. He also reduced the average age of the FA's staff from 55 to 32, progressed the Wembley Stadium redevelopment, and reduced the FA's ruling body from a 91-member FA Board to a committee of 12. His moves were not without criticism, with complaints from some about lack of consultation and of acting beyond his powers. He was replaced by Mark Palios. While at the FA, Crozier reportedly identified some members of the England national team as the Golden Generation. It was a term later criticised towards the end of the decade by some England players as having been undeserved, and of causing undue expectations and pressure due to the fact they had at the time, and in years since, failed to win major tournaments. =Royal Mail= Crozier became the chief executive of the Royal Mail Group in February 2003. Entering the post, Crozier described his remit as the \\"biggest corporate turnaround programme in the UK\\". Crozier initiated a programme of modernisation and reform, to deal with changes in the service brought about by reforms beginning with the Postal Services Act 2000. In Crozier's first three years, the Royal Mail division produced record annual profits of £537m in May 2005, making £2m a day in profits, up from £1.5m a day losses before he joined. The Group overall had been transformed from recording losses of £1.1bn at the start of the turnaround plan in 2002 into a profit of £355m in 2005. Royal Mail chairman Allan Leighton said it was a \\"fantastic turnaround\\" but also that there was still \\"a huge amount to do\\". The newly formed mail regulator Postwatch were however critical that it had failed to achieve 11 of its 15 licence targets during the previous financial year. As the postal service was opened up to competition in early 2006, Royal Mail recorded losses of £10m in 2006 and £279m in 2007. His reforms included highly controversial large scale post office closures in the thousands, layoffs of Royal Mail staff, changes in working practices, and the ending of the second daily delivery and moving the first daily delivery to later in the day.. Royal Mail strikes: Adam Crozier second highest paid public sector boss on £1m The Daily Telegraph, 2 November 2009 While at the Royal Mail, Crozier's salary, one of the largest in the country for the head of a publicly owned body, was criticised in light of the changes being made to the Royal Mail workforce. Ongoing reforms eventually led to large scale industrial disputes and strike action in both 2007 and 2009 onwards. =ITV= On 28 January 2010, it was announced Crozier would be leaving the Royal Mail later in 2010 to become the next permanent chief executive of media group ITV plc.Adam Crozier to leave Royal Mail later this year to join ITV Royal Mail Group, 28 January 2010 ITV plc is one of three partners within ITV Network Limited, the not for profit organisation which runs the ITV television network, the United Kingdom's first commercial network effectively created under the Television Act 1954. Crozier was replacing Michael Grade, who announced his intention to leave in April 2009. Crozier was given the task of increasing ITV's advertising revenues which had fallen with the proliferation of new channels in the British television market. On announcing the appointment, ITV chairman Archie Norman said of Crozier that he is a \\"very strong leader with a great track record in delivering transformational change\\". =Other roles= Crozier is also a board member of Camelot Group, the National Lottery operator, and the Debenhams retail chain. He is also member of the President's Committee of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI). He joined the board of Whitbread in 2017, becoming a senior independent director that year. In 2018 he succeeded the retiring Richard Baker as Whitbread's chairman. Personal life Crozier is married to Annette, whom he met while working for Saatchi and Saatchi, and has two children. Despite having taken on high-profile jobs involving pressing through major upheavals, he is described as \\"softly spoken\\" and has previously said of the spotlight, \\"I hate it, absolutely hate it. The bizarre thing about the last three jobs I've done is that I don't like [the public profile] at all. I will go to enormous lengths not to do public things – because it is just not me.\\" References Category:1964 births Category:Alumni of Heriot- Watt University Category:Chief executives of the Football Association Category:Living people Category:Royal Mail people Category:Scottish businesspeople Category:Scottish chief executives Category:Scottish television executives Category:People from the Isle of Bute Category:People educated at Graeme High School ","title":"Adam Crozier"},{"id":"2480931","text":"Okaya Optical Co., Ltd.

Overview The Blue Eye was a development of the AGM-12 Bullpup, intended to provide a more advanced homing system. The Bullpup was manually steered onto the target, whereas the guidance system in the Blue Eye was an optical area correlation seeker. A TV camera in the missile's nose provided an image to the pilot; he used this to select the target and lock the missile on before firing. Once launched the area correlation system could detect any deviation of the picture compared to the locked image and correct the missile's course accordingly. The Blue Eye used the same airframe as the AGM-12C/E. A radar altimeter was fitted to allow the warhead to explode in an air burst mode. Firing trials took place in late 1968, with the prototype missile designated XAGM-79A. After several years of development the missile was cancelled in the early 1970s.

It requires players to control the navies of ancient Rome and Carthage during the Punic Wars, in order to conquer the Mediterranean Sea. Gameplay Legions of Death is a one or two-player strategy game set during the Punic Wars between ancient Rome and Carthage. In single-player mode the player controls the fleet of Carthage, in two-player mode one player controls the Roman navy while the other controls the Carthaginian fleet. Each player must try to destroy their opponent's fleet and gain control of the Mediterranean. At the start of play each player receives a number of points to construct their navy using a combination of faster biremes and triremes, along with various heavier combat ships, up to Heptares class. Additional points may be spent to upgrade individual ships, such as adding marine detachments, archer platforms, and boarding hooks. Lighter ships can be used to collect funds from outlying ports and transport it back to the player's home port, while heavier ships are needed to counter the other player's attacking fleet, as they can more effectively ram and sink enemy vessels. Gameplay is turn-based, with movement resolved simultaneously, and plays out on a square grid. Ships may accelerate or decelerate each turn by one speed point, up to a speed limit which depends on the class of ship. Ships may turn up to 45 degrees maximum per unit of movement (so no right-angle turns). This movement system adds a unique tactical element in which the player must carefully plan out routes and speeds several turns ahead in order to intercept enemy ships, and bring ships into harbours without crashing.

Kanthal FeCrAl alloys consist of mainly iron, chromium (20–30%) and aluminium (4–7.5 %). The first Kanthal FeCrAl alloy was developed by Hans von Kantzow in Hallstahammar, Sweden. The alloys are known for their ability to withstand high temperatures and having intermediate electric resistance. As such, it is frequently used in heating elements. The trademark Kanthal is owned by Sandvik Intellectual Property AB. Characteristics For heating, resistance wire must be stable in air when hot. Kanthal FeCrAl alloy forms a protective layer of aluminium oxide (alumina). Aluminium oxide has high thermal conductivity but is an electrical insulator, so special techniques may be required to make good electrical connections. Ordinary Kanthal FeCrAl alloy has a melting point of . Special grades can be used as high as . Depending on specific composition the resistivity is about 1.4μΩ·m and temperature coefficient is +49ppm/K ().  Uses  Kanthal is used in heating elements due to its flexibility, durability and tensile strength. Its uses are widespread, for example in toasters, home and industrial heaters, kilns and diffusion heaters (used in the making of crystalline silicon). Recently, Kanthal has been used for heating coils in electronic cigarettes. Unlike alternative types of metal such as Nichrome, Kanthal is durable enough to withstand the temperatures needed, but flexible and cheap enough to be practical.

The Battle Axe culture was an offshoot of the Corded Ware culture, and replaced the Funnelbeaker culture in southern Scandinavia, probably through a process of mass migration and population replacement. It is thought to have been responsible for spreading Indo-European languages and other elements of Indo- European culture to the region. It co-existed for a time with the hunter- gatherer Pitted Ware culture, which it eventually absorbed, developing into the Nordic Bronze Age. The Nordic Bronze Age has, in turn, been considered ancestral to the Germanic peoples. HistoryOrigins= The Battle Axe culture emerged in the south of the Scandinavian Peninsula about 2800 BC. It was an offshoot of the Corded Ware culture, which was itself largely an offshoot of the Yamnaya culture of the Pontic-Caspian steppe. Modern genetic studies show that its emergence was accompanied by large-scale migrations and genetic displacement. The Battle Axe culture initially absorbed the agricultural Funnelbeaker culture. =Distribution= The concentration of the Battle Axe culture was in Scania. Sites of the Battle Axe culture have been found throughout the coastal areas of southern Scandinavia and southwest Finland. The immediate coastline was, however, occupied by the Pitted Ware culture. By 2300 BC, the Battle Axe culture had absorbed the Pitted Ware culture. Throughout its existence, the Battle Axe culture appears to have expanded into coastal Norway, accompanied by dramatic cultural changes. Einar Østmo reports sites of the Battle Axe culture inside the Norwegian Arctic Circle in the Lofoten, and as far north as the present city of Tromsø. =Successors= The Battle Axe culture ended around 2300 BC. It was eventually succeeded by the Nordic Bronze Age, which appears to be a fusion of elements from the Battle Axe culture and the Pitted Ware culture. Characteristics Boat-shaped battle axe, characteristic of Scandinavian and coastal-German Corded Ware. =Burials= The Battle Axe culture is mostly known for its burials. Around 250 Battle Axe burials have been found in Sweden. They are quite different from those found in the Single Grave culture of Denmark. In the Battle Axe culture, the deceased were usually placed in a single flat grave with no barrow. Graves were typically oriented north-south, with the body in a flexed position facing towards the east. Men were placed on their left sides, while women were placed on their right sides. As regards both objects and placement, the grave goods are quite standardized. Axes of flint are found in both male and female burials. Battle axes are placed with males close to the head. These battle axes appear to have been status symbols, and it is from them that the culture is named. About 3000 battle axes have been found, in sites distributed over all of Scandinavia, but they are sparse in Norrland and northern Norway. The polished flint axes of the Battle Axe culture and the Pitted Ware culture trace a common origin in southwest Scania and Denmark. Corded Ware ceramics were also common grave goods in Battle Axe burials. They were usually placed near the head or feet. Other grave goods include arrowheads, weapons of antler, amber beads, and polished flint axes and chisels. Faunal remains from burials include red deer, sheep, and goat. A new aspect was given to the Battle Axe culture in 1993, when a death house in Turinge, in Södermanland was excavated. Along the once heavily timbered walls were found the remains of about twenty clay vessels, six work axes and a battle axe, which all came from the last period of the culture. There were also the cremated remains of at least six people. It is the earliest find of cremation in Scandinavia and it shows close contacts with Central Europe. =Settlements= Few settlements of the Battle Axe culture have been uncovered. Most of them are located inland, but some are located in coastal areas. Battle Axe culture settlements are, however, not located directly on the coastline, which was rather occupied by the Pitted Ware culture. Less than 100 settlements are known, and their remains are negligible as they are located on continually used farmland, and have consequently been plowed away. Archaeological remains of southern Sweden reveal close spatial relations between houses and graves, indicating that farms were central to social and economic activity in the Battle Axe culture. =Pottery= Battle Axe pottery has been found frequently in Pitted Ware settlements. Some settlements even display fusions of the pottery styles of the Battle Axe culture and Pitted Ware culture. The relationship between the two cultures is controversial and not well understood. =Culture= The social system of the Battle Axe culture was markedly different than that of the Funnelbeaker culture, shown by the fact that the Funnelbeaker culture had collective megalithic graves, each containing numerous sacrifices, while the Battle Axe culture had individual graves, with a single sacrifice each. Individualism appears to have played a much more prominent part in the Battle Axe culture than among its predecessors. =Economy= The Battle Axe culture was based on the same agricultural practices as the previous Funnelbeaker culture. The Battle Axe culture appears to have emphasized cattle herding, which explains the apparent mobile nature of the culture. They also appear to have engaged in trade with populations to their north, exchanging animal products for material goods. Einar Østmo emphasizes that the Atlantic and North Sea coastal regions of Scandinavia, and the circum-Baltic areasIlja A. Seržant The Circum-Baltic Area Leipzig University were united by a vigorous maritime economy, permitting a far wider geographical spread and a closer cultural unity than interior continental cultures could attain. He points to the number of widely- disseminated rock carvings assigned to the era, which display \\"thousands\\" of ships. To such seafaring cultures, the sea is a highway and not a divider. Ethnicity The Battle Axe culture is believed to have brought Indo-European languages and Indo-European culture to southern Scandinavia. The fusion of the Battle Axe culture with the native agricultural and hunter-gatherer cultures of the region spawned the Nordic Bronze Age, which is considered the ancestral civilization of the Germanic peoples. Physical type The physical type of the Battle Axe people was different from the physical type of the preceding Funnelbeaker people of southern Scandinavia. Genetics A genetic study published in Nature in June 2015 examined the remains of a Battle Axe male buried in Viby, Sweden ca. 2621-2472 BC. He was found to be a carrier of the paternal haplogroup R1a1a1 and the maternal haplogroup K1a2a. People of the Late Neolithic and Bronze Age cultures of Scandinavia were found to be very closely related people of the Corded Ware culture, Bell Beaker culture and Unetice culture, all of whom shared genetic affinity with the Yamnaya culture. The Sintashta culture and Andronovo culture of Central Asia also displayed close genetic relations to the Corded Ware culture.. \\"Although European Late Neolithic and Bronze Age cultures such as Corded Ware, Bell Beakers, Unetice, and the Scandinavian cultures are genetically very similar to each other (Fig. 2), they still display a cline of genetic affinity with Yamnaya... The close affinity we observe between peoples of Corded Ware and Sintashta cultures (Extended Data Fig. 2a) suggests similar genetic sources of the two, which contrasts with previous hypotheses placing the origin of Sintastha in Asia or the Middle East28. Although we cannot formally test whether the Sintashta derives directly from an eastward migration of Corded Ware peoples or if they share common ancestry with an earlier steppe population, the presence of European Neolithic farmer ancestry in both the Corded Ware and the Sintashta, combined with the absence of Neolithic farmer ancestry in the earlier Yamnaya, would suggest the former being more probable... Yamnaya migrations resulted in gene flow across vast distances, essentially connecting Altai in Siberia with Scandinavia in the Early Bronze Age (Fig. 1). The Andronovo culture, which arose in Central Asia during the later Bronze Age (Fig. 1), is genetically closely related to the Sintashta peoples...\\" A genetic study published in Nature Communications in January 2018 examined a male buried in Ölsund in northern Sweden ca. 2570–2140. Although buried without artifacts, he was found close to an archaeological site containing both hunter-gatherer and Corded Ware artifacts.. \\"One sample from northern Sweden (Scandinavia LNBA Olsund, ca.2570–2140 calBCE) dates to the Late Neolithic but was found without associated archaeological assemblages... The individual from Olsund in north- eastern Sweden was dated to the Late Neolithic, when agriculture had been introduced to the coastal areas of northern Sweden with the Battle Axe Culture, the regional variant of the CWC, while foraging persisted as an important form of subsistence. The remains were found without any associated artefacts, but in close proximity to a site where the assemblage showed a mix between local hunter-gatherer traditions and CWC influence...\\" He was found to be a carrier of the paternal haplogroup R1a1a1b and the maternal haplogroup U4c2a. He was found to be genetically similar to peoples of the Battle Axe culture, carrying a large amount of steppe-related ancestry. The paternal haplogroup R1a1a1b was also found to be the predominant lineage among Corded Ware and Bronze Age males of the eastern Baltic. A genetic study published in Proceedings of the Royal Society B examined the remains of 2 Battle Axe individuals buried in Bergsgraven in central Sweden. The male carried the paternal haplogroup R1a-Z283 and the maternal haplogroup U4c1a, while the female carried the maternal haplogroup N1a1a1a1. Haplogroup R1a is the most common paternal haplogroup among males from other cultures of the Corded Ware horizon, and has earlier been found among Eastern Hunter-Gatherers (EHGs). Interestingly, the Yamnaya culture is on the other hand dominated by the paternal haplogroup R1b.. \\"The paternal lineages found in the BAC/CWC individuals remain enigmatic. The majority of individuals from CWC contexts that have been genetically investigated this far for the Y-chromosome belong to Y-haplogroup R1a, while the majority of sequenced individuals of the presumed source population of Yamnaya steppe herders belong to R1b. R1a has been found in Mesolithic and Neolithic Ukraine. This opens the possibility that the Yamnaya and CWC complexes may have been structured in terms of paternal lineages—possibly due to patrilineal inheritance systems in the societies—and that genetic studies have not yet targeted the direct sources of the expansions into central and northern Europe.\\" The two Battle Axe individuals examined were found to be closely related to peoples from other parts of the Corded Ware horizon. They were mostly of Western Steppe Herder (WSH) descent, although with slight Western Hunter-Gatherer (WHG) and Early European Farmer (EEF) admixture. The admixture appears to have occurred through mating of WSH males with EEF and WHG females. The ancestry of the Battle Axe individuals was markedly different from that of previous Neolithic populations, suggesting stratification among the cultural groups. WSH ancestry has not been detected among previous populations of the area. The results further underpinned the notion that the Battle Axe culture emerged as a result of migrations from southeast of the Baltic. The study also examined a female buried in a Funnelbeaker megalith in Öllsjö, Sweden c. 2860–2500 BC, during which the area was part of the Battle Axe culture. She carried the maternal haplogroup H6a1b3, and was found to be closely genetically related to other people of the Battle Axe culture. Two individuals buried in the same megalith during the Late Neolithic were likewise closely related to peoples of the Corded Ware culture. A genetic study published in the American Journal of Physical Anthropology examined a number Pitted Ware individuals buried in Gotland. Several of these individuals were buried with Battle Axe artifacts in a fashion typical of the Battle Axe culture. None of these individuals were found to harbor any admixture from the Battle Axe culture, suggesting that peoples of the two cultures interacted without mixing with each other. Modern Northern Europeans were found to be closely genetically related to people of the Battle Axe culture.

Edinburgh, 1 May 1775 – d. London, ca. 1831)The date of 1847 usually given as her death date is actually that of her second husband's death. No death certificate for Sophia is extant, whereas there is a certificate from 1847 for J. Moralt. was a Scottish singer, pianist, harpist, and composer of Italian descent. In 1792, Dussek married the composer Jan Ladislav Dussek. Following Jan's death in 1812, Sophia married the violist John Alvis Moralt. The couple lived in Paddington, where she founded a music school. The opus 2 sonatas were published in at least 3 editions in the 1790s by the Corri-Dussek company in London as by Madame Dussek, and there is no reason to doubt that the 6 sonatas of opus 2, including the famous C minor sonata published and misattributed by Schott as by JL, are anything but the work of Sophia. Paris editions of opus 2 published by Pleyel only bear the name Dussek, leading Zabaleta to his misattribution, but nobody actually claimed opus 2 as the work of JL rather than Dussek before the mid-20th century.  Life and family  Sophia Dussek was born into the Corri family. She studied voice with her father, composer, music publisher, and impresario Domenico Corri. Her uncle was composer Natale Corri and her cousin was soprano Fanny Corri-Paltoni. Her father provided Sophia with vocal instruction and had her performing from a young age. She was well known as a soprano and composer of songs. After moving to London in 1788, she studied with Luigi Marchesi and Giovanni Battista Cimador. Dussek was a highly accomplished performer and she had her London debut at the prestigious Salomon concerts in 1791 with Haydn directing from the harpsichord, and afterwards sang quite a bit of the series, taking part in the first performance of Haydn’s The Storm. She also played a big role in the introduction of Mozart's music to London. She was a soloist in the London premiere of the Requiem, given at John Ashley's Lenten Oratorios, Covent Garden, on 20 February 1801. In 1792 she married Jan Ladislav Dussek. She had been performing, singing and playing the piano and harp with him for some time before that. Their daughter, Olivia, was also a pianist, harpist, and composer. After Jan Ladislav's death in 1812 Sophia married the viola player John Alvis Moralt. They lived in Paddington, where she established a music school. She published sonatas, rondos, variations, and numerous arrangements for the piano or harp.

Its principal aim is to promote scientific capacity and excellence for sustainable development in developing countries. It was formerly known as the Third World Academy of Sciences. Its headquarters is located on the premises of the Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP) in Trieste, Italy. History TWAS was founded in 1983 under the leadership of the Nobel Laureate Abdus Salam of Pakistan by a group of distinguished scientists who were determined to do something about the dismal state of scientific research in developing countries. * Although developing countries account for 80% of the world's population, only 28% of the world's scientists hail from these countries. This fact reflects the lack of innovative potential necessary to solve real-life problems affecting poor nations. * A chronic lack of funds for research often forces scientists in developing countries into intellectual isolation, jeopardizing their careers, their institutions and, ultimately, their nations. * Scientists in developing countries tend to be poorly paid and gain little respect for their work because the role that scientific research can play in development efforts is underestimated. This in turn leads to brain drain in favour of the North that further impoverishes the South. * Research institutions and universities in the South are under-funded, forcing scientists to work in difficult conditions and often with outdated equipment. The founding members of TWAS therefore decided to set up an organization that would help to: # Recognize, support and promote excellence in scientific research in the South; # Provide promising scientists in the South with research facilities necessary for the advancement of their work; # Facilitate contacts between individual scientists and institutions in the South; # Encourage South–North cooperation between individuals and centres of scholarship; # Promote scientific research on major developing countries problems. Since its inception, TWAS's operational expenses have largely been covered by generous contributions of the Italian government; since 1991 UNESCO has been responsible for the administration of TWAS finance and staff on the basis of an agreement signed by the director general of UNESCO and the president of TWAS. It was named \\"Third World Academy of Sciences\\" until 2004 and \\"TWAS, the academy of sciences for the developing world\\" before September 2012, when it was renamed to is current name, \\"The World Academy of Sciences for the advancement of science in developing countries\\".

At inception, the award was titled TWAS Awards in Basic Sciences and was awarded in Physics, Chemistry, Biology and Mathematics categories but was merged with the TWNSO (Third World Network of Scientific Organizations) Prizes in Applied Sciences in 2003 to form the present-day TWAS Prize, which is awarded in nine categories viz. Agricultural Sciences, Biology, Chemistry, Earth Sciences, Engineering Sciences, Mathematics, Medical Sciences, Physics and Social Sciences. The award carries a plaque and a cash prize of 15000 and is open to scientists living and working in a developing country.

The Swedish Empire had the greatest and most numerous copper mines in Europe as it entered into its pre-eminence in the early 17th century as an emerging Great Power. Through poor fiscal policies and in part the Treaty of Älvsborg, Sweden lost control of its reserves of precious metals, primarily silver, of which most had fled to the burgeoning trade economy of Amsterdam. In 1607 the Swedish King Charles IX attempted to persuade the populace to exchange their silver- based currency for a copper-based coin of equal face value, though this offer was not generally taken up. Sweden's large army of the time were paid entirely in copper currency, further issued in large numbers by Gustavus II to finance his war against Ferdinand II of Germany. The face value of the copper coins in circulation now greatly exceeded the reserves of the state and production of the national economy, and quickly the value of the currency fell to its commodity value, which in a country where copper was so abundant, was small indeed. The savings of the people of Sweden were wiped out. When Gustavus' daughter and heir Christina reached maturity at 18, after a brief fling with paper-based money backed by copper—which was well received initially but soon lost credibility—she began issuing copper in lumps as large as fifteen kilograms to serve as currency. Unwieldy as they were, the copper-based monetary system worked to a fashion until the world copper price slumped. Sweden's great copper no longer commanded the premium it once had on world markets, and foreign income dried up. Relative to the rest of Europe, Sweden's people once more had become poor. In an effort to shore up the economy, government minister Baron von Görtz stepped up to the challenge and became the country's central banker. He issued more copper-based currency without limit, with a face value of one daler (much greater than their intrinsic value) and which were technically inferior and easy to counterfeit. Soon these coins were so abundant that they too depreciated rapidly towards their raw metal value as belief spread that the copper coins would soon be unacceptable as a form of payment of taxes. Görtz was blamed for the failure, and was duly beheaded in March 1719, a punishment which greatly pleased the Swedish people.

Born in Montreal, he was nicknamed Le Chat, French for The Cat, because of his luck in evading death after surviving at least three assassination attempts and a police shootout, and escaping from custody twice. Biography Born in the Montreal neighbourhood of Rosemont, Blass would turn to amateur boxing as a way to channel his anger when he was a child. It was after a boxing fight that Blass committed one of his first known crimes, attacking fellow boxer Michel Gouin with a knife after losing a fight to him. Blass pleaded guilty to assault and spent one night in jail. Over time Blass became more obsessed with the Mafia activity going on in New York city, south of Montreal. As obsessed as he was with the Mafia, however, he was also known for his hatred of Mafia families: resenting the fact that the Italian Mafia held a stronghold on Montreal's underworld business during the late 1960s, Blass was involved in violent feuds with many Mafiosi, particularly those related to Frank Cotroni and brothers Joe and Vincenzo Di Maulo. On May 7, 1968, Blass and Robert Allard attempted an ambush of Frank outside his home; two of his bodyguards were killed, but Frank escaped. He had also worked as a hitman for the notorious West End Gang.Schneider, Iced: The Story of Organized Crime in Canada, pp. 270 By then, Blass had a sizable number of members in his own criminal gang. Blass and his gang then became more violent, committing a number of murders against Italians, some of whom had nothing to do with crime. The first such killing took place on May 27, when Giuseppe Collizza was killed with five shots to the head. One of the persons that Blass and his group killed, Francesco Grado, however, had connections to the Mafia. Grado was a loan shark for the Mafia. He was murdered with multiple gunshots. On August 24 of that year (1968), the first Mafia attempt against Blass' life took place, when two hired gunmen entered a bar where Blass was enjoying some drinks. Although shot at multiple times, Blass was able to escape unscathed. Two weeks later, Blass was tracked by the Mafia to a motel named \\"Le Manoir de Plaisance\\", in a Montreal suburb. The motel was set on fire and three people died, but Blass escaped the blaze. Police investigation indicated arson as the fire's cause. In October 1968, Richard Blass was injured by bullet shots to the head and back after being ambushed, alongside partner Claude Menard, inside a garage. The two were able to save their lives when Menard drove the car they were in through the garage's door, and Blass required hospitalization for his wounds. He refused to identify his attackers, a fact which may have led him to earn respect among Canadian mafia members. In January 1969, Blass and his gang tried to commit a bank robbery but the attempt failed, and Blass shot a policeman as he was fleeing from the financial institution. He was consequently arrested and sentenced to four consecutive terms of ten years in jail. On October 16 of that year Blass became a fugitive for the first time, when he and other prisoners overpowered a jail guard and fled the van in which they were being transported to court. Blass was caught after an anonymous caller informed police that he was hiding in his wife's apartment. Blass waited five years and in 1974 perpetrated his second attempt at escape. An unidentified female friend of his brought in some firearms during a visit, and Blass broke the jail visitor's window. Armed with various types of guns and rifles, he and other men were able to escape jail, in Blass' case, for the second time. Blass wanted to kill Raymond Laurin and Roger Lévesque, both of whom had participated in the 1969 bank robbery and testified against him. He found them both at a bar on October 30, 1974 and shot them to their deaths. Convinced that he needed to kill all witnesses of the deaths of Laurin and Lévesque, Blass and gang partner Fernand Beaudet returned to the bar on January 21, 1975. They locked ten men and three women inside a bar locker before killing all 13 of them. What followed that act was one of the largest manhunts in Canadian history. On January 24, 1975, police located the chalet where Blass was hiding. At 1:30 AM EST, three officers, led by Albert Lisacek, broke the windows of the chalet door and entered. As Blass approached them, the officers opened fire, and Blass was hit by 27 bullets, dying within seconds. Police reports and testimony stated that Blass had shot first; however, in May 2012, Lisacek told journalist Warren Perley that Blass had been unarmed, and had only been 'wielding' a sock. He was entombed at the Notre Dame des Neiges Cemetery in Montreal. Depictions The 1992 film Requiem for a Handsome Bastard (Requiem pour un beau sans-coeur) is loosely based on Blass' career. The film centers around the last three days of a fictionalized, pseudonymous version of Blass. A book about Blass was published in 1983Frank Shoofey, Nom: Blass, prénom: Richard, alias: \\"le chat\\", profession: criminel (English translation: Name: Blass, first name: Richard, aka \\"the cat\\", occupation: criminal), Québécor, 1983, . by famous criminal attorney Frank Shoofey, who previously represented him.

Biblical renewal started with Pope Pius XII's 1943 encyclical Divino afflante Spiritu after which Catholic translations of the Bible became based directly on the texts found in manuscripts in the original languages. Later documents (of which Dogmatic Constitution on Divine Revelation published as a result of the Second Vatican Council can be considered to be of special importance) were encouraged to provide versions of the Bible in the \\"mother tongues\\" of the faithful, and urged both clergy and laity to continue to make Bible study a central part of their lives. Liturgical renewal was launched by the Second Vatican Council, emphasising that \\"the faithful should be led to that fully conscious and active participation in liturgical celebrations which is demanded by the very nature of the liturgy\\" (Constitution on the Sacred Liturgy). Other Second Vatican Council documents, like the Dogmatic Constitution on the Church, can be considered to be the background for catechumenate renewal which was introduced in many Catholic particular churches in many forms soon after the Council (of which the Neocatechumenate is probably the best known), and for charismatic renewal which started in 1967.

It was published in 1994.  Synopsis  The book follows the childhood memories of the narrator, illustrating various experiences in his life: fishing on the beach at dawn; his grandparents and how one grandfather went mad; a hunchback great-uncle; the betrayal of children by adults; fear of the unknown; an unwanted pregnancy, violence, possibly even murder. The general story is paralleled with the traditional story of the Mr. Punch show, 'The oldest, the wisest play'. The narrator is first introduced to Mr. Punch when fishing with his grandfather, but encounters it, and a mysterious 'professor' (Punch & Judy man), during various other activities. The story of Mr. Punch, is that he kills his baby, then his wife Judy and the police officer who comes to arrest him. He outwits a ghost, a crocodile and a doctor, convinces the hangman to be hanged in his place and, at the play's end, even defeats the devil himself. Like many of Gaiman's works, a major theme in this graphic novel is memory and the unreliability of one's own recollections.

Felipe Guamán Poma de Ayala’s Nueva crónica y buen gobierno (New Chronicle and Good Government). Early Ibero/Ango Americanist Summit: New World Antiquities and Histories. (retrieved 8 Sept 2009) Today, Guamán Poma is noted for his illustrated chronicle, Nueva corónica y buen gobierno.Fane, 166  Biography  The son of a noble family from the central southern Peruvian province of Lucanas located in the modern day department of Ayacucho, he was a direct descendant of the eminent indigenous conqueror and ruler Huaman-Chava-Ayauca Yarovilca-Huanuco,Hamilton, Roland. Table of Contents and Excerpt, Guaman Poma de Ayala, the First New Chronicle and Good Government. University of Texas Press. 2009 (retrieved 8 Sept 2009) Felipe Guamán Poma de Ayala was a fluent speaker of several Quechua and Aru dialects,Adorno, xix who probably learned the Spanish language as a child or adolescent. He went on to become literate in the language, although he did not achieve a perfect grasp of Spanish grammar. He described himself as \\"eighty years of age\\" in his 1615 manuscript, leading many to deduce that he was born in the year 1535, after the 1533 Spanish conquest of Peru. It seems that he used the figure \\"80\\" as a metaphor for old age, however, and many other references in his text indicate a possible birthdate of 1550 or shortly thereafter. The information known about Guamán Poma's life comes from a variety of written sources. Most likely he was born in the Lucanas province and spent most of his life in or near Huamanga, a central Peruvian district. It is believed that the first time he left his hometown was when he served as an interpreter on the church inspection tour of a Spanish priest named Cristóbal de Albornoz, who was attempting to eliminate idolatries in the small Quechua towns. In the late 1580s to early 1590s, he was an assistant to Fray Martin de Murúa, another Spanish cleric. In 1594 he was employed by the Spanish judge of Huamanga who was in charge of land titles. In late 1600, however, all of his property was confiscated and he was banished from Huamanga, an event that led to his travels throughout the country and most likely to the composition of his masterpiece. Based on a published work, in 1967, by archaeologist Edward P. Lanning, \\"Peru before the Incas\\", one of the first references to an organized culture around the Huaman Culture, was between 1000–1476 CE, known as the \\"Late Intermediate\\", before the Inca Empire expanded, forming alliances with the most powerful empires. The Huaman Family, per stirpes, belonged to the wealthy among the Inca Empire, before and after. As it used to be common, the marriages among the ruling families took place, to remain in control and current. At the time, the Huaman (or Waman, in Quechua; or Guaman after the Spanish conquest) were a selected family of warriors, and land owners in several regions of the pre-Inca empire. They venerated the wild bird (similar to a Falcon), that only grows in the Andean Region of Peru, above 4,000 meters above sea level. There can be found, among the Inca's family tree lines: a) Tarco Huaman Inca, son of Inca Mayta Capac, cousin of Capac Yupanqui, and grandson of Lloque Yupanqui. b) Huaman Achachi, brother of Tupac Inca Yupanqui. c) Inca Huaman Taysi, son of Inca Rocca. d) Landowner Don Antonio Huaman Cucho, in Huamanga City, in 1570 declares ownership of several cities for the descendant of the Huaman Family as an Inca descendant. During the occupation of the conquerors, the Huaman family, being very extensive, were fiercely prosecuted, fearing the overtake of the Andean government, the impeachment of the Hispanic occupation and land ownership claims. Reasons for which most of wealth in pure gold, and ornaments were hidden and re-distributed among the descendants. Most family members moved to different areas from Peru and Ecuador. The most prominent landowners were located in Pariamarca, Santiago de Huaman, Quito and Huamanga. There is a tale that says that direct descendants from the ruling Inca Huaman, are protected and secretly maintained as of \\"ready\\" to overtake the Peruvian empire and re- impose the supremacy of order over chaos. There are tales among the Andeans that one day the \\"...Hawk will fly high, where the Sun surrenders...\\"  Chronicles  thumb300pxThe author on his way to Lima (NC, p. 1105). The text reads: \\"CAMINA EL AVTOR con su hijo don Francisco de Ayala. Sale de la prouincia a la ciudad de los Reys de Lima a dar qüenta a su Magestad. Y sale pobre, desnudo y camina enuierno...\\", \\"The author walks with his son, Don Francisco de Ayala. He leaves the province for the City of Kings Lima to report to His Majesty. And he leaves with no money, poorly dressed for walking in winter...\\" His dogs are identified in the drawing as \\"Amigo\\", friend, and \\"Lautaro.\\" A handful of sixteenth-century documents attest that Guaman Poma served in the 1560s–70s as a Quechua translator for Fray Cristóbal de Albornoz in his campaign to eradicate the messianic apostasy, known as Taki Unquy, from the Christian doctrine of local believers. Guaman Poma appeared as a plaintiff in a series of lawsuits from the late 1590s, in which he attempted to recover land and political title in the Chupas valley that he believed to be his by family right. These suits ultimately proved disastrous for him; not only did he lose the suits, but in 1600 he was stripped of all his property and forced into exile from the towns which he had once ruled as a noble. Guaman Poma's great work was the El primer nueva corónica [sic] y buen gobierno (The First New Chronicle and Good Government), a 1,189-page document written largely in Spanish, with sections in Quechua. He wrote Corónica instead of Crónica, a form of the word common in the Middle Ages. His book remains the longest sustained critique of Spanish colonial rule produced by an indigenous subject in the entire colonial period. Written between 1600 and 1615 and addressed to King Philip III of Spain, the Corónica outlines the injustices of colonial rule and argues that the Spanish were foreign settlers in Peru. \\"It is our country,\\" he said, \\"because God has given it to us.\\"Guáman Poma and Dilke, 204 The king never received the document. The Crónica is remarkable in many ways. First, it has brilliant melding of writing and fine line drawings (398 pages of the book consist of Guaman Poma's famous full-page drawings). The work also includes Guaman Poma's 'Mapa Mundi de Reino de las Indias', a cartographic representation of the Inca Empire drawn in the Mappa mundi style favored by medieval European mapmakers, which placed Cusco, the Peruvian capital, at the center of the world.Adorno, Rolena. “Andean Empire.” In Mapping Latin America. Dym, Jordana and Karl Offen, eds. University of Chicago Press, Chicago: 2011. Second, the manuscript expresses the view of a provincial noble on the conquest, whereas most other existing expressions of indigenous views from the colonial era come from the nobility of Cusco, the ancient capital of the Incas). Third, the author frequently uses Quechua words and phrases in this primarily Spanish work, which provided material for scholars to learn more about Quechua. Guaman Poma proposed a new direction for the governance of Peru: a \\"good government\\" that would draw from Inca social and economic structures, European technology, and Christian theology, adapted to the practical needs of Andean peoples. He writes that indigenous governments treated their subjects far better than the Spaniards and pleads with King Phillip to instate Indians to positions of authority. It is important to note that, although he rejects Spanish rule, he does not reject the Spanish king. During that time, monarchs were typically seen as descendants of God and being strongly Catholic, Guaman Poma holds the Spanish monarch in the highest regard. In his writing, he not only wants to propose changes in society, but also to bring perceived injustices to the attention of the king, who, as representative of God, surely would not have allowed them to occur had he known. The original manuscript of the Corónica has been kept in the Danish Royal Library since at least the early 1660s, though it only came into public view in 1908, when it was discovered by the German scholar Richard Pietschmann. After many aborted facsimile-projects, a heavily retouched facsimile edition was produced in Paris in 1936, by Paul Rivet. In 1980, a critical transcription of the book, based on autopsy of the manuscript rather than on the 1936 facsimile, was published by John Murra and Rolena Adorno (with contributions by Jorge Urioste) as Felipe Guaman Poma de Ayala, Nueva crónica y buen gobierno (Mexico City: Siglo XXI). A high-quality digital facsimile of the original manuscript was published online in 2001 by the Danish Royal Library, with Rolena Adorno as scholarly editor.  Fray Martín de Murúa and Guaman Poma  Twentieth-century scholars had often speculated that there was some relationship between Guaman Poma's Corónica and Fray Martín de Murúa's Historia general del Piru (1616), assuming that Guaman Poma served as an informant or coauthor to Murúa.Fane, 239 In 1967, Condarco Morales compared the texts and concluded that Guaman Poma followed Murúa's work. A direct relationship between Guaman Poma and Murúa was confirmed in 2007–2008 by a project at the Getty Research Institute. The project's principal scholars included Juan de Ossio, Thomas Cummins, and Barbara Anderson, with collaboration by Rolena Adorno and Ivan Boserup. After comparing the two existing manuscripts of Historia general del Piru (one owned by the Getty and the other by a private collector in Ireland), these scholars proved that Murúa's chronicle includes illustrations by Guaman Poma. They concluded that Guaman Poma was one of a team of scribes and artists who worked for Murúa. While Murúa's project began sometime in the 1580s, Guaman Poma became involved only as an illustrator and only shortly before 1600. Still, his contribution to Historia general del Piru is very significant. These findings were the basis of an exhibition and symposium at the Getty Center in October 2008. Guaman Poma notably attacks Murúa in his Corónica, including depicting the friar's striking and kicking an indigenous woman seated at a loom. This image is entitled \\"The Mercedarian friar Martín de Murúa abuses his parishioners and takes justice into his own hands.\\" According to Rolena Adorno, \\"...when he became an author, after 1600, [Guaman Poma] was highly critical of a work by Murúa that he had recently illustrated. Guaman Poma was prompted to write his own account against what he understood to be Murúa's limited perspective, which he had encountered in [the original manuscript of Historia general del Piru]. Guaman Poma wrote about Andean history back to the era predating the Inca. He also elaborated a long and highly critical survey of colonial society, unique among other manuscripts of the era. Guaman Poma's artistic range, displayed in his nearly 400 drawings, was based on his experience gained while working with Murúa, but it also developed in new directions. He revealed a strong polemical and satirical bent that he directed against colonial abuses. \\"Although the evidence suggests that they worked independently after 1600, the efforts of Murúa and Guaman Poma can never be separated, and their talents, individually and together, produced three distinctive testimonies to the interaction between missionary author and indigenous artist-cum-author in early colonial Peru.\\"Adorno and Boserup, pp. 7–75  Name  Guaman's name means \\"Falcon\\" or \\"Aguila\\" when translated into English and Spanish respectively. At the time, a Falcon, had the meaning of a representation of a \\"Supreme Existence\\". Someone, with the \\"designation\\" of a \\"Falcon\\" had the highest regards within the Inca and predesecing cultures. Poma's name meant \\"Puma\\" in Quechua dialect.Boone, Elizabeth Hill Boone and Tom Cummins. Native Traditions in the Postconquest World. Dumbarton Oaks Research Library, 1998: 101. (retrieved through Google Books, 8 Sept 2009) In modern Quechua orthography, it would be spelled Waman Puma,Adorno, lvi and it is sometimes listed as such. Other variants include Waman Poma, Huamán Poma, and Guamán Poma (the latter two with a Spanish accent; the Quechua stress is on the first syllable). In his own writing, he signed with his Quechua name put between his Spanish baptismal name, Felipe (or Phelipe, as he spelled itAdorno, xii) and the family name of a Spanish conquistador connected to his family history, Luis Ávalos de Ayala.Adorno, 17 Guaman Poma writes about the symbolism of all his names in his book. He seemed to consider the form of his name as a statement that his Quechua identity remained his core, although it was surrounded by Spanish names.

Around this time, Craig Cash introduced him to Geoff Lloyd.The Independent: Geoff Lloyd on Craig Cash Lloyd was an aspiring comedy writer and performer, and a fellow radio presenter. In 1996 they were asked by Key 103 to co-present its afternoon show. The duo rapidly established a cult following with their witty and slightly risque banter, and in 1998 won a Sony Radio Academy Award for their show. They were subsequently recruited by Virgin Radio and again rapidly built up a significant audience for its Drivetime Show. By 2003 they were the most popular DJs on the station, and were moved to the Breakfast Show in order to increase the audience. This they did very successfully, sticking to their well-established formula of slightly risque banter about contemporary news and culture, with Mitchell tending to play the \\"straight man\\" to the more outrageous Lloyd. Lloyd occasionally courted controversy with some of his remarks, most notoriously when he expressed willingness to eat the limbs of a dead baby to ease poverty. A complaint against the station was upheld, and Lloyd was reprimanded for his comments. Nevertheless, the audience for the show remained strong, despite (or possibly because of) Lloyd's willingness to stray to the edge of acceptability with his remarks. On 28 November 2005 the duo announced that they were splitting up and leaving the Breakfast Show on Virgin Radio. Their final show together took place on 16 December. Geoff Lloyd remained at Virgin Radio, hosting the Late Show, whilst Pete Mitchell left the station to pursue other projects.

Political career Hamad served as Member of the Zanzibar Revolutionary Council and Zanzibar Minister of Education (1977–1980), founding member of the Zanzibar House of Representatives (1980–1989) and Member of Tanzanian Parliament (1977), Member of the Central Committee and National Executive Committee of Chama cha Mapinduzi (CCM) - Tanzaniania's Ruling Party (1977–1987), Head of the Economic and Planning Department of the CCM (1982–1987) and Chief Minister of Zanzibar from 6 February 1984 to 22 January 1988. Soon after his dismissal, he was expelled from the sole legal party, Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM), after disputes with party officials. From May 1989 - November, 1991 he was imprisoned as a prisoner of conscience. When Tanzania adopted a multiparty political system in 1992, Hamad along with other former CCM members founded the Civic United Front party. The first multiparty elections took place in 1995 and Hamad was the CUF's candidate for the Presidency of Zanzibar. He was narrowly defeated by CCM candidate Salmin Amour, winning 49.76% of the vote to Amour's 50.24%. Observers noted serious irregularities in the poll and the CUF rejected the result as rigged. Hamad was again defeated in the 2000 elections by CCM candidate Amani Abeid Karume. He received 32.96% of the vote to Karume's 67.04%. Observers condemned the poll citing widespread irregularities and instances of intimidation of opposition supporters by the security forces. The Commonwealth of Nations team described the election as a 'shambles'. On 26 and 27 January 2001, more than forty five CUF supporters were gunned down by Tanzanian Security Forces in peaceful demonstration called to protest the imposition of Zanzibar Government against the will of the people. This led to the ruling CCM party and opposition CUF to have a dialogue that resulted in signing MUAFAKA II, a peace accord designed to ensure electoral and constitutional reforms. Most of the planned reforms were not implemented by the government, including, crucially, an agreed credible voter's register prior to the elections of October 2005. In the 30 October 2005 election, according to official results, Hamad was again defeated by Amani Abeid Karume, winning 46.07% of the vote to Karume's 53.18%. CUF disputed the election and refused to recognise Karume as President. International observers, such as the Commonwealth, and National Democratic Institute again noted serious concerns with the fairness of the poll, and the United States boycotted the swearing-in ceremony of Abeid Karume as President. The union elections in December 2005 followed a similar pattern on Zanzibar with CUF carrying Pemba but not Unguja. On 31 October 2010, Tanzanians vote to elect President of Tanzania and Zanzibar and Hamad runs for election, alongside Dr Ali Mohamed Shein of the ruling party CCM who was declared the winner on Monday, 1 November 2010, scooping 179,809 votes against 175,338 votes of Hamad. Dr Shein's victory is equal to 50.1 per cent of all the 364,924 votes cast while Hamad garnered 49.1 per cent. In October 2015 Hamad won the election by 25000 votes against Incumbent Ali Mohamed Sheni but the election commission canceled the election after noticing ruling party had lost the election. In March 2016, Hamad refused to participate in the rerun of the election which brought Dr Sheni to power again illegally . On 18 March 2019 Hamad resigned from CUF and joined another political Party ACT Wazalendo. Political victimisation In January 1988, he was unceremoniously dropped from the Revolutionary Council and removed as the Chief Minister of Zanzibar and in May 1988 he was expelled from the ruling CCM with six colleagues and automatically lost his parliamentary seat in the Zanzibar House of Representatives. In May 1989, he was arrested and taken to court to face (politically motivated) trumped up charges of allegedly being found with government secret documents. From 1989–1991 he was remanded in the Zanzibar Central Prison. In April 2000, he was arrested and charged with trumped up charges of allegedly attacking members of the police and robbing them with a gun. (The charges were finally dropped by the Zanzibar Magistrate’s Court in November 2003). (Link inactive, 2016) Hamadi became the first ever vice president of Zanzibar when Dr. Shein was sworn in as president of Zanzibar, References Category:1943 births Category:Living people Category:Government ministers of Zanzibar Category:Amnesty International prisoners of conscience held by Tanzania Category:Civic United Front politicians Category:Members of the National Assembly (Tanzania) Category:Zanzibari politicians Category:University of Dar es Salaam alumni Category:Members of the Zanzibar House of Representatives Category:Tanzanian prisoners and detainees Category:Heads of government who were later imprisoned ","title":"Seif Sharif Hamad"},{"id":"2481115","text":"The 62nd World Science Fiction Convention (Worldcon) was Noreascon 4, which was held in Boston, Massachusetts, from September 2–6, 2004.

Signs and symptoms Pain and swelling or focal mass at the level of the joint. The pain may be related to a meniscal tear or distension of the knee capsule or both. The mass varies in consistency from soft/fluctuant to hard. Size is variable, and meniscal cysts are known to change in size with knee flexion/extension. Cause Various etiologies have been proposed, including trauma, hemorrhage, chronic infection, and mucoid degeneration. The most widely accepted theory describes meniscal cysts resulting from extrusion of synovial fluid through a peripherally extended horizontal meniscal tear, accumulating outside the joint capsule. They arise more commonly from the lateral joint margin, and occur most often in 20- to 40-year-old males. Diagnosis Magnetic resonance imaging is the modality of choice for diagnosis of meniscal cysts. In their most subtle form, meniscal cysts present as focal areas of high signal intensity within a swollen meniscus. It is not uncommon for radiologists to miss this type of meniscal cyst because the signal intensity is not quite as great as fluid on T2 weighted sequences.2 When this fluid is extruded into the adjacent soft tissues, the swollen meniscus subsequently assumes a more normal shape, and the extruded fluid demonstrates a higher T2 signal typical of parameniscal cysts. Medial meniscus horizontal tear extending into a meniscal cyst. Sagittal T2 images of a medial meniscus horizontal tear extending into a meniscal cyst. Large medial meniscus cyst. Treatment Treatment of meniscal cysts consists of a combination of cyst decompression (intraarticular decompression versus open cystectomy) and arthroscopic repair of any meniscal abnormalities. Success rates are significantly higher when both the cyst and meniscal tear are treated compared to treating only one disease process.

Huitema, Simple Gateway Control Protocol (SGCP) Version 1.1 draft, 30 July 1998 at Telcordia Technologies (formerly Bellcore). The protocol architecture decomposes a telecommunications gateway located at the boundary between the public switched telephone network and an Internet Protocol (IP) network, such as the Internet, into a media gateway controller (MGC) on the IP network, providing call and device control, and multiple media gateways (MGs) that handle the actual media conversion to the analog or digital circuits of the PSTN, or simply connect residential telephones. Other implementations of the architecture refer to the controller as a softswitch. Communication between multiple media gateway controllers is handled by other protocols, such as the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). Shortly after its publication, SGCP was merged with the Internet Protocol Device Control (IPDC) proposal sponsored by Level3 Communications in the Fall of 1998. This led to the definition of the Media Gateway Control Protocol, jointly submitted to the IETF by the authors of SGCP and IPDC in October 1998.

It was the main railway station and terminus station prior to the curtailment of the Newcastle railway line. The current railway station structure was built in 1878 under the direction of John Whitton and was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999, with additional workshops and rail yards surrounding the station also added to the Register on the same day. In September 2018, the Newcastle station precinct was reopened as a multipurpose community space branded as The Station. History Newcastle station was originally located at the site of the Honeysuckle Point Terminus. Early on in the making of the Honeysuckle Point Terminus, Newcastle residents called for an extension to the centre of town and in 1857 the parliamentary select committee recommended, that a single line for goods and passenger traffic be laid from Honeysuckle Point to the wharf at Watt Street. In November 1857 a contract for £6,347, was awarded to William Wright for the extension. The station was located on a spur line which serviced Circular Wharf and was opened on Saturday 20 March 1858. The current station opened on 9 March 1858, replacing the temporary terminus on what later became Civic station. A large goods yard fanned east from the station, constructed in 1858.Newcastle Station NSWrail.netNewcastle Railway Station Group NSW Department of Environment & Heritage With the connection of the original isolated Hunter Valley line to Sydney came the need for a new terminus. Under the supervision of John Whitton, Engineer in Chief of the NSW Government Railways, the new station was erected. The original building was constructed in 1878 and first used in December of that year. It consisted of a central two storey building with single storey pavilions at either end. The ground floor housed a ticket office, waiting room, ladies room, parcels office and a stationmaster's office with administrative offices on the first floor. The pavilions on each end of the main building housed the men's lavatories and porter's accommodation. This new station was designed with a layout typical of NSW railway stations at that time (although was unique in being two-storey) and forms the basis of the station as it exists today. By the late 19th century the popularity of rail travel led to the extension and completion of Platform 2 in 1880, with the subsequent addition of a canopy in 1892 as well as a new parcels office and stationmaster's office. The areas previously occupied by these offices were converted into a dining room and bar. In 1897 a major renovations phase resulted in the demolition of the western pavilion and construction of the two storey kitchen and staff block as well as the original single storey dining room used as a Railway Refreshment Room (RRR), the last major RRR built in the state. In addition a new single storey building was erected. The last major phase of development occurred between 1923 and 1929. It was intended to construct a new building to improve accommodation at the station. This plan did not eventuate, but rather the replacement of the original Scott Street verandah by the current enclosed brick structure and the extension of the single dining room to three storeys. Most of the internal partitions and staircases were constructed during this time. The first floor of the 1878 building was converted to staff bedrooms, and a scullery and change rooms were added. Further minor changes were made during the 1940s and 1950s and the last major works before closure occurred in 1980.EJE Architecture 1996 On 20 September 1987, the diesel multiple unit depot was relocated to Broadmeadow and later redeveloped as a bus station and park land.\\"Broadmeadow Loco Depot\\" Railway Digest December 1987 page 399\\"Newcastle Terminal Commissioned\\" Fleetline issue 257 November 1998 page 204 On the 14 December 2014, hundreds travelled to the city by train to make up the over 3,500 people who gathered at Pacific Park (cnr Hunter & Pacific Streets) to protest against the proposed truncation of the rail line.Rally for the Rail Newcastle (14 December 2014) On 24 December 2014, the Save Our Rail group were granted an injunction by the Supreme Court of New South Wales preventing RailCorp from removing any part of line infrastructure after the closure of the line.

The central booking hall is topped by a lantern and features cornered pavilions. The complex is united structurally by platform verandahs, supported on elaborate brackets, and visually by the common motifs of semi-circular windows, four-panel doors with overhead fanlights, frieze under eaves and the stone quoins/pilasters which define the corners of the buildings. The overall decorative effect is of a restrained Renaissance classicism resulting from the flat detailing. The buildings on either side of the Booking Hall have raised skylights which make interesting variations in the roofline of the complex. The one to the west on the roadside however, was converted into a three-storey hotel for a time and this addition has altered the original symmetry.Kerr/Conners 1975 It was reported to be in good physical condition with low archaeological potential as at 30 September 1997. Platform and services Newcastle Station consisted of four platforms, two of which were allocated for Central Coast & Newcastle Line services and two for Hunter Line services, although in practice all services could use any platform.Central Coast & Newcastle line timetable NSW TrainLink 20 October 2013Hunter line timetable NSW TrainLink 20 October 2013 All four lines were electrified in 1984. A loop was maintained between platforms 1 and 2 until removed in 2012. The station was also a major bus and coach interchange.  Heritage listing  Historically the building reflects the phases of development of the state's second most important city over almost a century and a half, symbolises the expansion of rail into regional NSW and the completion of the major link in the opening up of the north of the state to rail travel. Aesthetically, the station is a fine example of the station type built for larger centres in NSW. Socially the buildings have a unique place in the social activity of Novocastrians over nearly a century and a half. Scientifically the site has potential to reveal information which could provide greater insight into the changing face of rail travel to the state's second major city, the changing face of its relationship with the harbour and the Honeysuckle Point Railway Workshops and the importance in the development of gas lighting in Newcastle City.

Scott, \\"Impact Origins for Pallasites,\\" Lunar and Planetary Science XXXVIII, 2007. History Krasnojarsk meteorite A common error is to associate their name with the asteroid 2 Pallas but their actual name is after the German naturalist Peter Pallas (1741–1811), who studied in 1772 a specimen found earlier near Krasnoyarsk in the mountains of Siberia that had a mass of . The Krasnoyarsk mass described by Pallas in 1776 was one of the examples used by E.F.F. Chladni in the 1790s to demonstrate the reality of meteorite falls on the Earth, which were at his time considered by most scientists as fairytales. This rock mass was dissimilar to all rocks or ores found in this area (and the large piece could not have been accidentally transported to the find site), but its content of native metal was similar to other finds known from completely different areas. Pallasite falls Pallasites are a rare type of meteorite. Only 61 are known to date, including 10 from Antarctica, with four being observed falls.Meteoritical Bulletin DatabaseMetBase The following four falls are in chronological order: *Mineo, Sicily, Italy. A luminous meteor was observed and an object seen to fall with a loud roar in May 1826. Only are preserved in collections. *Zaisho, Japan. 330 g were found on February 1, 1898, after the appearance of a fireball. *Marjalahti, Karelia, Russia. After the appearance of a bright meteor and detonations, a large mass was seen to fall and were recovered in June 1902. At this date the fall site belonged to Finland, and the main mass of Marjalahti is now at the Geological Museum of the University of Helsinki. *Omolon, Magadan Region, Russia. A reindeer-breeder observed the fall on May 16, 1981, and found the meteorite two years later. The fall was confirmed by a meteorological station that had observed a fireball on the same date.  Notable pallasite finds  Brenham Imilac full slice Although pallasites are a rare meteorite type, enough pallasite material is found in museums and meteorite collections and is available for research. This is due to large finds, some of which yielded more than a metric ton. The following are the largest finds: *Brenham, Kansas, United States.

Coincidentally, both the town of Pallasovka and pallasite meteorites were named after the naturalist, Peter Pallas. *Krasnojarsk, Yeniseisk, Russia. A mass of about 700 kg was detected in 1749 about south of Krasnojarsk.The original location of the Krasnojarsk meteorite was: 54° 54' N, 91° 48' E. See: * The Meteoritical Society * Pallas describes the location of the meteorite (which he calls a \\"mass of native iron\\") on p. 525. It was seen by P. S.

Pallasites are named after Peter Pallas for his study of this meteorite. * Seymchan, discovered near the town by the same name, in far eastern Russia in 1967. This main group Pallasite has some areas free of olivine crystals, and may have formed near the junction of the core and the mantle of an asteroid. Multiple masses in excess of 1 tonne have been recovered.

Palmira is the third largest city in the Valle del Cauca, behind Cali and Buenaventura. Geography  Catedral. Palmira is located in southwestern Colombia, lying in the Cauca River valley. 3°31’48” north altitude and 76°81’13” longitude west of Greenwich. The city covers an area of . The average temperature is and it is at an elevation of above sea level. Industry Sugar cane plantations. Important agricultural products are sugar cane, coffee, rice, corn, and tobacco. Palmira is known as the agricultural capital of Colombia, its main source of income is agriculture and specially the sugarcane cultivation. Palmira is home to the most important sugar mills in the country like : Manuelita Sugar Mill, Providencia Sugar Mill, Del Cauca Sugar Mill and more. The illegal burning of waste cane is the main source of air pollution in the city. In 2005, Palmira opened its first large and post modern shopping mall Centro Comercial Llanogrande Plaza, popularly called \\"La Catorce\\", after the department store 'La 14' located in the mall. The indoor/outdoor shopping center has become very popular among Palmireños since its opening as there were until recently no other large shopping malls in the city. Nevertheless, Palmiranos can still do their basic shopping in La Marden or any of its other stores located all throughout the city, specially in El Centro. Before the mall was built, Palmireños had to travel to Cali to many of its shopping centers such as La Catorce De Calima and Chipichape. Llanogrande has many restaurants, several outdoor bars, an indoor cinema, casino, and a small amusement park. It is located on the city's southwest side. In 2014, a second commercial shopping center called “Unicentro Palmira” was opened on the north west side of the city. Transportation Alfonso Bonilla Aragón International Airport, which serves Cali, is located in Palmira. The citizens' most common method of transportation is the motorcycle. There are many of these in the city and many operators ignore traffic laws so that cars on the street have to drive slow and carefully in order to avoid hitting them. In fact, the large numbers of motorcycles has become a new business since the past 5 years. Since there are a lot of motorcycles, their owners have started to offer transporting people from one place to other as if they were taxis. This caused a lot of friction between taxis and \\"mototaxis\\", as many people call them, because it has reduced the demand of people willing to pay for the cost of a taxi. Another method of transportation that is very common, but mostly used as attractive complement to the colonial architecture, are the white carriages which tourists can pay for to have a tour of the city. The city recently began municipal bus service under the name TUPAL that utilize natural gas powered buses. Education Palmira is also famous for having many colleges, this has led it to been called \\"The University City\\". The following universities are located in Palmira. * University of Valle (univalle). The university is the principal higher education institution in the South West of Colombia. It has the third highest number of students in Colombia. The University has 4 campuses, with one of them located in Palmira. The University of Valle has 30,000 students, of which 25,000 are undergraduate and 5,000 are postgraduate students.

They spoke an Algonquian language also known as Pamlico or Carolina Algonquian.  Geography  Pamlico The Pamlico Indians lived on the Pamlico River in North Carolina. Named after them were Pamlico Sound, the largest sound in North Carolina, and Pamlico County. They are one of the most southerly Algonquian tribes on the Atlantic seaboard and the most southerly ones for which scholars collected a vocabulary.  History  The Raleigh colonists referred to the Pamlico in 1585-86 by the name Pomoui. =17th century history= The Arrival of the Englishmen in Virginia, 1607. In 1696, smallpox, called \\"A great Mortality\\", devastated the Pamlico and neighboring Algonquian communities and reduced their populations. In 1701 the explorer John Lawson noted their Algonquian language and vocabulary (Lawson, 1860). By 1710 the Pamlico people were so limited that they lived in a single small village. Algonquian village on the Pamlico River estuary By 1709 the total North Carolina Algonquian population was down to some 600 from at least several thousand at the time of English encounter. The Tuscarora War, 1711-1713, claimed more fatalities among the Algonquian allies than of the Tuscarora. In the late stages, the Tuscarora turned on some of their allies. They likely incorporated some of the Pamlico as slaves. By the end of the century, only a handful of Algonkians remained. With the decrease in numbers came the loss of tribal lands. Thus, the Weapemeoc Indians sold their lands on Albemarle Sound in 1660 and 1662 and started to move to the interior. By 1697 they complained against the encroachments of white settlers in their new location. The English assigned a reservation on Bennetts Creek to the Chawanokes (Chowan) before 1700; they reduced its sized from 12 to by 1707; the Chowanoke sold off land in 1713. After the Tuscarora War, the Machapunga also were assigned to a reservation. Other groups on the Pamlico Sound joined either the Machapunga or the Tuscarora. With growing white presence in eastern Carolina, more products of European origin were introduced to the Indians. Guns were regularly used instead of bows and arrows during the eighteenth century. Iron hatchets had likewise replaced wooden clubs. English clothes were also widely used by the Indians. The Roanoke chief had an English-style house built in 1654. Other practices persisted through the nineteenth century, including the women making baskets of rushes and silk grass. They decorated them with woven-in life motifs. =18th century history= An aged Native man from Pomeiock, c. 1590 During the seventeenth century, the Chawanoke were in frequent and partly hostile contact with their Virginia Algonquian neighbors. Their traditional hostilities with the Iroquoian Tuscarora continued during that tribe's war with the whites, when they were actively engaged in expeditions against the hostiles. The Machapungas and other tribes of Pamlico Sound, however, changed their alliances: before 1700 they were still at war with the Tuscarora and Coree, but in 1711 they sided with them against the English. The Hatteras, Weapemeoc (Paspatank or Pasquotank, Poteskeet, Perquimans and Yeopim) Indians were at that time the most acculturated groups; they remained on the side of the English. Except for the Tuscarora War, there was little open fighting between the Algonquian and English colonists. They had suffered more from epidemics of infectious diseases. Due to small numbers, trade was of little importance. Sale of strong liquors to the Indians was probably the greatest problem created by white traders around 1700. Alcohol was banned from Indian towns in 1703, but the prohibition was never strictly enforced. Little was done for Indian education, even though native languages were being replaced by English during the eighteenth century. A small number of Indians were baptized as Christians by Anglican ministers throughout the late seventeenth and the eighteenth centuries. Tribe members starting adopting English names (sometimes as second names to be used occasionally) shortly after 1700. Indian medicine men earned money by treating white settlers as well as their own people. Some settlers in North Carolina bought Indians as slaves, and others transported them to northern markets. The extent of Indian servitude and slavery is not accurately known. Culture The town of Pomeiock The Pamlico created distinctive dugout canoes, and traveled extensively. Pamlico artifacts have been found as far away as the North Atlantic.http://www.roadstojustice.org/pamlico-county-here-we-come They ate corn, fish, and other agricultural vegetables and fruits. Besides hunting and agriculture, the coastal groups still relied much on fishing and shellfish gathering, drying the products for preservation on reed hurdles over an open fire or in the sun. Sturgeon was not used as a food by the Indians along the coast. Cattle raising is documented for the Paspatanks around 1700 (Lawson 1709). The Tuscarora War disturbed the economic balance of many of the Algonquian groups: the fields of the Machapunga and their allies were destroyed by the English. The Hatteras were prevented from planting by their enemies, and in 1714-1715 needed supplies from the colonial authorities to survive. Political organization with hereditary chiefdoms was still functioning around 1700. Chiefs' corpses were buried in the temples as before. Commoners could purchase the right of burial in the temple precinct with enough money. Shell beads (wampum) served as money, for example, to compensate victims of crimes. =Ceremonies= Marriage restrictions that prohibited marrying first cousins made it difficult to find mates within rapidly shrinking communities. Resulting marriages into other tribes certainly strengthened intertribal bonds. The huskenaw rite appears to have been used as an initiation for both boys and girls. It was held around Christmas and lasted for five or six weeks, during which the adolescents were separated in a special building outside the village. There were some colonial reports that two of 50 families among the Machapungas practiced male circumcision, but this was not typical of the Native Americans.

HEs helps in the attachment and destruction of certain sialic acid receptors that are found on the host cell surface. Viruses that possess HEs include Influenza C virus, toroviruses, and coronaviruses (but not SARS-like coronaviruses). HEs is a dimer transmembrane protein consisting of two monomers, each monomer is made of three domains. The three domains are: membrane fusion, esterase, and receptor binding domains. The different HEs enzyme activities include: receptor binding activity, receptor hydrolysis (esterase) activity, and membrane fusion activity. The receptor binding activity involve the attachment of HEs to N-acetyl-9-O-acetylneuraminic acid (9-O-Ac- Neu5Ac) of glycolipids and glycoproteins and in turn serve as viral receptor. Receptor hydrolysis (esterase) activity allows virus particles to escape the infected cell by removing an acetyl group from the C9 position of terminal 9-O-Ac-Neu5Ac residues. Membrane fusion activity helps in incorporation viral genome into the host cell cytoplasm by enhancing the attachment between the viral envelope and host cell membrane. In certain Influenza viruses, the cell surface consists of both Hemagglutinin (HA) and Neuraminidase (NA) proteins that encompass enzymatic activities, whereas hemagglutinin-esterase fusion (HEF) proteins have been found to be the primary single spike protein that combines all of the enzymatic activities listed above. HEF proteins have been tested to be high-temperature and low-pH resistant and are the primary source of virulence in viruses. Influenza C have been shown to have unique HEF structure proteins that enhance its ability to infect the host cell compared to Influenza A and B. The folding of different domains in the hemagglutinin- esterase protein is important for intracellular transport of proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus. The presence of oligosaccharide chains in the E, F, and R domains of the HE enzyme also influence intracellular transport. Acylation of the hemagglutinin-esterase has shown to play an essential role in virus particle assembly replication. The exact process of enzyme catalytic cleavage has not yet been detailed out. However, proteolytic cleavage must occur before hemagglutinin-esterase membrane fusion activity. HEF proteins have a unique spikes hexagonal arrangement. This feature is unique to Influenza C virus particles. The arrangement is a covering outside of the particle. The structure of the Hemagglutinin Esterase protein.  Structure  Certain studies revealed that coronavirus and Toroviruses HE was originated from HEF glycoprotein that is found in Influenza C viruses which resulted from alteration of Hemagglutinin esterase from a trimer into a dimer glycoprotein. During this process, the receptor destroying enzyme acetyl esterase domain stayed unchanged. However, the HE receptor binding domain has been altered in which that the ligand is bound in opposite orientation than before. Both coronavirus and Toroviruses HE monomers are made up of the same three domains which are: central esterase/hydrolase domain, receptor binding lectin domain, and membrane proximal domain which is small. Both coronavirus (CoV) and Toroviruses (ToV) HE monomers are made up of the same three domains which are: central esterase/hydrolase domain, receptor binding lectin domain, and membrane proximal domain which is small. The two monomers of HE dimer in both CoV and ToV involve the same two contact regions (CR 1and 2). CR 1 contain the receptor binding domain and Contact region 2 that contain membrane proximal domain. Yet, ToV HE contacts region 2 contain additional esterase domain. As a result, the CR 2 surface is larger in ToV HEs than in CoV HEs. However, Close to the carboxylic terminal membrane anchor, there are number of disulfide bridges between Cys385 of Coronavirus HE that in turn keep the HE dimers connected to each other. In CoV HE, the two R domain beta sheets are connected to each other forming a continuous intermolecular Beta sheet across the dimer interface. On the other hand, in ToV they are oriented at angles. As a result, the beta sheet of receptor binding domain in ToV is more twisted, the contact region 1 is smaller, and the R domains position are shifted along the Beta strands compared to CoV. = Crystalline structure = “Initial studies using electron microscopy showed that the HEF spike forms a mushroom-shaped trimer consisting of a membrane-near stalk and a globular head”. Later studies were able to examine and show a higher resolution structure (4.5 Å) of the Hemagglutinin esterase fusion trimer using X-ray crystallography of the bromelain-cleaved ectodomain. Both hemagglutinin and hemagglutinin esterase fusion protein are similar in terms of structure and the folding of individual segments. yet, only 12% amino acid are identical between HA and HEF. One significant difference between HE and HEF is the presence of an additional bulge in HEF globular domain (bottom part of the domain) which contains the esterase region. The receptor-binding region in both HA and HEF is found in the upper part of the domain and contain only HEF1 residues. The stalk is made of three 60 Å long α- helices that contain: all sequences of HEF2 sequence, and certain HEF1 residues which are N-terminal residues (1–40), and C-terminal residues (367–432). The crystalline structure shows that the way that HEF binds to 9-O-Ac- Neu5Ac is the same as the way HA binds to Neu5Ac. The binding parts include an α-helix, a loop and an extended strand. There are hydrogen bonds between the amino acids (Tyr127, Thr170, Gly172, Tyr227 and Arg292) and the hydroxyl-groups of the ligand, and other residues form the structural support of the receptor binding site. A unique hydrophobic pocket is present in the HEF binding site that in turn accommodates the acetyl methyl group.  Activity  Receptor binding activity = Glycolipids and glycoproteins contain N-acetyl-9-O-acetylneuraminic acid (9-O-Ac- Neu5Ac) that serve as viral receptor in which HEF binds to. HEF can bind to its receptor whether or not 9-O-Ac-Neu5Ac is attached by an α-2,3 or α-2,6 linkage to the next galactosyl residue. However, host specificity can be affected by terminal N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) and the glycosidic linkage of Neu5Ac. Influenza C virus can recognize 9-O-Ac-Neu5Ac on the surface of different cells due to its unique receptor specificity. = Receptor hydrolysis (esterase) activity = The receptor hydrolase activity of HEF aids in the release of virus particles from an infected cell using esterase enzyme that cleaves acetyl from the C9 position of terminal 9-O-Ac-Neu5Ac. The esterase activity of HEF which is part of serine hydrolase class includes a nucleophilic attack of the hydroxyl group (OH) of a serine amino acid, with the help of two other amino acids (histidine and aspartic acid), on the carbonyl group of the substrate. Basic histidine enhances the reactivity of serine by polarizing and deprotonating its hydroxyl group. Along with that, aspartic acid polarizes histidine. X-ray crystallography of the crystalline structure of HEF showed that serine 57, aspartic acid 352 and histidine 355 are the important amino acids for the esterase activity. Also, early studies showed that mutation in Ser57 and His355 residues can completely stop the esterase activity of HEF. = Membrane fusion activity = The membrane fusion activity between, the viral envelope and endocytic vesicles of host cell, is important to help the virus inject their genome into the cytoplasm of the cell. In order to activate membrane fusion, Cleaving the precursor proteins HEF0 and HA0 into the subunits into the subunits HEF1 and HEF2, then exposing these proteins to acidic pH must be done prior. Acidic pH causes protonation of specific amino acids that initiate certain rearrangement of the proteins. The protonated amino acid is found to be histidine while its pKa matches the pH of endosome. Studies showed that there is about 0.7 difference in the pH value that trigger the membrane fusion activity from strain to strain of both influenza A and C. Conformational change in HEF structure that occur at low pH results in the separation of fusion peptide from its location at the lower part of the stalk and exposing the outer surface of the molecule, so it can be inserted into the endosomal membrane. Another conformational change occur which cause the bending of the ectodomain to push the fusion peptide toward the transmembrane region. As a result of that, the virus and endosomal membranes get closer, exchanging lipids withhemifusion.Then, opening of a fusion pore and eventually complete merger of both lipid bilayers.  Folding and intracellular transport  The folding of the hemagglutinin esterase protein and the way that the domains of the protein assembles contribute the transport of membrane and secretory proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus. Researchers found that trimerization occurs at a point before exiting the ER. The monomers of the HE protein are folded before assembling is possible. Before the hemagglutinin esterase can report to the Golgi, it must be extensively folded and assembled. The structure of hemagglutinin-esterase contributes to the intracellular transport. The hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) glycoprotein of Influenza C virus is composed of three domains: a stem domain active in membrane fusion (F), an acetylesterase domain (E), and a receptor-binding domain (R). The protein contains eight N-linked glycosylation sites, four (positions 26, 395, 552, and 603) in the F domain, three (positions 61, 131, and 144) in the E domain, and one (position 189) in the R domain. Oligosaccharide chains in the domains influence intracellular transport. A study showed that it was evident that glycosylation at the two sites in the F domain (positions 26 and 603), in addition to that in the E domain (position 144), is required for the HE molecule to be transported from the endoplasmic reticulum and that mutant HEs lacking one of these three sites failed to undergo the trimer assembly. Oligosaccharides are needed to maintain esterase activity in the F and R domains. If any of the domains lack an oligosaccharide chain, cell surface expression will be affected. It was found that HE monomer have acetylesterase activity because they possessed full-enzyme activity despite lack of an oligosaccharide chain. Oligosaccharide chains are important for intracellular transport, but not for fusion activity. Thus, oligosaccharide chains do not really promote membrane fusion.  S-acylation and RAFT-localization  Acylation of the Hemagglutinin-esterase enzyme is necessary for virus replication of Influenza C virus. It was found that recombinant virus lacking the acylation site of HEF could be rescued, but viral titers were reduced by one log relative to wild type Flu C. The resulting virus particles have a regular protein composition and no changes in their morphology were obvious by electron microscopy, but their hemolytic activity is reduced indicating a defect in membrane fusion. This is in comparison to several HA protein subtypes that showed similar results. The hemagglutinin-esterase-fusion protein has co- and post- translational modification, such as N-glycosylation, disulfide bond formation, S-acylation and proteolytic cleavage into HEF1 and HEF2 subunits. The HEF prtoein of Influenza C virus has only one stearate attached to a transmembrane cysteine. Whereas HA of influenza A and B virus are associated with membrane rafts, cholesterol- and sphingolipid-enriched nanodomains of the plasma membrane, HEF is thought to localize to the bulk phase of the plasma membrane.  Proteolytic cleavage  The binding and cleavage properties of the Influenza Cvirions hemagglutinin-esterase (CHE) protein for 9-O-acetyl groups on sialic acids have been used in various assays using whole virions. Proteolytic cleavage must occur before any membrane fusion activity of HE because it enables the protein to become activated by low pH. HEF proteins from all Influenza C virus strains contain a monobasic cleavage site and are in this respect similar to HAs from human, porcine, equine and low pathogenic avian influenza A viruses. Polybasic cleavage sites that are present in HA of highly pathogenic avian influenza A viruses and processed by the ubiquitous protease furin are not found in any HEF protein. Consequently, replication of Influenza C virus is limited to the site of virus infection, the respiratory tract. Unlike other influenza viruses, Influenza C virus does not spread to other tissues. Multiple replication cycles of Influenza C virus in tissue culture are enabled by addition of trypsin, whereas embryonated eggs produce infectious virus with cleaved HEF. The enzyme catalyzing proteolytic cleavage of HEF has not been identified so far, but since both HA and HEF can be cleaved by trypsin at similar concentrations in vitro(5~20 µg/mL) it seems likely that they are also activated by the same enzymes inside cells. It is very common that HA is compared to HEF in many contexts.  Regular arrangement of HE spikes in virus particles  The only spike of Influenza C virus, the hemagglutinin‐esterase‐fusion glycoprotein (HEF) combines receptor binding, receptor hydrolysis and membrane fusion activities. Like other hemagglutinating glycoproteins of influenza viruses HEF is S‐acylated, but only with stearic acid at a single cysteine located at the cytosol‐facing end of the transmembrane region. This HE protein however, has spikes in its structural organization as well. HEF trimers on the surfaces of both spherical and filamentous particles are arranged in a reticular structure that has been described to consist mainly of hexagons. This feature is unique to Influenza C virus particles. Even when HEF is removed from the membrane, the polymeric reticular structure that it originally had can still be seen. These results indicate that the hexagonal arrangement is an intrinsic feature of HEF and does not require other viral proteins such as M1 and that its formation likely involves lateral interaction between the ectodomains of HEF. The formation of the spike arrangement in virus particles acts like a coat around the virus particle by creating and covering it. This is similar to the hydrophobic effect in lipid bilayer membranes where nonpolar molecules and in the interior.  Location of N-glycosylation sites  HEF N-glycosylation sites are located in figure 1. One sequon is located in HEF2 and six in HEF1. There are three in the globular head and 2 in the hinge region that connects the stalk with the head. The site at position 589 is not glycosylated because it is too close to the membrane-spanning region and cannot be accessed by the oligosaccharide transferase.Glycosylation is crucial for proper folding because it protects it from proteolytic degradation from the host cell and is important for the presentation of antigenic epitopes. = In Influenza C = The primary structure of HEF in Influenza C contains 641 amino acids. It is a typical type 1 transmembrane protein with a short N-terminal, cleavable signal peptide, a long ectodomain, a transmembrane region and a very short ctyoplasmic tail. HEF is composed of two subunits, HEF1 consisting of the N-terminal and HEF2 consisting of the transmembrane domain and the cytoplasmic tail. Electron microscopy analyzing the crystal structure of HEF showed that the spike of HEF forms a mushroom-shaped trimer consisting of a membrane-near stalk and a globular head. HEF contains only asparagine-linked carbohydrates which indicates that O-glycosylation does not occur. The location of the individual glycosylation sites in the crystal structure are located on seven of the eight highly conserved N-glycosylation sequons; one is located in the subunit, HEF2 and the other 6 are located on the subunit HEF1. Three sites are in the globular head and two are in the hinge region that connects the stalk with the head. There is a site at position 589 on the crystallized structure that is not glycosylated and this may be due close location to the membrane- spanning regions and cannot be accessed by oligosaccharide transferase. The positions of HA in Influenza A are quite similar to Influenza C by the majority of its carbohydrate positions being located in the larger subunit.  Location of intramolecular disulfide bonds  In HEF1, 12/15 cysteine residues form 6 intrachain disulfide linkages that stabilizes the globular head domain. There are two cysteine residues, Cys373 and Cys399 that do not form disulfide linkages in the mature protein. They are located at the hinge that connects the globular head with the stalk region. The rest of the cysteine residues form interchain disulfide bonds with HEF in the ectodomain area, near the bottom of the trimer. These disulfide bonds in HEF2 allows the subunit to perform large conformational changes that catalyze membrane fusion. = In influenza viruses = In Influenza C, there are 15 cysteine residues in subunit HEF1, 12 of the residues form six intrachain disulfide links that stabilize the globular head domain. Two of the cysteine residues are not required for proper folding and function of HEF and/or they do not form a disulfide linkage in the mature protein located at the connection hinge. The remaining cysteine rescues forms an interchain disulfide bond with the only cysteine residue in the ectodomain of subunit HEF2. This residue is located at the bottom of the trimer. In comparison, Influenza A, has similar disulfide bond distributions with one bond connecting HA1 with HA2, the majority are intrachain bonds. The rare occurrence of disulfide bonds in HEF2 and HA2 subunits allows these subunits to perform large conformational changes that catalyze membrane fusion.  Co- and post-translation modification  During translocation of HEF into the lumen of the ER, the N-terminal signal peptide is cleaved, and carbohydrates are attached. Disulfide bond linkages are formed and remodeled. These modifications affect the folding and trimerization of the molecule. These processes are prerequisites for exiting cargo form the ER. Later on, a fatty acid chain is attached to the cysteine located on the end of the transmembrane region and HEF is cleaved into 2 subunits, this process is essential for virus replication. = In influenza viruses = In comparison, influenza A, B, and C have different spike proteins, the haemagglutinin and the neuraminidase. The HEF surface glycoprotein of Influenza C consists of three activities, receptor-binding, receptor-inactivating, and fusion activity. Receptor-binding mediates the attachment of the virus to N-acetyl-9-O-acetylneuraminic acid on the cell surface, receptor-inactivating releases the 9-O-acetyl group from N-acetyl-9-O-acetylneuraminic acid and the fusion activity depends on the post-translational proteolytic cleavage of HEF into two subunits as well as exposure to an acidic environment. In low pH conditions, a conformational change of HEF occurs. In influenza A, the rearrangement of hydrophobic sequences at the N-terminus of subunit HEF2 becomes exposed and induces the fusion of the viral envelope with the membrane of the target cell. Another way that fuses the viral envelope to the host cell is with endocytic vesicles. HEF does not cleave the terminal silica acid residue from carbohydrates but removes the acetyl group from the position C9 of N-acetyl-9-O-acetylneuraminic acid. This is required to release fresh budded virus particles from infected cells, which otherwise would be trapped in the plasma membrane if the receptor is still present Influenza C is distinguishable from Influenza A and B by its structural components. There are three amino acids that comprises the cytoplasmic portion of HEF, Arginine- Threonine-Lysine, whereas in Influenza A and B consists of ten hemagglutinin amino acids. A post-translational modification of HEF is the acylation with fatty acids.

He was however best known for his alleged role in Operation Keelhaul, the forced repatriation of Russian, Ukrainian and other prisoners of war to the Soviet Union where many were executed. After he was accused of war crimes, he successfully sued his accusers for libel. Life He was the son of Colonel Stuart Low, who died in action in 1942, and Lucy Atkin, daughter of the Lord Atkin. He was educated at Winchester College (where he later became Warden, i.e. chairman of the governing body), and at New College, Oxford where he studied law. He qualified as a barrister in 1939. He had joined the Rangers (King's Royal Rifle Corps), a famous London Territorial Infantry Regiment, in 1934 and served in World War II in Greece, Crete, Egypt, Libya, Tunisia, Italy and Austria, becoming the youngest Brigadier in the British Army in 1944. He was appointed to the Distinguished Service Order in 1941, made a Commander of the Legion of Merit (US) and awarded the Croix de Guerre. Low stood for Parliament as a Conservative in the 1945 general election, and won the seat of Blackpool North. He served as Parliamentary Secretary at the Ministry of Supply 1951–54 and Minister of State at the Board of Trade from 1954, becoming a Privy Counsellor. In 1957, he was knighted and became chair of the Select committee on nationalised industry. In 1959, he became deputy Conservative Party chairman. In 1962 he was created Baron Aldington, of Bispham in the County Borough of Blackpool, and increased his business interests, serving as the chairman of several companies. He had been a director of the Grindlay family banking company, Grindlays Bank, in 1946, following his father and grandfather. In 1964, Lord Aldington became Chairman of the bank as well as of GEC. In 1971, he joined the BBC general advisory council, and became chairman of Sun-Alliance and the Port of London Authority. In 1972, he became co-chairman, with Jack Jones, of the joint special committee on the ports industry. He became chairman of Westland in 1977. Lord Aldington was considered a One Nation Conservative and supported British involvement in the European Union. He continued political activities in the House of Lords, including as chairman of the Lords' select committee on overseas trade. He was also a Deputy Lieutenant for Kent. In 1999, when hereditary peers were excluded from the House of Lords by the House of Lords Act 1999, as a hereditary peer of first creation he was granted a life peerage as Baron Low, of Bispham in the County of Lancashire, so that he could remain. Family Aldington married (Felicité Ann) Araminta MacMichael (died 2012), a daughter of Sir Harold MacMichael, on 10 April 1947. They had a son, Charles Low, 2nd Baron Aldington, and two daughters, (Priscilla) Jane Stephanie, Lady Roberts (Curator of the Print Room at Windsor Castle and Royal Librarian; married Sir Hugh Roberts), and Hon. Lucy Ann Anthea (married Alasdair Laing). Lady Aldington was Patron of the Jacob Sheep Society. Libel case In 1989 Lord Aldington initiated and won a record £1.5 million (plus £500,000 costs) in a libel case against Nikolai Tolstoy and Nigel Watts, who had accused him of war crimes in Austria during his involvement in the Betrayal of the Cossacks at Lienz, part of Operation Keelhaul at the end of the Second World War. Tolstoy had written several books (Victims of Yalta in 1977, Stalin's Secret War in 1981, The Minister and the Massacres in 1986) about the alleged complicity of British politicians and officers with Stalin's forces in the murder of White Russian exiles from Soviet Rule, Cossacks, Croatian paramilitaries and collaborationist fugitives from Tito, as well as 11,000 Slovenian anticommunist fighters. Nigel Watts, who was in a business dispute with one of Lord Aldington's former companies, used this information to further his own cause, printing 10,000 leaflets about Aldington's role in the matter and circulating them to politicians and other figures. Tolstoy avoided paying the damages by declaring himself bankrupt, although shortly after Aldington's death he paid £57,000 in costs to Aldington's estate. In July 1995, the European Court of Human Rights decided unanimously that the British Government had violated Tolstoy's rights in respect of Article 10 of the Convention on Human Rights, describing the damages as \\"excessive and not necessary in a democratic society\\". This decision referred only to the amount of the damages awarded against him and did not overturn the judgement in the libel action. The Times commented: :\\"In its judgment yesterday in the case of Count Nikolai Tolstoy, the European Court of Human Rights ruled against Britain in important respects, finding that the award of £1.5 million levelled against the Count by a jury in 1989 amounted to a violation of his freedom of expression. Parliament will find the implications of this decision difficult to ignore.\\" Subsequently, allegations were made that Aldington had been materially assisted by friends at the Ministry of Defence, who had suppressed crucial documentation, but Tolstoy and Watts were refused Leave to Appeal on the basis of those findings. Nigel Watts was jailed for 18 months in April 1995, after repeating the libel that Aldington was a war criminal in a pamphlet. In 1996 the Court of Appeal upheld an order Aldington had obtained that made the lawyers acting for Tolstoy pro bono parties to the case, and thereby jointly liable with Tolstoy for any costs or damages awarded to Aldington. This order was combined with a requirement that Tolstoy underwrite the cost of Aldington's defence to obtain leave to appeal.

Retrieved 10 February 2015.  Biography  For most of his childhood, Dennis O'Rourke lived in a small country town, where his parents ran a failing business, until he was sent to a Catholic boarding school for his secondary education. In the late 1960s, after two years of fruitless university studies, he went travelling in outback Australia, the Pacific Islands and South East Asia. During this period he worked as a farm hand, salesman, cowboy, a roughneck on oil rigs, and as a maritime seaman. He also taught himself photography and dreamt of becoming a photojournalist. Wanting to make documentary films, he moved to Sydney, where the Australian Broadcasting Corporation employed him as an assistant gardener. He later became a cinematographer for that organisation. From 1974 until 1979 he lived in Papua New Guinea, which was in the process of decolonisation. He worked for the newly independent government, teaching documentary filmmaking skills to Papua New Guineans. His first film, Yumi Yet - Independence for Papua New Guinea, was completed in 1976, and it was widely acclaimed. O'Rourke's film Half Life: A Parable for the Nuclear Age was screened at a Leicester Square cinema in London in 1986. Controversy sometimes surrounded O'Rourke's interactions with, and depiction of, the individuals who were subjects of his documentaries, such as The Good Woman of Bangkok (released in 1991), which concerned a sex worker in Thailand and Cunnamulla (2000), which was made up mostly of monologues by residents of the Queensland town of the same name, discussing everyday life. In 2007, O'Rourke was awarded damages by the Australian Capital Territory Supreme Court for defamation. The action followed the reporting of comments accusing O'Rourke of unscrupulous conduct during the filming of Cunnamulla.

The Guldengroschen's name comes from the fact that it has an equivalent denomination value in silver relative to that of the goldgulden (60 kreuzer). In the latter years of the 1470s and early years of the 1480s Sigismund of Austria issued decrees that reformed the poor state of his region's coinage by improving the silver fineness back to a level not seen in centuries (.937 pure) and created denominations larger than the ubiquitous, but fairly low valued Groschen of 4 to 6 Kreuzer that were in use. In 1484, small numbers of \\"half guldengroschens\\" valued at 30 kreuzer were issued. This was a revolutionary leap in denomination from the smaller pieces, and surpassed even the large testones of Italy which were the highest weight coins in use. Finally, in 1486 the full sized guldengroschen of 60 kreuzers was put into circulation and it was soon nicknamed \\"guldiner\\". For a long time thereafter such coins were also called \\"unciales\\" because their actual silver weight was very nearly one ounce. As large quantities of silver became available other states began issuing guldiners of their own. Bern, in modern-day Switzerland was one of the earliest to follow Tirol by issuing its guldiners in 1493. In 1500, Saxony's mint at Annaberg took minting of guldiners to new heights and the economies of central Europe welcomed these large new coins. Guldengroschen The original Tiroler guldiner was designed so that eight coins minted would weigh in pure silver at one Tiroler Mark. This was fine for Tirol, but much of Europe was accustomed to measuring by the more widely used Cologne mark. The penultimate development of the guldiner occurred in 1518 when the Joachimsthal mint in Habsburg-controlled Bohemia slightly altered the weight of the coin from 31.93 g down to 29.20 g. This made it possible to mint nine guldiners to have the silver weight equivalent of one Cologne Mark, rather than the eight in Tirol. This new coin was known as the Joachimsthaler (Joachimsthal guldiner), but like the guldengroschen being contracted to guldiner, the joachimsthaler became known simply as the thaler. This new coin was an instant success and was the great grandfather of many other similar weight coins like the daalder, dollar, tolar, tallero, etc. 700 Years City of Hall in Tyrol commemorative coin Guldengroschen represented in other coins Guldengroschen itself, has been the main motive for many collectors coins and medals. One of the most recent is the Austrian 700 Years City of Hall in Tyrol commemorative coin, minted on January 29, 2003. The reverse side of the coin shows the Guldiner silver coin. However, the design is negative, representing a coin die, as a reference to Hall’s history as a significant centre for minting coins.

They live mainly in the provinces of Pampanga, Bataan and Tarlac, as well as Bulacan, Nueva Ecija and Zambales. Overview Tarik Sulayman, a prominent Kapampangan leader from Macabebe who fought against the Spanish in the Battle of Bangkusay Channel in June 1571. The province of Pampanga is the traditional homeland of the Kapampangans. Once occupying a vast stretch of land that extended from TondoLoarca, Miguel de, Relación de las Yslas Filipinas, Blair and Robertson volume 5, page 34–187 to the rest of Central Luzon, huge chunks of territories were carved out of Pampanga so as to create the provinces of Bulacan, Bataan, Nueva Ecija, Aurora and Tarlac.Henson, Mariano A. 1965. The Province of Pampanga and Its Towns: A.D. 1300–1965. 4th ed. revised. Angeles City: By the author. As a result, Kapampangans now populate a region that extends beyond the political boundaries of the small province of Pampanga. In the province of Tarlac, the indigenous population of Tarlac City and the municipalities of Bamban, Capas and Concepcion are Kapampangans, while the municipalities of Victoria, La Paz, have a significant Kapampangan population. In Bataan, Kapampangans populate the municipalities of Dinalupihan and Hermosa, and the barangays of Mabatang in Abucay and Calaguiman in Samal. Kapampangans can be found scattered all across the southern barrios of Cabiao in the province of Nueva Ecija and in the western section of the province of Bulacan. Kapampangan enclaves still exist in Tondo and other parts of the National Capital Region. Kapampangans have also migrated to Mindoro, Palawan and Mindanao and have formed strong Kapampangan organizations called aguman in Davao City and General Santos City. Agumans based in the United States and Canada are active in the revival of the Kapampangan language and culture. California-based organizations promoted Kapampangan language and culture and raised funds for charitable and cultural projects in California and in Pampanga. The Kapampangans have produced many Rajahs, Datus, four Philippine presidents, three chief justices, a senate president, the first Filipino cardinal, one Huk Supremo, many Huk Commanders and NPA cadres and many notable figures in public service, education, diplomacy, journalism, the arts and sciences, entertainment and business. Kapampangan farmers plowing with oxen, c. 1900. The oldest artifact ever found in the Province of Pampanga is a 5000-year-old stone adze found in Candaba. It is said to be a tool used in building boats. Earthenware and tradeware dating back to 1500 BC have also been found in Candaba and Porac. Farming and fishing were the main industries of the Kapampangan people. Kapampangans have played a dynamic yet conflicting role in Philippine history. It was the Kapampangans of Macabebe who were formerly Muslim were the first to defend the Luzon Empire from Spanish domination in 1571.Gaspar de San Agustin, Conquistas de las Islas Filipinas 1565–1615, Translated by Luis Antonio Mañeru, 1st bilingual ed [Spanish and English], published by Pedro Galende, OSA: Intramuros, Manila, 1998 Yet it was the Kapampangans that the Spaniards relied on to defend their new colony from the Dutch. It was at this time that \\"one Castillan plus three Kapampangans\\" were considered as \\"four Castillans\\" as long they gallantly served in the colonial armed forces. Such behaviour earned them the stereotype of being quislings in exchange for personal wealth and self-aggrandisement all throughout the archipelago. After their successful battle against the Dutch in 1640, only Kapampangans were allowed to study side by side with the Spaniards in exclusive Spanish academies and universities in Manila, by order of Governor-General Sebastián Hurtado de Corcuera. In 1896, Kapampangans were one of the principal ethnic groups to push and fuel the Philippine revolution against Spain. Yet it was also the Kapampangans of Macabebe that fiercely defended the last Spanish garrison against the revolutionaries. With the outbreak of World War II, Japanese planes invaded the main province of Pampanga and attacked the United States Air Base at Clark Field in Angeles, Pampanga on December 8, 1941. Later Japanese soldiers entered the province of Pampanga in 1942 and the Japanese Occupation formally began. Many Kapampangans joined a group of stronghold soldiers that survived the invasion and officially trained under the 31st Infantry Division, Philippine Commonwealth Army. USAFFE was stationed in Pampanga on July 26, 1941 before the surrender by the Japanese to April 9, 1942. After the Battle of Bataan in 1942, some Kapampangan soldiers of the USAFFE 31st Infantry Division fought four years of battles against Japanese troops. After the fall of Bataan on April 9, 1942, many Kapampangan soldiers of the USAFFE 31st Division surrendered to the Japanese and then participated in the Bataan Death March from Mariveles, Bataan to Capas, Tarlac. Many Kapampangans joined the guerrilla resistance fighters of the Hukbalahap Communist resistance. Many Kapampangan guerrillas and Hukbalahap communist groups fought for more than three years of insurgency during the Japanese Occupation and also fought side by side with allied forces in the main province of Pampanga, helping local troops of the Philippine Commonwealth Army and incoming Philippine Constabulary 3rd Constabulary Regiments stationed at the general headquarters in Pampanga in operations in Central Luzon from 1942 to 1945 against the Imperial Japanese troops. Culture and cuisine Sisig, a very popular Kapampangan dish. Kare-kare Many Kapampangan festivals display an indigenous flavor unique only to the Kapampangan people. Consider the Curaldal or \\"street dancing\\" that accompanies the Feast of Santa Lucia in Sasmuan or the Aguman Sanduk were men cross-dress as women to welcome the New Year in Minalin or the Batalla Festival to re- enact the battle between the native Muslim Moor and the new colonist Native Capampangan Christians, the historical battle between the two religious native Kapampangans. They start the battle in Ugtung-aldo or afternoon and they end it in Sisilim or sunset with the tune of what Macabebeanons and Masantuleñios called BATTALA Masantol, Macabebe and Lubao. The Pistang Danum of the barrios of Pansinao, Mandasig, Lanang and Pasig in Candaba, where food is served on floating banana rafts on the waters of the Pampanga River was originally a non-Christian holiday that is now made to coincide with the baptism of Christ. The Kapampangan New Year or Bayung Banwa that welcomes the coming of the monsoons and the start of the planting season is made to coincide with the feast of John the Baptist. The colourful Apung Iru fluvial procession of Apalit, once a thanksgiving celebration in honour of the river, has become the feast of Saint Peter. The most dramatic festivals can be witnessed during the Mal ay Aldo, which is the Kapampangan expression of the Holy Week. These include the erection of a temporary shrine known as the puni where the pasion or the story of Christ's suffering is chanted in archaic Kapampangan. The melody of the Kapampangan pasion was said to have been taken from their traditional epic, whose original words were lost and replaced by the story of Christ. The highlight of the Mal ay Aldo celebration is the procession of the magdarame or sasalibatbat penitents covered in blood from self-flagellation. Some of them even have themselves crucified every Good Friday at the dried up swamp of barrio Cutud in San Fernando. Kapampangan cuisine, or Lutung Kapampangan, has gained a favourable reputation among other Philippine ethnic groups, which hailed Pampanga as the \\"Culinary Capital of the Philippines\\".

It is bordered on the north by Greenhill Road, on the east by Portrush Road, on the south by Flemington Street and Windsor Road and the west by Fullarton Road. The suburb has a rectangular layout. A number of residential streets in the suburb contain avenues of jacaranda trees, which provide a lush purple colour when they flower in Spring.  History  Glenside, along with its neighbouring suburb of Glenunga were originally known by the name of 'Knoxville'. They were first settled in the 1840s as farming land, and wheat grown in the area was awarded first prize in the Royal Adelaide Show. The area now taken up by Glenunga International High School and Webb Oval, was previously home to slaughterhouses established in the nineteenth century. At one point, the slaughterhouses were exporting overseas and at the same time providing half of Adelaide's lamb requirements. In 1846 the Public Colonial Lunatic Asylum of South Australia was founded at the site of the present-day Glenside hospital. The site has been used almost-continuously since then as a public mental health facility, although its present form occupies a much smaller area than in the twentieth century. In September 2007, following a review of mental health services in South Australia by Social Inclusion Commissioner Monsignor David Cappo, a major redevelopment of the Glenside hospital site was announced. The redevelopment included a new 129 bed specialist psychiatric hospital that was opened on 2012. The Victorian-era hospital buildings were also refurbished as part of the construction of the new South Australian Film Corporation studios, which were opened in October 2011.The Advertiser, 21 October 2011 Much of the remaining unused original hospital site was sold into private hands in 2014.The dark, disturbing past of Glenside’s Z Ward, the lunatic asylum, Adelaide Now, April 24, 2016 A number of coach companies, notably Cobb & Co and those of William Rounsevell, and John Hill were set up in the 1870s and 1880s. Up to 1000 horses grazed the land. At this point, most of the streets were beginning to be named. Most were named by the inhabitants at the time, usually in reference to their original homes in Ireland, England, Scotland, Wales and the United States. However, one street was named after an Aboriginal Word - \\"Allinga\\", meaning sun. In the early twentieth century, a number of businesses started locating themselves in Glenside. The Australian icon, the Hills Hoist clothes line, was invented by the Hill family in neighbouring Glenunga. Other notable businesses were the Symons & Symons glass merchants and one involved in \\"Bland Radios\\".  Demography  At the 2016 Australian Census, the suburb was home to a population of 2,401, with 43.9% male and 56.1% female. The median age of the residents was 45 years old, five years older than the state median age. Ten percent of the population of Glenside were of Chinese heritage. The suburb contains three retirement communities: Victoria Grove and Pineview Village on Greenhill Road and Glenbrook on L'Estrange Street.  Geography and built environs  The suburb is home to Glenside Health Services, a primary mental health facility in the state, on the site of the old Glenside Hospital. Originally established in March 1870 as Parkside Lunatic Asylum, it once occupied approximately one-third of the area of the suburb. Areas were gradually sold for other purposes, with 12 hospital structures being heritage- listed and refurbished for other uses. The South Australian Film Corporation has since taken over a redeveloped portion of the former hospital property as its headquarters following a move from the former studio at Hendon in the north-western suburbs of Adelaide. The new studio includes office accommodation and facilities for film production. The Burnside Village shopping centre is located in Glenside, on the corner of Greenhill and Portrush Roads, serving much of the City of Burnside council area in addition to Glenside. Glenside also contains South Australia's only orthodox Jewish synagogue. Many of Adelaide's Jewish community live nearby in the eastern suburbs in order to walk to the synagogue on Sabbath or other holy days. Although most of the rest of Glenside is residential, there are offices related to mining, veterinary health, primary industries and health services along Flemington and Conyngham Streets and a variety of food and service businesses along Greenhill Road. There are several parks in Glenside as well as the Conyngham Street Dog Park for dog exercise. Symons & Symons reserve, named for a well-known glassmaker who lived and worked in the area in the mid 1900s, is located on the corner of Conyngham and Cator Street. Plane Tree Reserve is located on Cedar Crescent and Plane Tree Avenue. Glenside Olive Reserve, a landscape relic of the former olive grove, is accessible from Amber Woods Drive. Glenunga Reserve is also located on Conyngham Street in the adjacent suburb of Glenunga.

Background Streaming media became mainstream with the advent of portable music players / MP3 player and the convenience of converting and compressing CD music into music file by the computer or the acquisition of products in such formats using on-line music stores like Amazon, iTunes, and 7digital. The network music player is connected to a home router. For convenience a wireless router is often used. The router is connected to the internet and thus enables access to Internet streaming resources. Alternatively, the home network can access the user's collection of music on a computer or on a network-attached storage (NAS) device dedicated to store a user's music files. Audio streaming Audio streaming is one way of transmitting audio files on a continuous feed to a network music player. A common way today is to stream the audio from the computer to a network music player over the more convenient wireless technologies such as Wi-Fi in a networked environment. The computer, which is typically used for storing the music file, acts as a music server by means of server software, often compliant to DLNA (Digital Living Network Alliance) standard. And the network music player is a typical receiver which starts playing an audio file as soon as some of the data has been received so that one does not have to wait for the entire audio file to finish downloading. The MP3 music file is streamed to the network music player in digital format, commonly in the original MP3 format. Therefore, the audio details of the MP3 music are sent wirelessly in the home to the network music player as it is stored on the computer and without loss. The MP3 music files are then converted back into audio signal by the network music player and played. As the MP3 music files are organized by the music server on the computer, the information is also sent to the network music player where the user can see all of the music track information. Many companies working actively in bringing Internet radio into devices are organized in the Internet Media Device Alliance IMDA. In addition to the home networking standards of DLNA, IMDA compatibility standards dedicated to all aspects of Internet radio distribution. Internet radio Internet reaches many areas in the world, and thus does Internet radio. It has expanded enormously with an estimated 19,000 stations currently available, including many traditional FM /AM simulcasting their content over the Internet. Online music services Online music services usually offer millions of songs and thousands of artists for users to choose from. Network music players that support online music services let users access this vast selection of music tracks. Station directory services keep a current list of active Internet radio stations, their URI and streaming formats and list them sorted by genre, location, language and other criteria. Many devices use either proprietary vendor-specific station list servers or dedicated directory services. Categories There are generally two types of network music players: * Those without speakers that need to be connected to an audio system in order to listen to the music. Examples of commercial devices are the Philips Streamium NP1100 and NP2500, the Logitech Squeezebox, the Roku SoundBridge (M500, M1000, M2000 and M1001), and the Grace Digital IRDT200. * Those with their own speakers. Examples of commercial devices are the Connected Flow range of devices from Pure Digital, TerraTec Noxon family, Philips Streamium NP2900 the Logitech Squeezebox Boom, the Roku SoundBridge Radio (R1000), and Grace Digital models IR1000-IR2500. Also many higher end audio devices such as AVRs and systems from Denon, Pioneer and Onkyo include Internet radio capability. Hardware A Sonos controller (bottom left) tuned to an Internet radio station Network music players usually have: * Broadband connection: an Ethernet and/or Wi-Fi network interface, with TCP/IP support for access to the Internet * USB port, where the user can connect an external MP3 player like iPod or external harddrive for MP3 files * LCD, remote control * Built-in amplifier/speaker, or AUX-out port, that can be used to connect to a HiFi or similar audio device * Rechargeable batteries for mobility with internal charger integrated * Favorite streams & contents can be saved as presets * Clock with lighted display, some with alarm settings and auto-time-sync Some devices also have: * Memory card reader: SD or even SDHC card * XLR connectors * (MP3) stream encryption See also * FM radio * DAB * Digital photo frame * Network Media Player * Radio receiver * Smart speaker References Category:Internet audio players ","title":"Internet radio device"},{"id":"2481272","text":"Diamond Music is a 1996 album by Welsh composer Karl Jenkins. One of Jenkins's most recognised works is the first movement of the suite Palladio, inspired by 16th-century architect Andrea Palladio and in the style of a concerto grosso. This piece, in varying arrangements, has served as the music for DeBeers television advertisements since the company's \\"Shadows and Light\\" campaign in the mid-1990s. For this reason, the album is titled Diamond Music and the cover art features shadowed figures and photographs of diamonds much like the imagery used in the ad campaign. Jenkins' compositions in this album encompass a broad polystylistic range, contrasting delicate pieces written for string quartet with the broad sound of a string orchestra. \\"String Quartet No. 2\\" includes movements in the Baroque style of Antonio Vivaldi (\\"The Fifth Season\\") as well as a tango, waltz, hoedown, and others. The four \\"Adiemus Variations\\" are reworkings of Jenkins' own piece \\"Adiemus\\" from Adiemus: Songs of Sanctuary.

He had a friendly relationship with fellow chancellor Zhang Jiuling, and when another chancellor, Li Linfu, managed to convince Emperor Xuanzong that both Zhang and Pei were engaging in factionalism, both were removed, although Pei continued to serve in important positions in the imperial administration until his death in 743. He was known for improving the food transportation system between the capital Chang'an and the eastern capital Luoyang, obviating the need for the emperor to periodically move between the two capitals.  Background  Pei Yaoqing was born in 681, during the reign of Emperor Gaozong. He was from \\"The Wu Pei from south\\" of the prominent Pei clan of Hedong. Pei Yaoqing's grandfather Pei Shen () served as a county magistrate during Tang, and his father Pei Shouzhen () served as a prefectural prefect.New Book of Tang, vol. 71.

He later passed a special imperial examination for boys,Old Book of Tang, vol. 98 .New Book of Tang, vol. 127 .According to the New Book of Tang, vol. 44 , only boys under nine years old were eligible for this examination, and therefore Pei must have passed the examination in 689 or earlier. and in his youth became an assistant secretary at the Palace Library. He later served as the communications for Emperor Gaozong's son Li Dan the Prince of Xiang. Li Dan respected him, and made him and his colleague Wei Liqi () consultants. After Li Dan, a former emperor, returned to the throne in 712 (as Emperor Ruizong), he made Pei Guozi Zhubu (), the secretary general at the imperial university.  During Emperor Xuanzong's reign  Early in the Kaiyuan era (713-741) of Emperor Ruizong's son Emperor Xuanzong, Pei Yaoqing was made the magistrate of Chang'an County—one of the two counties making up the Tang capital Chang'an. At that time, Chang'an County put governmental funds in trust with rich households to have them manage the funds for the government, leading to much trouble for both government and the people. Pei ended the practice and retrieved the funds from the rich households, reducing both corruption and burden on these households. He served as magistrate of Chang'an County for two years, and it was said that he drew a balance between strictness and laxity. When he left that office, the people missed him greatly. In 725, Pei became the prefect of Ji Prefecture (濟州, roughly modern Liaocheng, Shandong). That year, Emperor Xuanzong offered sacrifices to heaven and earth at Mount Tai, and as he went through the various prefectures, the prefectural prefects were rushing to offer him tributes—but Emperor Xuanzong was impressed by three prefects—Wang Qiu (), Cui Mian (), and Pei, who offered no luxury items—and in Pei's case, what he offered was several hundred suggestions, all of which were aiming toward correcting Emperor Xuanzong's behavior. Emperor Xuanzong was particularly impressed with one of the suggestions, which stated, \\"If you cause great harm to the people, then you cannot say that the realm is peaceful.\\" Emperor Xuanzong promoted the three of them—in Pei's case, to be the prefect of the more important Ding Prefecture (定州, roughly modern Baoding, Hebei). At the time that his promotion was announced, he was overseeing a project to repair the Yellow River levees. Instead of departing immediately for Ding Prefecture, he delayed his departure to make sure that the levees would be complete. He later successively served as the prefect of Xuan (宣州, roughly modern Xuancheng, Anhui) and Ji (冀州, roughly modern Hengshui, Hebei, note different prefecture than his previous post) Prefectures, before being recalled to Chang'an to serve as the deputy minister of census (戶部侍郎, Hubu Shilang). In 732, Emperor Xuanzong commissioned his second cousin Li Hui () the Prince of Xin'an to command an army against Khitan and Xi tribes which would not submit to Tang suzerainty, with Pei as Li Hui's deputy. After Li Hui scored a major victory over both the Khitan and the Xi, Emperor Xuanzong ordered Pei to tour the Xi tribes that were submissive and which had participated in the campaign, to award a large amount of silk to them. Pei, realizing that such a journey would be filled with danger as other tribes might become aware and might attack, proceeded quickly on the trip and divided his train into several groups, awarding the silk quickly and then returning to Tang territory. Indeed, hearing about Pei's tour, Eastern Tujue and Shiwei forces launched a raid against him, but by the time that they arrived, Pei had already returned to Tang territory. In winter 732, he was made the mayor of Jingzhao Municipality (), which encompassed Chang'an. In fall 733, there was much raining in the Guanzhong region (i.e., the region around Chang'an), causing flooding and rise in food prices. Emperor Xuanzong considered going to the eastern capital Luoyang, to decrease the need to requisition food supplies, and he summoned Pei to discuss with him. Pei suggested revising the food shipment scheme at that time to reduce the need for such journeys. Pei's proposal included several points:Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 213.Bo Yang Edition of the Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 51. * At that time, most of the food supply was coming from south of the Yangtze River and were shipped by ships from the region, which were unfamiliar with the waters in the Yellow River region, the journeys were often slow, often causing thefts or embezzlement. Under Pei's proposal, a large food storage would be built at Hulao, where Bian River (汴水, a major shipping route from the Yangtze to the Yellow) joined Yellow River, and the ships from the Yangtze region would offload their supplies at Hulao. * The food supply would then be shipped from Hulao to Luoyang on either the Yellow River or the Luo River (洛水, flowing near Luoyang). * One large food storage would be built on each side of Sanmenxia. The food supplies intended for Chang'an would be shipped from Luoyang to Sanmenxia and stored there. * A road would be built from Sanmenxia upstream to the Wei River, allowing food to be shipped on land when the water flow was unsuitable for shipping on water. * Once the food supply had been shipped to the Wei River either on land or on water, the food could then be shipped easily to Chang'an. Emperor Xuanzong agreed with the proposal. Later that year, when he removed the chancellors Xiao Song and Han Xiu from their chancellor positions, he made Pei and Zhang Jiuling new chancellors to succeed them. Specifically, Pei was made Huangmen Shilang (), the deputy head of the examination bureau of government (門下省, Menxia Sheng) with the chancellor de facto designation Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (). He was also made the director of food supply shipments (轉運使, Zhuanyun Shi). In 734, Zhang proposed that private citizens be allowed to mint money. Pei opposed, pointing out that the quality of the coins would be greatly reduced. Emperor Xuanzong, with opposition also from Liu Zhi, decided not to allow private minting. Later that year, Pei was made Shizhong (), the head of the examination bureau and a post considered one for a chancellor. Pursuant to Pei's proposal, a shipping station was built at the point where the Yellow River and the Bian River joined, with two large food storages—Heyin Storage () to the east and Boyai Storage () to the west. At Sanmenxia, Jijin Storage () was built to the east, and Yan Storage () was built to the west. A road 18 li long (roughly nine kilometers) was built from Sanmenxia to the Wei River. With Pei's plan implemented, the government received considerably savings during the next three years, and Pei's subordinates suggested that he submitted the surpluses to the emperor as a tribute. Pei stated, \\"This is money saved for the government. How can I use it to ingratiate the emperor?\\" Instead, he saved the money for future transportation improvements.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 214. By 736, however, Pei was caught in the middle of palace intrigue, with fellow chancellor Li Linfu beginning to gain favor at the expense of Pei and Zhang, who were friendly with each other. At that time, there were several incidents for which the blunt Zhang had offended either Emperor Xuanzong—who was described to have begun to tire of governance and started seeking luxuries in earnest—or Li Linfu, who was described to be ingratiating the emperor: * In fall 736, when Emperor Xuanzong was at Luoyang, he had set to return to Chang'an on March 7, 737.兩千年中西曆轉換 However, at that time, an incident occurred where there were strange apparitions appearing in the Luoyang Palace, and Emperor Xuanzong did not want to stay at Luoyang. On or right before November 9, 736,兩千年中西曆轉換 he summoned the chancellors to ask them whether he could depart for Chang'an immediately. Pei and Zhang, pointing out the fact that it was harvest season and that the imperial train would interfere with harvest, requested a one-month delay. After Pei and Zhang exited, however, Li Linfu remained personally and stated his agreement with the departure, arguing that the farmers could be compensated by relieving their taxes. Emperor Xuanzong was pleased and immediately departed for Chang'an. * Emperor Xuanzong was, then, impressed with Niu Xianke, the military governor (jiedushi) of Shuofang Circuit (朔方, headquartered in modern Yinchuan, Ningxia), wanted to make him the minister of defense. Zhang, who pointed out that Niu was not well-learned and had started from the ranks of low-level administrators—contrary to the Tang tradition of going through the imperial examinations—opposed, and then further opposed the creation of a title. Eventually, despite Zhang's opposition, Emperor Xuanzong, with concurrence from Li LInfu, created Niu the Duke of Longxi. * Li LInfu was associating with Emperor Xuanzong's favorite concubine Consort Wu and trying to have Emperor Xuanzong make her son Li Mao () the Prince of Shou crown prince to replace Emperor Xuanzong's then-crown prince Li Ying, who had long lost Emperor Xuanzong's favor. With Zhang strenuously opposing such a move, Li Ying remained in his position. * The deputy minister Xiao Jiong (), whom Li Linfu recommended, was demoted on the suggestion of Zhang and Zhang's friend Yan Tingzhi (), who further offended Li Linfu by refusing to meet with him. Soon thereafter, there was an incident where Wang Yunyan (), the husband of Yan's ex-wife, was accused of corruption. Yan tried to intercede on Wang's behalf, and this was discovered. Li Linfu thus made accusations to Emperor Xuanzong that Zhang and Pei were engaging in factionalism. Around the new year 737, Emperor Xuanzong removed Pei and Zhang from their chancellor posts, making them Chengxiang () -- the heads of the executive bureau (尚書省, Shangshu Sheng) instead. Niu was made chancellor to replace them, serving with Li Linfu. At the same time, Pei was created the Marquess of Zhaocheng. Later in 737, there was an incident in which the Yang Jun () the prefect of Yi Prefecture (夷州, roughly modern Zunyi, Guizhou), was accused of corruption and received a death sentence. Emperor Xuanzong commuted the sentence to caning for 60 times and exile to Gu Prefecture (古州, roughly modern Lạng Sơn Province, Vietnam). Pei submitted a petition, pointing out that while caning instead of death was grace already, public caning nevertheless was undignified for someone who had been an honored official. Emperor Xuanzong agreed and commuted the caning as well. In 740, Emperor Xuanzong, impressed at the military accomplishments of the general Gai Jiayun (), the military governor of Hexi (河西, headquartered in modern Wuwei, Gansu) and Longyou (隴右, headquartered in modern Haidong Prefecture, Qinghai) Circuits, summoned him to the capital to reward him and commissioned him to plan an attack on Tufan. Gai, happy about the imperial favor, lingered in Chang'an and did not immediately depart. Pei submitted a petition, pointing out that while Gai was brave, he was becoming arrogant and unattentive in light of imperial favors. He suggested that Gai's commission be cancelled, or, in the least, that Emperor Xuanzong order Gai to immediately return to his command. Emperor Xuanzong did the latter. Later, as Pei predicted, Gai was unable to prevail over Tufan. Pei continued to serve as Pushe for the next several years. He died in 743 and was given posthumous honors.

The Pancharatra movement created numerous literary treatises in Sanskrit called the Pancharatra Samhitas, and these have been influential Agamic texts within the theistic Vaishnava movements.Oriental Institute, Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda (1940). Gaekwad Oriental Series, Issue 86, p.7. Literally meaning five nights (pañca: five, rātra: nights),Jones, Constance and Ryan, James D. (2007). Encyclopedia of Hinduism, p.321-322. Infobase Publishing. the term Pancharatra has been variously interpreted. The term has been attributed to a sage Narayana who performed a sacrifice for five nights and became a transcendent being and one with all beings.Sharma, C. D. (1991). Critical Survey Of Indian Philosophy, p.336. Motilal Banarsidass Publications. The Pancharatra Agamas constitute some of the most important texts of many Vaishnava philosophies including the Dvaita Vedanta of Madhvacharya and the Srivaishnava Sampradaya of Ramanuja. The Pancharatra Agamas are composed of more than 200 texts;Datta, Amaresh (1987). Encyclopaedia of Indian Literature: A-Devo, p.95. Sahitya Akademi. likely composed between 600 AD to 850 AD. The Shandilya Sutras (~100 CE) is the earliest known text that systematized the devotional Bhakti pancharatra doctrine and 2nd-century CE inscriptions in South India suggest Pancharatra doctrines were known there by then. The 8th- century Adi Shankara criticized elements of the Pancharatra doctrine along with other theistic approaches stating Pancaratra doctrine was against monastic spiritual pursuits and non-Vedic. The 11th-century Ramanuja, the influential Vaishnavism scholar, developed a qualified monism doctrine which bridged ideas of Pancharatra movement and those of monistic ideas in the Vedas. The Pancharatra theology is a source of the primary and secondary avatar-related doctrines in traditions of Hinduism. History Pancharatra has likely roots in 3rd-century BCE, as a religious movement around the ideas of a sage Narayana who is an avatar of Vishnu. The earliest use of the word Pancharatra is found in section 7.1.10 of the Taittiriya Samhita, a Vedic text. The section describes a person going through a Pancharatra ritual to become a master of rhetorics. The section 13.6 of the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa mentions Nārāyaṇa as the primordial divinity who performs this offering. The Narayaniya section of the Mahabharata (XII, 335-351) refers to seven rishis who say the Pancharatra ritual was made consistent with the Vedas. Though the five day ritual is mentioned along with many other sacrifices in the Vedic text, the origins of Pancaratra devotees of Vishnu and their tradition is unclear. The movement merged with the ancient Bhagavata tradition also around Krishna-Vasudeva, and contributed to the development of Vaishnavism. According to J. A. B. van Buitenen, the word \\"Pancharatra\\" is explained in Naradiya Samhita as referring to a tradition of \\"five knowledges\\". Similarly, Jan Gonda states that the term \\"nights\\" in \\"five nights\\" in the Pancharatra tradition may be a metaphor for inner darkness, and \\"came to mean – how, we do not know\\", though indeed there have been many interpretations such as \\"five systems\\", \\"five studies\\" and \\"five rituals\\". The 1st-century works by Shandilya are the earliest known systematization of the Pancharatra doctrine. This doctrine was known and influential around then, as is attested by the 2nd-century CE inscriptions in South India. Evidence suggests that they co- existed with the Bhagavata tradition in ancient times. The Advaita Vedanta scholars, such as Adi Shankara, criticized elements of the Pancharatra doctrine along with other theistic approaches stating it was against monastic spiritual pursuits and non-Vedic. According to Suthren Hirst, Shankara supported the use of icons and temple worship if it focussed as a means to comprehend Brahman as the sole metaphysical reality. However, he opposed devotional theism as an end in itself and the goal of spiritual pursuits. The Pancharatra tradition has historically disagreed with claims of it being non- Vedic, states Gonda, and Pancharatra texts explicitly state that, \\"Pancharatra is Vedic, it originates in the Sruti\\" and that the \\"Pancharatra precepts and practices should be observed by anyone who has allegiance to the Vedas\\". The 11th-century Ramanuja, the influential Sri Vaishnavism scholar, was born in Pancharatra tradition, disagreed with Shankara, and developed a qualified monism doctrine which integrated ideas of Pancharatra movement and those of monistic ideas in the Vedas., Quote: \\"The establishment of the teaching of the Pancharatra as Vedic in character and as one form of Vaishnavism was one of the achievements of Ramanuja\\". Ramanuja stated that the Vishnu of Pancharatra is identical to Vedanta's Brahman, where Purusha reflects the eternal soul that is Vishnu, and Prakriti the impermanent ever changing body of Vishnu. Vishnu worshipers of today, represented in a wide spectrum of traditions, generally follow the system of Pancharatra worship. The concept of Naḍa and Naḍa-Brahman appear already in Sāttvata Samhita or Sāttvata Tantra and in Jayākhya Samhita, two texts considered most canonical of Pancharatra texts. Ānanda Tīrtha the founder of Madhva line has written in his commentary on Mundaka Upanishad: dvapariyair janair viṣṇuḥ pancarātrais ca kevalam kalau tu nāma-mātreṇa pujyate bhagavan hariḥ \\"In Dvapara Yuga, Vishnu is exclusively worshiped according to the principles of the Pancharatra Scripture, but in this age of Kali Yuga, the Supreme Lord Hari is worshiped only by the chanting of his Holy Name.\\" Jiva Gosvami had stated in his Paramātma Sandārbha, forming part of six principal Sandārbhas, or philosophical treatises of Gaudiya Vaishnavism, that, \\"Seeing that the imperfect scriptures in the modes of passion and ignorance bring only a host of troubles, and also seeing that the original Vedas are very difficult to follow properly, and thus being very dissatisfied with both of these, the all-knowing scripture authors affirm the superiority of the Pancharatras, which describe the pure absolute truth, Narayana, and the worship of the Lord, which is very easy to perform.\\"  Divine Manifestation The Pancharatra theology developed over time. It presents a dualistic theory on how creation manifested from a godhead, as the Purusha-Prakriti and as the masculine-feminine manifestations of the divine., Quote: \\"The dualism of Samkhya-Yoga is fundamental to the Pancaratra tradition.\\" It states that the creation emerged through vyuhas (arrangements). In the beginning, states Pancharatra doctrine, there was only Vāsudeva-Krishna (Vishnu-Narayana, Vāsudeva literally means \\"indwelling deity\\")Doris Srinivasan (1979), \\"Early Vaiṣṇava imagery: Caturvyūha and variant forms\\", Archives of Asian art, Volume 32, pp. 39-40, 43-54 as the highest changeless god. It arranged into Saṅkarṣaṇa (Balarama) as the lord over all life, then Pradyumna creating mind, and Aniruddha as ego (ahamkara). Thereafter, Brahma emerged from Aniruddha who created the empirical universe. Thus, the divinity was and is everywhere in Pancaratra, but in different aspects, one form or phase emerging from the previous. During the 11th century AD Ramanuja, a founder of Sri Vaishnava traditions of Vaisnavism had established the Pancharatra system of Vaisnavism for his followers. His philosophy of worship of Narayana was based on the pancaratric teachings. Ramanuja taught that the deity absolute, Parabrahman, manifests in five possible aspects: Para, Vyuha, Vibhava, Antaryamin, and Archa. Living beings can interact with the divine through one or another of these five:Siddheshwar R Bhatt (1968), The Philosophy of the Pancharatra: Advaitic Approach, Ganesh, page 38-41 *Para: the invisible, eternal supreme ; *Vyuha: the invisible, impermanent supreme in form; *Vibhava: also called the Avatharam, are the incarnations of the supreme in various yuga (eras in Hindu cosmology) such as the Dashavatara; *Antaryamin: not directly perceptible but can be inferred, the aspect of supreme whose presence can be felt by the devotee; *Archa: visible icon form, filled with symbolism, consecrated in temples or revered images inside home (Shalagrama, conch shell, festive decorations), a means to remember and meditate on the supreme. To worship Lord in temples- The ancient civilization systematically developed cities, towns and villages according to the scriptures written with Vedic knowledge and build temples to consecrate the Idol of lord and prescribed the rules to worship, offering, to do festivals by bring people together from all walks of life with all civic sense. Interestingly, while doing festivals the scriptures insist clean environment and maintaining of medical, stay and food facilities for pilgrimage visit the festival =Influence= The Vyuha-related Pancharatra theology is a source of the primary and secondary avatar-related doctrines in traditions of Hinduism, particularly Sri Vaishnavism. According to Barbara Holdrege, a professor and comparative historian of religions, the Pancharatra doctrines influenced both Sri Vaishnavism and Gaudiya Vaishnavism, albeit a bit different. In Sri Vaishnavism, Vishnu-Narayana is supreme, while Vasudeva, Samkarsana, Pradyumna and Aniruddha are the four Vyuhas. In Gaudiya Vaishnavism, the Vyuha theory is more complex, Krishna is \\"Svayam Bhagavan\\" (the ultimate, Brahman) who manifests as Vyuhas, and he along with Samkarsana, Pradyumna and Aniruddha are the Vyuhas and the Purusha-avataras of the material realm. Practices 11th- century Vaikuntha Chaturmurti. It is one of the iconic representation of the Pancharatra Vyuhas theory found in some medieval Hindu temples.Vaikuntha Chaturmurti, Gujarat, 11th century, Prince of Wales Museum, Art and Archeology Magazine The Pancharatra tradition has taught Panchakala or five observances every day. The first is called Abhigamna or ablutions and morning prayers to god. This is followed by Upadana or collecting worship materials. The third practice is Ijya or worship with offerings. The fourth practice in the Pancharatra tradition has been daily study or Svadhyaya. The fifth recommended practice is Yoga and meditation. The significance of divine manifestation theology in Pancaratra tradition is it believes that an understanding of the process by which Vishnu-Narayana emerged into empirical reality and human beings, can lead one to reverse the process. Through practicing the reversal and moving from the empirical to ever more abstract, according to Pancaratra, human beings can access immanent Vasudeva-Krishna and thereby achieve salvific liberation (moksha).Mitsunori MATSUBARA (1994), The Concept of Vasudeva as the Hindu Bhagavat, Journal of Esoteric Buddhism, Vol. 184, pp. L158-L157, context: L164-L157, =Temples= The Vaishnava temples and arts since the Gupta Empire, states Doris Srinivasan, attempted to present the Pancaratra ideas. In this system, states Srinivasan, \\"Vāsudeva, literally, \\"the indwelling deity,\\" is the first emanation and the fountainhead of the successive emanations, which may be represented either anthropomorphically or theriomorphically in Hindu art\\". As one circumambulates the ancient and medieval Vaishnava cave temples, the devotee walks past from the icon representing Vāsudeva (most abstract) and then the successive Vyuhas (literally, \\"orderly arrangement\\").  Pancharatra Texts  The Bhaktisūtras of Shandilya were one of the earliest systematic treatises on the Pancaratra doctrine. The Pancaratra literature constitutes the Āgama texts of Vaishnavism. Like the Shaivism counterpart, it not only presents the theology, but describes the details, symbolism and procedures of Vaishnava temples building and rituals. According to the Pancharatra tradition, there are 108 samhitas, but its texts list over 200 samhitas. Many Pancaratra texts have been lost. Some surviving Pancaratra texts, with their general focus, are: *Sasvata Samhita: treatise on divine manifestations (vyuhas), thirty nine incarnations of Vishnu, and worship methodology *Ahirbudhnya Samhita: discusses philosophy, vyuha theory, alphabet and rituals *Hayashirsha Samhita: rituals and deities *Padma Samhita: Panchakala practices for the devotee, festivals and mantras *Paushkara Samhita: iconography and worship, believed to be a gem along with Satvata Samhita *Maha Sanatkumara Samhita: a large text on religious practice *Isvara Samhita: meditation, worship and rituals. =List of agamas= The Pancharatra texts are samhitas and tantras which both classify as Agama due to subject matter. The Agamas are predominantly divided into Saiva, Sakta and Vaishnava Agamas. The Vaishnava Agamas identify Brahman as Vasudeva. The Mahabharata subscribes to the Pancharatra philosophy in its Narayaniya section. The Vaishnava Agamas are Pancharatra Agama and Vaikhanasa Agama. Some of the Samhita's are, a list mainly based on the list of the Sanskrit texts from the H.

It tells the story of a weatherman in the midst of a mid-life crisis. The film was released on October 28, 2005, and grossed $19 million worldwide. Plot A successful weatherman at a Chicago news program, David Spritz (Nicolas Cage) is well paid but garners little respect from people in the area who throw fast food at him, David suspects, because they're resentful of how easy his high-paying job is. Dave also feels overshadowed by his father, Pulitzer Prize-winning author Robert Spritzel (Michael Caine), who is disappointed in Dave's apparent inability to grow up and deal with his two children. The situation worsens when Robert is diagnosed with lymphoma and given only a few months to live. As he becomes more and more depressed, Dave takes up archery, finding the activity a way to build his focus and calm his nerves. David later remembers a conversation between himself and his father, where his father explains to him that \\"the harder thing to do and the right thing to do are often the same thing\\" and that \\"nothing that has meaning is easy\\". David appreciates this advice but struggles to implement it. To prove himself to his father and possibly reconcile with Noreen (Hope Davis), his estranged wife, Dave pursues a weatherman position with a national talk show called Hello America. The job would nearly quadruple his salary, but means relocating to New York City. When Hello America invites him to New York, he takes his daughter, Shelly (Gemmenne de la Peña), with him and bonds with her by helping her shop for a more suitable wardrobe. While away, Dave learns that his son Mike (Nicholas Hoult) attacked his counselor, Don Bowden (Gil Bellows), claiming that the man wanted to perform oral sex on him. Despite this stress and an all-night drinking binge, Dave impresses the Hello America interviewers and is eventually offered the job. When he returns, Dave slaps Russ (Michael Rispoli), Noreen's boyfriend, when he finds him dealing with his son's predicament. Dave later confronts the counselor at his home, beating him up and warning him that he is in store for worse. The family holds a living funeral for Robert (organised by Dave's mother, Lauren, played by Judith McConnell), in which Dave asks Noreen to reconcile and move to New York, but she has decided to marry Russ. Dave and Robert have one final talk, in which Dave breaks down in tears, unsure of his life's choices. Robert consoles him, telling him that he has time to \\"chuck\\" the garbage of his life.
