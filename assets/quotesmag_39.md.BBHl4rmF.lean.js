Fritz Paul Schmenkel (14 February 1916 in Warsow bei Stettin, German Empire ‚Äì 22 February 1944 in Minsk, German-occupied Byelorussian SSR, Soviet Union) was a German communist and resistance fighter against Nazism, who fought with the Soviet partisans in Belarus during the Great Patriotic War. Biography Fritz Schmenkel was born in Stettin (today Szczecin, Poland) in 1916. His father, Paul Krause, a brickyard worker and communist, was murdered by SA members in 1932. This caused Fritz to join the Young Communist League of Germany. After working in several different jobs, Schmenkel was conscripted into the Wehrmacht in December 1938. There, he was trained to become a Kanonier. His dislike of military discipline, opposition to Nazism and being absent without leave led to him being imprisoned several times, culminating in a sentence of 18 months' imprisonment, which he served in a military prison in Torgau. In July 1941, after the beginning of Nazi Germany's invasion of the Soviet Union, Schmenkel volunteered to fight on the Eastern Front, and he was released from prison. While serving in Belarus in November 1941, Schmenkel deserted and went into hiding near the village of Podmoshe (Yartsevsky District, Smolensk Oblast). He made contact with a Soviet partisan unit named \\"Death to Fascism\\". Despite their initial suspicions and repeated interrogations, Schmenkel convinced the partisans that he had a genuine desire to fight against the Nazis. He won their trust by killing a German soldier who, by coincidence, attempted to set fire to the house where the partisans had their base. Schmenkel was accepted as a member of the partisans, who gave him the nom de guerre \\"Ivan Ivanovich\\" (or Vanya ‚Äì the short form of Ivan). Schmenkel proved himself to be valuable to the partisans; wearing captured German uniforms, including one belonging to a Wehrmacht general, Schmenkel led German military units into ambushes arranged by the partisans. This helped the partisans capture entire units of Wehrmacht soldiers, as well as ammunition and food. Schmenkel quickly rose through the ranks of the partisans. In March 1943, he travelled to Moscow at the behest of the Red Army, was awarded the Order of the Red Banner and received further military training. He was appointed deputy commander of a special operations (sabotage and intelligence) unit, which operated in a German occupied area north of the city of Orsha. In December 1943, Schmenkel was captured by German forces. He was taken to Minsk, where a German military court sentenced him to death on 15 February 1944; he was executed by firing squad a week later. Legacy Commemorative plaque to Fritz Schmenkel on Victory Square in Minsk, Belarus. Fritz Schmenkel was posthumously awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union and the Order of Lenin in 1964. A street in Nelidovo, Nelidovsky District, Kalinin Oblast (today Tver Oblast), was named after Fritz Schmenkel in 1965. In 1976, a street in the Karlshorst locality of Berlin was named Fritz-Schmenkel-Stra√üe; however, it was renamed Rheinsteinstra√üe in 1992. There is still one Fritz-Schmenkel-Stra√üe in Leipzig and one in Torgau. A commemorative plaque has been placed on the house on Victory Square in Minsk, where Schmenkel was sentenced to death by the German occupants in 1944. A movie about Schmenkel, titled Ich will euch sehen (I Want To See You), was made in 1978. Personal life Schmenkel was married to Erna Sch√§fer. Together, they had three children: a son, Hans, and two daughters, Ursula and Christa.

About BARC India  BARC (Broadcast Audience Research Council) India is an industry body set up to design, commission, supervise and own an accurate, reliable and timely television audience measurement system for India. It currently measures TV Viewing habits of 197 million TV households in the country, using 40,000 sample panel homes. This will go up to 50,000 in the next couple of years, as mandated by the Ministry of Information & Broadcasting. Guided by the recommendations of the TRAI (Telecom Regulatory Authority of India) and MIB notifications of January 2014, BARC India brings together the three key stakeholders in television audience measurement - broadcasters, advertisers, and advertising and media agencies, via their apex bodies. BARC India is committed towards establishing a robust, transparent and accountable governance framework for providing data points that are required to plan media spends more effectively. Standardization Certificates obtained by BARC India are CESP France Certification in April 2017 which validates representativeness of BARC India's TV Measurement Panel and by ISI, Kolkata in May 2018 certifying the representativeness of BARC India's Panel Design & Household Selection  Genesis of BARC India  Nielsen (the owner of TAM Media along with Kantar Media) was sued by Indian TV channel NDTV for $810 million for fraud and $580 million for negligence in a New York court. NDTV's weighty lawsuit‚Äî194 pages; targeted at over 30 companies and individuals; and $1.4 billion in damages‚Äîagainst TAM and its investors accused them of deliberately publishing corrupt and tainted data, favoring rival channels in return for bribes. NDTV also alleged that Nielsen and Kantar were not funding TAM India adequately in order to increase its scale and invest in systems, security and quality procedures. A statement in the lawsuit read: ‚ÄúThe primary remedy (of the corrupt activities) was to increase sample size from 8,000 boxes to 30,000 boxes, immediately stopping publication of data until the sample size was increased to appropriate levels.\\" The case was dismissed by the New York court on the issue of jurisdiction and asked NDTV to fight the legal battle in India. NDTV subsequently unsubscribed from TAM's services only to subscribe again in May 2014 citing the lack of alternate sources for such data as the TAM provided and the arrival of BARC as a new measuring standard in the industry.  BARC Launch  After nearly two years of being in the making (2013-2015), BARC's new ratings system formally rolled out in April 2015. Since most broadcasters had decided not to continue their subscription to TAM India, the industry underwent a ratings darkness period since April 1 where the old TAM software had been given up, and the new BARC India ratings software was yet to be installed. The broadcasters had a feel of these ratings a couple of weeks before the official rollout when BARC India made a presentation to share household level data. While there were no major changes, channel ranking across genres, gaps between channels widened or narrowed. The initial rollout of the new ratings included a sample size of 10,000 Bar-o- meters, and covered the towns and cities with a population of 1,00,000 or more. Although this was less than what BARC India had assured to launch with, by October 2015, the sample reporting was scaled up to 20,000 Bar-o-meters, covering all 153 mn TV owning homes in India. The sample has been since scaled up to 30,000 homes. As of 1 July 2017, BARC India has stopped reporting of analogue TV homes, in line with Government of India's DAS-4 deadline. At launch, the following changes were introduced: * A deeper and broader consumer classification system called new consumer classification system (NCCS), replaced the existing socio-economic classification (SEC). While SEC was based on occupation of chief earner and education of chief earner, NCCS is based on education of chief earner and number of ‚Äòconsumer durables‚Äô owned by the family which includes a list of 11 items ranging from ‚Äòelectricity connection‚Äô and ‚Äòagricultural land‚Äô to cars and air conditioners * The age groups as a reporting parameter will be different adapting to the NCCS. Under BARC, data would be available for age parameters like ‚Äì children (4‚Äì8 years), tweens & schoolers (9‚Äì14 years), youth (15‚Äì21 years), young adults (22‚Äì30 years), adults (31‚Äì40 years), peak (41‚Äì50 years), mature (51‚Äì60 years), and seniors (61+ years). An addition in the reporting age groups are 2‚Äì12 years and 13‚Äì21 years. * The new ratings system under BARC also measured catch-up TV viewing along with linear viewer * It made use of the channel watermarking technology that video content consumption on all platforms using an encoding process that involves inserting an inaudible audio watermark into the content at the broadcaster's end from where the signal will play out * Since the people- meters under BARC, called BAR-o-meters, were manufactured domestically, the ratings measurement system would be able to scale up faster. These meters, were available at a lower cost than those imported from various countries globally  BARC India Products  BIO News: It is a visualisation tool for News broadcasters that gives the performance of News channel, News Stories, News Anchors and Other Personalities at a click of a button.

Return Path Data  BARC India has tied up with DEN Networks, Siti Cable & Airtel Digital TV for measuring TV viewership using Return Path Data (RPD) via their digital set-top boxes (STBs). The move will help expand panel home size from the current 30,000 to over 150,000 in the near future. The large pool of panel households will also help address the issue of panel home tampering plaguing the TV industry in India. As part of this partnership, BARC India will fetch data from STBs of DTH and Multi System Operators (MSOs), who will also use this data for subscriber management, packaging opportunities and to drive advertising revenue on their in-house channels. BARC India is currently in talks with other players for RPD. The RPD initiative in India will be sample based and will exist in addition to BARC India's BAR-O-Meters.  EKAM  After the exit of TAM India from television measurement business in India, one of its parent companies Nielsen has been appointed by BARC India as it digital measurement partner. BARC India's digital measurement service will be made available under the umbrella brand EKAM (Sanskrit for ‚Äòone‚Äô), and is promised to be a single platform for all measurement products, across TV and digital. EKAM Pulse, EKAM Beam, EKAM Stream, EKAM Ad-Scan and EKAM Integra are the five products that have been designed based on industry-specific needs. 1\\\\. Ekam Pulse: To measure video ad campaigns; will be the first product that will be rolled out. 2\\\\. EKAM Beam: To measure linear broadcast that is viewed on a digital device. 3\\\\. EKAM Stream: To measure both non-linear and pure play digital video content. 4\\\\. EKAM Ad-Scan: A global first-of-its-kind product which will give an overview of digital ads in India, across the competition at an aggregate level. 5\\\\. Ekam Integra: Will help the industry with common, robust and independent audience numbers that will give more accurate incremental reach figures. To enable this, BARC India's TV data will be tied with Digital Video data with the help of Single-Source and Digital Booster panels on top of the census measurement and big data. The move is set to be a game changer for the digital content industry and its key stakeholders ‚Äì broadcasters and advertisers. It is well known that advertising revenue is the dominant business model for most over-the-top streaming platforms, and the ad-revenue depends largely on the reach and viewership which the platform provides. And this, until now, was measured by individual content platforms in-house. This raised issues such as dependency on publishers/platforms for data, lack of quantifiable differences in impressions, inability to see unique and de-duplicated reach and frequency across publishers/platforms and lack of knowledge on return on investment. In order to meet the needs and challenges of digital measurement, BARC India has been guided by its Digital Technical Committee, which has representation from all major players in the sector, including Google, Facebook, Hotstar, Voot, Zee5, Sony, P&G;, HUL, Flipkart, GroupM, Madison, IPG and Omnicom Media Group.  Broadcast India Survey  BARC India's Broadcast India Survey is an annual research study that gathers specific details of households and individuals to be used together with Census data in the preparation of universe estimates for TV audience characteristics ‚Äì geographic, demographic, socio-economic status, etc. The Survey also serves as a randomly selected pool of TV owning households for use in the ongoing selection and recruitment of panel households. Broadcast India 2016 Survey was released in February 2017. The findings of Broadcast India (BI) 2018 Survey was released in July 2018. The study is based on a sample of 3 lakh homes in the country. As per the latest BI 2018 Survey, TV homes in the country have seen a 7.5% jump, outpacing the growth of homes in India which grew at 4.5%. India currently boasts of 298 million homes, of which 197 million have a TV set, having an opportunity of almost 100mn more TV homes in the country.

In June 2020, Prof. Moshe Garsiel and Dr. Bath-Sheva Garsiel published an article suggesting they have proof for the identification of the Biblical city of Ziklag in Tel a-Sharia in the Negev. They argued that since the name of the Tell, as well as the Wadi below, mean in Arabic law, it commemorates David‚Äôs law of sharing the spoils of war between the warriors and the ones who are left behind, which occurred in the vicinity (1 Sam 30: 22-26).

She built an earlier career as a teacher and educationalist. Life Christa Weigel was born in Leipzig during the first half of the Second World War. Between 1955 and 1959 she studied at a Teacher Training Institute for non-graduate teachers: between 1959 and 1964 she taught at the Goethe-School in M√ºgeln, a small town located a short distance to the east of Leipzig. She then switched to the Pestalozzi School for children with special needs in Leipzig, where she taught from 1964 till 1990. By 1990 sources were describing Christa Schmidt as \\"married with two children\\". In parallel with her teaching job, between 1972 and 1974 Schmidt studied successfully for a degree in Special School Pedagogy (\\"Sonderschulp√§dagogik\\") at the Martin Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg. Further study at the same institution led to her Doctorate of Pedagogy in 1980: her doctoral dissertation concerned handicapped school children. In 1982 she was promoted to the status of \\"Chief Teacher\\" (\\"Oberlehrer\\") and in 1988 she was promoted again, becoming an Education Councillor (\\"Studienrat\\"). Political engagement began in 1973 when, at the age of 32, Christa Schmidt joined the Christian Democratic Union (CDU). The East German CDU lacked the autonomy of its West German counterpart, being a \\"bloc party\\" controlled through the country's so-called National Front by the country's ruling Socialist Unity Party (\\"Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands\\" / SED). Nevertheless, the East German CDU was not entirely without influence, and was allocated a fixed quota of around 50 seats in the National Parliament (\\"Volkskammer\\") even though general elections from 1949 until 1990 always resulted in more than 99% of the reported votes having been cast in support of the single candidate list provided by the ruling party. For Christa Schmidt, between 1979 and 1989 CDU party membership was accompanied by a role as a deputy in the Central Lepizig City Assembly, where she worked on the Commission of Training and Education. In November 1989, following months of mounting street protests, the Berlin Wall was breached by demonstrators. Back in 1953 street protests had been brutally suppressed: in 1989 the realisation that Soviet occupation forces no longer had orders to suppress the protests using violence opened the way for a series of events which would lead to German reunification, formally in October 1990. In March 1990 the country held its first (and as matters turned out last) free parliamentary election. Based on the popular vote, the CDU now received not 50 seats but 163 of the 400 in the Volkskammer. Following a change in the law that had been voted through in February 1990, voters had no longer been restricted to a single party list, and Christa Schmidt's name had been on the CDU party list for the Leipzig electoral district, positioned high enough up on the list for her now to be elected to the assembly. The powerful performance of the CDU meant that the task of forming a new East German government fell to the party chairman, Lothar de Maizi√®re. In April Christa Schmidt was appointed as a minister, mandated to head up the newly formed Ministry for Family and Women (\\"Ministerium f√ºr Familie und Frauen\\"). The de Maizi√®re government ended in the context of German reunification on 3 October 1990, when what had been East Germany was incorporated into the German Federal Republic. 144 of the 400 members who had sat as members of the now defunct East German Volkskammer since March 1990 now became members of a newly enlarged Bundestag (upper parliamentary chamber) in the reunified Germany. Christa Schmidt was one of these, remaining a member till the general election in December 1990. She returned to the Bundestag in February 1994, taking the seat vacated through the resignation from the chamber of the CDU member Bertram Wieczorek, who left in order to take on the chairmanship of Berlin's monopoly Water Supply company. Schmidt again remained a Bundestag member only till the next general election, which this time took place in October 1994, with the resulting change-over taking place two months later, in December. In 1991 Christa Schmidt resumed her work as an education professional, becoming vice-president of the Upper School Office (Oberschulamt) in Leipzig. At the same time she served during 1990/91 as chair of the (CDU) Women's Union for Saxony. In 1992 she took on the leadership of the Leipzig Schools appointments department. During 1992/93 she set up in the regional Saxony Culture Ministry a state institute for teachers of special needs and primary schools, herself taking on the role of its head. She continued in this post till her retirement in 2002.

The organisation is further responsible for the observation and orientation of unaccompanied minor foreign nationals (UMFNs). The reception of asylum seekers is provided at individual reception locations or collective reception centres. Fedasil operates under the supervision of the State Secretary for Asylum Policy, Migration and Social Integration, Theo Francken ( as of december 2018: Maggie De Block) . In accordance with the Reception Act of 12 January 2007, the agency provides material assistance: accommodation, food, clothing, medical, social and psychological counselling and access to legal support and certain services (interpreters, training). For those wishing to return to their country of origin either during or after an asylum procedure, Fedasil will provide a programme for voluntary return. Fedasil is also authorised to perform resettlement. Fedasil is led by Jean-Pierre Luxen, the agency's Director-General. Fedasil was declared Federal Government Organisation of the Year in 2016.  Mission and vision  Fedasil is responsible for the reception of asylum seekers and other target groups and guarantees high- quality and conformity within the various reception structures. Besides reception, Fedasil also coordinates voluntary return programmes. The organisation describes its vision as follows: \\"Fedasil guarantees equal services, irrespective of implementation modalities, and integrated counselling attuned to the specific characteristics of the various target groups. The protection of personal integrity and the provision of a realistic image of the future are important points of attention in this regard. Fedasil strives to attain the requisite flexibility and decisiveness in order to be able to fully assume our responsibility. The most important success factors for this are: involvement in the preliminary phases and aftercare, a responsible organisation that puts result-oriented and efficient management at all levels first and foremost, combined with the necessary transparency and regular follow-up. Fedasil intends to make an important contribution to the definition, correct image, social acceptance and implementation of a just migration policy. To this end, Fedasil intends to observe Belgium's international commitments, such as the conventions and treaties concerning human rights and European Directives with regard to reception and asylum.‚Äù  History  Prior to 1986, there was no structured reception for asylum seekers in Belgium. The federal government considered the Public Social Welfare Centres responsible for this and paid for their support services. In 1986, Belgium saw a steep rise in the number of asylum requests, owing in part to conflicts in Eastern Europe, Iraq and Iran, Ethiopia and Eritrea, which were displacing great waves of refugees. The federal government therefore decided to set up collective reception locations. The first to open, in November 1986, was the ‚ÄòPetit Ch√¢teau‚Äô, a former military barracks in Brussels, but by the end of 1992, it was no longer able to accommodate the flow of refugees. A total of almost 27,000 asylum seekers arrived in Belgium in 1993, which led the federal government to open multiple centres across the country. Over the years, Fedasil has needed to expand or reduce its reception capacity depending on the number of asylum seekers on Belgian soil. In the years 1999 and 2000, for example, Belgium saw a steep rise in the number of asylum requests. The year 2000, which also saw the one-off regularisation campaign, broke all records with 42,691 requests. The years that followed saw the number of asylum requests in Belgium drop back, however, only beginning to rise again from 2014 onwards. The reasons for this were largely related to the conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq, and the Syrian civil war. In 2015, Fedasil only had a few months to double its number of reception locations in order to accommodate 35,000 people. It worked together with a whole range of existing partners ‚Äì including the Red Cross, Caritas and Samu Social ‚Äì in order to achieve this. The number of asylum requests dropped back once more at the start of 2016, which led to a number of these temporary centres closing their doors again. By the end of 2016, Fedasil will be operating 25,000 structural reception places along with a number of buffer places for the reception of asylum seekers.  Size  Fedasil employs over 1,500 staff as of mid-2016, spread across twenty reception centres, the head office, the Dispatching service and its regional offices. Fedasil has two reception regions (North and South) that span the various reception structures, and a range of partners (local reception initiatives, the Red Cross, the Flanders Refugee Council, private entities etc.).  Reception  Anyone requesting asylum in Belgium will be referred to Fedasil's Dispatching service, which will allocate the asylum seeker a place, usually in a Fedasil reception centre or with a partner organisation (such as the Red Cross). The allocation will consider the number of places available and the asylum seeker's particular situation (family composition, knowledge of local languages, the age of their children, state of health). Particular attention is paid to 'vulnerable' persons, for example unaccompanied foreign minors, single parents, disabled persons, the elderly, pregnant women and victims of human trafficking, torture or other forms of violence. These asylum seekers will be referred to more structured reception or an institution where more tailored guidance can be provided. Reception centres will house people with a wide range of ages, religions and nationalities. All reception locations are neutral or, in other words, everybody's ideological and religious opinions are respected. Specific accommodation is reserved for families. Asylum seekers have the right to social guidance. They will be allocated a social worker on arrival, who will support them during the course of their stay at the centre and throughout the asylum procedure. Asylum seekers at a reception centre can also call upon the services of interpreters, psychologists and medics.  Europe  Fedasil works actively with a number of European exchange platforms seeking to address the reception of asylum seekers, voluntary return and re-integration into their countries of origin. Over the past few years, Fedasil has also been involved in ENARO exchanges within Europe. Furthermore, Fedasil regularly sends experts abroad as part of EASO missions (to Greece, for example). International activities (missions, resettlement, voluntary return, re-integration etc.) are financed by the European Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund. Poetry On the Move: Poems and Songs of Migration is a book of poetry written by people living at the Fedasil Petit-Chateau Arrival Centre, with Marieke Slovin Lewis and S.R. Harris.

It was opened by the Great Northern Railway as a dead-end branch from Stanningley to Pudsey in 1877. However there was demand for a better connection with the main line network, and the line was extended to make a through route. Considerable earthworks and a tunnel made this a difficult work to execute. The line opened in 1895 and became used as a through route, as an alternative to the earlier line. Declining use eventually led to closure in 1964. Demand for a railway The GNR Pudsey branch in 1878The Great Northern Railway route between Leeds and Bradford had been built by the Leeds, Bradford and Halifax Junction Railway and opened in 1854. The GNR operated the trains from the outset, and took it over in 1863. There is a promontory at Pudsey rising to 577 feet above sea level, and the LB&HJR; avoided the engineering difficulty, routing its line through Stanningley, a mile to the north. Deputations from Pudsey had been protesting to the GNR and its predecessor since 1856 about the inconvenience arising from the remoteness of the railway station. By the 1870s Pudsey had a population of almost 15,000 and was a thriving centre for woollen manufacture, stone quarrying and coal working. The GNR decided that a railway connection to Pudesy was now essential, and on 24 July 1871 a short branch line was authorised. The authorised route was to make a triangular junction with the Leeds to Bradford line between Bramley and Stanningley.John Wrottesley, The Great Northern Railway: volume II: Expansion and Competition, B T Batsford Limited, London, 1979, , pages 20 and 21 Construction and opening In fact the GNR were cautious about the commercial value of the branch, and at first only the curve towards Stanningley was made. Work started on 24 November 1876.Wrottesley, volume II, page 61 Land was taken for a double line and bridges made to suit that, but at first only a single line was installed. The line began in a dock platform at Stanningley, and was 1 mile 62 chains in length to a terminus at Pudsey Greenside. The connection was therefore west-facing. The intermediate station at Pudsey Lowtown (often spelt Low Town) was on a gradient of 1 in 50 falling towards Stanningley. The Board of Trade inspecting officer refused to sanction opening of the station until a second platform with a shelter, and a loop line with catch points had been provided. (In fact most of the branch was on a 1 in 50 gradient towards Pudsey).Martin Bairstow, The Great Northern Railway in West Yorkshire, Wyvern Publications, Skipton, 1982, , page 50 Goods traffic on the line began in the summer of 1877,The date is uncertain. and a service of 15 passenger trains each way on weekdays only between Stanningley and Pudsey Greenside began on 1 April 1878. The single line was worked on the train staff and ticket system.David Joy, A Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain: volume VIII: South and West Yorkshire, David & Charles, Newton Abbot, 1984, , page 95Joy, pages 250 and 251Michael Quick, Railway Passenger Stations in England, Scotland and Wales: A Chronology, the Railway and Canal Historical Society, Richmond, Surrey, 2002, page 333 The timetable had been printed before the company knew of the ban on use of Low Town, so it showed the trains as calling there. Pudsey Lowtown station was modified in accordance with the Inspecting Officer's requirements, and it opened in July 1878. Parliamentary estimates had been ¬£44,771 but the actual expenditure was eventually reckoned at ¬£103,044, the excess being attributed to extensions at Stanningley, work at Low Town, an extension of Greenside station, cost of the Bramley branch, and doubling the line. Extending the line The GNR Pudsey and Shipley branches in 1895In 1882 the Great Northern Railway and the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway came to an agreement to co-operate over routes and services in which they both had an interest. This made possible a scheme to provide a direct curve from Bramley to the Pudsey branch, an extension from Pudsey Greenside to a double junction with the Ardsley line north of Dudley Hill, and a link from Dudley Hill to Low Moor. This created a new route through Pudsey making a direct line to the Spen Valley Line, as well as a loop line providing an alternative Leeds to Bradford connection. The authorising Act for the work was granted on 16 July 1885.Wrottesley, volume II, page 140 Bridge across the former line near Pudsey LowtownLack of capital delayed construction, and the Pudsey loop line became operative on 1 December 1893 with the opening of the new (east-facing) curve at Bramley and the extension to Cutlers Junction, near Laisterdyke. The construction ran through the 616 yard Greenside Tunnel and across what was claimed to be the highest embankment in the country. The Stanningley connection of the original branch was severed at the south (Pudsey) junction and the curve made into a siding from Stanningley; the line was accessed directly from the Leeds direction via Bramley. At the western end, the opening through to Low Moor took place on 1 December 1893, with the loop lienm itself. An unusual circular passenger service was introduced: from Leeds Central trains ran through Pudsey, Low Moor, the L&YR; Spen Valley stations, Thornhill, and over the Headfield junction spur to Dewsbury Central and Batley. From here the journey returned to Leeds by means of the line to Beeston junction via Tingley. The service started with six trains in one direction and seven in the other, the GNR working nine of them and the L&YR; the other four. They took up to 90 minutes to cover the 30 miles (48 km).Joy, page 96John Wrottesley, The Great Northern Railway: volume III: Twentieth Century to Grouping, B T Batsford Limited, London, 1981, , page 32 Closure The former Great Northern Railway network in West Yorkshire was reviewed in the early 1960s. Passenger and goods carryiungs had fallen substantially since the 1920s, and a decision was taken to close the Pudsey loop line. It closed completely on 15 June 1964.Joy, page 98 A park and ride station was later provided (on 6 March 1967) on the Leeds - Bradford main line; it was named \\"New Pudsey\\".Bairstow, page 18 Western portal of Greenside Tunnel Bridge west of Greenside Tunnel  Current situation  Any traces of the line between Bramley station and Mount Pleasant Road have been lost due to the construction of an industrial estate and of Stanningley Bypass. Sections of trackbed are preserved and can be walked between Mount Pleasant Road and Pudsey Lowtown and between the locations of the two Pudsey stations. The site of Pudsey Greenside station is occupied by warehouses. Tracks and ballast have been removed in the tunnel and along the whole line. Some bridges in the course of the embankment between Pudsey and Cutlers Junction have been removed, and the cutting below Arkwright Lane has been filled in.

He began as a cadet newspaper reporter at the age of 18 before becoming a general and senior reporter; a political correspondent; a columnist, a newspaper editor, a private and published socio-political consultant and ‚Äì in the decades after his formal retirement ‚Äì an author of books, mainly popular non-fiction. Biography Born in Johannesburg, he was educated at Kingswood College, Grahamstown, 1937‚Äì1945. He was awarded a bursary to Rhodes University in the first post-war year of 1946, but left after a year to join The Star newspaper in Johannesburg in 1947. He studied economics and law, part-time, for the next three years at the University of SA without seeking a degree. He was invited in later years to join sabbaticals studying economics at the universities of Cape Town and Oxford. In the first 40 years of adulthood, Tyson worked full- time on nine different newspapers in South Africa and abroad. He was on the Diamond Fields Advertiser as a cadet journalist when it still published from a flat-bed press and, in the late 1940s, on the Pretoria News with its brand-new post-war rotary press. In the 1950s he was stationed mainly in Durban and, later, Cape Town where he became political correspondent for three Argus newspapers. In the 1960s he left newspapers briefly to act as an Assistant Adviser to the Chamber of Mines in South Africa, where he also continued to write reports and articles for general publication and help launch an industry news-sheet. During two periods in the 1950s and 1960s, Tyson worked on the Yorkshire Press, The Kentish Times, The Scotsman in Edinburgh and The Times in London. He also contributed to news agencies and occasionally to publications in the USA, Europe and the UK. In the 1960s he became an assistant editor of The Daily News, Durban, and later, The Argus, Cape Town. In 1970 he became Deputy Editor of The Star, then Editor three years later, then retired officially as Editor-in-chief of Star newspapers in 1990. Circumstances during those 20 years led The Star to producing two morning and three afternoon editions; Saturday and Sunday newspapers and an overseas weekly edition. Despite the paper struggling against censorship, its daily circulation was reaching a quarter of a million buyers in the Transvaal (an estimated one to two million readers) of all beliefs and cultures. During his years as editor of The Star newspaper Harvey Tyson's commitment to freedom of expression was unwavering. This was evident in his daily management of the newspaper. Some of the more notable events as outlined in the Freedom of Expression Institute's submission to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission included giving instructions to his editorial executives to not identify people by race unless it was relevant in 1975; urging readers in his column to listen to the BBC for very important National and International news; convincing authorities that his copy-editor, Don Mattera would not be expressing his own views as a copy- editor; giving evidence in the second Steyn Commission of Enquiry; resigning from the Media Council for it not being representative; being charged under the Internal Security Act for quoting Oliver Tambo and refusing to \\"scale down\\" coverage of the unrest in 1985. Before 1990 his main preoccupation as editor-in-chief of Star newspapers involved the world threat to freedom of speech and the direct threat of censorship of news in South Africa. He addressed international conferences in Canada, Italy, Holland, Britain, Spain and Turkey on these issues. In 1987, against the wishes of State President P W Botha, he convened a conference in South Africa on ‚ÄòConflict and the Press‚Äô which was supported by leading newspaper proprietors, editors and heads of radio and television news from 17 countries, including some from behind the ‚ÄúIron Curtain‚Äù of Russian communism. \\"In the 1983 whites-only referendum on the tricameral constitution, Harvey, uniquely among the nation‚Äôs editors, refused to endorse either a yes or a no vote, instead advising readers to abstain. The newsroom derision was swift, surfacing within hours in large letters on the editor‚Äôs noticeboard: ‚ÄúThe Editor‚Äôs indecision is final‚Äù, it scoffed.\\" After his official retirement he served on the two boards of Argus Newspapers until the titles were sold to Independent Newspapers. He acted as a consultant to overseas investors; served on the board of Sussens Mann PR; and joined Editors Inc. in launching the annual South Africa at a Glance. During his retirement he has written books in various styles on a variety of themes including: Editors Under Fire (1993). A Walk on the Wild Side (1995). Itch of the Twitch (1996). Have Wings, Will Fly (1998). Birders of a Feather (An anthology, 1998). Laugh the Beloved Country (co-edited with author/columnist James Clarke 2001). Blood on the Path (2009). Thereafter, he planned and wrote three more books. The first of these was part-memoir, On My Watch. The second is End of the Deadline, a history of the world‚Äôs free press ‚Äì and its possible future in the 2030s. The third is a travel book, exploring Vanishing Places around the world. The books were planned to encourage a new form of inter- action between print and digital publishing. The printed books carry cross- references to online articles on similar themes and topical issues. The first, the semi-auto-biographical On My Watch was published in both print and digital in 2016 and the others were due to follow rapidly in the same technique before his anticipated 89th birthday. Harvey Tyson and his wife Arlene retired to Hermanus on the South Cape coast in 1998, not far from his three children and one of his step-children ‚Äì all of whom have, at one time or another, worked as full-time journalists or practised as regular freelance writers.

Despite a massive manhunt and national coverage, there has been no successful conviction of anyone responsible for her death. In 2015, after pressure from Elsie's family, West Yorkshire Police re-opened the case, and then, in March 2018 the primary suspect died. History Elsie had spent the afternoon at Snapethorpe School's sailing club on Horbury Lagoon, a flooded gravel quarry next to the Calder and Hebble canal. When she and her friends left between 3:50pm and 4:00pm,The accounts of Elsie's departure from the sailing club vary. The official Police account is 3:50pm, some say 3:55pm and others 4:00pm Elsie took a slightly different route from the others, avoiding a partially flooded tunnel, possibly to prevent her new shoes getting muddy. She was attacked whilst walking through a tunnel underneath the railway line that runs between Wakefield Kirkgate railway station and Horbury. She was stabbed five times: twice in the head, once in the hand and twice in the back, with one of the knife wounds piercing her heart, causing her death. The wound in her hand led the police to believe that it was sustained whilst trying to defend herself. The post-mortem showed that Elsie had died of shock and blood loss. She made it through the underpass and collapsed at the bottom of the ABC steps, as they are known locally (because there are 26 of them as there are in the English alphabet). She was found at 4:12pm by a man who was out walking with his 3- and 5-year-old children. Over 1,200 written statements were taken: four hundred people who lived within a radius of the murder scene were traced and had their movements checked, over 12,000 men were interviewed and a large number of knives belonging to local residents were examined. Despite an intensive police enquiry, coupled with national coverage (the manhunt was the biggest that the city of Wakefield had ever seen), the police were unable to establish a motive for the crime or indeed, if Elsie was the intended victim or a passerby who happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. The manhunt was later expanded using the army, and also involved the use of metal detectors in an attempt to find the murder weapon. Inquest accusation In January 1966, the deputy coroner, Philip Gill, presiding over the inquest into Elsie's death decided that Ian Bernard Spencer, who was 33 at the time, was the man guilty of killing Elsie. Spencer maintained that although he was in the area of Elsie's death earlier in the day, he was at home during the time that Elsie was murdered. Despite this being corroborated by his wife, his mother-in-law and a family friend, the three witnesses were not called to give evidence on his behalf at the inquest. Until 1984,The Coroners Rules 1984; Rule 42 specifically prohibits a coroner from determining any criminal or civil liability a coroner's inquest could apportion blame and guilt and recommend criminal proceedings to be brought against an individual, which is what happened Mr Spencer. The coroner stated that there was sufficient prima facie evidence against him. Even though Ian Spencer had been cleared by two courts with one judge instructing a jury to acquit, police still routinely turned up at the Spencer family home whenever there had been a knife crime in the area. Mr Spencer took to writing down what time he left one place and then the time he arrived at the next, including the mileage he had travelled. He carried on creating these logbooks throughout his working life and on into retirement. The Frost family were convinced at the time that Spencer had nothing to do with Elsie's death; Elsie's mother, Edith Frost, stated: Cold case Pressure from Elsie's brother and sister (Anne Cleave and Colin Frost) and coverage of the murder on an investigative BBC Radio 4 programme prompted West Yorkshire Police to re-open the case in 2015, 50 years after the killing. The new investigation produced 100 lines of enquiry, a response that the police found encouraging. The Major Investigation Review team is staffed by serving officers as well as civilians, most of whom are retired detectives. The review team disclosed that most of the original files from 1965 had been destroyed. After the programme was aired on Radio 4, several listeners gave accounts of what they had seen leading to fresh evidence and new theories. Members of the public submitted Freedom of Information requests to The National Archives for the murder files, which were not due to be opened until 2030 and 2060. The requests were denied on the grounds that the police files name other suspected individuals other than the man sent to trial in 1966. The release into the public domain of this information may have harmed any future criminal proceedings. There were also notes that the files contains post- mortem images and reports which could be distressing for the immediate family. It was revealed during the investigation by Radio 4 that Elsie's clothes had been offered to the family but when the offer was declined the clothes were then destroyed by the police. Despite there being no knowledge of the science of DNA in 1965, this effectively ended any hope of possible DNA retrieval. There have been other suspects and theories: one was that Elsie had stumbled across two men engaged in a homosexual act (homosexual acts were illegal in Britain up until 1967). Another witness has described seeing a man in his mid- twenties, dressed in white overalls and on a bike. This led to suggestions that the man, who could be a witness, was a butcher's delivery boy or an abattoir worker. Another theory was that Elsie was meeting someone in the days before her death, possibly a boyfriend. Her father had said that the night before she died she went to Balne Lane Youth Club in her best clothes, rather than her normal attire and she had asked to stay out later than usual (though she actually came home no later than usual) Another lead was proffered by a school acquaintance of Elsie's, who, as a nurse, had heard a third-hand account of a man confessing in hospital to being her killer. This tied in with the homosexual act angle as the man apparently confessed to that taking place and being the reason behind Elsie's death. Whilst this new information was forwarded to the police, it is unreliable because of its third-hand nature and the man was allegedly under the influence of drugs when he made his confession. On 27 September 2016, it was announced that Thames Valley Police had arrested a 78-year-old man in connection with Elsie's death. It was revealed on 29 September 2016 that the man had been bailed after his arrest. On 6 March 2017 it was reported that the same man had been re-arrested in connection with Elsie's death and that he was also being questioned in relation to an unconnected allegation of rape and kidnap in 1972. On 25 March 2018, it was reported that the hitherto unnamed suspect was Peter Pickering, convicted of the 1972 manslaughter of 14 year old Shirley Boldy in Wombwell near Barnsley. Pickering had died in a secure hospital the previous day. Detective Superintendent Nick Wallen of West Yorkshire Police said they had \\"strongly suspected\\" he was responsible and \\"it was our expectation\\" the Crown Prosecution Service would have decided to charge him in due course. In July 2018, it was revealed that the Frost family would be lobbying the Attorney- General for a new inquest where they could ask that the evidence against Pickering be looked at. The family stated that they felt \\"cheated and robbed\\" by Pickering's death as he would not go in front of a jury, but that a new inquest would be the next best thing.

Sold to the town for preservation in 2000, it was demolished about 2013. Description and history The Cornwall General Store was located in the small village center of Cornwall, on the east side of Vermont Route 30, immediately south of Cornwall Town Hall. It was a rambling 1-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a gable-roofed main section that has additions to both sides and the rear. It was finished in wooden clapboards, and the main block and left addition had a Victorian porch extending across them. The interior of the store had retained many original features, including store fixtures and oil lamps on the wall. with The store was built about 1880 by Conrad Frost, at a time when the town's village center was just beginning to take shape. The Congregational Church and village common had been a focal point since 1803, and the town hall had just been built. Frost's choice of location was well made, for he drove a well-established store a short way north of the center out of business by 1890. The store was bought in 1918 by William LaValley, and was operated by his family until 1940. May LaValley occupied the residential portion of the building until 1997, and in 2000 it was sold by her heirs to the town in the hopes that it would be preserved. In 2012, the town voted to either demolish or sell the dilapidated structure. Funds for its demolition were appropriated in 2013, and in 2014 the town was considering other uses of the parcel, including for a potential expansion of town hall.

After 1924, \\"half- caste\\" children were separated from the adults and moved to an institution at Myilly Point. History In 1913 the Northern Territory Protector of Aborigines, anthropologist Walter Baldwin Spencer decided to solve what he called the \\"half-caste problem\\" by rounding up hundreds of Aboriginal children and removing them from the \\"native camp\\"'. The Kahlin Compound and Half Caste Home was established on Lambell Terrace at Myilly Point, overlooking Mindil Beach in Darwin. Spencer envisaged that the compound would be self-sufficient, providing housing, schooling and domestic training for each Aboriginal family. The whole compound was to be fenced with access for Aboriginals and Departmental officials only. A 1923 Commonwealth parliamentary inquiry headed by the South Australian Senator John Newland included an investigation of conditions at the Compound. Newland recommended that it be moved to a site further from the town, but this did not happen (perhaps because the residents were a source of cheap labour). A subsequent inquiry appointed by the NT Administrator also recommended the establishment of a new compound be established and also that \\"half-caste\\" children should be separated from adults, in a separate institution where they could be disciplined and integrated into the [white] community. The new \\"Half-Caste Home\\" was opened at Myilly Point in 1924, and most of the Kahlin children were moved there. The compound was damaged in the 1937 cyclone. All residents were moved to the new Bagot Aboriginal Reserve in 1938. The Kahlin Compound closed in 1939 and was revoked as an Aboriginal Reserve on 3 July 1940. The site was used as an emergency hospital during a meningitis outbreak in 1940. Current use The Kahlin Compound site The site of the Kahlin Compound remains a vacant block.

The site is located in the area of Lake Mikata, one of the Mikata five lakes, near the confluence of Hasu and Takase Rivers, within the borders of the Wakasa Wan Quasi-National Park. At that time, the Shiibayama hill on which the site is located extended like a cape from the west to the east, and Lake Mikata extended to the tip of the hill. On the southern slope of the hill, three pit dwellings were detected, indicating that there were settlements. The shell midden begins at a depth of 7 meters underground to 3 meters above ground. At the time it was used as a garbage dumping site, it was in the lake. Excavations The excavation of the site was initiated in 1962, and conducted up to 1972 by Doshisha University in Kyoto, and Rikky≈ç University in Toyo. Starting in 1975, the Fukui Prefectural Board of Education continued the investigations. Important information about early agriculture in Japan in 7500‚Äì3500 BC was discovered. Discoveries The cultural deposits are about 6 to 3 meters thick. Primarily fresh water shells are found in the midden. Ropes, reed baskets and similar items were plentiful. Very old stone weights used for nets were excavated, as well as many other items made of stone. A large quantity of stone axes were found. The inhabitants hunted various local fauna. Skeletal remains of the Japanese wolf have been found at Torihama dating 10,000 to 250 B.C. =Cultivated plants= In 2011, radioactive carbon dating has revealed that the lacquer tree found at the Torihama shell mounds is the oldest lacquer tree in the world, dating back 12600 years.1‰∏á2ÂçÉÂπ¥Ââç„ÅÆ„Ç¶„É´„Ç∑Êú®Áâá ‰∏ñÁïåÊúÄÂè§„ÄÅÁ¶è‰∫ï„ÅßÂá∫Âúü, The Nikkei, November 6, 2011Kakinoshima Jomon Archaeological Site Evidence of early beefsteak plant perilla (Jap.

Weedy annuals and shrub fruits and nuts, such as acorns and walnuts, were also used by villagers. The latter comprised a very substantial part of the diet. Chestnut (Castanea crenata Siebold & Zucc.) was also found, as well as water chestnut (trapa), and the regular sweet chestnut. In terms of caloric intake, plant foods made up about half of the diet.

Dedicated string synthesizers occupied a specific musical instrument niche between electronic organs and general-purpose synthesizers in the 1970s and early 1980s, until advances in digital signal processing technology allowed the production of inexpensive general-purpose polyphonic synthesizers and samplers, which made the existence of a separate type of instrument unnecessary. The development of the string synthesizer was originally motivated by the need for a cheaper and more portable alternative to the Mellotron, which was itself a cheaper alternative to human string ensembles. The availability of string synthesizers was influential in adding string orchestration to popular music that would not otherwise be able to afford the use of a human string ensemble, and their characteristic sound, which was almost, but not quite, like that of a real string ensemble, was one of the distinguishing sounds of the era. To keep costs down, string synthesizers typically used a frequency divider architecture similar to that of electronic organs, with the addition of specialized in-built vibrato and chorus effects to mimic the ensemble effect of multiple string instruments playing at once.

The harsh threat of punishment (Latae sententiae) contained in Pastorale officium made the Conquistadors complain to the Spanish king and Emperor. Charles V went on to argue that the letter was injurious to the Imperial right of colonization and harmful to the peace of the Indies. The urging of Charles V to revoke the briefs and bulls of 1537 and exemplifies the tension of the concern for evangelisation as manifested in the teachings of 1537 and the pressure to honor the system of royal patronage. The weakened position of the pope and the memory of the Sack of Rome (1527) a decade earlier by imperial troops, made the ecclesiastical authorities hesitant in engaging in any possible confrontation with the Emperor.. (A Prophetic Challenge to the Church: The Last Word of Bartolom√© de las Casas, Luis N. Rivera-Pag√°n ) Under mounting pressure Pope Paul III succumbed and removed the ecclesiastical censures in the letter titled \\"Non Indecens Videtur \\". The annulling of the ecclesiastical letter was not a denial of the doctrinal teaching of the spiritual equivalence of all human beings. The annulation gave rise to the subsequent papal encyclical Sublimis Deus promulgated by Pope Paul III on June 2, 1537\\"A Prophetic Challenge to the Church:The Last Word of Bartolom√© de las Casas\\", Luis N.

In his anthology of ecclesiastical normative documents regarding the Spanish empire, Francisco Javier Hern√°ez reproduces Pastorale officium, but not Sublimis Deus, though he includes Veritas ipsa, a variant of Sublimis Deus. He blames Las Casas for the ‚Äúexaggerated news‚Äù regarding the mistreatment of the Native Americans as the source for the Pope‚Äôs concern and reproduces some of the most denigrating testimony against the Native Americans ever expressed in the sixteenth century.

Olango, a 38-year old former refugee from Uganda, was shot several times by police responding to a call for emergency psychiatric aid. He died later that day in a hospital. Officers on scene claimed to have believed Olango was pointing a firearm; the object in his hand was an e-cigarette. The shooting sparked days of protests in El Cajon and around San Diego County. San Diego County prosecutors declined to file charges against officers Josh McDaniel and Richard Gonsalves, who were involved in the shooting. Alfred Olango Alfred Olango arrived in the U.S. as a refugee from Uganda in 1991.Authorities tried twice to deport unarmed black man fatally shot by cops, New York Post, September 29, 2016 Born in Kampala, Uganda in 1978, Olango came to New York with his mother and eight siblings as refugees in 1991. He married in 2001, having one child with his wife at the time. He worked at Toro manufacturing and McDonald's, and he hoped to one day open his own restaurant. Shooting Days before the incident, one of Olango's longtime childhood friends died. On the day of the incident, Olango's sister noticed strange behavior from him and called police three times asking for immediate help. A 5150 (involuntary psychiatric hold) request for a psychiatric emergency response team (PERT) was placed. Fifty minutes after the first call, at least two non-PERT officers arrived on scene. Officer Richard Gonsalves fired his handgun four times at Olango, and officer Josh McDaniel fired his Taser. =Video evidence= In video footage released by the El Cajon Police Department, two uniformed police officers can be seen approaching Olango. In the video, Olango is retreating into a corner formed by a fence and an unoccupied parked truck. Olango's sister can be seen approaching behind the police officers. Seconds later, Olango drew an object and extended it in two hands towards police in a shooting stance before being shot. He was pronounced dead at a nearby hospital later that day. =Police statement= According to the El Cajon Police Department's statement on the evening of the shooting, Olango was simultaneously tasered and shot several times by the two officers. They said Olango refused to comply with instructions to remove one concealed hand from a pocket, paced back and forth, then \\"rapidly drew an object from his front pants pocket, placed both hands together and extended them rapidly toward the officer taking up what appeared to be a shooting stance\\". Officers claimed to have believed that Olango was pointing a handgun at officers, in which the object was a vape pen which was pointed towards the officers with the tip facing. Investigation Footage of Olango's shooting was released by the El Cajon Police Department on September 30, 2016. There have been two videos of the shooting that were recorded and released to the public, one from a bystander inside a Mexican restaurant and the other from the restaurant's drive-thru surveillance camera. In January 2017, San Diego County District's Attorney Bonnie Dumanis announced that no criminal charges would be filed against officers Richard Gonsalves and Josh McDaniel. =Criticism= The ACLU has criticized the El Cajon Police Department's partial release of video evidence.

He is enshrined in the Georgetown University Sports Hall of Fame.  Early life  Cordovano‚Äôs parents emigrated from Serradifalco, Sicily. His father, Colegio Corduana (changed to Cordovano at Ellis Island), a miner, settled with his wife, Elizabeth, and son, James in the Pennsylvania coal mining region. There, Sam was born in December of 1906. While in Pennsylvania, the elder Cordovano taught himself the butcher trade and then in the early 1920‚Äôs moved his family to Buffalo, where the family opened and operated a butcher shop.  College football career  After a stand-out athletic career at Canisius prep school (including selection to numerous Buffalo All-City Football Teams, Cordovano enrolled at Georgetown University and played football under the tutelage of Lou Little There, Cordovano made varsity in 1927 and continued to letter all 3 years of his college career (1928, 1929) while playing a combination of guard and tackle on both offense and defense. Cordovano earned numerous accolades during his three seasons at Georgetown, including being named team captain in 1929. That same year, Cordovano earned Georgetown‚Äôs ‚ÄúMost Valuable Player‚Äù award as well as an All-American Mention. During the Hoya‚Äôs 1929 campaign, storied sports journalist, Richards Vidmer had this to say about Cordovano: ‚ÄúHe is six feet tall and weighs about 183 pounds. He is fast, strong, and powerful; hits hard, is a deadly tackler, smart and knows more football than 90 per cent of those playing the game today. He can play center, guard or tackle. He is our (Georgetown‚Äôs) whole defense, and only one team scored on us to date and that was by a pass.‚Äù Throughout Cordovano‚Äôs tenure in college football, Georgetown‚Äôs record was 21 wins, 5 losses, 2 ties. Cordovano was inducted into the Georgetown Athletic Hall of Fame in 1953.  Professional football career  Cordovano played one season in the NFL with the Newark Tornadoes in 1930.  Collegiate coaching career  After a successful 1929 season at Georgetown, Lou Little accepted the head football coach position at Columbia University. Little promptly hired Cordovano as his offensive line coach in 1930, a position that Cordovano held through the 1943 season while becoming one of the most renowned assistant football coaches in the country. During Cordovano‚Äôs time at Columbia, the Lions defeated Stanford, 7-0, in the 1934 Rose Bowl. Considered to be one of the greatest upsets in Rose Bowl history, the game‚Äôs lone score came on a fake reverse and hand-off from MVP Cliff Montgomery to halfback, Al Barabas, who went untouched for the 17 yard score. During Cordovano‚Äôs tenure at Columbia, the Lions held a record of 61 wins, 51 losses, 9 ties.  Professional wrestling career  Cordovano began taking professional wrestling matches in the early 1930s as a way to make money during the football offseason. Known for his football bonafides and business-like demeanor on the mat, Cordovano achieved success in promotions in New York, Boston, Buffalo, Pittsburgh, and Toronto. Cordovano frequently grappled with wrestling legends, including Ed ‚ÄúStrangler‚Äù Lewis, Jim Browning, Ed Don George and Jim Londos. Throughout Cordovano‚Äôs 6-year professional wrestling career, he had several high-profile matches. On March 27, 1933, Cordovano challenged Jim Browning for the NYSAC World Heavyweight Championship in front an audience of over 5,000 at the 71st Regiment Armory in New York. Cordovano also challenged for other venerated wrestling titles, including Boston‚Äôs AWA World Heavyweight Title held by Ed Don George on June 28th, 1933, and the NWA World Heavyweight Title held by Jim Londos on March 2nd, 1934. Cordovano‚Äôs professional wrestling career includes 61 wins, 16 losses, 52 draws on record.  All-America Football Conference  In 1943, Cordovano organized a group of local businessmen which applied for a Buffalo franchise in the NFL, along with groups from Los Angeles and San Francisco. However, in April of 1944, the NFL owners voted to table the franchise applications until after WWII. Shortly thereafter, Chicago Tribune editor, Arch Ward, began the process of forming a rival league: the All-America Football Conference. Cordovano was treasurer of the new league and in charge of player personnel. By December 1945, Cordovano, had 37 players signed-up to play for the Buffalo franchise, including Paul Governali, a Columbia All-American. The AAFC‚Äôs inaugural season, 1946, included teams in Los Angeles (backed by actors Bing Crosby and Don Ameche), San Francisco, New York (backed by Eleanor Gehrig), Brooklyn, Baltimore (backed by Gene Tunney) Miami, Cleveland (backed by Paul Brown) and Chicago. Cordovano resigned his ownership position in Buffalo and his position as league treasurer, to focus on other business opportunities, just prior to the inaugural season. He was replaced as treasurer by Mrs. Gehrig. When the League folded in 1949, the AAFC Baltimore Colts, San Francisco 49ers and Cleveland Browns joined the NFL. The AAFC‚Äôs Buffalo Bills, however, disbanded; many of their players were drafted by other teams in the NFL.  Later life and death  In 1950, Cordovano founded The Cordovano Co., a precision tool business and metrology lab. He was an avid golfer and was a member of The Sea Pines Club in Hilton Head, South Carolina where he retired. Cordovano passed away in 1995 in Hilton Head.

This battle was the start of the Hungarian offensive whose aim was to liberate central and western Hungary, and its capital, from imperial occupation. The Austrian force was commanded by General Franz Schlik, while the Hungarians were led by Colonel Andr√°s G√°sp√°r, and lieutenant-colonel Ern≈ë Poeltenberg. The Polish Legion under Colonel J√≥zef Wysocki also fought alongside the Hungarians. The Hungarians were victorious, and advanced towards the Hungarian capitals, Buda and Pest. Background After the Battle of K√°polna on 26‚Äì27 February 1849, the commander of the Austrian imperial forces Alfred I, Prince of Windisch- Gr√§tz thought that he had destroyed the Hungarian revolutionary forces once and for all. In his report of 3 March sent to the imperial court in Olm√ºtz, he wrote that: \\"\\"I smashed the rebel hordes, and in a few days I will be in Debrecen (the temporary capital of Hungary)\\".. Despite of this he did not attacked the Hungarian forces, because he did not have any reliable information about the strength of the Hungarian forces he would face if he crossed the Tisza river. But because of his caution he lost the opportunity to win the war. While he was debating whether or not to attack, the Hungarian commanders who were discontented with the disappointing performance of Lieutenant General Henryk Dembi≈Ñski as commander-in-chief of the Hungarian forces, blaming him for the defeat at K√°polna, started a \\"rebellion\\", holding a meeting in Tiszaf√ºred, which forced the Government Commissioner Bertalan Szemere to depose the Polish general and install Art√∫r G√∂rgei instead. This infuriated Lajos Kossuth, the President of the National Defense Committee (interim government of Hungary), who wanted to execute G√∂rgei for rebellion. Finally the Hungarian generals‚Äô support for G√∂rgei forced him to renounce his plan and accept the deposition of Dembi≈Ñski. But Kossuth's antipathy towards G√∂rgei prevented him from accepting Szemere's decision, and he named Lieutenant General Antal Vetter as commander-in-chief instead.. But Vetter fell ill on 28 March, so two days later Kossuth was forced to name G√∂rgei temporary commander-in-chief of the main Hungarian force.. These days and weeks of unrest, uncertainty and changes could have been an excellent opportunity for Windisch-Gr√§tz to cross the Tisza river and defeat the Hungarian army once and for all. But instead of attacking, and paralyzed by increasing fear of a Hungarian attack, the Austrian field-marshal tried to discover the numbers and strength of the Hungarian armies which were on the Eastern bank of the Tisza river, but his spies were unable to obtain any information. Because of this he spread his troops out to prevent an outflanking attack from the north, which he feared would relieve the imperial siege of the fortress of Kom√°rom, and could cut his lines of communication.. Meanwhile, on 30‚Äì31 March the plan was devised for the Hungarian army's Spring Campaign. Under the overall command of the most capable Hungarian general, Art√∫r G√∂rgei, the best generals were appointed to lead the corps preparing to attack the Austrians and liberate Hungarian lands west of the Tisza river (consisting of much of the territory of the Kingdom of Hungary, occupied by the Habsburg forces). G√∂rgei's army numbered 47,500 men and 198 guns organized in 4 army corps led by General Gy√∂rgy Klapka (I. Corps), General Lajos Aulich (II. Corps), General J√°nos Damjanich (III. Corps) and Colonel Andr√°s G√°sp√°r (VII. Corps). The imperial forces under Alfred I, Prince of Windisch-Gr√§tz had 55,000 men and 214 guns and rockets organized in 3 army corps led by Lieutenant Field Marshal Josip Jelaƒçiƒá (I. Corps), Lieutenant General Anton Csorich (II. Corps), General Franz Schlik (III. Corps), and one division under Lieutenant General Georg Heinrich Ramberg.. Prelude The location of the Battle of Hatvan (2 April 1849) on the Second Military Survey of Austro- Hungary (1806‚Äì1869) The Hungarian plan for the Spring Campaign, as elaborated by Antal Vetter, was that G√°sp√°r's VII. Corps was to draw Windisch-Gr√§tz's attention by making an attack from the direction of Hatvan, while the other three corps (I., II., III.) would encircle the Austrian forces from the southwest and cut them off from the capital cities (Pest and Buda). According to the plan, VII. Corps had to stay at Hatvan until 5 April, then on the 6th it had to reach Bag. The attack on the Austrian forces had to occur on 7 April at G√∂d√∂ll≈ë, from two directions, while the I. corps would advance to Kerepes, and fall on the Austrians from behind, preventing them from retreating towards Pest.. The key to this very risky plan was that the Austrians should not discover the Hungarian movements until they completed the encirclement. This is why a very great responsibility lay on G√°sp√°r's shoulders to lead VII. Corps in a way which would not betray the campaign's strategy. This meant he had to make the enemy commander facing him believe he was confronted by the whole Hungarian army, distracting his attention from the Hungarian I., II., and III. Corps, which meanwhile were advancing towards G√∂d√∂ll≈ë from the southeast. If G√°sp√°r had failed in this task, Windisch-Gr√§tz could have sent overwhelming forces to destroy him, which would then have opened the way for the Austrians to the interim Hungarian capital, Debrecen.. KOCZICZKA(1850) p008 K&K; Kavalerie-General Franz Schlik zu Bassano und Wei√ükirchen On 1 April a division of G√°sp√°r's VII. Corps led by Lieutenant-Colonel Ern≈ë Poeltenberg was in Hort, with only a minor unit stationed in Hatvan. Schlik's imperial III. Corps came from the west, entered the town and chased out the Hungarians towards Hort, killing two Hussars. Schlik was sent by Marshal Windisch-Gr√§tz to conduct a reconnaissance in force to discover the strength and positions of the Hungarian forces in that area. Hearing this, G√∂rgei sent Colonel Andr√°s G√°sp√°r there with a division, ordering him to defend Hort at any cost.. Battle On 2 April, at 5 o'clock, the two Hungarian division commanders ordered a cavalry reconnaissance towards Hatvan, whose report made G√°sp√°r think the enemy had a squadron in front of Hort, and that the edge of the vineyards was held by enemy infantry. So he decided to push his vanguard forward, and to advance west of Hort village with his division. At 11:30 his vanguard reported that more Austrian cavalry squadrons were arriving together with many kaiserj√§gers. G√°sp√°r sent two squadrons of hussars, but seeing that the imperials were sending more cavalry together with cannon, he ordered to the two divisions to fall back a little and form battle order on the heights before the second stone bridge west of Hort.. Schlik's troops debouched Hatvan led by the Parrot's brigade, which he ordered to advance against the enemy in front of Hort in order to force them to reveal their strength. According to some accounts, Schlik was in a light-hearted mood, and told his officers that the battle would be a joyous rabbit hunt.. He did not imagine that in the end his troops would become the hunted. At 1 o'clock Parrot's brigade came face to face with G√°sp√°r's and Poeltenberg's troops, and started its attack. Schlik also ordered two other infantry brigades (the K√ºnigl and Fiedler brigades) and a cavalry brigade (the Montenuovo cavalry brigade) to support the attack.. Battle of Hatvan 1849.04.02 Battle of Hatvan. The Austrians destroy the bridge on the Zagyva river, before retreating. Until 3 o'clock the battle continued mostly just with a cannonade. G√°sp√°r was waiting for his two cavalry squadrons from Ecs√©d, and the brigade sent to Cs√°ny to arrive before starting his own attack. Meanwhile, because of the Hungarian resistance, Schlik was unable to push forward either. At this moment the detached troops arrived and G√°sp√°r gave the order to attack. He sent three brigades from Poeltenberg's division to outflank the enemy. The cavalry squadron and two cannons under Lieutenant- Colonel Lajos Z√°mbelly moved around the left wing, while Liptay's brigade advanced on the right wing. For now G√°sp√°r did not move while he waited for his encircling manoeuvre to be completed. But Schlik sensed that something dangerous was happening, and ordered his troops to retreat to the vineyard- covered hills between Hort and Hatvan. Poeltenberg's division advanced and started a concentric attack from three sides against Hatvan together with Z√°mb√©lly and Liptay. After positioning some of his infantry and artillery on the heights in front of the bridge on the Zagyva river, Schlik ordered his sappers to build another bridge to enable him to withdraw his troops, guns and baggage from Hatvan as fast as possible. Meanwhile, General Damjanich of Hungarian III. Corps had sent J√≥zef Wysocki's division, whose approach was observed by Schlik, and the Austrian retreat became more panic-stricken. In the end the imperial infantry which defended the Zagyva bridges and covered the imperial troops crossing to the other bank succeeded in demolishing both bridges, thus preventing the Hungarians from catching them and encircling them. Schlik's cavalry retreated between Bag and Hatvan, while his infantry and artillery moved to Asz√≥d, than to G√∂d√∂ll≈ë.. Aftermath The battle of Hatvan was not a very important victory, but its influence on the morale of the Hungarian troops was remarkable. The most important result of the battle was that G√°sp√°r succeeded in making Schlik think that he faced the whole Hungarian army, not just VII. Corps. Windisch-Gr√§tz continued to be unsure about the plans and dispositions of the Hungarian main army, and because of this he remained mostly incapable of stopping them advancing from two sides on his headquarters at G√∂d√∂ll≈ë. After the victory at Hatvan, the other, more numerous Hungarian army, consisting of three corps, won another victory at T√°pi√≥bicske then approached Isaszeg where the decisive battle of the first phase of the Spring Campaign took place on 6 April. This victory earned Colonel Andr√°s G√°sp√°r the rank of general, together with the position of leader of VII. Corps. Before this he was only interim commander of this corps, standing in for G√∂rgei who had to hand it over when he took over command of the whole Hungarian army except the Transylvanian and Southern armies. Although Lajos Aulich had been designated the new commander of VII. Corps, he was away, so until he arrived, G√°sp√°r as its senior staff officer had had to perform the role..

The centre is dedicated to the rehabilitation of mistreated, injured, orphaned, and/or confiscated snakes, focusing primarily on venomous species. Once the animals are fully rehabilitated, they are reintroduced into their natural habitats in protected areas, mainly in the Pacuare River primary forest. Visitors are permitted in the centre during certain times each day. The center was created and is run by Minor Camacho, a Costa Rican herpetologist. The educational guide explores the natural history and habitat of poisonous snakes more than their taxonomy. The Viborana centre also doubles as a snake call centre, with the owner and staff going out to homes to remove venomous snakes from places where they might inconvenience people.  History  Founded by Minor Camacho Loaiza, a former reptile handler, trained at the University of Costa Rica and former chief of the Herpetarium division of the Department of Biochemistry of that University. The centre began as a herpetarium exhibition for reptiles and amphibians. Inspired on research findings that suggested an increase in snake populations around the Pacurare River sugarcane landscapes, the herpetarium redirected its focus towards the study of the dynamics of the Natural History of snakes in the fields of Cartago.  Exhibits  The centre is devoted to indigenous reptiles. Many are collected from local homes, yards, or from areas about to be burned under the controlled burning program to keep summer grass fires from threatening the local homes. Most of the reptiles end up being relocated to uninhabited areas. Animals at the centre include the Bothrops lanceolatus ‚Äî known as the fer-de-lance; Bothriechis schlegelii, the eyelash viper; large and small pythons, coral snakes, and rattlesnakes, among others.

The CAPE- OPEN specifications define a set of software interfaces that allow plug and play inter-operability between a given Process Modelling Environment and a third-party Process Modelling Component. Origins The CAPE-OPEN, European Union funded, project was established in 1997.M. Jarke, J. K√∂ller, W. Marquardt, L. von Wedel, B. Braunschweig, 1999, ‚ÄúCAPE-OPEN: Experiences from a Standardization Effort in Chemical Industries‚Äù, Proceedings of 1st IEEE Conference on Standardisation and Innovation in Information Technology (SIIT 99), Aachen, Germany, pages 25-35, The project involved participants from a number of companies from the process industries (Bayer, BASF, BP, DuPont, French Institute of Petroleum (IFP), Elf Aquitaine, and Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI)) together with 15 partners including software vendors (Aspen Technology, Hyprotech Ltd, QuantiSci and SimSci]) and academics (Imperial College London, National Polytechnic Institute of Toulouse (INPT), and RWTH Aachen University). The objective of the project was to demonstrate the feasibility of a set of specification interfaces to allow plug and play interoperability between modelling environments and third party modelling components. Following the completion of the CAPE-OPEN project in 2001, and the successful proof-of-concept of plug and play interoperability, a second project, Global CAPE-OPEN, was formed to turn the interface specifications into products that could be widely used by Industry. This project had a number of key elements including: * An interoperability task force to check on the implementation of CAPE-OPEN in commercial simulation tools * The subsidy of small simulation vendors to implement CAPE-OPEN interfaces * The formation of the not-for-profit organisation, The CAPE-OPEN Laboratories Network (CO- LaN),CO-LaN to assure the maintenance and further development of the CAPE-OPEN interfaces. Purpose Operating companies in the process industries typically make a significant financial investment in commercial simulation technologies. However, all simulation tools have strengths and weaknesses. Typically, these reflect a focus on the particular process industry for which the simulation package was originally developed. For example, simulation packages developed for the oil industry may have a weakness for the modelling of certain speciality chemical systems; modelling environments focussed on gas and oil systems may not have the capabilities to handle multiple liquid phases and/or solids formation. Although, over time, simulation vendors improve and enhance the capabilities of their modelling technologies generally capability gaps remain. An operating company can address these capability gaps by replacing the relevant components in their tool of choice with improved components from elsewhere. Often these improved components originate from within the operating company itself and contain significant intellectual property relating to a specific process which is not readily available to the commercial modelling vendors. Alternatively, the improved components may come from a company specialising in niche areas of modelling, for example the rigorous modelling of heat exchangers or for thermodynamics and physical properties. Historically the integration of third-party components into a commercial simulation environment involved the writing of proprietary software interfaces that ‚Äúwrapped‚Äù around the new components and allowed them to communicate with the host modelling environment. The degree of difficulty in developing such interfaces varied significantly depending on how ‚Äúopen‚Äù the host modelling environment was and how well documented were the associated communication protocols. Inevitably bespoke component interfaces were difficult to maintain as new versions of the modelling environment were adopted. Additionally, a component wrapper for one environment would not work with an alternative environment from a different simulation vendor. User added subroutines, for both unit operations and thermodynamic models, is an alternative approach to component integration but one that suffers from similar difficulties in moving the subroutines from one simulator to another. The development of a standardised plug and play capability hence had the potential to deliver a number of significant business benefits: * Lower maintenance costs for operating companies and software vendors due to the standardisation of the interfaces. * Continuous capture of lessons learned across the membership community and the associated improvements to the interfaces. * The ability to apply a consistent set of simulation components across all CAPE-OPEN compliant simulation environments and other modelling tools such as MATLAB and Microsoft Excel. * The ability to choose and incorporate the technically most appropriate model for a particular modelling task with the level of fidelity needed. Concepts A number of commercial simulation programmes are available to support process modelling. Generally one or more of these commercial tools will be used by a given operating company to underpin its modelling activity. In addition, many operating companies also maintain their own in-house software to allow for the modelling of niche applications not fully addressed by the commercial tools. Each simulation programme provides an environment which allows a process flow-sheet to be constructed and the process fluid thermodynamics to be incorporated. The CAPE-OPEN project formally identified such a modelling programme as a Process Modelling Environment (PME) with the requirement that users of a PME should be able to easily connect the PME with other modelling tools without the need to develop bespoke interfaces. To do this a PME would be provided with a CAPE- OPEN ‚Äúplug‚Äù that would allow any CAPE-OPEN component to be added to the modelling environment.JP. Belaud, M. Pons, 2002, \\"Open Software Architecture For Process Simulation: The Current Status of CAPE-OPEN Standard\\", Computer Aided Chemical Engineering., DOI:10.1016/S1570-7946(02)80169-9 All PMEs come with a library of unit operations (vapor-liquid separators, valves, heat exchangers, distillation columns etc.) and a range of thermodynamic methods (equation of state, activity coefficient models, etc.). These library components are normally restricted to usage within the native PME. However, users of a given PME, often require to substitute a third party unit operation or thermodynamic model for the one provided by the native environment. The CAPE-OPEN project formally identified a unit operation or a thermodynamic engine as a Process Modelling Component (PMC) with the requirement that a PMC could be ‚Äúwrapped‚Äù with standard interfaces that would allow it to be placed in a CAPE-OPEN compliant PME without the need for additional interfacing software to be developed ‚Äì no programming would be required either for the modelling environment or for the core of the modelling component. In order to organise its work programmes the CAPE-OPEN project classified the main elements of a simulation system namely: * Unit operations; the modelling of specific process units, e.g. reactors, distillation columns, heat exchangers. A unit operation has ports defining the locations of material stream inputs and outputs and acquires physical properties from Material Objects. * Material Objects. These represent process fluid, energy or information streams connecting two or more unit operations. A material object is associated with a thermodynamic package which returns physical properties such as density, viscosity, thermal conductivity, etc. * Numerical solvers; efficient iterative numerical methods for solving the highly non-linear equations set formed by a process flow-sheet. Iterative methods are used to solve the equations of both a single unit operation module and to solve the overall flow-sheet containing a number of inter-connected unit operations. Any modelling environment with a CAPE-OPEN interface, for a unit operation or a thermodynamics package, would be able to communicate with any CAPE-OPEN modelling component without the need for additional interfacing software to be written. The CAPE-OPEN specifications define software interfaces for process simulation environments in terms of both the Microsoft standard COM/DCOM and the Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA). Hence both COM and CORBA based simulators are supported by the CAPE-OPEN specifications. The specifications follow an Object Oriented approach and are developed and specified using the Unified Modelling Language (UML). Formal Use Cases are developed to define end-user requirements. The Use Cases summarise the activities and interactions involved with the installation and application of a CAPE-OPEN component within a CAPE- OPEN modelling environment. Once developed, the Use Cases provide an effective procedure for testing new CAPE-OPEN components and environments. Support The Global CAPE-OPEN project ended in 2002 and delivered interface specifications for unit operations (in steady-state) and thermodynamic components. A non-profit organisation, CO-LaN, was subsequently established to maintain and support the existing specifications and to continue the development of additional CAPE-OPEN interface specifications. CAPE-OPEN specifications Currently three main CAPE-OPEN specifications have found wide use within the process industriesMichel Pons, 2009, \\"Making Use of CAPE-OPEN Technology in Process Simulation\\", Conference: 2009 AIChE Annual Meeting, * The unit operation specification, version 1.0, which applies to steady-state modelling * Thermodynamic and physical property interface 1.0 * Thermodynamic and physical property interface version 1.1. This interface is a complete revision of Thermodynamic and physical property interface 1.0 with some extended functionality together with simplifications and increased flexibility designed to make it easier for the CAPE-OPEN implementation to be carried out. Unfortunately this version of the interface is not backwards compatible with version 1.0 The development and support of new CAPE-OPEN components has been actively encouraged and supported by CO-LaNMichel Pons, 2010, \\"How to make use of CAPE-OPEN?\\", 2010 AIChE Annual Meeting, Jasper Van Baten, Michel Pons, 2014, ‚ÄúCAPE‚ÄêOPEN: Interoperability in Industrial Flowsheet Simulation Software‚Äù, Chemie Ingenieur Technik, Volume 86, Issue 7, Pages 1052-1064, DOI: 10.1002/cite.201400009 and attention has focussed on new unit operations, not readily available in commercial simulatorsJasper Van Baten, C√©sar G.

A full list of the available PMEs and PMCs is available on the CO-LaN website. Software tools There is no licensing required from CO-LaN or another organization in order to make use of the CAPE-OPEN specifications. However, CO-LaN has developed a number of tools to assist with the implementation of CAPE-OPEN interfaces: * Software Wizards to assist with the development of the CAPE-OPEN interface for modelling components. * Software code examples for thermodynamic components and unit operations to provide templates for new implementations. * A CAPE-OPEN testing environment into which components can be plugged and tested for conformity against the CAPE-OPEN specifications. * A logging tool to capture all communications between a CAPE-OPEN modelling component and a CAPE-OPEN modelling environmentMichel Pons, Peter Banks, Bertrand Braunschweig, 2007, \\"A deliverable from CO-LaN to CAPE-OPEN developers and users: the CAPE-OPEN logging and testing tool (COLTT)\\", 17th European Symposium on Computed Aided Process Engineering, More information on the CO-LaN software tools together with available downloads can be found on the CO-LaN website. In addition, CAPE-OPEN is implemented in freeware such as COCO simulator, in openware such as DWSIM, and in many of the leading commercial simulation tools. Future developments Specifications under development by the CO-LaN include: * Dynamic unit operations. This extension to the steady-state unit operation specification will allow third party dynamic unit operation models to be used in a CAPE-OPEN compliant dynamic simulation environment. * Chemical reactions which will be issued as an extension to the Thermodynamic interface Michel Pons, 2003, \\"The CAPE-OPEN Interface Specification for Reactions Package\\", Computer-Aided Chemical Engineering, Volume 14, DOI:10.1016/S1570-7946(03)80225-0 * A flow-sheet monitoring specification * A Petroleum fractions interface specification References Category:Simulation software ","title":"CAPE-OPEN Interface Standard"},{"id":"51770034","text":"Gadis Arivia (born 8 September 1964) is an Indonesian feminist philosopher, lecturer, scholar, and activist. While teaching feminism and philosophy at the University of Indonesia, Arivia founded , Indonesia's first feminist journal, in 1996. She was arrested by the Suharto government for protesting against the regime in 1998. Biography Arivia was born in New Delhi, India, in 1964. The daughter of an Indonesian diplomat, she spent most of her childhood abroad; aside from living in India, she also spent time in Ethiopia and Hungary, where she studied at the British Embassy School in Budapest. After some time studying in Indonesia, she completed her senior high school studies at McLean High School in McLean, Virginia, while her brother was stationed in Washington D.C.. After completing her high school studies, Arivia studied the French language in a diploma program at the University of Indonesia, later completing a degree in philosophy at the same university. While completing her baccalaureate studies, Arivia became interested in feminism. She read several works on the subject, including the writings of her lecturer, Toeti Heraty, as well as Barbara Smith's All the Women Are White, All the Blacks Are Men, But Some of Us Are Brave: Black Women's Studies. She began teaching at the University of Indonesia in 1991, and was responsible for the inaugural Feminist Paradigms course before she enrolled at EHESS the School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences in 1992. Arivia received her DEA in social psychology two years later. Upon her return to Indonesia, Arivia resumed teaching. Noting the difficulty of finding feminist materials in Indonesia and hoping to promote democratization efforts and protect minority rights, she began work, supported by Ida Dhanny, Asikin Arif, and Toeti Heraty, to establish the country's first feminist journal. She founded the in 1995, and the inaugural (Women's Journal) was published the following year; Krishna Sen of the University of Western Australia describes it as \\"Indonesia‚Äôs first journal of feminist theory\\". The journal had limited funds for its publication and later social work, and in the eight years that Arivia served as the journal's director, she did not receive a salary. She remains on the journal's board of editors. During the Asian Financial Crisis, Arivia ‚Äì recognized as one of Jakarta's leading feminist scholars ‚Äì protested against the government using the rising price of milk as a camouflage. On 23 February 1998, she joined some twenty other women at the Hotel Indonesia roundabout to protest high prices in a protest organized by Jurnal Perempuan and established Suara Ibu Peduli (\\"Voice of Caring Mothers\\"), an organization coordinated by Arivia. The protesters prayed, sang, distributed flowers, and read a statement that called for greater women's participation in resolving the crisis. Arivia was arrested with two other women, the astronomer Karlina Leksono Supelli and the activist Wilasih Noviana. After receiving extensive public support, the three were released. In 2002, Arivia completed her doctorate studies at the University of Indonesia's philosophy department. Her dissertation, \\"Dekonstruksi Filsafat Barat, Menuju Filsafat Berperspektif Feminis\\" (\\"Deconstructing Western Philosophy, Moving Towards a Feminist Perspective Philosophy\\") was published the following year as Filsafat Berperspektif Feminis (Feminist Perspective Philosophy). In 2009, Arivia published a poetry collection titled Yang Sakral dan yang Sekuler (The Sacred and the Profane). This collection, published a year after the controversial Pornography and Pornoaction law was passed, has been read as a condemnation of the Indonesian state's continued power over women's bodies and sexuality. Arivia in 2006 received the Tasrif Award by Alliance of Independent Journalists (AJI) Arivia teaches contemporary philosophy and feminist theory at the Faculty of Humanities at the University of Indonesia until 2017. In 2018 she joined Montgomery College, Takoma Park, Silver Spring, Maryland as an adjunct professor in sociology and sociology of gender. She is married to Richard Pollard, with whom she has two children, Anisa Joyce Pollard and Benjamin Arif Pollard. She currently lives in Bethesda, Maryland.

From 2015 and 2017, he completed an epic two year long walk across Africa, from Cape Town to Cairo entitled Crossing Africa. Mario is an advocate for the inclusion of diversity in the outdoors and encourages POC (people of colour) to explore the outdoors more often. Rigby leads hikes, small expeditions and speaking engagements between major projects. Rigby was born on November 24, 1985 in Grand Turk Island, Turks and Caicos Islands to Zemar Stingl. He is the oldest of two sons born to Stingl, and he is of Jamaican and Bahamian descent. Shortly after his brother was born, the family relocated to Stuttgart, Germany where they resided for several years before returning to the Caribbean. The family's first move to Canada was to Hamilton, Ontario. Rigby ran competitive track and field for Turks and Caicos from age 14-26 and competed in multiple world championships and IAAF tournaments. After completing high school in Hamilton, he moved to London, ON when he was 18, and attended Western University. He later moved to Toronto where he became a fitness trainer and ran his own gym in downtown Toronto - Magnus Training. = Adventures =  Walk across Africa  451x451px 299x299px In early 2015, Rigby decided he wanted to \\"shatter stereotypes that set narrow limits on what he can aspire to and where he can go\\". He began to research and train for an epic two-year long walk across the continent of Africa. \\"Rigby started training slowly. First, he walked from his home near Queen and Ossington to the Eaton Centre, then up to Bloor Street. Once that five-kilometre trip felt easy, he kept increasing the distance, walking from Toronto to Hamilton and, eventually, from Toronto to Montreal\\". By November 2015, he flew to Cape Town, South Africa, and embarked on a journey that took him through South Africa, Mozambique, Malawi, Tanzania, Kenya, Ethiopia, Sudan, and Egypt. He walked most of the way, only switching his routine to kayak through Lake Malawi, the ninth largest in the world, and second deepest in Africa. He completed the adventure by early 2018 and returned to Toronto in March 2018. Rigby's Crossing Africa Expedition garnered him international acclaim and coverage from digital and print media around the world. A feature article in the Toronto Star was one of the top stories on their website for 2 weeks. He was also interviewed on multiple national Canadian network shows such as The Marilyn Dennis Show, The Social, and CTV National News.  Cycle across Canada  451x451px 234x234px Mario completed a solo and unsupported cycling tour across Canada and the United States from Victoria, British Columbia to St. John's, Newfoundland. The tour began July 19 and ended October 18th. A walk in the park compared to Crossing Africa but this is was an entirely different challenge on its own for Rigby. Training throughout the year and joining charity bike tours to gain experience is how Mario prepared for his tour. Mario kept his route live and trackable on Strava for people to follow along his journey. MEC (Mountain Equipment Co-op) saw the importance in representation of diversity within the outdoor industry and partnered with Mario to help make this tour feasible for him. PURPOSE * Help identify representation of diversity in the outdoor industry. * Inspiring people to enjoy adventure and exploration for the great outdoors. * Promote human powered adventures for the sake of reducing CO2 emissions and living sustainably.

Walking from the CN Tower in Toronto to the summit of Mount Royal in Montreal Donna Foster-Larocque in action ¬© Donna Foster- Laroque/blogIn an interview with CBC‚Äôs Andie Bennett, Foster-Larocque explained the journey. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre trying to mimic exactly what his walk is going to be so that means a back-pack, carrying all of our fuel, the sleeping bag, the tents, our little stove burners, the lamps, the thermal clothing, everything that we can think of that will be on the walk we‚Äôll do together so that he‚Äôll have more experience when he does the trek across Africa.‚Äù Mario Rigby, a Toronto-based personal trainer and former professional track and field athlete, is setting out on the two-year journey on November 24, 2015. He says he is doing it to test his limits and connect with his heritage. The sometime model was born in Turks and Caicos, and has plans to document the Africa crossing in several media. As for the current quest, Rigby arrived in Kingston, Ontario, last night, sharing his fatigue on Twitter. Just beyond the half-way point now, Rigby is expected to arrive atop Mount Royal in Montreal on November 13th or 14th. The 500 kilometre trip from Toronto to Montreal is one many Canadians are familiar with, but only from the point of view of a vehicle.

It functions as a nature reserve and a scientific research station. It is also a popular visitors attraction - both for tourists and for Mauritians. Ile aux Aigrettes website Geography It has an area of 27 ha and is the largest islet in the Grand Port bay, 850 meters off the south-east coast of Mauritius and roughly a kilometer from the coastal town of Mahebourg. It is low-lying and is formed from coral-limestone (unlike the majority of Mauritius which is from volcanic rock). Nature reserve and conservation Mauritian Fody on Ile aux Aigrettes Ile aux Aigrettes conserves the world's only remaining piece of \\"Mauritius Dry Coastal Forest\\" - a once plentiful vegetation type. It is therefore home to a large number of extremely rare or endangered species of plants and animals. Over several hundred years, indigenous flora and fauna was devastated by logging and invasive species. In this sense, the islet shared the same fate as the rest of Mauritius. The Dodo and the indigenous species of giant tortoise became extinct, as did many species of plant.Cheke, A.S. and Hume, J.P. The Lost Land of the Dodo. London: Academic Press. Relicts of some species survived though, and in 1965 the island was declared a nature reserve. There followed intense work to restore the vegetation and the few remaining indigenous animal species. In addition, several other species which had disappeared from the island - but survived elsewhere in Mauritius - were reintroduced.MWF (2010) Ile aux Aigrettes - A Nature Reserve. Mauritius: MWF Reptile species include the large, slow Telfairs Skink, several species of ornately coloured day gecko, and a population of non-indigenous Aldabra giant tortoise, brought to √éle aux Aigrettes to take over the important ecological role of the extinct Mauritian tortoises. The large tortoises eat and spread the plant seeds and thereby help the forest to rejuvenate naturally.Cole, N. (2009) A Field Guide to the Reptiles and Amphibians of Mauritius. Mauritius: MWF.

The plant has a projected capacity of 280 MW, and a projected average annual energy production of 1.2 TWh. It is being developed by JSC Nenskra Hydro, founded in 2015 as a joint venture between Korea Water Resource Corporation and JSC Partnership Fund. The project has faced significant opposition from representatives of all communities in Upper Svaneti.  General Background  The Nenskra river joins the river Enguri from the right side. It is 42 km long with the watershed area of 623 km¬≤. The river originates on elevation of 2915 m above the sea level and is nourished by glaciers, snow, rain, and ground waters. Its water regime is characterized with flood in spring and summer and shallowness in winter. Flood rate is the highest in autumn. In winter the river experiences flood icing, anchor ice, ice apron. Average annual discharge of the Nenskra river is 40.1 m¬≥/sec. In winter, when less water is available from rivers and domestic energy consumption rises, Georgia experiences a deficit in electricity supplies, and imports energy from neighbouring countries. Nenskra HPP is one of the four proposed power schemes with a large regulation capacity, intended to meet the government's strategy to reduce dependency on imported power during the winter.  Description  Nenskra HPP will be constructed in the Nenskra and Nakra valleys on the southern slopes of the Central Caucasus mountains in Mestia Municipality, Svaneti. Construction is scheduled to start in 2020. Nenskra HPP is being implemented based on BOT (Build-operate- transfer) model that stipulates transfer of the ownership to Georgia 36 years after the HPP is commissioned. = Nenskra Powerhouse = The Nenskra HPP powerhouse will house three vertical Pelton turbines of 93 MW capacity each and with 280 MW total installed capacity. Generated power will be transmitted to a Gas Insulated Substation (GIS Substation) and through the transmission line will be connected to the country's power grid. Water flow of 47.0 m/sec will be transferred through a 15.1 km long and 4.5 m wide headrace tunnel to the turbines. In the close proximity with the HPP powerhouse, the headrace tunnel will branch into three separate penstocks to connect to the turbines. Water is transferred to a tunnel through a water intake located on the left bank of the reservoir creating a 130 m high asphalt faced-rockfill dam. The dam will be raised about 5 km off the village of Tita up the narrow gorge of the Nenskra river creating a live storage of 3,176 million m¬≥. From the reservoir, water is to be supplied into the headrace tunnel. To improve the energy scheme, three low-pressure dams will be constructed in the Nakra river valley. Out of the created reservoir, 45.5 m/sec additional water is to be discharged into the Nenskra reservoir through a transfer tunnel allowing the Nenskra HPP to produce 1,219 GWh yearly. The powerhouse of Nenskra HPP is planned on the left bank of the Nenskra river on the edge of village Chuberi. The power unit will consist of the HPP powerhouse and near-located GIS substation. = Nenskra Dam & Nakra Weir = The main structures of the Nenskra dam are to be a 125‚Äì130 high and 870 long dam on the upper Nenskra river to create a live storage of 176 million m¬≥ and a reservoir area at supply level of 2.7 km¬≤. The dam will capture the flows of the Nenskra river and the adjacent Nakra river upstream of the existing Khudoni HPP reservoir, exploiting the available head of 725 m. The Nakra Weir is 8.7 m high and 44 m long located on the Nakra river and is built for impoundment and diversion. = Tunnels = The Nakra transfer tunnel connects the Nakra valley with the Nenskra valley and is approximately 12.5 km long by 3.5 m in diameter and will divert water from behind the Nakra weir and into the Nenskra reservoir. The Nenskra headrace tunnel follows the left bank of the Nenskra valley and is about 15.1 km long by 4.5 m wide. The tunnel connects to the surface penstock upstream of the Powerhouse at a level around 600 m above valley floor level. The power unit will include the HPP powerhouse, tailrace for discharged water and GIS substation. Water will be supplied from the intake of the headrace tunnel to the end of the penstock. The penstock starts from the surge, which then transfers into the turbine tunnels. Waste water will be discharged into the Nenskra river by tailrace. During the operation, 3 units of Pelton turbine type electromechanical plants, each with installed capacity of 93MW will be installed. To defend from the probable maximum flood, the diversion tunnel dimensions are designed to deal with probable maximum discharge of 1 101 m/sec that is 3.67 times as much as expected discharge of 300 m/sec with the rate of once in 10000 years. = Reservoir = According to the previously drawn up plan the reservoir will capture the flow slowly and gradually (layer by layer). The dam will operate in the natural regime of the river through a bottom outlet to keep the water at the level of 1 370 m.  Impacts  = Environmental and Social Impact Assessment Reports (ESIA) = In 2015, the Nenskra Hydropower Project submitted the final Environmental & Social Impact Assessment Report (ESIA) to the Government of Georgia (GoG) as part of the national environmental permitting process. The 2015 ESIA report has been prepared by Gamma Consulting Limited, a Georgian consultant, based on field investigations undertaken in 2011 and 2014 and following the public consultations held in May 2015. The Environmental Permit was issued by the Environmental Authorities in October 2015. Several International Financial Institutions (the Lenders) have been approached to finance the Project. To ensure compliance with their Environmental and Social (E&S;) policies, the Lenders recommended that a number of Supplementary E&S; Studies be undertaken. In 2017 the supplementary studies-based report consisting of ten volumes was disclosed to the general public. The report is available at JSC Nenskra Hydro web-site. Based on the research made JSC Nenskra Hydro has prepared The Environmental and Social Impact management Plan. The plan aims at implementing mitigation measures during the construction and operation in compliance with Georgian legislative requirements and international standards. Disclosure of the report has started in March 2017. During the disclosure period JSC Nenskra Hydro should introduce the relevant report data to the general public of Georgia, Nenskra and Nakra valleys communities, NGOs, Government of Georgia and other stakeholders. = Economical impact of the project = According to the National Statistics Office of Georgia, JSC Nenskra investment was among the 2015 direct investments Top 10. The Nenskra HPP Project will create jobs for the local population both during the construction and operation. 100% of unskilled labor will be represented by residents of the Nenskra and Nakra valleys. 75% of partly unskilled labor will be provided by Georgians, out of whom 50% will be residents of Mestia. In 2016, the project company conducted a study to identify the needs of the local residents. With the study findings and needs of the population in view, the project company launched a community investment program with the following goals: * create jobs for the local population through support and strengthening of local business * develop and reinforce the village areas through encouraging of agricultural business and collective farms * increase involvement of the population into economic and social activities * contribute to market and touristic business in the Nenskra and Nakra valleys = Social Impacts = Some 400 families live in close by villages (Chuberi and Nakra). The majority are Svans, an ethnic subgroup of Georgia's Caucasus mountains with their own language, laws and traditions. The traditions, culture, and identity of the Svans' is rooted in their mountain location. For generations, they have lived in isolation and self-dependence and their livelihoods depend on forestry, grazing and subsistence agriculture. Approximately 28 households will be affected by the project's land acquisition phase, either through permanent loss of land or temporary loss of access to pastures near the dam and reservoir sites. = Geological & Environmental Impacts = \\"[From a] nature preservation point of view, not all of these larger [rivers] like Enguri and smaller rivers like Nenskra and Nakra should be used for hydropower generation.\\" Prof. Dr. Frank Schrader, International Consultant on Hydropower, in his review of the Nenskra ESIA. The project site was originally proposed to be included within the European system of protected areas as the ‚ÄòSvaneti 1‚Äô Emerald site. In January 2016 the Georgian government attempted to exclude all territories to form part of the planned Nenskra project, without providing any evidence that the Nenskra and Nakra valleys are less important in terms of biodiversity than the rest of the Svaneti region. This resulted in a complaint to the Berne Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats for a violation of a number of articles of the convention. The dam construction will also include constructions of bypass and access roads, high voltage transmission lines and substations. These construction may increase landslides. An indirect result of this project is also the increased chance of flooding because of the mudflows. These mudflows have the potential of blocking the Nakra river, creating flooding upstream. Svaneti is a landslides and mud-flows sensitive area. The local cemetery and agricultural fields of the village of Nakra are regularly flooded by mud-flows. These mudflows have the potential of blocking the Nakra river, creating flooding upstream. Yet according to a review of the Nenskra Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA), the geologic hazards and potential adverse impacts on locals have not been properly evaluated.  Involvement of International Financial Institutions  The project involves the following international financial institutions: European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), Asian Development Bank (ADB), European Investment Bank (EIB), Korean Development Bank (KDB), Italian Export Credit Agency (SACE) and Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB).  Project implementation  The Project is being implemented by K-water, a sole multi- purpose dam management company in Korea and international engineering companies, such as Stucky, Mott MacDonald and Lombardi. The company has announced \\"international tender\\" to select Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) Contractor. Independent International Panel of Experts (IPOE) is monitoring all designs and activities, to ensure dam safety and its compliance with the environmental and social standards.

He is an IBM Fellow and Vice President at IBM Thomas J Watson Research Center, Yorktown Hts, NY. His pioneering work in the miniaturization of semiconductor devices changed the world of computing. His research led to the first generation of voltage-scaled deep-submicron CMOS with sufficient performance to totally replace bipolar technology in IBM mainframes and enable new high-performance UNIX servers. He is credited with leading IBM into the use of copper and silicon on insulator before its rivals. He is a member of the U.S. National Academy of Engineering and is known for his seminal contributions to the field of CMOS technology. He is an IEEE Fellow, recipient of the J J Ebers Award in 2005 and IEEE Andrew S. Grove Award in 2010. At the present time, he leads the Next Generation Systems Area of research. Education Bijan Davari was born in Tehran, Iran, in 1954. He received his bachelor's degree in electrical engineering from Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, and his master's degree from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI). He received his doctorate from RPI as well with a thesis on the interface behavior of semiconductor devices, and joined IBM Thomas J Watson Research Center in 1984. Technical achievements At IBM, Davari worked on ways to improve MOSFET (metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor) and CMOS (complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor) technology, which provides the basis for much of today's semiconductor processing. In 1985, Davari began the task of defining IBM's next generation of CMOS integrated circuits, which came to be called CMOS-5X. He led the research efforts that produced the first generation of high-performance, low voltage deep submicron CMOS technology. CMOS-5X served as the basis for the PowerPC¬Æ 601+ and several other microprocessors, including those used in IBM System/390 servers. Davari defined the roadmap for technology and voltage scaling for IBM which influenced the CMOS roadmap for the industry down to 70 nm regime. This technology led to several generations of high-performance, low-voltage and low-power CMOS technologies that enabled servers, portable computers and battery powered handheld devices. Davari and his team at IBM also demonstrated the first shallow trench isolation (STI) process. STI helps prevent electrical current leakage between semiconductor devices on an integrated circuit. STI process was first used in IBM's 0.5-micrometer technology node for high-performance CMOS logic and in 16-Megabit dynamic RAM. It was eventually used widely throughout the industry. In 1987, Davari led an IBM research team that demonstrated the first MOSFET with 10 nanometer gate oxide thickness, using tungsten-gate technology. In 1988, he led an IBM team that demonstrated high-performance dual-gate CMOS devices with 180 nm to 250nm channel lengths. Davari was one of the leaders in the Cell Broadband Engine work at IBM, which was used to build the first Cell-based supercomputer, IBM Roadrunner. In 2008, the Roadrunner supercomputer was the first to break the petaflop barrier, reaching a processing speed of 1.026 petaflops.

Since October 2017 Ratnam has been a member of the Victorian Legislative Council, representing the Northern Metropolitan Region. Prior to this she was a councillor and former mayor for the City of Moreland. Early life Born in England and raised in Sri Lanka, Samantha Ratnam and her family left the country after the 'Black July' 1983 riots in Colombo that gave rise to 30-year Sri Lankan Civil War between the government and Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, a Tamil separatist group. The family eventually settled in Australia after spending time in Europe and Canada. From 1995 to 2001 Samantha Ratnam completed a Bachelor of Arts and a Bachelor of Social Work (Honours) from the University of Melbourne. She completed in 2015 her Doctor of Philosophy in Youth Sociology ‚Äì Young People and Citizenship, also from the University of Melbourne. Ratnam has worked in various roles in assisting migrants and asylum seekers including at the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre, in the fields of drug and alcohol rehabilitation, mental health and international development. In April 2014 Samantha Ratnam explained in The Indian Sun, an online publication for the Australian-Indian community how she is a product of diaspora and her motivations for entering politics. Moreland Council Ratnam first stood for and was elected to the City of Moreland Council for South Ward in 2012 as one of three Ward Councillors. In 2016 she was re-elected with her vote more than doubling to over 55 percent of the ward vote. In 2015 she was elected by councillors as the first Greens mayor of Moreland for 2016 in a 6 to 5 vote with Independent Councillor Helen Davidson and Socialist Alliance Councillor Sue Bolton supporting her bid for the mayor. Her election as Mayor was even noted in the country of her heritage, Sri Lanka, and by the Indian community in Australia, and in Tamil culture. In her time on the council, Ratnam was instrumental in removing official council references to Australia Day, saying ‚Äúthis is a gesture of respect and an important step in healing‚Äù. Ratnam resigned from the council on 11 October 2017. 2016 Federal election campaign Ahead of the 2016 federal election the Greens preselected Ratnam to stand in the Division of Wills, where the sitting MP Kelvin Thomson was retiring. During the election campaign Ratnam was invited as a speaker to address an anti-racism rally in the Victoria Street mall in Coburg. With the threat of violence raised by right-wing groups such as the United Patriots Front organising a counter rally in Bridge Reserve nearby, Ratnam withdrew from attending just two days before the rally. The advertised anti-racism rally occurred without violence, however at Bridge Reserve and on Bell Street, Coburg other left-wing anti-racist protesters confronted the right wing protesters with the police needing to use pepper spray. Subsequently, Ratnam wrote an opinion article for SBS on racism and why she chose not to attend the rally. One of the organisers of the rally, Cr Sue Bolton, also wrote an opinion article on why it was essential for the anti-racism rally to be held, despite right-wing threats to disrupt it and calls by others for council to cancel it. Although Ratnam substantially increased the Greens vote with a swing greater than 10 percentage points in Wills, the Labor candidate Peter Khalil won the seat with a 4.88 point margin. State politics Ratnam filled the vacant Legislative Council seat of former Victorian Greens leader Greg Barber, who announced his retirement from politics on 28 September 2017. On 12 October 2017, prior to having officially filled Barber's seat, Ratnam was appointed as leader of the Victorian Greens, becoming the first woman to lead the party at a state level. She was officially sworn in as a member of the Legislative Council on 19 October 2017. Ratnam was re-elected in the Northern Metropolitan region at the 2018 state election, though her four party colleagues failed to win back their seats and she became the only Greens member of the Legislative Council.

In 1920, he moved to Anticoli Corrado. By 1922, he began a long collaboration with the \\"Lenci\\" company of Turin producing ceramics. In 1925, he helped design the sets for the presentation in Turin of L'Italiana in Algeri. In 1926, he traveled to New York to design sets for the Metropolitan Theater. The next year he was made professor of Scenography for the Scuola Superiore di Architettura of Turin. In 1927, he participated in the III Biennale di Monza, and at the Exposition d'Artistes Italiens Contemporaines in Geneva, and the Promotrice of Turin. In 1928, he exhibited at the Venice Biennale. In 1929, he was one of the founders of the Gruppo dei Sei of Turin, a group of expressionist painters active mainly in Turin. The group was formed of Jessie Boswell (1881‚Äì1956), Nicola Galante (1883‚Äì1969), Carlo Levi (1902‚Äì1975), Francesco Menzio (1899‚Äì1979), and Enrico Paulucci Delle Roncole (1901‚Äì1999). The group exhibited together for about two years, and dissolved after criticism from fascist authorities. He continued to exhibit during the early 1930s, until his death from tuberculosis in 1935, in Turin.

It can, however, be used for diversions during engineering work or emergency timetable changes. History The line was opened by the London and Blackwall Extension Railway (LBER) on 2 April 1849 and is built on a viaduct between Gas Factory Junction on the LTSR and Bow Junction on the GEML. When the line first opened, the only intermediate station was at Bow and Bromley, however this closed the following year. It was later rebuilt and reopened as on 1 October 1876. The station was re-sited on 4 April 1892, and was located down-line from . On 21 April 1941 Bow Road was closed due to bomb damage sustained during the Blitz but re-opened on 9 December 1946. It closed between 6 January and 6 October 1947 so that a number of alterations could be made. The line was electrified at this point and the original intention was to run shuttle services between Stratford and Fenchurch Street via Limehouse. Following nationalisation of the railways in 1948, the line became part of the Eastern Region of British Rail. It was later decided to withdraw passenger services from the line and Bow Road station was permanently closed on 7 November 1949. The line remains open for diversions. The route was reduced to a single track in 1986 to allow the Docklands Light Railway's - branch to share the alignment north of the station.

Its primary role is to be the custodian of the Alternative Investment Standards (formerly known as \\"the Standards\\"), which are designed to create a \\"framework of transparency, integrity and good governance\\" in the way the hedge fund industry operates.  History  The SBAI originated in June 2007, when a group of leading alternative investment managers formed the Hedge Fund Working Group to develop industry standards in areas such as disclosure, valuation, risk management, governance, and shareholder conduct. Founding firms included Marshall Wace, Cheyne Capital Management, Man Group, and CQS. In January 2008, the working group was established as a nonprofit, called the Hedge Fund Standards Board (HFSB). Its primary purpose was to oversee what's called the \\"Standards\\" (now known as the \\"Alternative Investment Standards\\"). At its inception, the board had 14 leading hedge fund managers and was chaired by Sir Andrew Large to develop the standards. By 2016 it had almost 200 hedge fund managers and institutional investors as members; the total assets under management of all members was $3 trillion. In 2014, the board became an affiliate member of the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) and in 2016 established mutual observer relationship with the International Forum of Sovereign Wealth Funds. On July 2011, Dame Amelia Fawcett was appointed Chair of the SBAI, replacing Andrew Large. In 2014, SBAI became an affiliate member of International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) and in 2016 SBAI and International Forum of Sovereign Wealth Funds (IFSWF) agreed to engage in mutual observership. In September 2017, the board announced that it was changing its name from HFSB to the SBAI or Standards Board for Alternative Investments (SBAI) to \\"reflect the evolution of the industry\\". Specifically, it noted that \\"managers increasingly offer their investment strategies through a variety of vehicles beyond 'hedge funds', including liquid alternatives, regulated funds, co-investment vehicles, drawdown funds, and managed accounts\\" while at the same time moving away from \\"hedge fund\\" as a term in order to \\"classify and integrate a diverse array of alternatives strategies by underlying asset class, return profile, market exposure, or liquidity\\".

The seven-line long poem is one of the five so-called \\"chronicle poems\\" found in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle; it is preceded by \\"The Battle of Brunanburh\\" (937) and followed by the two poems on King Edgar. In the Parker MS, the text of \\"Brunanburh\\" is written by the same scribe as \\"Capture\\", which starts on the line for 941 but has the correct date added by another hand. Frank Stenton comments that the poem \\"is overloaded with cliches\\", but also packs a lot of historical information, recording how the conquest of Mercia by King Edmund liberated, in 942, the people of the Five Boroughs (Leicester, Lincoln, Derby, Nottingham, Stamford) from the Norsemen under Olaf Guthfrithson and Amla√≠b Cuar√°n. These people were not English‚Äîrather, they were Danes, who by this time considered themselves so English that they preferred King Edmund over their Norse overlords who had invaded their territory from Viking York. According to Sarah Foot, these \\"anglicised\\" Danes, liberated by Edmund, must thus have been Christian as well, and the poem aids in the construction of an English identity out of different ethnic groups united in their opposition to outside, pagan forces.

Game theory, based on Johan Huizinga's Homo Ludens, argues that playing video games provides a way to learn about the world. Games offer opportunities for players to explore, practice, and re- enforce cultural and social identities. Video games predominantly created and played by one racial group can unintentionally perpetuate racial stereo-types and limit players' choices to preconceived notions of racial bias. Demographics of video game players There are mixed results on the demographics of people who play video games. While one study mentions that African American and Hispanic children make up the majority of video game players, a study by Pew Research Center finds that 73.9% of white children play video games compared to 26.1% of nonwhite children. The Pew Research Center found that 19% of Hispanic respondents and 11% of Black respondents described themselves as \\"gamers,\\" compared to 7% of Whites. Another report by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that African American and Hispanic youth ages 8‚Äì18 spend more time with video games on average than White youth. Nielsen survey research found similar results. In her work, Adrienne Shaw describes how the gamer identities of players intersect with identities of gender, race, and sexuality. Another Pew study showed that 89% of Black teens play video games, as well as 69% of Hispanic teens. In addition, white and Hispanic teen gamers were 'more likely than blacks to report feeling angry while playing online.' People of color in the games industry A 2014-2015 report published in 2016 by the International Game Developers Association found that people of color were both underrepresented in senior management roles as well as underpaid in comparison to white developers. Gaming convention organizer Avinelle Wing told Newsweek, \\"The industry has an even bigger problem with race than it does with gender.‚Äù Many have pointed out that this lack of diversity within the industry has contributed to a lack of representation within video games themselves. Dennis Mathews, a game designer at Revelation Interaction Studios, suggests that the exclusion of non-white game developers leads to stereotyping within video game development and marketing. Developer prejudices impact who counts as a game's target audience, leading many developers to pigeonhole or ignore non-white gamers. As Mathews puts it, \\"Those stereotypes tie into publisher decisions of what games get picked up and what should be put into games.\\" The Game Developers Conference, a popular annual video game conference frequented by both industry and players, runs an \\"Advocacy Track\\" to \\"address new and existing issues within the realm of social advocacy. Topics covered range from diversity to censorship to quality of life.\\" While initially started in 2013 to address issues around gender and gaming, the \\"Advocacy Track\\" features panels explicitly interested in improving diversity in gaming more broadly, including concerns around race. One of the earliest pioneers in the gaming industry was African-American engineer Jerry Lawson, who helped develop the first cartridge-based home video game console. Other people of African descent in gaming include industry executive Gordon Bellamy. Notable Hispanics in the gaming industry include John Romero, co-creator of Doom, often called the first true \\"first-person shooter.\\" Racial representations in video games Through interactive gameplay, players learn about race through the types of characters that are portrayed in the virtual reality. Some scholars argue that the way racial groups are portrayed in video games may affect the way video game players perceive defining characteristics of a racial group. The presence or absence of racial groups affects how players belonging to those racial groups see themselves in terms of the development of their own identity and self-esteem. The idea of portraying different races is not something entirely new in the history of video games. Early games, including some MMORPGs like World of Warcraft, featured multiple playable (fictional) races that the player could choose from at the beginning of the game. Compared to the research on gender stereotyping, fewer studies have examined racial stereotyping in video games. Light skin tones are seen as the default skin color for many games. The portrayal of racial minorities in video games has been demonstrated to have a tendency to follow certain racial stereotypes. A study by the Children Now organization in 2001 noted that of the 1,716 video game characters analyzed, all Latino characters \\"appeared in a sports-oriented game, usually baseball.\\" 83% of African-American males were portrayed as competitors in sports-oriented games, while 86% of African-American females were either \\"props, bystanders, or participants in games, but never competitors.\\" Research by Anna Everett and Craig Watkins in 2007 claims that since then, the number of black and Latino characters has increased with the rising popularity of \\"urban/street games,\\" while their portrayal has remained consistently narrow. In the action/shooter genre of urban/street games, both blacks and Latinos are typically portrayed as \\"brutally violent, casually criminal, and sexually promiscuous.\\" The protagonist of the Just Cause series, Rico Rodriguez, is Hispanic, as is 'Ding' Chavez, protagonist of Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six. In the sports genre, blacks are typically portrayed as \\"verbally aggressive and extraordinarily muscular and athletic.\\" African Americans are represented as aggressive or athletic characters more often than as protagonists or heroes. In a 2009 survey of 150 games across nine platforms, University of Southern California Professor Dmitri Williams \\"found that fewer than 3 percent of video game characters were recognizably Hispanic and none were playable. Native Americans and biracial characters were non-existent. Though, Native Americans have been the protagonists of several video games, most notably in the Turok series, and in the 2006 title Prey. African Americans enjoyed a rate of 10.74 percent, with a big caveat; they were mostly athletes and gangsters.\\" In a study that examined the top 10 most-highly rated games for each year from 2007‚Äì2012, Ithaca College graduate Ross Orlando found that \\"black and Asian characters each have 3 percent representation in the pool of main protagonists; Latino a mere 1 percent.\\" In 2015, Pew Research Center found that 35% of blacks, 36% of Hispanics, and 24% of whites surveyed believe that minorities are portrayed poorly in video games. The range of playable characters in certain gaming contexts has an overtly racial component. Some have argued that the high proportion of black male characters in sports video games (according to David J. Leonard, 80% of black male video game characters as of 2003 were sports competitors) have enabled (predominantly white male) gamers to practice what Adam Clayton Powell III refers to as \\"high-tech blackface\\", a digital form of minstrelsy that allows white players to effectively 'try on' blackness without being forced to acknowledge or confront the degrading racist histories surrounding minstrelsy. The potential for video games as a site for promulgating reductive, racist tropes has prompted many to point out the use of yellowface, or \\"the donning and using of the \\"yellow\\" body by whites\\" to degrade and invisiblize Asian characters in a variety of games as well. Anthony Sze-Fai Shiu argues that the Duke Nukem 3D series (including Duke Nukem 3D and its spiritual sequel Shadow Warrior) enable the gamer to identify strongly with the protagonist, due to the first-person perspective employed by the games. \\"These characters, then, establish a scenario where the player's control over virtual embodiment demands critical decisions concerning subjective investments in the games‚Äô scenarios and narratives. As such, both Duke Nukem 3D‚Äôs and Shadow Warrior's speculations concerning white subjectivity and yellowface performance call for an investigation into the value of performing as a racial other for the sake of game play.\\" Controversies There have been a number of controversies surrounding race and video games, including public debates about Resident Evil 5, Sid Meier's Civilization IV: Colonization, Left 4 Dead 2, BioShock Infinite, World of Warcraft, and Grand Theft Auto: Vice City. Video games may influence the learning of young players about race and urban culture.Everett A., Watkins C. and Salen K (ed.) \\"The Power of play: the portrayal and performance of race in video games. The ecology of games: connecting youth, games and learning.\\" The John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation Series on Digital Media and Learning. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA 2008 p141‚Äì166. The portrayal of race in some video games such as the Grand Theft Auto series, Custer's Revenge, 50 Cent: Bulletproof, and Def Jam: Fight for NY has been controversial. The 2002 game, Grand Theft Auto: Vice City was criticized as promoting racist hate crimes. The game takes place in 1986, in \\"Vice City\\", a fictionalized Miami. It involves a gang war between Haitian and Cuban refugees which involves the player's character.\\"Haitian-Americans protest Vice City.\\" GameSpot website Accessed 18 August 2006.\\"Take-two: self censoring \\"Vice City\\".\\" GameSpot website. Accessed 18 August 2006. However, it is possible to play the game without excessive killing.Hourigan B. \\"The moral code of grand theft auto IV.\\" Accessed 1 December 2013. The 2009 game Resident Evil 5 is set in Africa, and as such has the player kill numerous African antagonists. In response to criticism, promoters of Resident Evil 5 argued that to censor the portrayal of black antagonists was discrimination in itself. In 2008, the release of Sid Meier's Civilization IV: Colonization was controversial for giving players the ability to colonize the Americas. For some critics, like Ben Fritz, the game was 'offensive' since it allowed players to do ‚Äúhorrific things .. or whitewash some of the worst events of human history.‚Äù Fritz wrote, ‚Äúthe idea that 2K and Firaxis and Sid Meier himself would make and release a game in the year 2008 that is not only about colonization, but celebrates it by having the player control the people doing the colonizing is truly mind boggling.‚Äù Firaxis Games' president Steve Martin responded by pointing out how ‚Äúthe game does not endorse any particular position or strategy‚Äîplayers can and should make their own moral judgments.‚Äù There was significant backlash against Ben Fritz on online forums and blogs, with gameplayers talking about how colonization has always happened, and this is just realism. Others talked about how colonization and racism are two different things. Rebecca Mir and Trevor Owens write about how 'The game is undoubtedly offensive, but it would be impossible to create a value-free simulation of the colonial encounter. ... if there is something regrettable about the game in its current state, it is that it is not offensive enough. While the game lets you do some rather evil things, those evil things are nevertheless sanitized versions of the events that actually took place in reality.' Ken White says 'Empire-building games always involve conflict ‚Äî often violent ‚Äî with other people, and the more sophisticated ones almost always depict stronger groups overcoming weaker groups. Many involve religious or cultural conversion of some sort. Many permit digital genocide, with your little nation of abstractions defeating another little nation of abstractions mercilessly. ... While the graphics, gameplay detail, and level of abstraction vary widely, they all come down to build, manage, conquer, and destroy.' Media theorist Alexander Galloway, in his book, Gaming: Essays on Algorithmic Culture argues about how these kinds of games are always an ‚Äúideological interpretation of history‚Äù or the ‚Äútranscoding of history into specific mathematical models.‚Äù  Effects and Applications  Video games have also had an effect on the ability of racial minorities to express their identities online in semi-protected environments. The limited constraints in regards to character design in multiplayer games, such as Minecraft, allow video game players to alter their outer appearance in game to match their real life appearance as closely as they choose.

He is also chief executive officer of A&CT.;  Life  Christoph Tisch always was creative and inspired. When he was just 8 years old he created his first animated cartoon short movies. Drawing was one of his biggest hobbies. At the age of 14 his first website went live. Design was always an important part of his life and spent a lot of time in artworks, websites and he got his first jobs with well known companies. In 2001 he founded the advertising agency perfectborn focused on graphic and web design. Some years later he worked for known brands in the fashion and fitness industry and got a range of know-how. Now he has his own fashion label, but is still designing for other companies. He is also known for new artful fashion finishing techniques. Real gold, leather designs, spraying and very unusual vintage looks are some of his techniques.  Creator  Christoph Tisch is the creator of the T&Leather; technology. A technique which combines fabric with synthetic leather are his specialization. Logos, slogans and patterns in the form of leather. A revolution in the fashion industry.  Brand  In 2004 Christoph Tisch founded EPANDOR, as an award- winning eSport team. From the beginning he had the vision to make unique shirts under this brand name. One year later, the first shirts came online. The goal of the label was to catch people's eye with special features. Instead of big prints, the brand started using patterns and brief slogans in the form of leather appliqu√©s. A special technique was developed to give the leather appliqu√©s a lasting hold on fabric without affecting wearing comfort. Due to the fact that leather on T-shirts was still rather uncommon at this time, since 2013 the technique has only been used for small features, such as logos.

She studied at the University of Heidelberg, before being pulled out of the University by her father, and being forced to flee the country to avoid Nazi persecution. Later in her life, she posthumously published a number of Otto Brendel's works. Biography =Early life= An image of the German classical art expert Maria Weigert Brendel as a child. Born to director of the state court Erich Weigert and the daughter of a banker, Maria Weigert was the first girl to attend a normally boys only German Gymnasium. She was childhood friends with Dietrich Bonhoeffer. She went on to study at the University of Heidelberg, studying with Professor Ludwig Curtius. It was there that she met her future husband, Otto. When she was almost finished with her degree, while writing her dissertation on the Ludovisi Throne, her father discovered her relationship with Otto and pulled her out of the university, ending her doctoral career. =Marriage and children= Maria Weigert married Otto Brendel in 1929. In 1931, they moved near the University of Erlangen for Otto's new position. Here, their daughter Cornelia was born. *Cornelia Brendel Foss (1931) German artist, married to Lukas Foss. = Life and works = In 1932, the family moved to Rome for Otto's position as First Assistant at the German Archaeological Institute, but in 1936, Otto was dismissed from his post because he was married to Maria, a non-Aryan. Maria moved back to Berlin with Cornelia, living under a false name so nobody suspected her Jewish identity. On September 3, 1939, Maria and Cornelia left Germany and immigrated to St. Louis, Missouri, where Otto was already living. In 1956, they moved to New York City, where both Maria and Otto were actively involved in the Archaeology Club. Other members included Dorothy Hill, Homer and Dorothy Thompson, Frances Follin Jones of the Princeton Art Gallery, and Evelyn Harrison. After Otto died in September 1973, Maria began to publish and distribute a number of Otto's unfinished works. She translated The Symbolism of the Sphere from German into English, and an article on \\"Iphigeneia in Tauris in Euripides and Goethe\\" from English to German. She arranged for Emeline Richardson to complete his book Etruscan Art, and later for Francesca Serra Ridgway to write the second edition.

Biography N√°lepka was born into a peasant family in the village of Smi≈æany, in Spi≈°sk√° Nov√° Ves District. From 1931, he worked as a teacher in Stupava, Poruba pod Vihorlatom, Doln√° Marikov√° and Horn√° Marikov√°. He served as a lieutenant in the Czechoslovak Army from 1934. In 1941, the German-allied Slovak State participated in Operation Barbarossa, Nazi Germany's attack on the Soviet Union, and the military unit in which N√°lepka served was sent to fight against the Red Army on the Eastern Front. In 1942, while he was Chief of Staff of a Slovak regiment stationed in the town of Yel‚Äôsk, N√°lepka started organizing an underground anti-fascist group inside the army. For example, N√°lepka's group would give the local population information about the situation on the front lines, sabotage railway tracks, and give false information to German military aviators, so that they would bomb uninhabited forest areas instead of towns and villages. The same year, N√°lepka also established contacts with Soviet partisans. On the night between 14 and 15 June 1943, N√°lepka and several other Slovak officers and soldiers defected from the Slovak Army and joined the partisans. They formed a partisan detachment and fought against the German troops, and called for Slovak soldiers to join them. N√°lepka was made commander of the detachment, and was given the nickname Repkin by the Soviet partisans. Early in November 1943, N√°lepka joined the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. On 16 November 1943, N√°lepka's detachment tried to liberate the town of Ovruch from German occupation, together with Soviet partisans and troops of the 1st Ukrainian Front. However, N√°lepka and several other Slovak anti-fascist fighters were attacked and perished during an assault on the town's railway station. He was buried in a mass grave in Chernivtsi. Awards Posthumously, J√°n N√°lepka received the titles Hero of the Soviet Union (May 2, 1945) ‚Äì making him the only Slovak to be awarded this title ‚Äì and Hero of the Slovak National Uprising (May 5, 1945).

A commemorative plaque has been placed on the house in Smi≈æany where he was born, and a street there has also been named after him. Overall, more than a hundred streets in former Czechoslovakia, and several in the former Soviet Union, bear N√°lepka's name. A school in Stupava, where N√°lepka worked as a teacher, has been named after him, and there is an equestrian statue of him in the same town.

Navis actuaria (plural: naves actuariae) was a type of transport ship used by the Roman navy. The ship had sails and up to 30 oars (15 on each side). They were short, narrow at bow and stern. and wider midships. They were one of the fastest ships and they were very easy to maneuver. They had a flat hull, so that they could run aground without being damaged. Furthermore, the Navis actuaria could go ashore both forwards and backwards, since it was equipped with rudders fore and aft. The ship could run aground on a beach, unload, and depart without damage. When they took damage they did not sink into the water. The ship was therefore suitable for the transport of supplies and horses. It is believed that a navis actuaria was long and wide. The ship's draft was low (about ). Most of the naves actuariae were not armed. However, ships that were used in 16 CE under general Germanicus, carried light weaponry. The navis actuaria should not be confused with the navis lusoria, which was a small patrol boat used in Late Antiquity. References *Emil Luebeck : Actuariae .

Holm is best known for creating The Old Town Museum in Aarhus, Denmark, an open-air 'living' museum on the history of Danish life and architecture with a focus on the changes brought to urban life by the industrialization of the early 20th century and the development of the city through time. Holm worked against established museum organizations to create the first open air museum in Scandinavia and one of the largest open air museums in Europe.  Private life  Bust of Peter Holm at the Old Town in Aarhus Peter Holm was born in Aarhus on 13 April 1873. He was from an old Aarhusian family of craftsmen and had from his earliest years an interest in history, especially locally. He graduated from Jonstrup Seminary in 1891 and from 1894 to 1918 he worked as a teacher at Aarhus Municipal schools. In 1898 he obtained a translator's license in translation in English and over the following years he translated a number of from English. In 1899 he was married with Agnes Charlotte von Haven (1876-1929) with whom he had the son Ralph Christian. He was self-taught in the museum world; originally trained as a school-teacher, later working as a translator in English and German in many years alongside his work at the museum. As a school teacher he was known for his skills of persuasion. He had a teacher's license in Swedish, German, English and French and was a teacher for 27 years, of which 20 took place in Aarhus. In 1907 he was elected to the board of the Aarhus Museum. The same year he was appointed to chairman for the committee to hold a historical exhibit of Aarhus on the Danish National Exhibition of 1909. In 1909 he was made inspector of the museum Den gamle Borgmesterg√•rd (English: The Old Mayors's Mansion), consisting of a stately house formerly occupied by many of Aarhus' mayors. For the National Exhibition Holm reconstructed in the mayor's mansion a number of rooms from different time periods between 1597‚Äì1848. The exhibition won such acclaim that a wish to preserve the mayors mansion as a museum manifested. After some negotiation the mansion was moved from the former exhibition grounds and rebuilt in 1914 at Aarhus Botanical Gardens. In spite of opposition in the museum-world Holm gradually expanded the museum which over time turned into a nationally unique institution with some 55 buildings from the end of the 1500s to the beginning of the 1800s. In 1921 his marriage with Agnes Charlotte von Haven was dissolved. He was married again in 1921, to Petra Julie Nielsen (1889-1983) who from that year became responsible for the textile collection in The Old Town, Aarhus, from 1938 as a museum inspector. In 1924 the museum was renamed K√∏bstadmuseet Den Gamle By (Market Town Museum: The Old Town). Holm especially worked with atmospheric tableau's and built convincing streets-capes and interiors. In 1933 he was made Museum Director which he stayed until 1945. In addition to work at the school and museum Holm was involved in a number of local museum and tourism organizations. He was secretary for Samvirkende Jydske Turistforeninger for 12 years and was in the board of the Gamle Bygningers Bevaring. He was also in the board of Turistforeningen for Aarhus og omegn and in 1903 he became member of the Kongelige Nordiske Oldskriftsselskab.  Honors  In 1934 he was awarded the Hielmstierne-Rosencroneske stiftelses prismedalje. In 1946 he was made dr. phil. honoris causa at Aarhus University. He received the Order of the Dannebrog and was later made Knights of the Order of the Dannebrog.

It is bounded by M√ºllerstra√üe, Seestra√üe, Volkspark Rehberge, Goethepark, and the border with the neighboring borough of Reinickendorf. A large number of streets have names related to Africa, particularly parts of Africa that were involved in the German colonization of Africa. These include Afrikanische Stra√üe, Damara Stra√üe, Dualastra√üe, Ghanastra√üe, Guineastra√üe, Kameruner Stra√üe, Kongostra√üe, L√ºderitzstra√üe, Mohasistra√üe, Otawistra√üe, Petersallee, Sambesistra√üe, Sansibarstra√üe, Senegalstra√üe, Swakopmunder Stra√üe, Tangastra√üe, Togostra√üe, Transvaalstra√üe, Ugandastra√üe, Usambarastra√üe, and Windhuker Stra√üe, along with Nachtigalplatz.  Naming  Street sign for L√ºderitzstra√üe, named after Adolf L√ºderitz Prior to the First World War, Carl Hagenbeck planned the creation of a new zoo similar to his Tierpark Hagenbeck in Hamburg on the grounds of what is today Volkspark Rehberge, including also a human zoo featuring peoples from Germany's overseas colonies. A Rep. 000-02-01, Nr. 2193 (Vorlage vom 19. 3. 1912) The war interrupted these plans, but the streets had largely been named by that point. A number of streets have been the point of controversy in the African Quarter. In particular, the streets named after Germans who were involved in colonizing parts of Africa, such as L√ºderitzstra√üe, Petersallee, and Nachtigalplatz, which have been the target of occasional renaming initiatives. These names are criticized as discriminatory relics of colonialism and imperialism, honoring colonial figures who have since undergone historical re-evaluation. In 1986, Petersallee was re- dedicated to Hans Peters, a resistance fighter against Nazism, but the name remained unchanged. Since the late 1990s, over 1,000 African immigrants have moved to the African Quarter (predominantly from Ghana, Cameroon, and Nigeria), for an estimated total of 2,500 citizens of various African nations officially residing in the quarter, although this figure does not include naturalized African immigrants or their children. Of Berlin's 20,000 residents of African heritage, a large portion lives in Wedding and neighboring Tiergarten.  Architecture  Many of the buildings in the Afrikanisches Viertel date back to the 1920s and 1930s. The area is also home to the , as well as four buildings along Afrikanische Stra√üe between Sambesistra√üe and Seestra√üe designed by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe.

One of a number of paintings by Watts in this period on the theme of the corrupting influence of wealth, Mammon shows a scene from Edmund Spenser's The Faerie Queene in which Mammon, the embodiment of greed, crushes the weak through his indifference to their plight. This reflected Watts's belief that wealth was taking the place of religion in modern society, and that this worship of riches was leading to social deterioration. The painting was one of a group of works Watts donated to the South Kensington Museum (now the Victoria and Albert Museum) in late 1886, and in 1897 it was one of 17 Watts paintings transferred to the newly created Tate Gallery. Although rarely exhibited outside the Tate Gallery, the popularity of reproductions made Mammon one of Watts's better known paintings. Background alt=elderly bearded man George Frederic Watts was born in 1817, the son of a London musical instrument manufacturer. His two brothers died in 1823, and his mother in 1826, giving Watts an obsession with death throughout his life. Meanwhile, his father's strict evangelical Christianity led to Watts developing a deep knowledge of the Bible but a strong dislike of organised religion. Watts was apprenticed as a sculptor at the age of 10, and at the age of 16 was proficient enough as an artist to be earning a living as a portrait painter and as a cricket illustrator. At the age of 18 he gained admission to the Royal Academy schools, although he disliked their methods and his attendance was intermittent. In 1837 Watts was commissioned by Greek shipping magnate Alexander Constantine Ionides to copy a portrait of his father by renowned artist Samuel Lane; Ionides preferred Watts's version to the original and immediately commissioned two more paintings from him, allowing Watts to devote himself full-time to painting. In 1843 Watts travelled to Italy, where he remained for four years. On his return to London he suffered from depression, and painted a number of notably gloomy works. His skills were widely celebrated, and in 1856 he decided to devote himself to portrait painting. His portraits were extremely highly regarded. In 1867 he was elected a Royal Academician, at the time the highest honour available to an artist, although he rapidly became disillusioned with the culture of the Royal Academy. From 1870 onwards he became widely renowned as a painter of allegorical and mythical subjects; by this time, he was one of the most highly regarded artists in the world. In 1881 he added a glass-roofed gallery to his home at Little Holland House, which was open to the public at weekends, further increasing his fame. In 1884 a selection of 50 of his works were shown at New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art, believed to have been the first such exhibition by any artist. Subject alt=topless bare-breasted woman holding jewels Mammon originally meant wealth in Aramaic, but from the early days of the Christian Church the name was occasionally used to represent the personification of greed. This notion of Mammon as an individual, rather than an abstract concept, became commonplace in English culture owing to Edmund Spenser's The Faerie Queene, published in the late 16th century, and later in John Milton's Paradise Lost (1667), both of which treated Mammon as an individual exemplar of greed. As was the case with almost all English artists of the period, Watts was heavily influenced by the works of both Spenser and Milton. Watts based Mammon on a scene from Book II of The Faerie Queene in which the protagonist Guyon encounters Mammon in a cave containing .The Faerie Queene, Edmund Spenser, Book II, Verse 32 Mammon was one of a series Watts painted at around this time on the theme of the corruption brought about by wealth, including The Wife of Plutus (1880s), Sic Transit (1880‚Äì1882) and For he had Great Possessions (1894). Composition Watts depicted Mammon as a corrupted version of traditional images of the gods. This reflected his belief that the worship of wealth was taking the place of traditional beliefs in modern society, and that this attitude, which he described as \\"the hypocritical veiling of the daily sacrifice made to this deity\\", was leading to social decay. (His widow, Mary Seton Watts, wrote in 1912 that Watts had said that \\"Mammon sits supreme, while great art, as a child of the nation, cannot find a place; the seat is not wide enough for both\\".) Mammon wears gold and scarlet robes, and crushes \\"whatever is weak and gentle and timid and lovely\\". Watts aimed to show Mammon not as crushing the weak through deliberate cruelty, but through an indifference to the damage he was causing. His headdress resembles donkey's ears, an allusion to Thomas Carlyle's description of \\"serious, most earnest Mammonism grown Midas-eared\\" in Past and Present. Reception and legacy alt=blind girl sitting on an orange ball Mammon was first exhibited in 1885, under the title of Mammon Dedicated to his Worshippers. The catalogue accompanying this exhibition described this unusual title as \\"righteously scornful\\". Aside from an oil sketch now in the Watts Gallery, only one completed version of Mammon was made. This was among a number of paintings donated by Watts to the South Kensington Museum (now the Victoria and Albert Museum) in late 1886. In 1897 it was one of the 17 Watts works transferred to the newly-created Tate Gallery (commonly known as the Tate Gallery, now Tate Britain); at the time, Watts was so highly regarded that an entire room of the new museum was dedicated to his works. alt=horseman brandishing a bow rides behind three crouched figures Although rarely exhibited outside the Tate Gallery, cheap photographic reproductions of Mammon made by Frederick Hollyer circulated widely, making it one of Watts's better- known paintings. In 1887 it was one of the paintings discussed by Scottish theologian P. T. Forsyth in his series of lectures on \\"Religion in Recent Art\\". Forsyth considered Mammon a companion to Watts's 1885 Hope, arguing that both depicted false gods and the perils awaiting those who attempted to follow them in the absence of faith. By 1904 the image was well-enough known that the Daily Express reproduced the head of Mammon alongside that of John D. Rockefeller, a person of whom the newspaper greatly disapproved, implicitly inviting readers to draw comparisons. Watts returned to the theme of greed in Progress (1902‚Äì1904), one of his final works. This shows the figure of Mammon as one of three figures representing what Watts called \\"non-progress\\"; academia, wealth and laziness, oblivious to the emergence of Progress on horseback behind them. The central figure was described by Watts as \\"money grubbing\\"; as with Mammon and many of his other works, Watts aimed to show spiritual and material values as inherently contradictory.

The highway now has an intersection with Ruby Line before entering the St. John's city limits and coming to an end shortly thereafter at an interchange with Route 2 (Pitts Memorial Drive), with the road continuing north as Commonwealth Avenue into downtown Mount Pearl. For the majority of its length, Route 3 has a small gravel frontage road running along its southbound side. Future Route 3's northern terminus at Route 2 is also proposed to be the eventual southern terminus of Route 3's \\"alternate route\\", Route 3A (Team Gushue Highway). While currently unknown, it is speculated that once that connection is made, the entire route of the completed Route 3A will be completely renumbered as part of Route 3.

A contemporary description placed him among the \\"wisest and best merchants in London\\", and he was particularly known for his efforts to set the Protestant colony of Emden on a secure trade footing. His charitable works included the establishment of a free grammar school at his birthplace of Bunbury in Cheshire. Early life Aldersey was born in Bunbury, Cheshire. His father, John Aldersey (c. 1494‚Äì1554) of Aldersey Hall, was a landowner from Spurstow. His mother, Anne (or Agnes), was the daughter of Thomas Bird of Clutton or Colton. Several members of the Aldersey family were prominent in 16th-century Chester.Beck 1969, pp. 14‚Äì16Lake 1983, p. 147 Thomas Aldersey was the second of several sons of the marriage. He was educated in Bunbury, possibly at the Chantry House. London merchant and politician Aldersey was apprenticed to the London merchant Thomas Bingham in 1541, becoming a liveried member of the Worshipful Company of Haberdashers on 13 July 1548. Exposure to Protestant Reformist speakers in London, including Christopher Goodman and Jan ≈Åaski, led him to become a Protestant. Mary I's accession in 1553 made his religious and political convictions dangerous, and in 1555 he was charged over his attention to Goodman's writings. His efforts, which continued throughout his life, to aid the Protestant exiles who left England for Emden in Germany in establishing trading relationships gained him the support of William Cecil and other prominent Protestants. Cecil's support and his wife's family's influence ‚Äì he married into the Calthorpes in 1554 ‚Äì helped Aldersey to gain stature among London traders during Elizabeth I's reign. He was active in the cloth trade with Germany, the Low Countries, Spain and the Baltic states, and was a prominent member of the Company of Haberdashers, the Company of Merchant Adventurers, the Spanish Company and the Eastland Company.Rapple 2009, p. 63 He became known for his devoutness, honesty and business acumen, and was described by his peers as among the \\"wisest and best merchants in London\\". His popularity did not, however, extend to Chester, where he tried unsuccessfully to obtain the position of waiter at the waterside in 1595. From the early 1570s, Aldersey held several political positions in London, including common councillor for his home parish of Cripplegate (from 1571), city auditor (1571‚Äì72) and serjeant to the Sheriff of the City (1576). He was elected as one of the four London MPs at a by-election on 7 October 1579, following the death of John Marsh; he was re-elected three times, continuing to serve until 1592.Richardson 1972, pp. 128‚Äì29 He is not recorded as having made any speeches, but sat on multiple Parliamentary committees mainly relating to trade. The Privy Council employed him in 1574 to investigate claims against Spain, and he also investigated various trade-related matters for the Privy Council and the Admiralty, including smuggling, piracy, inflation and the gold trade. Personal life and charitable works St Boniface's Church, Bunbury, where he had endowed a preacher and curate Aldersey had a house in Cripplegate. In 1554, he married Alice Calthorpe (or Calthrop) (1526 to 1589‚Äì95), daughter of Richard Calthorpe of Antingham, Norfolk. The Calthorpes were an influential family in London; his brother-in-law Martin Calthorpe served as Lord Mayor of London in 1589. The couple did not have children. After his elder brother John's death in 1582, Aldersey assisted two of his sons. He remained a deeply religious man, with his views in later life also being described as Puritan. He was active in charitable works in both London and Cheshire. In London, he was a governor of Bridewell Hospital (1574‚Äì79), St Thomas' Hospital (1581‚Äì84) and Christ's Hospital (1585‚Äì96).Manzione 1995, pp. 136‚Äì37, 158 He was also active in the 1570s in collecting funds to support impoverished students at the universities of Oxford and Cambridge.Rapple 2009, p. 79 In Cheshire, he supported a project to build a conduit in Chester in 1582. He helped to organise relief efforts after the 1583 fire in Nantwich, serving with Thomas Brassey as London representative of the rebuilding fund, and collecting over ¬£2,700.Beck 1969, pp. 34‚Äì35, 75 In his birthplace, Bunbury, he founded a grammar school in 1575, which was incorporated on 2 January 1594 as \\"The Free Grammar School of Thomas Aldersey in Bunbury\\" ‚Äì now Bunbury Aldersey School. He gave the school, together with substantial endowments, over to the Company of Haberdashers on 21 October 1594.Beck 1969, pp. 22, 33, 105 It was the first school that the Company ‚Äì now predominantly an educational charity ‚Äì administered. At the same time, he established a preacher and curate in Bunbury, and gave the tithes and advowson (patronage) of the parish church to the Haberdashers' Company; this was the first ecclesiastical living to come under the Company's control.Ha 2011, p. 139 Dorothy Williams Whitney has suggested that this gift was associated with the later Puritanism of the Company of Haberdashers, and Bunbury became an early centre for Cheshire nonconformism.Beck 1969, p. 22 Aldersey died at Aldersey Hall in Spurstow, Cheshire, in December 1598, and was buried ‚Äì by his request, \\"without any pomp\\" ‚Äì at St Boniface's Church in Bunbury. He was a wealthy man at his death, leaving bequests totalling nearly ¬£2,000 in his will. He left ¬£100 to Christ's Hospital, as well as money to alleviate poverty in London, Putney in Surrey, Barking in Essex, and Bunbury and Chester in Cheshire. Around half of his property was allocated to the ongoing support of his grammar school; the remainder went to his nephew, John Aldersey of Berden, Essex (died 1616).

This technique is being investigated as a therapeutic to aid after damage has occurred to the heart, such as after a heart attack. The theory behind this approach is that by simultaneously limiting the oxygen demand and maximizing oxygen delivery to the heart after damage has occurred, the heart is more fully able to recover. This is primarily achieved by using temporary minimally invasive mechanical circulatory support to supplant the pumping of blood by the heart. Using mechanical support decreases the workload of the heart, or unloads it. Cardiac traumas such as myocardial infarction (commonly called a heart attack), myocarditis, peripartum cardiomyopathy, cardiogenic shock , and takotsubo cardiomyopathy result in an impaired ability of the heart to pump blood. Without proper blood flow the person will ultimately die. Maintaining sufficient cardiac output is the primary objective of therapeutic approaches treating these cardiac conditions. However, many therapies aimed at increasing cardiac output place further stress on the heart. In this way a well-document vicious cycle begins in which increased cardiac output is required, but in order to achieve this the heart must work harder. This exacerbated stress leads to poorer outcomes.Minicucci MF, Azevedo PS, Polegato BF, Paiva SA, Zornoff LA. Heart failure after myocardial infarction: clinical implications and treatment. Clinical Cardiology. 2011;34(7):410-414. With the exception of cardiopulmonary bypass, current therapeutic approaches do not allow the heart to rest and recover. The workload of the heart (pumping blood) is never uncoupled from heart function. Acute cardiac unloading is able to functionally uncoupleD. S. Burkhoff, G.; Doshi, D., Uriel, N., Hemodynamics of Mechanical Circulatory Support. Journal of the American College of Cardiology 66, 2663-2674 (2015). the heart from cardiac output, allowing the heart to rest and recover from damage.  Power expenditure  ESPVR and EDPVR are dynamic properties of the myocardium.The pumping of blood is considered the workload of the heart and requires power expenditure. Acute cardiac unloading is any maneuver, therapy, or intervention that decreases the power expenditure of the ventricle while maintaining cardiac output. Oxygen consumption (MVO2) is a direct measure of the total energy requirements of the heart, including the energy needed to pump blood.Suga, H. Total mechanical energy of a ventricle model and cardiac oxygen consumption. The American Journal of Physiology 236, H498-505 An increase in MVO2 compared to resting conditions is indicative that the heart is working harder and is under stress. Conversely, a decrease in MVO2 indicates that the heart is under a lesser amount of stress, and less energy is required to maintain proper blood flow. A decreased power expenditure directly correlates with a diminished MVO2. = MVO2 = The pressure-volume area (PVA) is the total mechanical energy generated by ventricular contraction. Pressure-volume (PV) loop analysis provides a framework for understanding how acute cardiac unloading reduces MVO2 in the heart.Burkhoff D., Dickstein M.

The PV loop characterizes the events occurring during a single cardiac cycle (a single heartbeat). The total area bound by the PV loop is the mechanical energy (pressure-volume work) used to actively pump blood every beat, measured in mmHg¬∑mL (aka, a joule ). This is known as the stroke work (SW). The remaining area bound by the ESPVR and EDPVR that is outside of the loop is the potential energy (PE) that resides in the myofilaments that was not transduced into the work of pumping blood. The sum of these two areas (PE + SW) is known as the pressure-volume area (PVA). PVA is a first order approximation of MVO2. Acute cardiac unloading decreases the workload of and the oxygen demand of the heart. This can be visualized as an overall decrease in the PVA of the PV loop. Mechanical unloading of the heart by a percutaneous ventricular support device such as the Impella device can achieve this in two ways. First, the device is a continuous flow device. It directly aspirates blood from the ventricle into the aorta. This decreases the preload and results in a left- shift and loss of the normal isovolumic contraction line. Under conditions of mechanical support, mean aortic pressure (MAP) is maintained independent of native ventricular function, and ventricular and aortic pressures become uncoupled.  Myocardial infarction  421x421px When the heart is damaged by a myocardial infarction a portion of muscle is permanently lost. The heart has a limited innate ability to replace dead muscle with new, functional muscle.Murry, C. E. & Lee, R. T. Development biology. Turnover after the fallout. Science 324, 47-48, (2009). The dead heart muscle is replaced by non- contractile fibrotic tissue, forming the myocardial scar. Scar tissue does not contract, and it does not help the heart pump blood. This persistently stresses the heart and increases the workload of the lasting myocardium as measured by MVO2. Clinical research indicates that as the size of the myocardial scar increases, so does the likelihood of the patient to develop heart failure.Stone, G. W. et al. Relationship Between Infarct Size and Outcomes Following Primary PCI: Patient-Level Analysis From 10 Randomized Trials. Journal of the American College of Cardiology 67, 1674-1683, (2016). Acute cardiac unloading decreases cardiac MVO2 and has been demonstrated to limit the amount of scar tissue that forms, thus preserving heart function after a heart attack.Kapur, N. K. et al. Mechanically unloading the left ventricle before coronary reperfusion reduces left ventricular wall stress and myocardial infarct size. Circulation 128, 328-336, Sun, X. et al.

Location The church is located at the junction of Colville Street and Kimathi Avenue, on Nakasero Hill, in the Central Division of Kampala. The church property is bounded by Portal Avenue to the south. The coordinates of the church are 0¬∞18'52.0\\"N, 32¬∞35'04.0\\"E (Latitude:0.314444; Longitude:32.584444). Overview The church serves Christ The King Catholic Parish, which covers Nakasero, Kololo, and Old Kampala. Many worshippers, however, come from other parts of the city and surrounding neighborhoods to pray at this location. As of September 2016, the seating capacity inside the church was about 600. Because of the size of the congregation, there is insufficient space inside the church to accommodate all the worshippers. During mass and other large events, tents are erected outside the church where worshippers follow the proceedings on loud speakers. History The church was built in 1930 by the immigrant Goan community who had come to Uganda to construct the Uganda Railway. In 1972, following the expulsion of Ugandan Asians by dictator Idi Amin, the church underwent a modest expansion to its present dimensions. Expansion In 1992, plans were initiated to enlarge the church to accommodate more worshippers. The parish began putting aside some funds to cover the expansion costs that year. In 2013, the Kampala Capital City Authority (KCCA) rejected the expansion plans submitted that year because the plans lacked parking space. Beginning in November 2016, the church will begin a multi-phased expansion and renovation that will last until 2018. The seating capacity will be increased from the current 600 to 1,500. The architectural plans were drawn by Ssentoogo & Partners Architects. The construction contract was awarded to Seyani Brothers, a Ugandan construction company. The budgeted construction costs are UGX:8.8 billion. As at October 2016, about 78 percent of the needed funds (approx. UGX 6.864 billion), had been collected, leaving a balance of about UGX 1.936 billion. The renovations are expected to conclude in April 2018.

Ramesh. The film features Nandha, Richard Rishi, and Ilavarasu in the lead roles, while Sharika, Arthi, and Baby Rethva Isvar play pivotal supporting roles. Featuring music composed by Umar Ezhilan, production for the film began in mid-2016. The narrative revolves around a police officer who sets out to help an unemployed man whose money needed for his daughter's operation gets stolen. The film was released theatrically on 30 September 2016 and received negative reviews from critics who praised the performances but criticized the writing. Plot Mahendran is an unemployed man whose daughter meets with an accident while being dropped to school. He admits her to Kaveri Hospital where he and his wife are told their daughter can be saved but they need to deposit 20 lakh rupees. He is told to register an FIR at the nearby police station, which he does with the help of a cop named Pazhani. A desperate Mahendran, along with his wife's jewels, reaches at the jewelry shop of Surendra Lal Seth, who gives him the said amount in exchange for the jewels. Mahendran promises to repay when he gets his job, and boards an auto rickshaw. Seth, however, orders his boys to collect the amount. They intentionally crash their bikes with the auto rickshaw, and while they fight, the bag full of money is taken away. The auto driver refuses to charge Mahendran anything and flees away. Mahendran rushes back to the police station and meets Thamizh, an honest cop, who decides to help him. Thamizh, Pazhani and Mahendran manage to locate the auto rickshaw and its driver, Kannan, who is beaten up and spills out the truth. Seth is also beaten up and he ends up revealing that while he conspired to get back the money, the boys who extracted it didn't return it to him. He also reveals about a dancer in Nellore whom the boys often met from time to time. With the help of Pazhani and a friendly cop in Nellore, Thamizh traces the dancer and questions her, but doesn't find anything significant. Returning to Chennai, Thamizh asks his friends to arrange for money upon learning from Mahendran that the operation needs to be commenced soon. When he doesn't succeed in getting any money, his wife gives him their dead daughter's jewels and tells him to sell them. Thamizh hands over the jewels to Pazhani, who approaches Ezhumalai, a criminal, for money. Seeing Ezhumalai play with his daughter, Pazhani convinces him to save the life of the girl admitted in the hospital. The next day, he sends Thamizh a bag full of money under Pazhani's name, following which Thamizh is arrested by the Anti-Corruption Bureau for publicly accepting bribe. In prison, Pazhani apologizes to Thamizh and asks him about the enmity Ezhumalai has with him. He reveals that while he was in Madurai with his wife and daughter, he tried to help a woman being harassed for her property by Ezhumalai. However, he met various alibis whenever he tried to arrest him. When he was finally about to arrest him, he was handed over his transfer orders. In the meanwhile, Thamizh's daughter met with an accident at home, and when admitted to hospital, she couldn't survive. Thamizh learnt it through the nurses that the medicines were expired, and Ezhumalai's pharma agencies were responsible for more similar deaths. Following this, Thamizh decided to come to Chennai on request transfer. He is then freed due to his reputation in the department. Thamizh sets up a plan to lure Seth into giving an officer 5 lakh rupees, following which Seth's boys crash their vehicles into the auto rickshaw and engage in fighting, but while trying to steal the bag, they are stopped by Thamizh, taken to a secret location and beaten up badly by an enraged Mahendran. The boys reveal everything about Ezhumalai's chain snatching and child kidnapping business, following which Thamizh conspires to kidnap Ezhumalai's daughter. He also joins hands with doctors at Kaveri Hospital. After a chase, he manages to get hold of Ravi, Ezhumalai's friend, and tells him to lure him into come to a spot, leaving behind his daughter. While going to school, Ezhumalai's daughter and wife are chased by bikers who end up in a crash, leaving the daughter injured. A worried Ezhumalai arrives at Kaveri Hospital and deposits the amount needed for the operation, which is used by the doctors to operate on Mahendran's daughter. She is saved, and in his next move, Thamizh tells the doctors to declare Ezhumalai's daughter dead. Upon hearing of her death, Ezhumalai and his wife break down, while his men start destroying the hospital. The doctor is almost attacked but Thamizh brings out Ezhumalai's daughter, reveals how he faked the accident, verbally confronts and gets him arrested.

She has also been a critic, serving as a frequent contributor to The New York Times Book Review; a co- author and ghostwriter, having collaborated on three books by Tim Gunn; and a freelance essayist and reporter. A Village Voice profile in 2015 said: \\"Her CV can seem as though it were cobbled together from the r√©sum√©s of three ambitious journalists.\\" Early life Calhoun grew up on St. Marks Place in East Village, Manhattan. She is the only child of art critic Peter Schjeldahl and actress Brooke Alderson. They appear as characters in her book St. Marks Is Dead, which she dedicates to them. She has written in The New York Times Magazine about a childhood fascination with the suburbs. As a teenager, she traveled through India and met Mother Teresa. She changed her name in 1998 to avoid comparison to her father. Writing As a reporter, she has written about imprisoned women in Alabama, the rap star Bobby Shmurda, and the rise of DIY abortions. She has also written personal essays, including three for The New York Times \\"Modern Love\\" column, and four for The New York Times Magazine's \\"Lives\\" column. The New York Times named her essay \\"The Wedding Toast I‚Äôll Never Give\\" its 41st most read story of 2015. In fall 2016, W.W. Norton announced that it would publish a collection of related essays in spring 2017, called Wedding Toasts I‚Äôll Never Give. In October 2017, Oprah.com published her article \\"The New Midlife Crisis.\\" Chartbeat named the article the internet's 55th-most-read story of 2017. =St. Marks Is Dead= Her book St. Marks Is Dead was published by W.W. Norton & Company in 2015. She wrote an op-ed that fall that explained her anti-nostalgic feelings about cities and change: St. Marks Is Dead was a New York Times Editors‚Äô Pick, Amazon Book of the Month, and named one of the best books of the year by Kirkus Reviews, The Boston Globe, Orlando Weekly, the New York Post. The Village Voice called it, \\"The Best Nonfiction Book About New York, 2015,\\" and said, \\"With St. Marks Is Dead, Ada Calhoun just became the most important new voice on old New York.\\" The Atlantic wrote: \\"Timely, provocative, and stylishly written ‚Ä¶Calhoun‚Äôs book serves as a welcome corrective to that rallying cry [that gentrification is bad], and to the tendency to romanticize New York City in the 1970s, when the city was far more riotous and permissive than it is now. ‚Ä¶ Her aplomb, in fact, is precisely what the discussion needs. Her portrait of neighborhood resilience might suggest more temperate proposals for an increasingly polarized debate.\\" The New York Times Book Review said, \\"Calhoun, who grew up on St. Mark‚Äôs Place, is careful not to romanticize any one era of the East Village (which serves as a suitable proxy for much of New York City during the past century). St. Marks Is Dead is an ecstatic roll call.\\" =Weddings Toasts I'll Never Give= Wedding Toasts I‚Äôll Never Give is a memoir by Calhoun about marriage. It was inspired by the success of her \\"Modern Love\\" column in The New York Times, \\"The Wedding Toast I‚Äôll Never Give,\\" which the paper named one of its most-read stories of 2015. The book was released on May 16, 2017 by W. W. Norton & Company. In the book, Calhoun presents seven personal essays, framed as \\"toasts\\", that discuss topics such as infidelity, existential anxiety, fighting in rental cars, and the \\"soul mates\\" ideal. Wedding Toasts I‚Äôll Never Give was praised in pre-publication reviews. Publishers Weekly calls it \\"A humorous, realistic, and loving look at marriage....Each essay mixes components of memoir and self-help, drawing on insight from Calhoun‚Äôs own marriage as well as the wise thoughts of clergymen and lessons learned from long-married couples.\\" Library Journal said \\"Alternating between hilarious personal anecdote and sobering professional insight, this memoir conveys perhaps the simplest lesson ever given about learning to make a marriage last: just don‚Äôt get divorced. Her other great contribution to the literature on marital happiness might be her explanation of why fights in cars are the worst: you cannot storm off.\\" The book received blurbs from Molly Ringwald, Susannah Cahalan, Karen Abbott, Phillip Lopate, Carlene Bauer, Davy Rothbart, Leah Carroll, Kathryn Hahn, Gretchen Rubin, Emma Straub, and Rebecca Traister. Reviews in the New York Times Book Review, The Washington Post, and elsewhere, were overall positive.

(no official census has been made in Lebanon since 1932). The majority of these consists of the Maronite Church based in Beirut, an Eastern Catholic church in full communion with the Pope and the rest of the Catholic Church. The Catholic Church in the Middle East is under the spiritual leadership of the Pope in Rome. The Catholic Church is said to have traditionally originated in the Middle East in the 1st century AD, and was one of the major religions of the region from the 4th-century Byzantine reforms until the centuries following the Arab Islamic conquests of the 7th century AD. Ever since, its proportion has decreased until today's diaspora tendency, mainly due to persecution by Islamic majority societies. In most Islamic countries, the Catholic Church is severely restricted or outlawed. Significant exceptions include Israel and Lebanon. The largest group remaining in the Middle East is the Maronite Church based in Beirut, Lebanon, an Eastern Catholic church in full communion with the Pope and the rest of the Catholic Church. For specific nations (including Eastern Catholic churches), see: * Catholic Church in Armenia  Armenian Catholic Church * Catholic Church in Azerbaijan * Catholic Church in Israel * Catholic Church in Iran * Catholic Church in Iraq  Chaldean Catholic Church * Catholic Church in Egypt  Coptic Catholic Church * Catholic Church in Kuwait * Catholic Church in Lebanon  Maronite Church * Catholic Church in Oman * Catholic Church in the Palestinian territories * Catholic Church in the United Arab Emirates * Catholic Church in Saudi Arabia * Catholic Church in Syria  Syriac Catholic Church  Melkite Catholic Church * Catholic Church in Turkey  Greek Byzantine Catholic Church * Catholic Church in Yemen In addition, the Latin Church in the Middle East comprise Latin Catholics, called Latins during the Middle Ages, subject to the Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem. Overview Christianity in the Middle East is characterized by its diverse beliefs and traditions, compared to Christianity in other parts of the Old World. In 2010, Christians were estimated to make up 5% of the total Middle Eastern population, down from 20% in the early 20th century. This was before the devastating civil wars in Syria and Iraq. Proportionally, Lebanon has the highest rate of Christians in the Middle East, where the percentage ranges between 39% and 40.5%, followed directly by Egypt where most likely Christians (especially ethnic Copts) account for about 10 percent, while in total the largest absolute figures. The majority of the Lebanese Christians consists of the Maronite Church based in Beirut, an Eastern Catholic church in full communion with the Pope and the rest of the Catholic Church. Demographics The second largest Christian group in the Middle East are the Arabic-speaking Maronites who are Catholics and number some 1.1‚Äì1.2 million across the Middle East, mainly concentrated within Lebanon. Many Maronites often avoid an Arabic ethnic identity in favour of a pre-Arab Phoenician or Canaanite heritage, to which most of the Lebanese population belongs. In Israel, Maronites are classified as ethnic Arameans and not Lebanese (together with smaller Aramaic- speaking Christian populations of Syriac Orthodox and Greek Catholics). The Arab Christians, who are mostly descended from Arab Christian tribes, are significantly adherents of the Eastern Orthodox Church. They number more than 1.5 million. Catholics of the Latin Church are small in numbers. Most Catholics are Maronites, Melkites, Catholic Syrians, Armenians and Chaldeans (from Iraq).Protestants altogether number about 400,000. Arabized Melkite Catholics of the Byzantine Rite, who are usually referred to as Arab Christians, number over 1 million in the Middle East. They came into existence as a result of a schism within the Greek Orthodox Church of Antioch over the election of a Patriarch in 1724. The Eastern Aramaic speaking Assyrians of Iraq, southeastern Turkey, northwestern Iran and northeastern Syria, who number 2‚Äì3 million, have suffered both ethnic and religious persecution over the last few centuries such as the Assyrian Genocide conducted by the Ottoman Turks, leading to many fleeing and congregating in areas in the north of Iraq and the northeast of Syria, followed by the Genocide of the Islamic State in the 21st century. The great majority are Catholic Chaldeans. In Iraq, the number of Assyrians has declined to between 250,000 and 300,000 (from 0.8‚Äì1.4 million before the US invasion in 2003). Christians numbered between 800,000 and 1.2 million before 2003. During 2014, the Assyrian population of North Iraq collapsed due to the Muslim Jihadist persecution. A 2015 study estimates 483,500 Christian believers from a Muslim background in the Middle East, most of them belonging to some form of Protestantism. Decline The number of Middle Eastern Christians is dropping due to such factors as low birth rates compared with Muslims, disproportionately high emigration rates, and ethnic and religious persecution. In addition, political turmoil has been and continues to be a major contributor pressing indigenous Middle Eastern Christians of various ethnicities towards seeking security and stability outside their homelands. Recent spread of Jihadist and Salafist ideology, foreign to the tolerant values of the local communities in Syria and Egypt has also played a role in unsettling Christians' decades-long peaceful existence. In 2011, it was estimated that at the present rate, the Middle East's 12 million Christians would likely drop to 6 million by the year 2020.

Born in Greenwich, London in 1909 Thompson served in the army for 30 years before becoming the defence correspondent of the Daily Telegraph. Early life Thompson was educated at Cheltenham College and then attended the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich before being commissioned into the Royal Artillery in 1929. Promoted to Lieutenant in 1932, Thompson was posted to India where he served in a mountain artillery battery. It was in India that Thompson developed a love of climbing and also acquired his nickname of Sheriff. Returning to England Thompson was seconded to the Royal Artillery Training Battalion at the Military College of Science and later appointed adjutant at the College with the rank of Captain. Second World War In 1940 Thompson was awarded the MBE \\"in recognition of distinguished services rendered in recent operations\\" and after various staff appointments by early 1943 he was a temporary Major and second-in-command of 1st Airlanding Light Regiment. In May 1943 the regiment moved to Algeria but did not participate in the Allied invasion of Sicily unlike the infantry components of 1st Airlanding Brigade. During operations in Sicily the divisional artillery commander was killed and the commanding officer of the 1st Airlanding Light Regiment was appointed to the role. As a result, Thompson was promoted to acting (subsequently temporary) Lieutenant colonel and given command of the regiment. Thompson and the regiment landed in Italy in September 1943 and took part in operations in Italy throughout the remainder of 1943 and into January 1944 when the regiment was withdrawn to England. =Arnhem= Thompson (left) and members of his HQ loading a jeep after landing by glider at Arnhem The regiment spent the spring and summer of 1944 training in readiness for the invasion of Europe. In September the regiment took part in Operation Market. Taking off from RAF Fairford on 17 September Thompson, most of his headquarters staff and two of the regiment's three batteries and his men landed by glider at west of Oosterbeek, Arnhem. Shortly after the landing Thompson is recorded as \\"C.O. \\"kicking\\" because there were no targets to fire on, he said we might just as well have come on the next day.\\" The following day with the arrival of the remaining battery the regiment moved to positions around Oosterbeck church to support the attempt by 1st Parachute Brigade to break through to Arnhem bridge. The attack by 1st Parachute Brigade failed and troops from the four infantry battalions started falling back towards Thompson's position. Thompson left his headquarters and went forward to try and get the retreating troops into defensive positions. Thompson organised about 400 men into positions along the road to protect the artillery positions and to block and German advance down the road, placing these men under the command of the most senior officer he could find, Major Robert Cain of the South Staffordshire Regiment, Thompson returned to his headquarters to report to his commanding officer, Brigadier Philip Hicks. Hicks sent Major Richard Lonsdale of 11th Battalion, Parachute Regiment to assist Thompson. Thompson placed Londsale in command of the Parachute Regiment battalions while he took command of the South Staffordshire men in addition to his own regiment and the men of the Glider Pilot Regiment. The whole force was designated \\"Thompson Force\\" by 1st Airborne Divisional Headquarters. Thompson remained in command of this mixed force until 21 September when he was wounded and command of the force passed to Lonsdale. Due to the severity of his wounds Thompson was not able to be evacuated and with the defeat of the airborne forces he was taken prisoner by the Germans and spent the rest of the war in Spangenberg Castle Oflag IX-A/H. For his actions at Arnhem Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands awarded Thompson the Bronze Cross. The citation ran: Post Second World War On his release from captivity Thompson held various staff appointments before commanding 61st Light Field Regiment during the latter stages of the Korean War and was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the 1954 Birthday Honours. Thompson was promoted to Brigadier at the end of 1958 and ended his army career as deputy director of staff duties at the War Office retiring in 1959. Journalism career After leaving the army Thompson became defence correspondent of the Daily Telegraph, a post he held until 1976. During his period as a journalist he reported from the front line of several wars including the Vietnam War, the Yom Kippur War and the Sino- Indian War of 1962. Between 1970 and 1978 Thompson was Honorary Colonel of 289 Parachute Troop, Royal Artillery.

It was built by the merchant Just Fabritius and is now owned by the businessman Fritz Schur. History =Early history= Vitus Bering The Klampenborg area was in 1666 granted to Historiographer Royal Vitus Bering for life by Christian V. He constructed the a modest country house at the site and gave it the name Christians Holm in 1670. It has been described as the earliest country house in Denmark. The estate returned to the crown when Bering died in 1675. =The new house= Christiansholm in c. 1830 In 1746, Christiansholm was acquired by the merchant Just Fabritius. He constructed a new house on the land. It is believed that the architect was Johan Christian Conradi, who also worked on Fabritius' townhouse on the street Pustervig in Copenhagen. Fabritius owned Christiansholm until 1763. Christopher MacEvoy Sr., a wealthy planter and merchant from St. Croix in the Danish West Indies, purchased Christiansholm in c. 1888. In 1783, he sold Christiansholm to Ernst Heinrich von Schimmelmann. Schimmelmann allowed Adam Oehlenschl√§ger to use it as a summer retreat from about 1810. In 1863, the estate was acquired by count Christian Danneskiold- Sams√∏e. He was appointed to administrative leader of the Royal Danish Theatre and acquired Nordfeld on the island of M√∏n in 1894. The English Terraces viewed from the air in the 1930s In 1900, Christiansholm was purchased by count Gustav Adolph Clauson-Kaas and baron Lerche through the company A/S Christiansholm. In 1901-03, they redeveloped most of the estate with the assistance of architect Tasmus Jensen. The development was, deceptively, marketed as Christiansholms Engelske Villakvarter (\\"Christiansholm's English Villa Quarter\\"), although the inspiration was in fact English terraced housing. The original plans comprised nine closed blocks but only two were built. The buildings are the earliest example of terraced housing in Gentofte Municipalit. The main building was sold to count Carl Moltke in 1914. A marshy area portion of the remaining land was acquired by Gentofte Municipality in 1920 and converted into a public parkland in 1929. The house was put through a major restoration in 1988-1990 undertaken by the architect Ulrich Schirnig from HUS arkitekter. Today The property is today owned by the businessman Fritz Schur. Schur has stated that he intends to turn the house into a retreat for Nordic artists after his death.

The school closed in 1983 but a significant number of its students went on to successful international careers., such as the Burkinabe choreographer, dancer, actor and artist Irene Tassembedo. Mudra Afrique played a crucial role in preparing the basis for contemporary African dance by training the first generation of ‚Äúmodern‚Äù African dancers according to international artistic standards.  History of the School  The name of the school comes from the Sanskrit term ‚Äúmudra‚Äù meaning ‚Äúgesture‚Äù or ‚Äúsign. The school, once located where the Court of Cassation in Dakar is currently housed, was founded in 1977 by Leopolod S√©dar Senghor and Maurice B√©jart and funded by Senegal and Belgium, with support from UNESCO. Germaine Acogny, a Senegalese dancer and choreographer originally from Benin, who is probably the best-known and most influential forerunner of contemporary dance in the West-African region, was appointed director of the school from its opening. Mudra Afrique, with an international student body, emphasized the Senghorian concepts of both enracinement and ouverture, rootedness and openness. The school was based on the premise that dance could be used to connect distinctly different African cultures. Students received training in African, contemporary, and classical dance, as well as in African drumming. They performed in Dakar but also in villages outside the capital. Acogny describes Mudra Afrique as ‚Äúthe sacred grove of modern time‚Äù, a place where Senghor‚Äôs Pan-African ambitions could live on in this space, which provided a platform for dancers from all over the continent and further afield to come to work, meet other artists, and be inspired.  Influence on Other Dance Schools  Many non-Senegalese African dancers, who went on to found their own schools, attended Mudra Afrique, and so its multidisciplinary training greatly influenced dance across West Africa. This includes Germaine Acogny, the former director of Mudra Afrique, who established her own African contemporary dance school, √âcole des Sables, in Senegal in 2004, based on the same Pan-African principles which inspired Mudra Afrique. The school is now a platform for choreographers from all over the world and for African dancers aspiring to an international career. She explains her conception of contemporary African dance saying ‚Äúthe artistic movement into which I insert my own work, even though it is deeply rooted in popular traditions, is not at all a return to roots. On the contrary, we pursue a way that is altogether different and resolutely urban, reflecting the modern context within which so many of us, Africans of our time, must live and move and have our being. The Africa of sky-scrapers, the Africa of international alliances‚Äù. By contrast with Mudra Afrique, however, funding for this school did not come from African states but from French and European agencies, private charities in Europe and North America, and from fee-paying students from outside Africa. Other examples include Ir√®ne Tassembedo from Burkina Faso, who founded her own dance school, √âcole Danse Ir√®ne Tassembedo (EDIT), in 2009 in Ouagadougou and developed an international career popularizing African contemporary dance. Laurent Longafo from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) also introduced Germaine Acogny‚Äôs dance techniques to a wider university student population. Maurice B√©jart established another dance school called √âcole Mudra in Belgium in 1970, which closed in 1988. So the influence of Mudra Afrique extends beyond Senegal.  Critiques of the School  The school served as a showcase for Senegal‚Äôs advanced artistic initiatives, which were elaborated and complicated by the dancers it trained. Since the foundation of Mudra Afrique in 1977, however, France and other European countries have been financing the choreographic arts in Africa via training, workshops, and space, using cultural agencies attached to the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs. This necessitates that performers respond to the artistic demands of these institutions, which raises concerns over creative agency and drives choreographic standardization towards European and away from African. Thus, efforts for self-determination by African performing artists deliberately opposing ongoing French cultural hegemony are coupled with a search for alternative frameworks of artistic development, following a strategy of diversification in a dual sense: broadening the range of potential donors and gaining access to new politico-economic resources by promoting ‚Äúcultural diversity‚Äù. An example of this are both EDIT (√âcole Danse Ir√®ne Tassembedo) and √âcole des Sable, which show the trend of combining profit-making with a ‚Äúcultural exchange‚Äù and a political and social development agenda. The new ‚Äúchoreographic movement‚Äù born out of transnational African collaboration has become more and more male-dominated with regards to international visibility, which is contrasted against the important role played by women such as Germaine Acogny and Ir√®ne Tassembedo, who are considered to be among the avant garde of contemporary dance in Africa. Given the family backgrounds of these dancing pioneers, who were part of the social, political and economic elite during the first decades of national independence and enjoyed state patronage, the current underrepresentation of female choreographers might be explained by the professionalization and opening of the dancing field towards less- privileged social spheres and groups, with the unfortunate effect of decreasing the representation of women.  Legacy  A set of three stamps was issued in 1980 to mark the Mudra Afrique Arts Festival in which musicians, drummers and dancers performed.

She became a nurse and at the outbreak of World War I turned her family estate into a hospital. When the Germans seized her castle, she went to the front to nurse soldiers at the Hospital du Duc de Vendome near Calais and soon was transferred to the √âlisabeth Hospital in Poperinge where she served as hospital director for three and a half years. After establishing the Belgian Civil Help Association, the Countess raised funds, organized and directed the association to support three hospitals, build two orphanages, run schools, provide inoculations and many other public health initiatives. She received many awards and honors, including the Order of the Belgian Crown, the Order of Leopold, the Order of the British Empire and the French Croix de Guerre. Early life Maria-Charlotte Ghislaine de Villegas de Saint-Pierre was born on 14 December 1870 in the Ch√¢teau de Louvignies, near Soignies, in Hainaut Province, Belgium to the Belgian Count L√©on de Villegas de Saint-Pierre and Countess Marie-Ferdinande de Maillin of , in the Wallonian Namur Province. Her father had been a diplomat, but gave up his career to become mayor of Chauss√©e-Notre-Dame-Louvignies. Maria was the second child in the family and had an older brother, Alphonse and two younger siblings, brother Louis and sister Albertine, who were raised in the family castle on the estate. On May 17, 1892, she married her cousin Count L√©opold van de Steen de Jehay, who worked for the royal family as a liaison between the court and foreigners. The couple lived in Brussels within walking distance of the royal palace and spent the summer months at her husband's family castle in Chevetogne in Namur Province. Within a year, she gave birth to their only son, Jean. Career Following in the family tradition, de Villegas de Saint- Pierre became a writer and published works under the pseudonyms \\"Quevedo\\" or \\"Dame Peluche\\". In 1902, she began publishing works and in 1912 published a novel, Profils de gosses which was recognized by the French Academy. She wrote a regular fashion column and covered galas and balls, but also wrote pieces of social commentary which were ahead of their time, including L‚Äôinfluence f√©minine et les colonies (The female influence and the colonies), La ligue nationale pour la protection de l‚Äôenfance noire au Congo belge (The National League for the protection of black children in the Belgian Congo) and L‚Äô√¢ge d‚Äôadmission des enfants au travail (The entrance age of working children), publishing from 1913 in magazines like La Femme belge. She was an associate of the Society of Men of Letters. In 1907, de Villegas de Saint-Pierre became one of the founders of the Saint-Camille Nursing School (), a Catholic training facility, which educated nurses with a religious, rather than secular method. She believed that training was needed, but as a devout Catholic felt that science and religious training could co-exist. She undertook nursing classes herself, and upon hearing rumors of impending war, took steps to have the Belgian Red Cross assist with training at the school. When World War I began, she went to the Ministry of War to complete permits to have her castle at Chevetogne turned into a neutral hospital for troops on both sides of the conflict. The facility served as a temporary emergency station, called an \\"ambulance\\", and required modifications to be suitable, such as remaking the castle living room into an operating theater. At the end of August 1914, the Germans began occupying the castle and though de Villegas de Saint-Pierre and her nurses continued to work, she made plans to work at the front. Closing the hospital, in November, she traveled through the Dutch port of Eijsden, staying with family until she could book passage on the ferry to Calais. She was also able to briefly see her brother, Louis, who having been injured in battle, was serving as a consul in Maastricht. Arriving in Calais, the Countess presented herself to Dr. Antoine Depage, who refused her services for his famed . She then went to the Hospital du Duc de Vendome to offer her services and ended up working in the linen room of the hospital for six weeks. When her family doctor, L√©opold M√©lis, who was also the Chief Inspector of the Health Service for the Belgian army, discovered she was working as a seamstress and not a nurse, he transferred her to Poperinge to help him establish a typhoid hospital there. The √âlisabeth Hospital was established in the Castle d'Hondt with twenty-five English Quaker nurses and some of her nurses from Saint- Camille. Much of her activity as director of the hospital was for fundraising and she used her wide contact with the nobility to garner money to both build and keep the hospital going. Initially, the focus was on the civilian population with a special focus on refugee and orphaned children, but in April 1915, when the Sacre-Coeur Hospital in Ypres was closed, de Villegas de Saint- Pierre gained authorization to treat military personnel at √âlisabeth Hospital. The Countess' vast circle of contacts and organization skills were utilized to found the Belgian Civil Help Association (), under the patronage of Queen Elisabeth. This organization undertook supplying funds and medical necessities for the Sacre-Coeur Hospital in Ypres, √âlisabeth Hospital and the Hospital of the Museum of Hazebrouck. It also provided funds and supplies for aid stations throughout the country, organized typhoid inoculations, distributed milk for children, helped with sanitary inspections and water purification programs, built two orphanages and established nurseries, as well as rescuing the cultural heritage and property of churches, convents and civic buildings. Through the Association, she organized schools in Poperinge in the garden of the castle, since most of the educational facilities had closed and teachers had fled the bombing. Over 300 children attended the daily classes, which were inspected by the Belgian authorities. Continued bombing forced removing the school to the Derycke Farm near Zwijnaarde and then moving an additional 75 children to northern France where they attended a Flemish school in Ca√´stre. In 1916, de Villegas de Saint-Pierre became ill with a severe throat infection. A blood test revealed she had sepsis and then she was overcome by gas. She was invited by Clementine de Chaumont-Quitry, Baroness de La Grange, to convalesce at her castle near Hazebrouck and a visit by Dr. M√©lis, revealed there was a lump in her neck. He performed an immediate surgery, saving de Villegas de Saint-Pierre's life. After her recuperation, the Countess returned to her work at √âlisabeth Hospital, until the war ended in 1918. She moved back to Brussels and retired from most of her hospital work, except serving on the boards of the Nursing Association, the Deux-Alice Clinic in Uccle and the Saint-Camille Nursing School. Her war work was recognized by many honors including recognition as a Commander of the Order of the Crown, a Knight of the Order of Leopold, and as a Commander of the Order of the British Empire, as well as receipt of the French Croix de Guerre with palms and Pro Ecclesia et Pontifice. After her husband's death, de Villegas de Saint-Pierre returned to writing, but using her own name Maria Van den Steen de Jehay. She published several autobiographical works, including Mon journal d‚Äôinfirmi√®re (My Nursing Journal, 1923); Nos souverains √† La Panne (Our rulers in De Panne), which was serialized in the March and April 1939 editions of Revue belge; and wrote two unpublished works L‚ÄôAutre Guerre (The Other War) and British Area. Death and legacy De Villegas de Saint-Pierre died on 23 January 1941 in Brussels and her funeral was held to much fanfare at the Cathedral of St. Michael and St. Gudula. In 2009, a biography, Une ch√¢telaine dans les tranch√©es (A lady in the trenches) using the Countess' notes and papers was published, by her distant cousin, Florence de Moreau de Villegas de Saint-Pierre. In 2014, an exhibition at the Ch√¢teau de Chevetogne, provided artifacts and presentations on the life of the countess and ran for five months.

His father wished to buy the freedom of his mother and son, but was not able. When Edmund was six, his mother was sold away and he and his sister remained. In 1833, Kelly was hired by a school- master to run errands and serve as a table waiter. Kelly saw the advantage of an education, and in secret gave candies to students who came to the house in exchange for a speller, a child's English textbook, and lessons. When the mistress of the house discovered Kelly's learning to write, she was upset, but because those responsible were children, nothing was done and Kelly continued to learn, although he never attended a formal school. He married in September 1839.Eastern Massachusetts, Springfield Republican (Springfield, Massachusetts), September 28, 1889, page 6 Career In April 1837 Kelly was baptized and joined a missionary church in Columbia. He was born to the Catholicism of his father, but was convinced by the Baptist teachings. On May 19, 1842 he was licensed to preach from the Mission Baptist Church at Columbia, and on October 1 of that year he was ordained by Rev. R. B. C. Harell and the First Baptist Church of Nashville to be an evangelist. His first posting was at the Mt. Lebanon Baptist Church in 1843, which at that time had only six members. This posting made him the first black Baptist preacher ordained in Tennessee.Fasol, Al. With a Bible in Their Hands: Baptist Preaching in the South 1679-1979. Baptist Sunday School Board, 1994. p90-91 He is also credited for organizing the First Negro Baptist Church in Columbia in 1843. =Escape to New England= Around this time, he escaped from slavery on the underground railroad to Massachusetts.Hall, Wade. The rest of the dream: The Black odyssey of Lyman Johnson. University Press of Kentucky, 2015. p28 He then purchased the freedom of his wife and four children for twenty-eight hundred dollars. For this purpose, he collected money in New England and in England. While in England, it was recommended to him that he purchase not only his family's freedom, but also his own, so that he would not be captured under the Fugitive Slave Act.Girdwood, J.

Free, Kelly moved to New Bedford, Massachusetts, where he was a prominent leader in the local church and the national American Baptist Conventions.Mulderink, Earl F. New Bedford's Civil War. Fordham Univ Press, 2012. p43-44 In 1845 along with Thomas T. Allen he became leader of the newly founded Second Baptist Church of New Bedford, Massachusetts which was dedicated in January of that year. Allen served as the head pastor for three years, followed by William Jackson and then Cummings Bray. In 1855, Jackson returned to lead the church, and in 1858 left to form the Salem Baptist Church. Kelly again took charge, but only for a short time.History of the Churches of New Bedford, E. Anthony & Sons, Printers, 1869, p68-69 In 1857, Kelly was a preacher in Philadelphia.

User base and adoption  The application has users reporting vehicular infractions in upwards of 30 countries. The top reporting countries are: Portugal, Canada, United States of America and Australia. Users have adopted TowIt for a variety of reasons, usually central to their geographical location and the prominent offences in those specific areas. For instance, the majority of Portuguese reports are cars parked on sidewalks, footpaths and pedestrian crossings, Australian reports are largely focused on the abuse of disabled parking spaces, and in Toronto or San Francisco users generally capture cars parked in bicycle lanes.  Functions  = Data collection = TowIt gathers data on individual parking offences, the prominence of various offence types, as well as recurring offenders. This allows the company to identify trends and hotspots in order to take action against problem vehicles, as well as to help improve urban planning, traffic congestion and gridlock management. Individuals modify or improve an aspect of their behavior in response to their awareness of being observed,Hawthorne effect theoretically more so when demonstrating selfishness, egocentrism, narcissism and anti-social behavior. The company states that by becoming a user, one can \\"help TowIt relieve congestion, reduce collisions, open up economies, improve the environment and enhance the lives of urban residents and suburban commuters alike\\". The company has acknowledged that there are numerous legislative changes that would be required to integrate with governments at any level in many countries. A simple three-step process allows users to take a photo of an offending vehicle and subsequently verifying the offending vehicle's license plate information before submitting by tapping the TowIt (submit) button. Photographical evidence can only be captured with the camera from within the TowIt application. An Internet connection is required. The company has stated that this was purposefully done for quality control and report validation purposes. Users may only submit and view their own report history on either the iOS or Android applications. Globally submitted reports are displayed uncensored and in aggregate only on the Android application and the TowIt website. The \\"Global Feed\\" feature was removed from iOS (see iTunes Connect Acceptance Issues). TowIt's back-end automatically geotags the report and compares it to local parking by-law data, including by-law types, locations, times, side(s) of street, etc.- where available. Valid reports are posted to the global feed, to the TowIt website, and passed on to municipalities and police for enforcement (where connected). = Technologies used under license = TowIt currently utilizes the following software or software libraries under license: AngularJS, Apache Cordova, Apple iTunes Store EULA, Chart.js, Google Play Distribution Agreement, Ionic Framework, MongoDB, Moment.js, Python 2.7, Python Flask, and jQuery.  Company history  The TowIt application was conceived by Michael Duncan McArthur on December 5, 2014 as a response to Toronto Mayor John Tory's election mandate to \\"get this city moving\\". The application was announced via TowIt's official Twitter page on January 6, 2015. After the initial public announcement, Michael & Gregory were contacted by members of John Tory's staff on January 8, 2015 and invited to demo a prototype at Toronto City Hall on January 12, 2015. The two were also invited to meet with Toronto Councillor Norm Kelly, in his City Hall office, for a subsequent demo of the live Android application on January 28, 2015. A similar meeting and demo took place with members of the Traffic Services department of Toronto Police Service on February 2, 2015. Michael & Gregory teamed up with friends and Toronto-based developers Dae-Seon Moon, Jesse Malone, and Marcus Veres to complete the prototype in time to meet the city's imposed demo deadline and to launch the initial Android version of the application. TowIt officially launched on the Android platform on January 16, 2015. A subsequent iOS launch took place on March 19, 2015. = iTunes connect acceptance issues = The iOS version of the application was delayed for approximately two months, only after significant deliberation with Apple's iTunes Connect review board around (as then stated) rule: \\"14.1 - Any App that is defamatory, offensive, mean-spirited, or likely to place the targeted individual or group in harm's way will be rejected.\\" The result was having to remove the \\"Global Feed\\" feature from the iOS platform, in which civilian users could view all recent reports from within the application. This feature still exists on the Android platform. = Business and legal = TowIt engaged Wildeboer Dellelce, one of Canada's leading business law and transactional corporate finance law firms, on January 17, 2015. The company filed for incorporation as \\"TowIt Solutions Inc.\\" by both Michael & Gregory in the Canadian province of Ontario on January 22, 2015. TowIt continues to operate under a Freemium business model. The company is 100% bootstrapped and has received no outside investment to date. TowIt was accepted into the MaRS Discovery District's Venture Services program on March 4, 2015. = Lobbyist registration = After receiving initial press coverage in January and February 2015, an unknown entity reported Michael & Gregory's initial communications with city staff to the City of Toronto's Lobbyist Registrar. This complaint resulted in legal threats of fines received on February 10, 2015 for apparently and unknowingly breaking municipal lobbying by-laws. These fines (of up to $100,000) were eventually withdrawn after Michael & Gregory immediately provided all records of communication with city officials and registered as lobbyists in the City of Toronto on the subjects of By-law / Regulation, Parking, and Technology. Their registration was accepted by the Lobbyist Registrar on March 6, 2015. However, communication with Toronto city staff was reduced greatly as a result, which the company believes may have been the desired intent of the original complaint. = Outreach and activism = TowIt encourages its global user base to reach out to their local government representatives to promote the app at the users' own will. This tactic is used not only to demonstrate grassroots support, but also to avoid future lobbying issues. On June 2, 2015 the company officially partnered with Australian campaign \\"No Permit No Park\\" who advocate for the creation of inclusive communities.

Ray stood next to the Ray River, an ancient boundary between the Cen√©l Luighdech and Cen√©l Duach. Four 7th-century abbots of Iona were of the Cen√©l Duach; Ray was almost certainly their home church. Ray high cross is the largest early medieval stone cross in Ireland. Local lore claims it was made by Columba (521‚Äì597) on Muckish to bring to Tory Island, but local saint Fionn√°n recovered Columba's Gospel Book and he gave the cross to Ray. The cross actually dates to the late 8th century. The church was destroyed by Oliver Cromwell's soldiers in the 17th century. During Sunday Mass, the entire congregation was slaughtered in the Massacre of Ray (Marfach R√°ithe). The dead are buried in a mass grave called Resting Place of the Bones (Lag na gCn√°mh).

It has thin, rough, tessellated bark on some or all of the trunk, smooth bark above, broadly egg-shaped to broadly lance- shaped adult leaves, flower buds usually in groups of seven, creamy white flowers and urn-shaped fruit. Description Corymbia foelscheana is a tree that typically grows to a height to and forms a lignotuber. It has thin, rough, tessellated brown, grey or reddish bark that is shed in small polygonal flakes, on part or all of the trunk, smooth white to cream-coloured bark above. Young plants and coppice regrowth have dull green, broadly egg-shaped to oblong or round leaves that are long and wide with a wavy margin. Adult leaves are arranged alternately, the same shade of dull green on both sides, broadly egg-shaped to broadly lance-shaped, long and wide on a petiole long. The flower buds are mostly arranged on the ends of branchlets on a branched peduncle long, each branch of the peduncle usually with seven buds on pedicels long. Mature buds are oval to pear-shaped, long and wide with a rounded operculum that sometimes has rounded knob in the centre. Flowering occurs from December to January or from January to May and the flowers are creamy white. The fruit is a woody urn-shaped capsule long and wide with the valves enclosed in the fruit. Taxonomy and naming The broad-leaved bloodwood was first formally described in 1882 by Ferdinand von Mueller in The Chemist and Druggist with Australasian Supplement and given the name Eucalyptus foelscheana. The type specimens were collected \\"near Port Darwin\\" by Paul Foelsche. In 1995 Ken Hill and Lawrie Johnson changed the name to Corymbia foelscheana. Distribution and habitat This eucalypt grows on gentle slopes, on low rocky hills in open forest and in low open woodland usually in loamy and laterite soils. It occurs from the Kimberley region of Western Australia and east through the top end of the Northern Territory, including on Melville Island. In a woodland setting associated species include Erythrophleum chlorostachys, Xanthostemon paradoxus, Eucalyptus setosa, Eucalyptus confertiflora and Eucalyptus latifolia in the overstorey and Grevillea decurrens, Gardenia megasperma and Calytrix exstipulata in the sparsely vegetated understorey.

She was the first woman president of the Royal Institution of South Wales (RISW) and a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries. She worked on several notable excavations during the mid-20th century in Wales, London and south-east England, including the Gower Peninsula, Verulamium and the Temple of Mithras in London. Biography Williams was born Audrey Davies in Dinas Powys, Wales. Her family moved to Swansea when she was 14, and she studied at Swansea Girl's High School. In 1920, she won a scholarship to Somerville College, Oxford to study English, the same year that the Statute for Degrees for Women was passed, giving women the right to take degrees. She returned to Swansea after graduation in 1923 and worked as a teacher at a local school. She resigned this post when she married her first husband, Percy James Williams, a local architect. It was through Williams, who had a keen interest in Swansea ceramics, that she became involved with Swansea Museum and the Royal Institute of South Wales in the 1930s. She helped her husband to reorganise and catalogue ceramic collections within the museum. She became the Honorary Curator of Antiquities, and in 1936 compiled an accession register of all the objects, information from which is still used today. It was during this time that she first worked with W. F. Grimes who was assistant keeper of archaeology at the National Museum of Wales. She excavated three Iron Age Promontory Forts on the Gower Peninsula. Between 1941 and 1944 she was appointed Assistant Inspector of Ancient Monuments by the Ministry of Works. She was to excavate archaeological sites before they were developed for defences or military instillations, again working alongside Grimes. As part of her work for the Ministry of Works, she excavated a number of sites in Swansea, Oxfordshire, Dorset and Pembrokeshire and in recognition of her work she was elected as a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries. In July 1944, she was elected President of the Royal Institution of South Wales. In 1945 she left Swansea and was appointed as curator of Verulamium Museum in St Albans. From there she began her excavation career in London and south-east England, working alongside many notable archaeologists of the time including Glyn Daniel, Kathleen Kenyon and Mortimer Wheeler. She was director of excavations for the Canterbury Excavations Committee, which was set up in 1944 to investigate archaeology uncovered during bombing raids, and in advance of redevelopment. Sheppard Frere succeeded her in 1946 as director. They co-wrote several publications about the Roman excavations, and she published two articles in her own name. In London, she once again worked with Grimes, on excavations at sites in the City of London affected by bomb damage, prior to their redevelopment, including Barbican, St Brides and Fleet Street. One of the most prominent excavations she worked on was the Temple of Mithras, which was discovered at a building site at Walbrook in 1954. The unexpected discovery of a bust of Mithras on the last scheduled day of the excavation generated considerable press and public interest, debates in Parliament and discussion in the Cabinet. The excavation was extended, allowing further discoveries to be made, but delaying the construction. Grimes is often solely credited as the director of the excavations, however he was running another site in London at the same time. Williams was on site every day and her work makes up much of the archive; because of her contribution, John Shepherd ensured her name was included in the title in his report of the excavation, The Temple of Mithras, London: Excavations by W. F. Grimes and A. Williams at the Walbrook. Grimes always described her as the better excavator. In 1950 she divorced P J Williams, and she remarried in 1952 to Illtyd Stockwood, which also ended in divorce in 1956. In 1959 she married W. F. Grimes and retired from professional archaeology. The couple returned to Wales in 1973, to Williams' home in Brynmill in Swansea. Williams died in 1978 and her ashes were scattered at Pwlldu Bay on the Gower Peninsula.

The Caterpillars were one of the most successful teams of the Amateur Athletic Union League in the 1950s and they became world-wide known in 1952 when five of their players represented the USA team in the Olympics, winning the gold medal. History =Team creation= The origins of the team go back to the beginning of the 20th century when a few Caterpillar employees formed the company's first team, the Holt- Caterpillar, in 1915. Gradually, basketball became part of the employee activities program and the team would create its basketball section in 1937. The team's would change soon to Caterpillar Diesels. The Caterpillar team won five AAU national championships from 1952 to 1960 and was the first team in the Cold War era (1958) to tour the USSR where they went undefeated. =1945‚Äì1949: Entry in the AAU and NIBL= The Caterpillar's team, funded by nickels and dimes it collected from vending machines inside company break rooms, just began to scratch the surface of its potential in the annual national AAU tournaments from 1945 to 1951 (all hosted at Denver). The Cat Diesels were placed among the top four twice: a third in 1949 and a fourth in 1951. They also joined the newly formed amateur league the National Industrial Basketball League in 1947, finishing second behind the Milwaukee Harnischfegers in their first season. Peoria would turn a corner without knowing it at the end of the 1947‚Äì1948 season with the acquisition of an obscure 29-year-old guard from Southeastern State College in Oklahoma named Warren Womble. =1949‚Äì1952: Warren Womble builds a winning squad= After playing the 1948‚Äì49 season, Womble expressed a desire to Caterpillar executives to move back to Oklahoma to pursue a coaching career. That was when the Cats manager Jim Monroe made easily the best move in Peoria's AAU program, offering Womble the coaching job, replacing the Cats' first coach, Marv Hamilton. Womble assisted Hamilton, who was promoted to a position within the company that didn't allow him to coach anymore, for the 1949‚Äì50 campaign before taking over as head coach the following year. Womble focused on reforming the team, acquiring sharp-shooting guard Howie Williams from Purdue, 6-foot-9-inch Frank McCabe (Marquette), 6-foot-11-inch center Marcus Freiberger from Oklahoma, speedy 5-foot-10-inch guard Dan Pippin from Missouri and 6-foot-2-inch guard Ron Bontemps who played for Illinois' first undefeated high school state champion, Taylorville, in 1944. The Cats ushered in a basketball renaissance in Peoria with a 66‚Äì53 victory over great rivals Phillips 66ers in the 1952 AAU national championship game. Williams drained nine of 11 shots for a game-high 20 points and Dan Pippin added 17 in what proved to be the first of three consecutive national titles for Peoria. In general, the early 1950s was a period when the NBA was still developing. Star college players like Al Kelley, drafted by the Milwaukee Bucks in 1954, and Howie Crittenden, selected by the New York Knicks in 1956, both chose to play for the Cats instead. =1952‚Äì1960: The team becomes known nationwide= By winning the AAU championship in 1952, the Diesels went on to compete in the Olympic basketball team playoffs at Madison Square Garden in New York City, N.Y. At the Olympic playoffs, after beating the Phillips 66ers in the semifinals, the Caterpillar Diesels defeated the University of Kansas with the score of 62‚Äì60. As a result, Warren Womble was selected to be the head coach of the U.S. Olympic basketball team and could choose seven members to comprise the U.S. Olympic team. He chose five members of the Caterpillar Diesels (Frank McCabe, Ron Bontemps, Dan Pippin, Marc Freiberger and Howie Williams) and also chose two members of the Phillips 66ers (Bob Kurland and Wayne Glasgow) out of respect to their rival team and the NIBL. Phog Allen, the legendary basketball coach who is often referred to as the ‚ÄúFather of Basketball Coaching,‚Äù was the head coach of the University of Kansas and was chosen as assistant coach of the U.S. Olympic team and would report to Womble. In the Olympics of 1952 in Helsinki, the USA team was the only undefeated team after the first six games. The U.S. played Argentina in the first game of the final round, winning 85‚Äì76. The U.S. was matched in the finals against the Russian team. This was a monumental occasion as it was at the height of the Cold War and was also the first Olympics that Russia fielded a basketball team. The U.S. defeated the Russians 36‚Äì25 in a not televised final, winning the gold medal. After the Olympic triumph the Diesels changed their name to Peoria Cats and continued their success in the AAU Tournaments. The Cats went on to defeat Los Alamitos Naval Air Station (73‚Äì62) and Grihalva Buick (63‚Äì55), both of California, for titles in 1953 and 1954, respectively. With the addition of 6-foot-9-inch Bert Born, a member of the Kansas Jayhawks' 1952 NCAA national champion and MVP of the 1953 Final Four for a national runner-up, Peoria added another AAU national title in 1958 with a 74‚Äì71 four-overtime classic over the Denver-Chicago Truckers. When the NBA's No. 1 overall choice of the 1959 draft, Bob Boozer, an All-American from Kansas State, spurned Cincinnati Royals's pro franchise to play in Peoria, the Cats tacked on their last championship. Peoria defeated the Akron Wingfoots 115‚Äì99 in the 1960 final. =1960: Curtain falls= Caterpillar decided to end its sponsorship of the Cats in 1960. Escalating salaries offered by NBA franchises ‚Äì gaining in popularity because of the infusion of college talent such as West, Baylor, Chamberlain and Russell ‚Äì caused Caterpillar to think twice about continuing its program. Bob Boozer finally signed for the Cincinnati Royals and enjoyed an 11-year NBA stint ever since. Caterpillar was more interested in developing employees, not becoming a minor- league affiliate for the NBA. Although the company liked the positive exposure it received from sponsoring a championship basketball team, it decided to pull the plug.

Howard, with elements of fantasy and horror. As often in Howard stories, there is a link to the Cthulhu Mythos, in this case mixed also with elements of both Norse Mythology and Catholic Christianity. It has a rather convoluted history, being in effect an adaptation of \\"Spears of Clontarf\\" - a historical fiction story by Howard focusing on the Battle of Clontarf (1014) and featuring Turlogh Dubh O'Brien or Black Turlogh, a fictional 11th Century Irishman created by Howard. His other story \\"The Grey God Passes\\" is also close to \\"Spears of Clontarf\\" with added fantasy elements. Howard failed to sell the story in these two versions (\\"Spears of Clontarf\\" was only published in 1978, in a collection of the same name). \\"The Cairn on the Headland\\", which is set in the present time (though its plot is strongly influenced by the events of 1014), did get published in Strange Tales on January 1933. It was later included in August Derleth's Skull-Face and Others as well as in Lancer Books' collection of Howard stories entitled Wolfshead. Plot summary James O'Brien is an Irish-American researcher who specializes in the history of Medieval Ireland - a subject which he is highly well-informed on and has a passionate feeling of partisanship towards. He speaks Gaelic fluently, can read ancient Irish manuscripts or inscriptions in their original state. and is thoroughly familiar with such works as The Book of Leinster, the Great Book of Lecan, and the Annals of the Four Masters. O'Brien's promising academic career, and his life's work, is threatened by an insidious blackmailer named Ortali. Ortali is now in possession of evidence which could implicate O'Brien in a murder he didn't commit. With this threat hanging over his head, O'Brien must give Ortali much of his salary and the money he got from various academic awards. Ortali enjoys taunting O'Brien and humiliating him. While visiting Dublin, O'Brien and Ortali discover an ancient cairn on a hillside. The area is shunned by the local citizens, and therefore remains nearly unchanged since the Middle Ages - though the bustle and bright lights of modern Dublin are just around the corner. It's known that the cairn was erected in the aftermath of the 1014 Battle of Clontarf, when Brian Boru liberated his kingdom from an army of Vikings. However, O'brien isn't sure if this structure was erected by the victorious Irish or by the defeated Norse, and who is buried underneath. Ortali decides on coming back around midnight and dismantle the cairn, in the hope of finding treasure under it. O'Brien strongly objects Ortali's decision, both because it's a historic landmark and he feels a premonition about what lays beneath it. Ortali ignores O'Brien's advice and his view towards superstition. When O'Brien mentions how local citizens believe holly should never be brought near the cairn, Ortali simply laughs and says he will wear a bundle of holly on his lapel when he returns. The two also argue about the Battle of Clontarf - O'Brien regarding King Brian Boru as not only having freed Ireland from centuries of Viking oppression, but also having saved all of humanity from the occult worship of the Norse deity Odin, whose followers abandoned their ancestral beliefs and eventually embraced the White Christ. Ortali laughs and scoffs about that, too. The two part in great anger, separately walking back to their hotel. Soon, O'Brien picks up a jagged stone and conceives the idea of killing Ortali with it - even though he would then be charged with a murder of which he would be truly guilty. Later, O'Brien encounters a mysterious woman, who wears archaic clothing and speaks an ancient version of Gaelic. She introduces herself as Meve MacDonnal and gives O'Brien a golden crucifix, decorated with tiny jewels, of an extremely archaic and unmistakably Celtic workmanship. After a moment, he recognizes it as a legendary relic, the Cross of Saint Brandon,Howard's text as printed refers to \\"Saint Brandon\\". Evidently, Howard actually meant Saint Brendan, one of the most important early Irish Saints. Meve MacDonnal's words: \\"Saint Brandon's Cross, fashioned by the hands of the holy man in long ago, before the Norse barbarians made Erin a red hell-in the days when a golden peace and holiness ruled the land\\" fit with the known dates of Saint Brendan's life. which was considered lost centuries ago. Shocked on why MacDonnal would give away such a rare artifact to an absolute stranger, he points out its priceless value. However, MacDonnal scolds O'Brien for placing a monetary value on the cross and explains she gave it to him as a free gift since he would have need of it - and then she disappears behind an alleyway. Suddenly, O'Brien realizes Meve MacDonnal has been dead for three centuries and is buried in a nearby cemetery. The Cross, buried with her, was given to MacDonnal as safekeeping by her uncle, the Bishop Liam O'Brien, who died in 1655.The story makes no reference to why it was necessary to hide the Cross. It's noteworthy that in 1655, the date of Bishop Liam O'Brien's death, coincides with the Cromwellian Conquest of Ireland - a time of great persecution and oppression for Irish Catholics, when valuable Catholic items were in concrete danger of being looted by Protestant troops. After falling into a troubled sleep, O'Brien relives the Battle of Clontarf - in which he had, himself, taken part in his earlier incarnation as the Irish warrior Red Cumal, a kern in service of King Brian Boru (his nickname derived from his having red hair and beard). Following the Irish victory, Cumal loots the armor and helm of a slain Viking. Surveying the battlefield, he sights a severely wounded and one-eyed Viking chieftain, who is actually the god Odin in human form. Odin has transformed himself into a human so he could aid his followers in battle. However, taking a human form left him vulnerable and he was severely wounded by a spear bearing a cross. Now, Odin is trapped in a mortal body and unable to resume his true form as a malevolent wild spirit. Mistaking the man for a Viking (due to his red hair, unshaven beard, and Norse armor), Odin begged Cumal to provide him with a bundle of holly - the only substance which could restore him to his spirit form. Soon, Odin is died (or at least went into a kind of suspended animation). Red Cumal quickly alerts his fellow Irish warriors. Together, they erected a cairn on the hillside, completely covering Odin's body. Cumal quickly warns everyone around him that the cairn must never be disturbed and no holly should ever be placed anywhere near it - thus originating the \\"Legend\\" which would survive into the Twentieth Century. Waking up and finding Ortali missing from the hotel, O'Brien realizes that he might have returned to the cairn and rushes back there. He arrives at the location just in time to witnesses Ortali uncovering the body of Odin, which remains exactly the same as it was when Red Cumal and his allies built the cairn a thousand years earlier. As Ortali bends down, a sprig of holly drops from his lapel onto Odin's corpse. Odin immediately reawakens and comes to monstrous life, shedding his human appearance before transforming into \\"a fiendish spirit of ice, frost, and darkness\\", with \\"the shuddering gleams of the aurora playing around his grisly head\\". Feeling no gratitude towards Ortali, but rather a deep hatred against all humans, Odin proceeds to kill Ortali with a single blot of lightning. Odin quickly turns his attention towards O'Brien. Fortunately, he remembers in time the cross which Meve MacDonnal gave him, holding it high and pointing the relic towards Odin. The cross unleashes a single beam of white light - \\"unbearably pure, unbearably white\\" - and the demon shrieks in pain. With a great rush of vulture-like wings, he soared into the stars, dwindling and disappearing. Soon, O'Brien has survived his encounter, saved Dublin from the demonic fury of Odin, and freed himself of Ortali's blackmail - since police would later determine that Ortali was struck by lightning and no blame attaches to O'Brien. The story never reveals what O'Brien did afterwards with Saint Brandon's Cross. Themes Essential to the story are very sharp, polar value judgements. The conflict of Christianity vs. Norse Religion ‚Äì specifically, Irish Christians vs. Odin- worshiping Vikings ‚Äì is depicted as no less than Good vs. Evil or Light vs. Darkness. As presented here, Clontarf defined not only the future of Ireland but also the fate of the entire world, the whole of humanity - though other Christians in other places failed to appreciate what Brian Boru and his warriors had done for them. The same point was made by Howard in the related story, The Twilight of the Grey Gods, whose plot all takes place in 1014 and where the participation of Odin in the battle makes it a Wagnerian G√∂tterd√§mmerung or Ragnar√∂k. This perception of Vikings and of the Norse religion as utterly evil is quite at variance with that presented in Tigers of the Sea, where Howard's earlier Irish protagonist Cormac Mac Art joins a Viking band, feels no objection to his Danish comrades-in-arms worshiping Odin, and conversely is not particularly fond of Christianity. Dorothy Sayers noted the trend of pagan deities sometimes degenerating into Christian demons, as for example the Greek Apollo becoming \\"The Foul Fiend Apollyon\\" of The Pilgrim's Progress. Clearly, Odin went through a similar transformation in Howard's story. Odin being in Howard's interpretation a demon, his banishment at the climax of the story is an effect an exorcism, and it includes many elements of an exorcism as depicted in Christian tradition. Holding out a crucifix is commonly mentioned as an effective method of confronting a demon. According to Christian theology - specifically, Catholic theology - one need not be a clergyman in order to perform an exorcism. However, if one is not especially holy oneself, the chances of overcoming the demon are much increased if one has a holy relic connected to a venerated Saint, thus being able to draw on that Saint's holiness. In all that, O'Brien follows on the well-established rules for carrying out an exorcism - and it works.

Active design in a building, landscape or city design integrates physical activity into the occupants' everyday routines, such as walking to the store or making a photocopy. Active design involves urban planners, architects, transportation engineers, public health professionals, community leaders and other professionals in building places that encourage physical activity as an integral part of life. While not an inherent part of active design, most designers employing \\"active design\\" are also concerned with the productive life of their buildings and their building's ecological footprint. History Active Design - England Sport England considers that the built environment has a vital role to play to encourage people to be physically active as part of their daily lives, enabling communities to lead more active and healthy lifestyles. In 2007 Sport England and David Lock Associates produced Active Design, which provided a set of design guidelines to help promote opportunities for sport and physical activity in the design and layout of new development. The guidance was developed in two phases, phase one (2005) developed the three key Active Design objects of - improving Accessibility, enhancing Amenity and increasing Awareness (The 3 A's). Phase two included two stakeholder sessions (May & October 2006) which expanded ‚ÄòThe 3 A‚Äôs‚Äô into a criterion based approach. These criteria formed the guidance which was published in 2007. The guidance was supported by CABE, Department of Health and Department for Culture Media and Sport. In 2014, Sport England held a stakeholder session made up of a range of bodies and individuals including Urban Planning and Public Health professionals to discuss whether Active Design was still relevant in today's planning and health context. The clear message from the stakeholder session was that there was still a role for Active Design to play in today's planning and health environment. The guide was revised, retaining ‚ÄòThe 3 A‚Äôs‚Äô and refining the criteria based approach to the Ten Principles of Active Design. The revised Active Design(prepared by Sport England and David Lock Associates) was published in 2015, and was supported by Public Health England. In 2016 Active Design: Planning for health and wellbeing through sport and physical activity was shortlisted for an award at the Royal Town Planning Institute (RTPI) Awards for Planning Excellence. Active Design was shortlisted in the category of Excellence in Planning for Community and Wellbeing.Royal Town Planning Institute - Excellence In Planning Awards 2016 short list http://rtpi.org.uk/briefing-room/news- releases/2016/february/over-60-projects-and-people-from-uk-and-around-the- world-competing-for-top-planning-award/ In 2017 Sport England prepared two animated films, Active Design by Sport England and The Ten Principles of Active Design, in addition to three further Case Studies. The animations and case studies are available on Sport Englands Active Design webpage. The Active Design principles are becoming increasingly embedded into Built Environment practice and placemaking design, with a growing list of Local Authorities in England making reference to Sport England's Active Design guidance in planning policy. In 2018 Active Design was embedded into the principles of the revised Essex Design Guide (prepared by Essex County Council and supported by Sport England). Active Design - New York Recognizing that physical inactivity was a significant factor in decreased life spans, notably because it promoted obesity, high blood pressure and high blood glucose, all precursors of early death, those responsible for planning in New York City developed a set of guidelines that, inter alia, they hoped would promote health by promoting physical activity. They released these guidelines in January 2010. The guidelines were also based on concerns about building longevity and ecological costs, which is generally known as \\"sustainable design\\". Impetus for the guidelines began in 2006 with the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) who then partnered with the American Institute of Architects New York Chapter to hold a series of conferences known as the \\"Fit City\\" conferences. Four key concepts came out of this process: :#Buildings should encourages greater physical movement within them for users and visitors :#Cities should provide recreational spaces that are accessible and encourage physical activity for a variety of ages, interests, and abilities :#Transportation systems in cities should encourage physical activity and should protect non- motor vehicle use :#Cities, market areas and buildings should provide ready access to food and healthy eating environments From New York City the active design movement spread throughout the United States and the world. Goals Sickness can lead to not working efficiently and effectively. Ineffective workers in the work force cause harm to the company and the people in the community. Active design strives to impact public health not only physically but also mentally and socially. For example, active design in transportation supports a safe and vibrant environment for pedestrians, cyclists and transit riders. It creates buildings that encourage greater physical movement within a building by both users and visitors. The active design of recreation sites shapes play and activity spaces for people of different ages, interests, and abilities. Also, improved food accessibility can improve nutrition in communities that need it the most. Effects There are few studies of the effects of implementing active design concepts, but they are in general agreement that the physical activity of occupants is increased. Moving to an active design building seemed to have physical health benefits for workers, but workers‚Äô perceptions on productivity about the new work environment have varied. A study reported that staff moved into an active design building decreased the time spent sitting by 1.2h/day. There was no significant increase in self-rated quality of work or work related motivation but there was no negative feedback in these areas. Implementation Active design concepts may be applied in remodeling or repurposing existing buildings and landscapes. Some elements include widening sidewalks and crosswalks; installing traffic calming elements that slow driving speeds; making stairs that are accessible, visible, attractive, and well-lit; making recreation areas, such as parks, plazas, and playgrounds, more accessible by pedestrians and cyclists. People would be more likely to be active if places for recreation were within walking distance. There are a number of concerns with the adoption of active design programmes. Developing communities are not always accepting of new forms of architecture and living. Integration of active design may come in conflict with making sure historical culture survives. Vernacular architecture may be abandoned due to it being considered insufficient or uncomfortable.http://0-eds.a.ebscohost.com.ignacio.usfca.edu/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=f05c2c1b-356f-4bce-800d-13c3aeecda9e%40sessionmgr4010&vid;=1&hid;=4210 (Unknown document) Future The future of active design may be to further incorporate requirements into law, as in the city of New York which set active design guidelines to improve public health in the city.

He is known for his online monograph and interactive keys to trichomycete taxa.  Family life  Lichtwardt was born in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil to American parents, and consequently had dual citizenship to both countries. As a child he made only a few trips to the U.S. with his parents, graduating from the American School of Rio de Janeiro high school in 1941 but permanently relocating to the US to attend college in 1945. When World War II began, he served for several years at the Embassy in a disbursing position at the Naval Operating Base for the South Atlantic in Rio.Pickett, Calder M. 1995.

Jones, Lichtwardt decided to pursue a master's degree in Botany, with an emphasis in Mycology, at the University of Illinois. He received his M.S. in 1951, and then his Ph.D. in 1954 both in Botany with a Mycology emphasis. His Ph.D. advisor was Leland Shanor, who suggested trichomycetes as a study subject.Lichtwardt, R.

Collections of millipede hosts used in Lichtwardt's thesis research were made at the University of Michigan Biological Station, Douglas Lake, Michigan, the Highlands Biological Station, Highlands, North Carolina, and from Champaign County, Illinois While taking an undergraduate course in field biology at Oberlin, Lichtwardt met his future wife Betty Thomas. They were married in 1951 and have two children  Career  Lichtwardt was among the first to receive the newly-offered post-doctoral fellowships from the National Science Foundation in 1954. He used the funds to pursue field work in Panama and the Amazon region of Brazil. Up to that point, trichomycete collections had been made almost entirely from Europe and North AmericaWhite, M.

In 1955 he obtained a post-doctoral position at the University of Iowa that was offered for three years, but after two years he left to accept a position as an assistant professor at the University of Kansas where he spent the remainder of his career. He rose quickly to associate professor in 1960 and then professor in 1965. He twice served as chairman of the Department of Botany: 1971‚Äì74 and 1981‚Äì84. He officially retired at the end of 1995 and has served as professor emeritus since that time. At Kansas, he taught botany, mycology, plant pathology, and medical mycology.

This species has been collected from hosts in cold, mountainous streams in the Grand Teton National Park, Wyoming, the Abiskoj√•kka river some 125 miles north of the Arctic Circle in Sweden, and a stream draining from the Steingletscher glacier in Switzerland. From collections in various geographic locations, Lichtwardt proposed two main hypotheses regarding historical trichomycete distributions: First, that ‚Äúancestral trichomycetes began to adapt to arthropod gut habitation shortly after insects began to evolve in aquatic habitats some 250 to 190 million years BP.‚Äù Second, that trichomycetes were associated with their arthropod hosts prior to the breakup of Pangea, thus accounting for the cosmopolitan distribution of some species and genera. In addition to taxonomy, he contributed to the methodologies important for the study of trichomycetes. He grew over 150 trichomycete isolates in axenic culture, a critical step for experimental studies on nutritional modes and mating types as well as molecular and ultrastructural analyses.

Under Spanish and Mexican rule, Utah was a major source of illegal slave raids by Mexican, Ute and Navajo slave traders, particularly on Paiute tribes. When Mormon pioneers entered Utah, they introduced African slavery and provided a local market for Indian slavery. After the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, Utah became part of the United States and slavery was officially legalized in Utah Territory on February 4, 1852 with the passing of the Act in Relation to Service. It was repealed on June 19, 1862 when Congress prohibited slavery in all US territories. Indian slavery Old Spanish Trail From 1824‚Äì1848, Utah was part of the Mexican province of Alta California (Upper California). Mexican trading parties would often travel the Old Spanish Trail, which went through modern day Utah, and buy Indian slaves to sell in the neighboring territory of Santa Fe de Nuevo Mexico or other places in Alta California. Mexicans, Utes, and Navajos would raid Paiute and sometimes Ute villages for slaves. Slavery had been made illegal in Santa Fe de Nuevo M√©xico in 1812 and in Alta California Territory in 1824, but lax enforcement and high profits kept it going. Boys would sell for $100 and girls between $150 and $200. Indigenous girls could demand a higher price because they had a reputation for making the best house servants. In addition, Mexican laws allowed for an aggressive debt bondage in the form of the peonage system. Shortly after the Mormon pioneers arrived in Salt Lake Valley, they began expanding into Indian territory, which often resulted in conflict. After expanding into the Utah Valley, Brigham Young issued an extermination order against the Timpanogos, resulting in the Battle at Fort Utah, where many Timpanogo women and children were taken into slavery. Some were able to escape, but many died in slavery. In the winter of 1849-1850, after expanding into Parowan, Mormons attacked a group of Indians, killing around 25 men and taking the women and children as slaves. News of the enslavement reached the US Government, who appointed Edward Cooper as Indian Agent in September 1850. Edward Cooper made the issue of Indian slavery one of his first efforts. A statue of Chief Walkara who was a licensed slave trader in Utah. At the encouragement of Mormon leaders, the Mormon pioneers started participating in the Indian slave trade. In 1851, Apostle George A. Smith gave Chief Peteetneet and Walkara talking papers that certified \\"it is my desire that they should be treated as friends, and as they wish to Trade horses, Buckskins and Piede children, we hope them success and prosperity and good bargains.\\" Brigham Young encouraged the saints to \\"buy up the Lamanite children as fast as they could\\". However, the Mormons strongly opposed the New Mexican slave trade. In November 1851, Don Pedro Le√≥n Luj√°n, a New Mexican slave trader who had been operating in Utah with a New Mexico license, asked Young as the newly appointed governor of Utah for a license to trade with the Indians, including slaves. Young refused to given Luj√°n a license to conduct any trade with the Indians. On the way home to New Mexico, Luj√°n's party was attacked by Ute Indians, who stole his horses. Luj√°n retaliated by kidnapping some of their children to sell in New Mexico. He and his party were caught in Manti and charged with violating the Nonintercourse Act, which prohibited trading with the Indians without a valid license. His property was seized and the children were sold into slavery to families in Manti. He contested, claiming it was hypocritical to not allow him to have slaves, but allow the Mormon families to have slaves. Many of Walker's band were upset by the interruption with the Mexican slave trade. In one graphic incident, Ute Indian Chief Arrapine, a brother of Chief Walkara, insisted that because the Mormons had stopped the Mexicans from buying these children, the Mormons were obligated to purchase them. In his book, Forty Years Among the Indians, Daniel Jones wrote, \\"[s]everal of us were present when he took one of these children by the heels and dashed its brains out on the hard ground, after which he threw the body towards us, telling us we had no hearts, or we would have bought it and saved its life.\\" A month after legalizing slavery with the Act in Relation to Service, Utah passed the Act for the relief of Indian Slaves and Prisoners, which officially legalized Indian Slavery in Utah. The bill provided several protections for the Indian slaves, including a requirement to educate and clothe the Indians, and a limit of twenty years, which was greater than the New Mexican limit of ten years. Mormons continued taking children from their families long after the slave traders left and even began to actively solicit children from Paiute parents. They also began selling Indian slaves to each other. By 1853, each of the hundred households in Parowan had one or more Paiute children. Indian slaves were used for both domestic and manual labor. In 1857, Representative Justin Smith Morrill estimated that there were 400 Indian slaves in Utah. Richard Kitchen has identified at least 400 Indian slaves taken into Mormon homes, but estimates even more went unrecorded because of the high mortality rate of Indian slaves. Many of them tried to escape. Historians Sarah Barringer Gordon and Kevin Waite have identified that over half of the Indian adoptees died by their early 20s. Those who survived and were released generally found themselves without a community, full members of neither their original tribes nor the white communities in which they were raised. African slavery In 1847, the Mormon pioneers arrived with African slaves, which was the first time African slavery was in the area. Mormons arrived in the middle of the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War and ignored the Mexican ban on slavery. Instead, slavery was recognized by custom, naturally coming from the Mormon view on blacks. Like many Christians of the day, Mormons believed in the Curse of Cain and Curse of Ham. Early Mormon leaders taught that God decreed that blacks should be \\"servants of servants\\" and that governments did not have the power to reverse God's decree. Three slaves arrived in the first company of pioneers, but more arrived in later companies.Negro Slaves in Utah by Jack Beller, Utah Historical Quarterly, vol. 2, no. 4, 1929, pp. 124‚Äì126 After Utah territory passed to American rule following the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in 1848, the issue of slavery in the newly acquired territories became a major issue, with the Whigs wanting to keep Mexico's ban on slavery and the Democrats wanting to introduce slavery. During discussions, Utah lobbyist John Milton Bernhisel hid Utah slavery from members of Congress. With the Compromise of 1850, Utah was granted the right to decide by popular sovereignty whether it wanted to allow slavery. By 1850, there were around 100 blacks, the majority of whom were slaves. It is difficult to know the exact numbers, because Utah continued to hide slaves. The 1850 census of Utah territory was taken without the certification of Territorial Secretary Broughton Harris, who complained that the census was done in his absence and that it had several irregularities. The census only reported 26 slaves, with a note that all of them were heading to California, making it seem like there would not be any slaves in Utah. It did not include any of the slaves held in Bountiful, Utah. On February 4, 1852, Utah passed the Act in Relation to Service, which officially legalized slavery in Utah territory. Like in other slave states, slaves tried to escape, were sold or donated, wanted their freedoms and were often treated similar to the slaves in other states. However, there were several unique characteristics to Utah slavery laws. The slave could be released for abuse or sexual relationships. Masters were required to clothe, educate and punish their slaves. When the Civil War broke out, there is some indication that some slave owners returned to the South because they were thought they were more likely to keep their slaves. On June 19, 1862 Congress prohibited slavery in all US territories.

It was founded by Nick Green, Gunnar Lovelace, Kate Mulling, and Sasha Siddhartha. By 2016 they had raised $141 million across three rounds of funding following their launch in November 2014. For every paid Thrive Market membership, a free membership is donated to a family in need in the United States. Described as \\"Costco meets Whole Foods\\", Thrive Market's business model is designed to simplify the supply chain by eliminating the markup typically applied by brick-and-mortar grocery stores.  Membership model  For every paid Thrive Market membership, a free membership is donated to a family in need in the United States as part of the company's Thrive Gives program. Students, teachers, veterans, and first responders are also eligible for free memberships. Thrive Market offers incentives with membership including free product gifts and samples with orders daily discounts, and limited-time-only deals. Thrive Market offers a savings guarantee for members who don't make back the $60 membership fee in savings over the course of the yearlong membership. The difference in savings and membership fee is refunded as shopping credit when the member renews for another year.  Shopping on Thrive Market  Thrive Market carries more than 6,000 products, including organic and non-GMO foods, ethically sourced meat and seafood, nontoxic home and beauty products, organic and biodynamic wine, and items for babies and kids. The company allows users to filter their search results by more than 70 different diets and lifestyle choices. Examples of filters include vegan, paleo, keto, gluten-free, Fair Trade Certified, and Non-GMO Project Verified. As of September 4, 2019, Thrive Market is the first retailer to use the Glyphosate Residue Free certification, created by the Detox Project, a research and certification platform.  History  Thrive Market was launched in November 2014 to address the geographical and monetary challenges that bar communities from healthy food. Lovelace grew up on an organic farm in Ojai, California and saw firsthand the power of group buying as a way to both make healthy food affordable and build community. When Green and Lovelace initially tried to raise money for Thrive Market, they were rejected by more than 50 venture-capital firms. They then focused on building a network of more than 200 health and wellness investors‚Äîincluding Deepak Chopra, Tony Robbins, and Jillian Michaels‚Äîto support Thrive Market individually. As of 2016, Thrive Market has raised $141 million from Greycroft Partners, E-Ventures, Cross Culture Ventures, and Invus, as well as from celebrities including John Legend, Will Smith, and Demi Moore. Thrive Market members pay an annual membership fee of $59.95 for 25-50% off traditional retail prices and free shipping for orders amounting to more than $49. Thrive Market has two fulfillment centers from which distribution is made, one at Batesville, Indiana, and another at Tahoe Reno Industrial Center near Reno, Nevada. They advertise delivery to 85% of the United States within two days. The company currently employs more than 500 people. In February 2016, Thrive Market launched a mobile app, available for iOS and Android systems. Co- founders Nick Green and Gunnar Lovelace appeared on CBS This Morning in May 2016. In June 2016, Thrive Market launched an online petition asking the USDA to accept food stamps online.  Products  Thrive Market is the largest national retailer of exclusively non-GMO foods. They launched their own product line in November 2015, aiming to develop affordable products in categories where there is not enough margin to cover cost. They currently offer more than over 400 different Thrive Market branded items by SKUs, including coconut oil, tomato sauce, olive oil, baking goods, and spices.  Thrive Gives Program and Donations  During 2016, Thrive Market noted that they had given away more than 350,000 memberships. Thrive Market also has provided memberships and stipends for families affected by Walmart closings in Wichita, Kansas, Denver, Colorado, and Chicago, Illinois; areas affected by water shortages in Flint, Michigan; and areas affected by floods in Louisiana. Thrive Market also works closely with the True Sioux Hope Foundation to provide healthy offerings for native communities, During the 2015 holiday season, Thrive Market teamed up with Feeding America to allow customers to donate their shopping savings to the nonprofit at checkout. In early 2016, they launched a campaign entitled, Spread the Health, which allows customers to donate a portion of their savings at checkout with every dollar donated going directly into the shopping cart of a low-income Thrive Gives family.  USDA petition  Soon after the petition launched, Gunnar Lovelace participated in a congressional briefing hosted by Congressman Tim Ryan and actress-activist Shailene Woodley. Lovelace also met with Senior Nutrition Policy Advisor Debra Eschmeyer and USDA officials in the White House. On September 25, 2016, the USDA announced plans for its pilot program for online shopping and called for volunteers to apply for participation.  Criticism of Thrive Market  Thrive Market attracts new users through free trial memberships, which last one month before automatically renewing at an annual cost of $59.95 billed to the customer. As a membership-based platform, Thrive Market requires new users to sign up for a free trial or paid membership to access the full website. To cancel a trial or paid membership, members must contact Thrive Market's customer service by email, phone, or 24/7 online chat support. The most common complaints about Thrive Market membership pertain to 1) customers claiming to be unaware of a membership fee and 2) customers claiming to have difficulty cancelling their memberships. After a customer provides an email address to gain access to the website or start a membership, Thrive Market delivers daily promotions and one-day-only discounts via its email marketing channel. This has resulted in some customers complaining about receiving too many emails. Customers have also filed complaints against Thrive to the California Attorney General for misleading and deceptive conduct in which coupons indicating a certain percentage off (30%, for example) are capped at small dollar amounts without any reference to the cap.

In his address, Kennedy defended post-World War II liberalism, advocated for a national healthcare insurance model, criticized retired Hollywood film actor and Republican presidential nominee Ronald Reagan, and implicitly rebuked incumbent President Jimmy Carter, for his more moderate political stances. It has been remembered by some as Kennedy's best speech, and is one of the most memorable political speeches in modern American history.  Background  Senator Edward \\"Ted\\" M. Kennedy, 1974 August 12 was devoted to platform debate. It began in the morning with social issues, and contentiously shifted to economic policies. Both the Carter delegate majority and the Kennedy delegate minority had six speakers to propose policies and counter the others' arguments. The final majority spokesman was United States Ambassador to the United Nations Andrew Young, whose words were drowned out by increasingly intense pro-Kennedy chants, which did not stop until Representative Barbara Mikulski introduced Kennedy, who himself was to make the minority's final economic comments.  The speech  = Composition = According to Bernard K. Duffy and Richard Leeman, the first draft of the speech was created by Carey Parker and Bob Shrum. Kennedy made additions, which were taken by Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. and Ted Sorensen and made into the final draft. Kennedy rehearsed the speech with a teleprompter twice, once in his hotel and again at the convention site. Kennedy remembered the process somewhat differently, stating in a 2005 interview that the original speech was continuously altered, starting from before the convention when Carter declined to participate in a debate and instead suggested that differences be expressed during the platform committees. That night Kennedy and his sisters Jean, Pat, and Eunice began piecing together a new speech, with Shrum filling in where necessary. This supposedly continued every night until the platform arguments. = Summary = Kennedy spoke for thirty-two minutes. He opened his speech by conceding his defeat: Kennedy criticized Ronald Reagan's ideas and nostalgically appealed to a defense of old liberal values: Kennedy later developed his argument by displaying his role as a spokesperson for Democratic voters. To do this, he employed prosopopoeia, telling real life stories of people he had met while campaigning. Shrum would maintain that this technique was new at the time and later popularized by Reagan: Towards the end of the speech, Kennedy made his only mention of Carter in an unenthusiastic non- endorsement: The crowd applauded and then fell silent. As Kennedy finished, he mentioned his two older brothers, John and Robert, something he usually avoided doing: Kennedy had been interrupted by cheers and applause a total of fifty-one times. He would later write that the delegates' response was \\"warm and generous\\". Sustained applause and cheers followed his speech for half an hour.  Aftermath  The following day Carter told state and local officials during a reception at Sheraton Centre Hotel that \\"Last night after one of the greatest speeches I have ever heard I called Senator Kennedy and told him how much I appreciated it. Ours is a nation, ours is a party well-represented by thousands of people like you who believe in the greatness of the United States, and who believe in openness, debate, controversy, courage, conviction and who believe in their future, and are not afraid to express your will in the most open, democratic and greatest party on earth. I'm grateful to you for that.\\" Reagan ended up defeating Carter in a landslide of 489 electoral votes to 49, or 50.7% to 41% of the popular vote.  Legacy  The speech is considered the most famous of Kennedy's senatorial career and laid the foundation for the modern Democratic Party's platform. Schlesinger would write in his diary that he \\"had never heard Ted deliver a better speech.\\" Former campaign aide Joe Trippi later said, \\"In a lot of ways, a whole country of young people were inspired that day.\\" It is often considered to be one of the most effective political orations of the time period. It was ranked as the 76th best American speech of the 20th century in a 1999 survey of academics. According to Robert S. McElvaine, \\"It was a great speech to read or to hear in the arena, but it was considerably less effective on television.\\" Kennedy referenced his words during the endorsement he made for Barack Obama at the 2008 Democratic National Convention, saying, \\"the work begins anew, the hope rises again and the dream lives on\\". Following Kennedy's death in 2009, many media outlets circulated footage of the closing of the speech.

Wolf, The Case for an International Anti-Corruption Court, Brookings Institution, Governance Studies at Brookings, July 2014. The idea for an International Anti-Corruption Court was first put forward by Judge Mark L. Wolf at the 2012 St. Petersburg International Legal Forum and subsequently presented at the 2014 World Forum on Governance.Mark L. Wolf, The Case for an International Anti-Corruption Court, Brookings Institution, Governance Studies at Brookings, July 2014, p.1. Wolf outlined the proposal in a paper for the Brookings Institution in July 2014,Mark L. Wolf, The Case for an International Anti-Corruption Court, Brookings Institution, Governance Studies at Brookings, July 2014. as well as in a Washington Post op-ed on 22 July 2014.Mark L. Wolf, We need an international court to stamp out corruption, The Washington Post, 22 July 2014. Judge Wolf wrote an article called \\"The World Needs an International Anti-Corruption Court\\" in the Daedalus journal to inform the public of his idea. It can be found here. The governments of Colombia, Peru, and Nigeria have formally endorsed a General Assembly session on corruption at the United Nations Headquarters in New York, scheduled for 26-28 April 2021. A joint declaration was issued by President Iv√°n Duque to Peru and President Mart√≠n Vizcarra Cornejo of Colombia with the purpose of adopting concrete actions to prevent and combat corruption, strengthen international cooperation and creation of an international anti-corruption court. With the active support of the Colombian government, momentum is growing to bring the International Anti-Corruption Court concept before international bodies, including the United Nations General Assembly. Though the process of drafting and ratifying international conventions can be slow, participants encouraged the development of regional or continental agreements to target corruption. Such agreements could serve as a proof of concept for an international body, while addressing ongoing issues of corruption as the details of the IACC are negotiated. Under the proposed Court, states could voluntarily accede to the IACC, granting it jurisdiction over investigating and prosecuting domestic acts of grand corruption. The IACC would be staffed by top prosecutors and impartial judges selected by the Court‚Äôs state parties. Crucially, the IACC would operate under the principle of ‚Äúcomplementarity,‚Äù meaning it would only conduct prosecutions where domestic courts are unwilling or unable to do so. In this way, the IACC would act as incentive for domestic governments to establish adequate anti-corruption processes while ensuring that corrupt leaders are held accountable where the effective processes do not yet exist. In these respects, the IACC is similar to, but distinct from, the International Criminal Court (ICC), and may be designed in a way that draws on the strengths of the ICC model while avoiding some of its weaknesses. Other elements of Wolf's proposalMark L. Wolf, The Case for an International Anti- Corruption Court, Brookings Institution, Governance Studies at Brookings, July 2014. include: * The court would serve as a forum for the criminal enforcement of the laws prohibiting grand corruption that exist in virtually every country, and the undertakings that are requirements of various treaties and international organisations (including the United Nations Convention against Corruption and the OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Officials, often called the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention); * The court should operate on the principle of complementarity, meaning the court would only conduct prosecutions where states are unwilling or unable to prosecute; * The court should be empowered to hear civil fraud and corruption cases brought by private \\"whistleblowers\\"'; * Submission to the jurisdiction of the court should be incorporated in the United Nations Convention against Corruption and a condition of membership in international organisations such as the OECD and WTO; * Submission to the jurisdiction of the court should be a condition of obtaining loans from international lenders such as the World Bank; and * Submission to the jurisdiction of the court should be incorporated into new free trade agreements. Wolf argues that an IACC would have \\"the potential to erode the widespread culture of impunity, contribute to creating conditions conducive to the democratic election of honest officials in countries which have long histories of grand corruption, and honor the courageous efforts of the many people, particularly young people, who are increasingly exposing and opposing corruption at great personal peril.\\"The Case for an International Anti-Corruption Court, Brookings Institution, Governance Studies at Brookings, July 2014, p. 1. Wolf attributes this \\"culture of impunity\\" to an \\"unwillingness of leaders to permit the honest and able investigation of their friends, families, and, indeed, themselves.\\"The Case for an International Anti-Corruption Court, Brookings Institution, Governance Studies at Brookings, July 2014, p. 1.

On June 12, 2019, Colombian Foreign Minister Carlos Holmes Trujillo delivered opening remarks, including calling for support of the IACC, to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime Expert Group Meeting in Oslo, Norway.

It consists of a selection of songs from Guthrie's Dust Bowl Ballads of 1940 and his Asch recordings of 1944‚Äì45, each introduced briefly by Geer with spoken relevant extracts from Guthrie's writings. By 1956, Guthrie was hospitalized with Huntington's disease, a hereditary condition. On March 17, 1956, a benefit concert was held for his children at the Pythian Hall, New York City; at which Guthrie made one of his last public appearances, sitting in the audience. Various folk singers performed Guthrie's songs, interspersed with readings from Guthrie's writings selected by Millard Lampell, a former member with Guthrie and others of the Almanac Singers. The album Bound for Glory was compiled and released following that event. The title was taken from Guthrie's 1943 autobiography, Bound for Glory. The album includes a cyclostyled booklet with an introduction by Lampell, and the spoken and sung words. It has been re-released several times.

He served as Danish Historiographer Royal and was the great uncle of the explorer Vitus Bering (1681-1741). Early life and education Vitus Pedersen Bering was born in Viborg, Denmark. Bering was the son of the city mayor Peder Pedersen Bering and Maren Vitusdatter Brun. He graduated from Viborg Katedralskole in 1635. He soon attracted attention for his poems in Latin and was called to serve as steward for Otte Thott, son of Scania county governor Tage Thott (1580-1658). He subsequently conducted a seven-year foreign trip to Leiden (1639), Orl√©ans (1640), Siena (1642), Rome and Padua (1647) and Strasbourg and Basel (1648). Career After their return to Denmark, he took a Master's degree at the University of Copenhagen in 1649. He immediately assumed a position as professor poeseos at the University of Copenhagen. Later that same year he was appointed to professor in history at Sor√∏ Academy and Historiographer Royal. In late 1651, he was granted permission to resign as professor. His patron, Tage Thott, made arrangements for a residence at Skabersj√∂ Castle in Scania. The king granted him the former archbishop's house Lundeg√•rd at Lund. The Danish loss of Scania to Sweden as a result of the Treaty of Roskilde in 1658 made Bering a Swedish subject. With support from Corfitz Ulfeldt (1606‚Äì1664) he negotiated with King Charles XI of Sweden for a position as Swedish Historiographer. The king approved his proposal in 1659 but Bering managed to sell his estate to Peder Winstrup (1605‚Äì1679), Bishop of the Diocese of Lund. in 1660 and chose instead to leave Scania. He was well received in Denmark and became a member of the Treasury college (skatkammerkollegiet) on 11 November 1660. In ca. 1669, he was also appointed Supreme Court justice. He also kept the position as Historiographer. Works Bering was tasked with writing a general history of Denmark, a work on reign of King Christian IV of Denmark and a work on recent events such as the assault on Copenhagen in 1659 and the institution of Absolutism in 1660. Neither of these were published prior to his death. His only publication was a critical work on England, Orosij Annilonis dissertalio de bello Dano-Anglico (1667), a defense of the Danish king's policy. His work Obsidio Hafniensis on the assault on Copenhagen was published posthumously in 1676. His largest work, Floms Danicus, an account of Danish history in Latin reaching back to 1448, was not published until 1698. It was in the style used in the works attributed to 2nd-century Roman historian Publius Annius Florus. Historically, it is of little interest, being merely a stylistical treatment of older sources. It was, however, praised in its own time. Bering was also a popular writer of Occasional poetry. Few of Bering's poems have survived. They represent the transition in Danish Baroque poetry from Anders Bording (1619‚Äì1677) to Thomas Kingo (1634‚Äì1703) both of whom were among his personal friends. Personal life his nephew Bering married Anne Nielsdatter, daughter of Niels Pedersen Aurilesius (1601-1634), rector of the University of Copenhagen, on 13 June 1652. She died in 1657. On 15 September 1663, he then married Gertrud J√∏rgensdatter, daughter of J√∏rgen Hansen (1613‚Äì73) and Kirstine Knudsdatter (died 1702). In 1666, King Christian V granted him the Klampenborg area north of Copenhagen for life. Bering constructed a small country house on the land and named it Christiansholm after the king. The king also granted him another country estate, probably Farumg√•rd shortly prior to his death in 1675. His great nephew cartographer and sailor Vitus Jonassen Bering (1681-1741) entered Russian service, and made himself a name as an explorer, commanding the First Kamchatka Expedition and Great Northern Expedition, where he perished at 60 years of age. Their similar names and the lack of the latter man's reliable portraits has led to the lot of confusion, and, until the explorer's remains were recovered in 1991, the portrait of his uncle was believed to belong to him.

Hope Harris, was a surveyor in South Australia, noted for laying out the town of Port Pirie. Lake Harris is named for him. History Harris was born in Clare, Suffolk, the fourth son of Congregationalist Rev. Samuel Link Harris (15 January 1807 ‚Äì 22 January 1894) and Emily Harris (c. 1811 ‚Äì 27 November 1889), who with their eight children emigrated to South Australia aboard the Asia, arriving at Adelaide in September 1851 and settled in the township of Macclesfield. He joined the Survey Department as a cadet in the field branch, and was put in charge of a field party in 1865. He spent some time in Melbourne gaining qualifications as a mine surveyor and shire engineer and, duly qualified, began advertising his services as a licensed surveyor in August 1869, operating from an office in Gresham Chambers, King William Street. In 1871 he was contracted to survey sections of the northern agricultural areas. He laid out the town of Port Pirie on the \\"spider-web\\" principle, and also surveyed Laura, Curramulka, Ardrossan, and other towns. He rejoined the Survey Department and in 1874 supervised the trigonometrical survey north-west of Port Augusta, and mapped areas beyond Lake Gairdner, as far as Wilgena, in the process of which he discovered and mapped two previously unrecorded lakes, which by order of Governor Musgrave were named Lake Harris in his honour, and Lake Everard, after the Commissioner of Crown Lands, William Everard. In 1875, he was transferred to the office staff, engaged on special survey work for the department, which included investigation of sites for the Beetaloo and Barossa reservoirs. In his last years he was almost totally blind, but with the aid of a young secretary was able to continue exercising his mathematical and curatorial skills. Other activities *In 1886, after Strawbridge was promoted to Deputy Surveyor General, Harris was appointed Examiner of Licensed Surveyors' Work, a position he held until the day he died. *He was the Trigonometrical Computer and Secretary to the Board of Examiners for Surveyors. *He was a foundation member of the Institute of Surveyors, served as Vice-President for many years.

He made a precise calculation, subsequently verified, for the mass of a comet which appears every 70 years. *He compiled a reference work on government surveying, which went to a fourth edition in 1914, and a number of pamphlets (listed below) based on his lectures. *He was an active member of the Clayton Congregational Church, and wrote a 32-page history of the church, published for its jubilee in 1906. *During leave of absence he familiarised himself with surveying methods in Victoria, New South Wales, and Tasmania. *For many years he was vice-president of the Kensington Literary Society. *He was one of the founders of the Surveyors' Institute. *He had a strong interest in the early history of the State. He and fellow Survey Department officer H. C. Talbot (1850‚Äì1924) were acknowledged by Rodney Cockburn, author of Nomenclature of South Australia, for their contribution to the knowledge of origins of placenames, and particularly Aboriginal placenames, for which he was an advocate. > Ignoring the wealth of history and romance wrapped up in the names given by > the natives to various natural features and localities, we have obliterated > them for the sake of names more dear to viceregal representatives, such as > Alice, Caroline, Anna, Joyce, Joanna, Julia, Laura, George, John, and James. > Our territorial rights may be equivocal, but this surely does not trouble > our conscience so much that we need hasten to destroy every vestige of the > people who were once supreme here.

Life and career  Nigel Cooke attended Nottingham Trent University at Undergraduate level (1991‚Äì1994) before completing a M.A at The Royal College of Art, London (1995‚Äì1997) and PHD from Goldsmiths (1998‚Äì2004). He is currently a visiting lecturer at the Royal College of Art, London.  Artistic Practice  Nigel Cooke‚Äôs paintings depict carnivalesque figures set within harsh landscapes that are littered with urban decay. The paintings imply a strong sense of foreboding both through the depicted forms such as skulls and derelict buildings and also through his use of colour which often features bilious toxic greens. The paintings develop and change over a protracted period of time and are built up though many layers of oil paint. The paintings often balance different languages of paint within the same canvas. Vast areas of colour are combined with obsessively detailed figuration and in recent works Cooke has incorporated large sweeping gestural marks into his compositions.  Collections  Cooke's work has been exhibited internationally and features in major museum collections including The Tate in London, The MOMA in New York and The Solomon R.

Plot In the production trailer, Sidney watches the footage of Dominic's arrival to the house and his fight with Matt. When Sidney's cameraman noticed Rory's murder by the Jane sisters' ghosts onscreen, he tries to bring the producer's attention to replay the footage but before the cameraman could do so, the latter and Sidney hear the screams of a production assistant's murder outside the trailer. When they investigate, Sidney and the cameraman are murdered by a crazed Agnes who has just arrived on the set, acting as the Butcher, and she steals the camera. After entering the storm cellar, Agnes is startled by the ghosts inside who string wooden totems around her. Inside the Roanoke house, the actors deny Matt's claim of Rory's fate and, when the participants search through the house, they find that Rory's body has disappeared from inside the bathroom. The second day before the second night shift of the Blood Moon, after rejecting Dominic's sexual advances in the kitchen, Shelby is attacked by Agnes who severely injures her shoulder inside the bedroom, but Dominic arrives and stops Agnes who manages to escape before she could kill Shelby. While Audrey and Dominic tend to Shelby's wounds, Lee informs the group that all the phone lines have been cut when she tried to contact help. During a brief argument, Lee decides to venture outside with Audrey and Monet to find Sidney's trailer, arming herself with her gun, while Dominic and Matt stay in the house with Shelby. When they venture through the passage, they're confronted by Mott's ghost, obliging the women to flee into the woods. As night falls, they arrive and witness the aftermath of the massacre outside the trailer on set. While the women look for a way to reach for help, Agnes appears and lunges after them but Lee pulls out her gun and shoots her in the shoulder. The real ghosts of the Roanoke colony appear, forcing the group to hide in the woods. After finding Rory‚Äôs corpse hanging from a tree, Lee, Audrey, and Monet are abducted by the real Polk family and taken into the Polk compound. The deformed family begins to torture the women by force-feeding the actresses human flesh that they cut from Lee's leg. Back at the house, Scathach once again manipulates Matt to engage in their sexual activity in the basement. After Dominic and Shelby arrive, the latter attacks and drives Scathach away with a crowbar. Matt absurdly confesses his affair with the witch as his reason for returning. Infuriated by his alleged betrayal, Shelby bashes Matt's head repeatedly with a crowbar, killing him. She becomes hysterical, regretting having murdered her husband. Outside, Agnes screams maniacally as Thomasin and threatens the group while the ghosts of the Roanoke settlers, including the real Thomasin, surround her. Shelby and Dominic are forced to watch from the upper view as the Butcher thrusts her cleaver into Agnes' head, killing her.

Biography =Origins and role in Blaj= Bunea was born in Vad, a village in the »öara FƒÉgƒÉra»ôului region of Transylvania, then part of the Austrian Empire. He attended primary school from 1864 to 1870, there and in nearby Ohaba. He went to a gymnasium in Bra»ôov until the spring of 1877, when he was briefly transferred to Blaj. While in Bra»ôov, he and classmate Andrei B√¢rseanu edited a magazine by hand; it was called Conversa»õiuni. Jurnal literar. In the magazine, Bunea published 97 folk poems he had gathered around his native village, accompanied by commentaries that showed familiarity with the relevant literature. In autumn 1877, he began studying philosophy and theology on scholarship at Rome's Pontifical Urban University. Ordained a priest in 1881, he obtained a doctorate in theology the following year.Ni»õƒÉ, p. 330 After returning to Blaj, the spiritual center of his church, Bunea was assigned to a number of posts within the hierarchy, from metropolitan's adviser and secretary under Ioan Vancea to scholastic and custodial canon under Victor Mihaly de Ap»ôa. He was involved in organizing confessional education at Blaj and across the FƒÉgƒÉra»ô and Alba Iulia Archdiocese. At Blaj, he taught religion and dogmatic theology within both the gymnasium and the seminar, briefly serving as prefect of studies. From 1900 to 1903, he was archdiocesan commissioner for the examinations given by certain church schools in Blaj. He was a founding member of the Greek-Catholic teachers' association, and served as inspector for the archdiocese's village schools. =Journalism and recognition= Over the course of his career, Bunea contributed to several Romanian-language publications, particularly in his native province. His articles dealt with literature, politics and history, appearing in Foaia bisericeascƒÉ »ôi scolasticƒÉ (Blaj), Tribuna and Transilvania (Sibiu), Gazeta Transilvaniei (Bra»ôov) and in the periodical Dreptatea (Timi»ôoara). In 1890, he helped establish Unirea newspaper in Blaj. In 1903, he published a selection of the texts he had submitted to this organ as Discursuri. Autonomia bisericeascƒÉ. Diverse.Ni»õƒÉ, pp. 330-31 Bunea became a member of Astra in 1886.Ni»õƒÉ, p. 331 In September 1900, he was elected a corresponding member of its historical section.Ni»õƒÉ, p. 334 He was among the collaborators on the organization's Enciclopedia rom√¢nƒÉ project, signing around fifty articles that covered some sixty pages. These mainly dealt with important figures in the church's past, but also touched on internal administration, the history of Blaj and Romanian monasteries in Transylvania. The author later drew on the articles for other historiographical works. Nicolae Iorga, Ioan Bianu and Dimitrie Onciul all appreciated Bunea's merits as a historian, and he was distinguished by cultural organizations both in the Empire and in the Old Kingdom. Following his 1900 advancement within Astra, in March 1901, the Romanian Academy received him with the status of corresponding member. Several months later, he was made a member of Astra's central committee. In 1903, he became a paid member of the Hungarian Historical Society. In May 1909, he advanced to titular membership of the Romanian Academy. =Politics and death= Beginning in 1890, Bunea participated in the political movement of Transylvania's Romanians. A distinguished orator, he was among those who defended the Transylvanian Memorandum signatories. For many years, he belonged to the Romanian National Party. In his will, drafted in early 1906, Bunea provided for the possibility that his money might be used to set up a foundation for Greek-Catholic youth. The foundation would be administered by the Blaj consistory and would be used to send promising graduates to further their studies abroad. Bunea died at Blaj in late 1909. His fellow priests at the theological seminary dedicated an album to him; this featured private messages and newspaper articles from the cities and villages of Transylvania, from Romania, from Vienna, Budapest and other European cities. The album dedicated a lengthy section to the numerous articles in the Romanian press covering the event.Ni»õƒÉ, p. 335 =Legacy= During Bunea's lifetime, biographical data about him appeared in the 1898 first volume of Enciclopedia Rom√¢niei and in three other sources, from 1899, 1900 and 1908. An article commemorating 30 years since his death appeared in the Cluj-based Tribuna in 1939. In 1940 and 1941, texts about him appeared in the book DascƒÉlii Blajului, in Convorbiri Literare and in the Blaj high school yearbook. Subsequently, under the early years of the communist regime which banned the church, Romanian historiography fell silent about him. In 1967, a detailed study appeared in Revista de etnografie »ôi folclor; this dealt with the youthful Bunea's collecting of popular poetry in »öara FƒÉgƒÉra»ôului. In 1970, a methodical study appeared in Pompiliu Teodor's Evolu»õia g√¢ndirii esoteric rom√¢ne»ôti. This included biographical data, identified the roots of his activity as a historian and defined his areas of interest, main historiographic achievements and concept of history. Teodor also made judgments about the documentation used by Bunea. The 1978 Enciclopedia istoriografiei rom√¢ne»ôti devoted a short entry to him. In 1991, following the Romanian Revolution, Liviu Maior dedicated an article in Tribuna to Bunea's political activity. A 1994 article deals with his contributions to Romanian cultural history in Transylvania as encapsulated in some of his works and in several articles from Unirea. During the 1990s, three articles, including one by Gabriel »òtrempel, brought to light previously unpublished material from his letters. Work =Early efforts= Bunea's early interest as a historian lay mainly with the history of the Romanian Greek-Catholic Church. His first book, a short volume from 1890, deals with the church's present condition. First appearing in Foaia bisericeascƒÉ »ôi scolasticƒÉ, and then as a 40-page brochure, it includes biographical information about incumbent metropolitan Vancea, as well as cataloguing his cultural, administrative and philanthropic activity. Bunea's 1893 work Cestiuni din dreptul »ôi istoria Bisericii Rom√¢ne»ôti Unite. Partea a II-a also deals with a contemporary issue. The author argued in defense of the church's autonomy, which was being threatened by the policies of the Hungarian government. In 1900, Bunea published two books: Istoria scurtƒÉ a Bisericii Rom√¢ne Unite, a brief history of the church; and an important monograph about Inocen»õiu Micu-Klein. The first, written on the 200th anniversary of the union with Rome, began with an overview of relations between Romanians and the Holy See from the 2nd to the 15th centuries, going on to discuss Transylvania's Romanian church under the Calvinist princes. He then described the union itself and the life and activity of the early bishops in each diocese, ending with the present day. Bunea's sources were either published Latin and Romanian books or documents he researched in the metropolitan archive at Blaj. It is possible that the work inspired Zenovie P√¢cli»ôanu, whose later history of the church features a similar structure.Ni»õƒÉ, pp. 331-32 His study of Micu-Klein, which also touched on Petru Pavel Aron and Dionisije Novakoviƒá, delved into the problems of the 18th century's first half, reconstructing the facts based on numerous sources collected from Transylvanian and foreign archives. It appears that Bunea began preparation as early as 1894, when he received several copies of documents from the Vienna imperial court's archive. The book demonstrates thorough research on the social, political and cultural history of the Romanians in that era. Later exegeses by P√¢cli»ôanu, I. T√≥th Zolt√°n and David Prodan used it as a basis for further research into contemporary Romanian life in Transylvania.Ni»õƒÉ, p. 332 =Church historian and polemicist= The 1902 Istoria rom√¢nilor transilvƒÉneni de la 1751 p√¢nƒÉ la 1764 is similarly ample in depth. The preface speaks of the author's purpose: to advance the community's national development and to present his own concept of history. It deals with the figure of Aron; the question of Romanian religious movements, which is allocated considerable space; the organization of his church and of the Romanian Orthodox Church; the founding and development of Blaj's schools; the history of Transylvanian monasteries; the evolution of printing among the province's Romanians; and the political, economic and social situation of the peasantry. He pinpoints two important processes that took place in the history of Transylvanian Romanians during the period analyzed: their confessional disunity and the founding of the Blaj schools. While he opined that the first was in the interests of their neighboring political adversaries, he saw the second as elevating Micu-Klein above all other Romanians of the period. The book is based mainly on unpublished documents gathered from institutional archives in Blaj, Sibiu, FƒÉgƒÉra»ô, Vienna, Budapest and Rome, as well as from a few private individuals in Transylvania and the Romanian Old Kingdom. Some 250 documents were reproduced in the footnotes and appendices. He also used texts published by Timotei Cipariu, Iorga and Sterie Stinghe. During the interwar period, the topics broached by Bunea were taken up by the Cluj historical school. Subsequently, Bunea became more interested in the history of the Orthodox Church in Transylvania, its origins, organizational and institutional evolution. A first work in this direction, published in 1902, was Vechile episcopii rom√¢nesci a Vadului, Geoagiului, Silva»ôului »ôi Bƒïlgradului. The following year, he amplified and corrected certain conclusions in Istoria autonomiei biserice»ôti, where he frequently cited Cipariu, George Bari»õ, Eudoxiu Hurmuzachi and Nikolaus Nilles. His next two books dealt with similar issues, and were written in response to polemics by contemporary Orthodox writers. Ierarhia rom√¢nilor din Ardeal »ôi Ungaria (1904) is Bunea's reply to Teodor PƒÉcƒÉ»õian's Istoriografi vechi, istoriografi noi. Studiu critic √Æn chestia vechei mitropolii rom√¢ne.Ni»õƒÉ, pp. 332-33 The latter work, a response to Vechile episcopii rom√¢nesci, attempted to demonstrate the existence of a Romanian Orthodox metropolis in medieval Transylvania. Bunea, analyzing the church's institutional organization, reiterated that there was no documentary evidence of such an organization. The book displays a biting critique of PƒÉcƒÉ»õian's way of writing history. It also elucidates his theory and approach to the practice: his knowledge of Latin, Hungarian and German allowed Bunea to use valuable historical information in order to complete what he found in Romanian sources, and to broaden his horizon when understanding the historical facts of the region. This made him an authority in debates on ecclesiastical history the western part of the Romanian-speaking lands. The second book, also a polemic, was the 1906 Mitropolitul Sava Brancovici. In his previous work, Bunea had already presented data about the life and activity of Sava Brankoviƒá. The new text featured a detailed analysis of a book with the same title by Vasile Mangra and reached contrasting conclusions about Brankoviƒá's place in church history. As with PƒÉcƒÉ»õian, Bunea questioned Mangra's competence as a historian.Ni»õƒÉ, p. 333 =Late contributions= Bunea's final studies, which have to do with medieval Romanian history, were left incomplete at the time of his death. At the Romanian Academy's request, they were published posthumously as StƒÉp√¢nii »öƒÉrii Oltului, which he had prepared as his maiden speech to the Academy; and √éncercare de istoria Rom√¢nilor p√¢nƒÉ la 1382. He chose to analyze the historic importance of »öara Oltului (another name for »öara FƒÉgƒÉra»ôului) because of its role in the origins of the foundation of Wallachia and the consolidation of the Romanian element through longstanding ties with the latter region. The theme also had an emotional resonance: as Bianu inferred, it represented \\"the country of his parents and his birth\\". The work comprises a succinct political history of the area from the 9th through the 18th centuries, describing its status and leaders, specifying the political implications of leadership for each of them. Beginning with the year 895, the author highlights the arrival of the Magyars in Pannonia and especially Transylvania; fixes the geographic limits of »öara Oltului; specifies its Romanian character, drawing on toponymy and the first Hungarian documents; credits the tradition that Radu Negru of FƒÉgƒÉra»ô was responsible for the foundation, which took place at C√¢mpulung and Curtea de Arge»ô; presents historical information about the region and its Romanian inhabitants over the course of the 13th century and into the first half of the 14th; details offensives launched by the Kingdom of Hungary to the east and south of the Carpathian Mountains during the same period; enumerates nine Romanian lords who possessed »öara Oltului, from Vladislav I to Vlad III; summarized their political relations with the suzerain power; listed the leaders from Vlad to Sigismund B√°thory; noted the role of the Romanian Mailat family, and the political implications of controlling the region; briefly listed its property owners from the 17th century, drawing on fiscal records; and ended with 1713, when the FƒÉgƒÉra»ô domain passed to the state. Bunea deliberately focuses on the intervals of Romanian domination. He speaks appreciatively of the historiographic achievements of Iorga, Onciul and J√°nos Kar√°csonyi; the text follows the direction set by the leading members of the Romanian critical school, Iorga, Onciul and Ioan Bogdan. However, at times, he expresses disagreement with other historians' opinions, advancing his own historiographic solutions in the same context.Ni»õƒÉ, pp. 333-34 He insistently draws upon the document collections of Hurmuzachi; and among Hungarian historians, he prefers Kar√°csonyi, Frigyes Pesty and Gyula Pauler. An abundantly documented work, its bibliography features over 80 titles in Romanian, Hungarian, German and Latin; there are 225 footnotes, some shorter, others lengthy. As to √éncercare de istoria...., the manuscript was analyzed by Onciul at the Academy's request. He found that the contents mainly dealt with church history and, tangentially, with political history and ethnography. Although it remained unfinished, Onciul recommended publication, both in order to make Bunea's findings known and as an homage. He also began a vast work about the Romanian regiments in the Transylvanian Military Frontier. Although he did not live to complete it, he did gather rich material on the subject. His archive includes numerous documents, both copies and originals, in Latin, Hungarian and German, about the border regiments.

Detainees in Angel Island turned to silent protests by writing poetry, often bitter and angry in nature, on the walls.Morris, Young. \\"Across Time And Space: The Transnational Movement Of Asian American Rhetoric.\\" Composition Studies 44.1 (2016): 131-133.

Academic Search Complete. Web. 24 November 2016. = Mass organizing = In the late 1960s, Asian Americans first began to organize on a large scale, resulting in the Asian American movement, a pan-Asian movement that lasted until the 1980s. The movement aimed to combat Asian Americans' shared oppression and race-based violence. The Asian American movement arose spontaneously all over the United States, often having different perspectives. In the San Francisco Bay Area, activists from college campuses such as the University of California, Berkeley and San Francisco State University protested the absence of Asian American experiences from university curricula. Activists focused on a variety of issues, including improving the conditions of San Francisco's Chinatown, participating in Third World Liberation Front strikes, and protesting the eviction of Filipino and Filipina residents from the International Hotel (San Francisco). Meanwhile, in New York City and on the East Coast, two nisei women protested the absence of a Japanese American community. In the Midwest, college students of Asian descent organized communities of support, and many eventually migrated to coastal cities that had stronger Asian communities.Wei, William. The Asian American Movement. [Electronic Resource]. n.p.: Philadelphia : Temple University Press, 1993. (Baltimore, Md.: Project MUSE, 2014), 1993. OskiCat. Web. 24 November 2016. Asian American college students nationwide also protested the model minority framework that many Americans had used to view Asians. Opponents of this framework considered it a myth that denied the challenges faced by Asian Americans in a white-dominated society.Nguyen, Thai-Huy1, and Marybeth1 Gasman. \\"Activism, Identity and Service: The Influence of the Asian American Movement on the Educational Experiences of College Students.\\" History of Education44.3 (2015): 339-54.

The Asian American movement is thought to have reached a high point after the 1982 murder of Vincent Chin, an employee of a Detroit engineering firm who was beaten to death by Ronald Ebens. Ebens had strong anti-Asian motives for committing the crime ‚Äì he believed Chin was Japanese and partly responsible for the decline of the U.S. automotive industry.Darden, Joe T, and Richard W Thomas. \\"Chapter 7.

Vincent Chin's murder and the resulting trials throughout the 1980s helped form a truly Asian American movement.  Notable Asian American activist movements  Asian Americans have participated in a variety of movements and protests, including: * The Asian American movement from the 1960s to the 1980s, including the 1982 murder of Vincent Chin * 2001-2003 protests against the Patriot Act, NSEERS, and anti-Muslim policies after the September 11 attacks * The 2014 Shooting of Akai Gurley * The 2015 Federal Complaints Against Harvard University's Alleged Discriminatory Admission PracticeMorris, Catherine. \\"Asian American Groups File Federal Complaint Against Harvard.\\" Diverse: Issues in Higher Education 32.9 (2015): 8.

Their objective is to stand in solidarity with people of color and to mainly support Black communities facing racial injustice. Their mission is built on the Ferguson National Demands, which call for the elimination of discrimination and police brutality and support in employment and housing for oppressed people in the US. These demands also address the school to prison pipeline: mass incarceration of people of color, and other demands regarding racial issues plaguing the American society. Asians 4 Black Lives focuses primarily on supporting the issues within African American communities as they believe that finding justice for this community is the foundation that liberation for other minority groups can be built upon. Their activism includes blockading Home Depot in response to the Emeryville Police Department‚Äôs murder of Yuvette Henderson, and protesting in front of the Oakland Federal Building and the Oakland Police Department. They have also initiated action to build houses for impoverished people. In addition, they are involved in the work of groups such as the Blackout Collective, #BlackBrunch, and Onyx Organizing Committee among many others. Asians 4 Black Lives is also working with Letters for Black Lives in a combined effort to root out ‚Äúanti-blackness‚Äù (the notion that African Americans are inferior) in communities. Its goal is to encourage discussion between older and younger generations about issues regarding racism and discrimination.  Participation in social media  Since many Asian Americans are immigrants from Asia or have family living in Asia, it is more common for activists to use foreign social media platforms such as China's WeChat and Weibo, Korea's KakaoTalk, and Japan's LINE and Mixi, rather than American platforms such as Facebook and Twitter to engage in discussions and organize protests.Xu, Qiong, and Richard Mocarski. \\"A Cross-Cultural Comparison of Domestic American and International Chinese Students' Social Media Usage.\\" Journal of International Students 4.4 (2014): 374-88.ERIC.

Reception Bloody Vampire received mixed reviews, currently sitting at 65/100 on Metacritic. Nintendo Life scored it 7/10, saying, \\"Bloody Vampire is a bit rough around the edges, and it's far from original, but it combines its sleeve-borne influences into a stylised package that's a lot of fun\\"; however, it expressed reservation over the \\"designated save spots and the absence of a map\\".

Description The bearded, blue character was introduced in a video hosted on the website Odnarotoop.com, which was created by Travel Portland in 2016 as part of a campaign called the \\"World of Odnarotoop\\". The campaign's name comes from the Japanese pronunciation of Portland, spelled backwards. The video's theme song is performed by the Portland-based rock band Ages and Ages in Japanese, with some English words and phrases such as \\"breakfast\\", \\"crazy donuts\\", and \\"ice cream\\".

Let's take a picture to start the trip.\\" He also instructs users to upload their pictures, which are integrated into the music video. The mascot was inspired by \\"the joy and lightheartedness that the city embodies\\" and Sasquatch (or Bigfoot). Some Reddit users speculated that Mr. Dude was derived from a Portland man who is often seen wearing blue makeup, though a Travel Portland representative has denied that the mascot was based on any particular individual.

He is currently a goalkeeper coach for French club Paris Saint-Germain under Thomas Tuchel and the Italy national football team. Coaching career Spinelli began his career as a goalkeeper coach at local team Como in 2002; as a player, he had previously served as a reserve goalkeeper for the club behind Alex Brunner, and helped the team achieve promotion to Serie A in 2002, starting in his side's decisive 2‚Äì0 home win over Empoli at the Stadio Giuseppe Sinigaglia, and keeping a clean sheet. After spending two years with the Lariani, he was picked up by Serie A team Genoa C.F.C.. He spent 12 years at Genoa, serving under 16 managers, and coaching several goalkeepers (in particular Mattia Perin), and helping lead the club out of the Serie C, (Now Lega Pro) to the top flight; during his time with the club, he earned a reputation as one of the best goalkeeping coaches in Italy. From 2014 Spinelli joined manager Antonio Conte as part of the coaching staff of the Italy national football team, maintaining the dual role of goalkeeping coach for both Genoa and Italy. After Italy's 6‚Äì5 penalty shootout loss to Germany in the Euro 2016 quarter-finals, Spinelli followed Conte to English club Chelsea. He held the dual role of goalkeeping coach for both the Italy national football team and Chelsea. During the 2016‚Äì17 Premier League season, Chelsea's starting goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois praised Spinelli's abilities as a goalkeeping coach, and has credited Spinelli for helping him to improve his overall game and technique, in particular his foot- work and diving, which enabled him to be more explosive and get to ground more quickly. The team's back-up goalkeeper, Asmir Begoviƒá, also praised Spinelli throughout the season, commenting: \\"He came in with a big reputation, we had heard a lot of great things about him and the work he did in Italy, especially with the national team during all those years at Genoa. I was excited to work for him and it's been a pleasure since day one. He's a really good guy, he creates a great atmosphere, and he really knows what he is talking about.\\" Chelsea finished the season as Premier League Champions. The following season, Chelsea won the FA Cup.

The episode was written by executive producer Ken Woodruff and directed by Danny Cannon. It was broadcast on September 26, 2016. In the episode, Bruce comes face to face with the council that wanted him dead. Gordon teams up with Valerie Vale to find Fish Mooney, who is going on a rampage to find the place where Dr. Hugo Strange is held. Meanwhile, Ivy Pepper undergoes into a physical change after the contact with Indian Hills' monster. The episode marks the introduction of Maggie Geha to the series and is credited as a main cast member. The episode received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised the character development but criticized the tone and the attack in the mansion. Plot Bruce (David Mazouz) is brought by Talon to the council's room, meeting the White-Haired Woman (Leslie Hendrix), a woman named Kathryn. Bruce instantly recognizes her as he saw her on Wayne Enterprises events. Kathryn begins to state that their organization controls Wayne Enterprises but Bruce threatens to reveal to the government their involvement and their exposure to the world if he dies. Kathryn is not afraid of the comments and in order to live, she tells him that he needs to stop investigating the council and his parents' murders. He agrees and is then sedated by Talon. Valerie (Jamie Chung) visits Gordon (Benjamin McKenzie), proposing that they cooperate to find Fish Mooney (Jada Pinkett Smith). Wanting to find Mooney's location, they go with Barbara (Erin Richards) to find her location but she wants Gordon to give her a kiss and leave. This causes Barbara to give the location and tells Gordon of a dream she had where he had an accident, losing his legs and pushing him around a giant babycarriage. In a shore, Ivy is revealed to be alive and also discovers that her physical body has changed into an older version (Maggie Geha). She is found by a man named Nick (Nicholas Calhoun) and taken to his home for care. The GCPD arrives at a building where Mooney and her gang are squatting. The monsters manage to hold back the police and Mooney and her gang escape. Cobblepot (Robin Lord Taylor) holds a press conference where he criticizes the GCPD and their failure in catching the monsters, earning him popularity with the public. Talon brings Bruce back to Wayne Manor, where he tells Alfred (Sean Pertwee) that the council spared him as long as he stops the investigation. Fox (Chris Chalk) shows Gordon the body of Peabody and they deduce that she was killed because she couldn't \\"fix\\" Mooney and the only other person who could do it is Hugo Strange (B. D. Wong). Bullock (Donal Logue) is abducted by Mooney, leaving his badge behind. She wants him to reveal Strange's location but he refuses, forcing her to seduce him with her powers and a kiss to reveal the location. Gordon and Fox inform Barnes (Michael Chiklis) about her next move and he reveals that Strange is being held in an abandoned mansion turned into a research facility out of Gotham City. Mooney, her gang and Bullock arrive at the facility, kill the officers and find Strange in a high-security glass cell. While the GCPD surrounds the mansion, Cobblepot and Butch (Drew Powell) lead a horde of people to the mansion, planning on killing the monsters. Gordon sneaks inside and is caught by the monsters and brought to Mooney. He manages to make a deal and spares Bullock's life by helping her escape through the backside. Before the escape, Gordon calls Cobblepot, telling him about Mooney's location and that he needs to send the people through the entrance. Cobblepot agrees and sends the people to burst in the building, killing two of Mooney's gang while everyone escapes. Cobblepot corners Mooney and Strange in the woods, demanding to know why she spared his life. She explains that the best thing she has done was making him into the \\"Penguin\\" and she \\"couldn't destroy that\\". With this confession, he decides to let them go, before warning Mooney to never come back. The mob takes out the corpses of the monsters and cheerfully burn them in a fire outside the mansion and hail Cobblepot for his successful effort in stopping them. Ivy knocks out Nick with a plant pot when he decides to throw it out, leaving in a green dress. In Wayne Manor, Bruce and Alfred hear a noise in the study and find Bruce's doppelganger sneaking in, to their shock. Valerie visits Gordon again and begins to deduce what happened in the woods, which culminates in a kiss. At the train station, Lee (Morena Baccarin) is revealed to have arrived at Gotham starting a new life. Production =Development= On June 2016, Drew Powell revealed on a tweet that the second episode of the season will be titled \\"Burn the Witch\\" and was to be directed by Danny Cannon and written by executive producer Ken Woodruff. =Casting= On June 13, 2016, it was revealed that Ivy Pepper's character would be promoted to main cast member and the actress would be recast with an older actress. On June 22, 2016, Maggie Geha was cast in the new version, is \\"due to a brush with one of Hugo Strange's creatures, last seen escaping into the Gotham night at the end of Season 2.\\" John Stephens spoke about this, \\"The mentality of the Ivy we have in our world is not the same as the Ivy who exists in the canon. She's a bit more of a loose cannon. And so she goes and creates a great deal of havoc in our world. And because she is still a 14-year-old, 15-year-old street teenager in the body of a 25-year-old woman, she doesn't know how to act in the world yet, and so she has to fumble her way about.\\" Camren Bicondova, Cory Michael Smith and Jessica Lucas don't appear in the episode as their respective characters. In September 2016, it was announced that the guest cast for the episode would include Jada Pinkett Smith as Fish Mooney, B. D. Wong as Hugo Strange, Jamie Chung as Valerie Vale, Nicholas Calhoun as Nick, and Leslie Hendrix as Kathryn. Reception =Viewers= The episode was watched by 3.54 million viewers with a 1.2/4 share among adults aged 18 to 49, a new series low. This was a 10% decrease in viewership from the previous episode, which was watched by 3.90 million viewers with a 1.3/4 in the 18-49 demographics. With this rating, Gotham ranked second for FOX, behind a presidential debate. The episode ranked as the 54th most watched show on the week. With Live+7 DVR viewing factored in, the episode had an overall rating of 5.92 million viewers, and a 2.2 in the 18‚Äì49 demographic. =Critical reviews= \\"Mad City: Burn the Witch\\" received generally positive reviews from critics. The episode received a rating of 73% with an average score of 6.7 out of 10 on the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes with the consensus stating: \\"'Burn the Witch' functions as a transitional episode - introducing an iconic villain, tying up some loose threads from last season, and laying the groundwork for intriguing new plot and character arcs for season 3\\". Matt Fowler of IGN gave the episode a \\"good\\" 7.0 out of 10 and wrote in his verdict, \\"When I talk about enjoying Gordon's time away from the GCPD, I'm half-joking. I'm just going with the flow here, and the flow is that Gordon is, at best, an irresponsible mess. In 'Burn the Witch,' he made one of the most boneheaded calls on the show so far when he triggered the angry mob so that he could save himself and Harvey. A good friend, sure, but Jim's not exactly the embodiment of justice we've come to expect from the character. At least it was good to see Strange return. And yes, I did kind of like seeing Penguin spare Fish's life. It at least showed us that he's more honorable than Jim (though we knew that).\\" Erik Kain of Forbes wrote, \\"All told, another solid episode of Gotham. Still lots and lots of plot to juggle. Hopefully the writers and showrunners are up for the challenge and can skillfully weave it all together and resolve everything. We still don‚Äôt have an established Big Bad this season, which is odd. And like I said up above, there's little indication of where everything is headed exactly.\\" Nick Hogan of TV Overmind gave the series a star rating of 4.5 out of 5, writing \\"Overall, I'm extremely impressed with the direction of these first few episodes, and especially 'Burn the Witch'. It was a well executed, well acted episode and I thoroughly enjoyed it.\\" Sage Young of EW stated: \\"They don't call it the 'mad city' for nothing. Questions of sanity still abound in Gotham. Questions such as: Why did the Court of Owls chloroform Bruce and kidnap him to a meeting he himself requested? For the aesthetics of it all, probably.\\" Lisa Babick from TV Fanatic, gave a 4.0 star rating out of 5.0, stating: \\"Whatever is going on, I think Bruce's story going to be the most interesting of the season. And, it's about time.\\" Vinnie Mancuso of The New York Observer wrote, \\"So I have a lot of questions about this particular episode of Gotham, most of which revolve around the show aging up Ivy Pepper via sewer magic, I assume because someone finally cracked open a comic book and said 'Wait THAT's Poison Ivy‚Äôs super power?? Oh, boy. Oh, no.' But since Ivy and her newfound rosebuds constituted roughly 10 percent of the whole hour, we'll save that conversation for later.\\" MaryAnn Sleasman of TV.com questioned the episode and Ivy's recast, stating \\"It's clear that Gotham ultimately determined it simply didn't know what to do with Ivy in the context that it created for her. We've seen her flunk out of the system with Selina, take on a stint growing magic mushrooms, and generally just hovering in the background with that frown on her face and not much else going for her. I just don't know if this recast was the answer.\\" Robert Yaniz, Jr. of ScreenRant wrote, \\"Even though Ivy is all evil and wearing a more pronounced shade of green than ever before (maybe she can give Nygma some fashion tips?), she doesn't appear to have developed her poisonous powers just yet. Sure, she's already fighting for the plant world, but we can only speculate how long Gotham will wait to unleash her own abilities. More importantly, now that Poison Ivy is finally starting to become a thing, the clock is ticking until Ivy's comic book love interest Harley Quinn makes her 'official' debut.\\" Kayti Burt of Den of Geek gave the episode a 2 star rating out of 5 and wrote, \\"Whatever the answers to these question, I have to admit that this doppelganger storyline is definitely not heading in the direction I thought it would. Not that it's heading in any direction at all, really, at this point. Hopefully, the Doppel-Bruce's collision with the Original-Bruce storyline will move things along. Your move, Master Bruce.\\" References  External links  * * Category:Gotham (season 3) episodes Category:2016 American television episodes ","title":"Burn the Witch (Gotham)"},{"id":"51775653","text":"Fawn is an unincorporated community in Dent County, in the U.S. state of Missouri.

The complex includes two early 19th-century stone warehouses, a former Lake Champlain ferry landing site (used until 1975), and the foundational remains of the Chipman Point Hotel. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996. Description and history Chipman's Point is located on the eastern shore of Lake Champlain, in its narrow southern reach opposite Wright, New York. Chipman Point Road leads to the area from Vermont Route 73A, and ends at a former ferry landing slip, now used as a local boat launch and fishing site. To the south of the landing, in an area now occupied by a local marina, stand two large four-story stone warehouses, built on limestone outcrops directly on the lakeshore. On a terraced rise above the two warehouses are the foundational remnants of the Chipman Point Hotel. The warehouses and hotel ruins are composed mainly of local limestone, which probably came from quarry sites on nearby stone outcrops. At the middle of the 19th century, Chipman's Point was one of Orwell's largest and busiest economic and commercial centers, with a church, post office, hotel, and residences, all oriented toward the ferry and shipping business. The warehouses were built to store goods awaiting passage by ship or to be picked up for local delivery, and the hotel (which burned in 1952) served travelers. The importance of the lake for transportation declined after the arrival of the railroad in the region in 1849, and even the ferry service across the lake was discontinued in 1975. with See also *National Register of Historic Places listings in Addison County, Vermont References Category:Commercial buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in Vermont Category:National Register of Historic Places in Addison County, Vermont Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1810 Category:Buildings and structures in Orwell, Vermont ","title":"Chipman's Point"},{"id":"51775774","text":"The 1980 Bowling Green Falcons football team was an American football team that represented Bowling Green University in the Mid-American Conference (MAC) during the 1980 NCAA Division I-A football season.

Background The Sturgis Dam was the first municipal water power plant built in Michigan. It is currently named after the city who owns it and paid for its construction. The dam is about away from the city of Sturgis which owns and operates the plant. The citizens of Sturgis passed a bond for a cost of $190,000 (equivalent to $ in ) for the construction of the dam by a vote of 779 to 47. Construction for the dam started in 1909 and the dam started producing power on September 3, 1911. Today the plant produces less than 4% of the cities electrical needs. It has been estimated that the cities operation of the plant has saved them $56.6 million by not having to buy power from Indiana Michigan Power. History When the dam was being voted on local municipalities had just been given the right to use eminent domain for construction of projects like this. However, the use of eminent domain was not used to secure the necessary right. At the time there were no other dams upstream of the Sturgis Dam. The original design of the dam had four floors in the powerhouse. When first constructed, there was the 2,300-volt oil switches and 23,000-volt lightning arresters on the switchroom floor. The lowest floor held six 200-kW oil-cooled transformers. The original transmission line out was a three-phase line of No. 4 B & S hard drawn copper. The bond that was approved was for $175,000 however the cost came to $250,000. When the dam was constructed it caused the Langley Covered Bridge to be raised . The general contractor for the spillway and powerhouse was Carpenter & Anderson of Allis-Chalmers. The entire engineering work including preliminary surveys, and estimates was under the supervision of Gardner S. Williams of M. Am. Soc. C.E. Consulting engineer. In 1930s the St. Joseph County Fish and Game Commission built two fish hatching ponds to stock the river. However, those ponds are now gone and overgrown. In 1982 a second powerhouse was added with two Allis-Chalmers horizontal tube units. During the 2011 Dam Days celebration a large boulder and plaque were placed on the grounds recognizing the dams centennial year of operation. Operation This hydro-electric dam is capable of producing 2,600 kilowatts. The original two Allis-Chalmers Vertical Shaft units produce 550 kilowatts each for a total of 1,100 kilowatts. The 1982 second powerhouse and two new units allow for an additional 750 kilowatts each, providing another 1,500 kilowatts. There are 33 gates that hold back the St. Joseph River and creating the Sturgis Reservoir. In July 2016, the City of Sturgis notified residents and land owners along the river that would be doing an emergency drawdown of the Sturgis Reservoir to make emergency repairs to the earth embankment of the dam. To perform the repairs the reservoir was drawn down . The emergency drawdown of the reservoir in the middle of a heat wave caused concern from local farms that irrigation intakes were now left above the water line of the river.

This includes everything from primitive algorithms that stop a robot when it approaches an obstacle to more complex algorithms that continuously takes in information from the surroundings and creates a plan to avoid obstacles. These methods are different from something like a Roomba robot vacuum as the Roomba may be able to adapt to dynamic obstacles but it does not have a set target. A better example would be Embark self-driving semi-trucks that have a set target location and can also adapt to changing environments. The targets of path planning algorithms are not limited to locations alone. Path planning methods can also create plans for stationary robots to change their poses. An example of this can be seen in various robotic arms, where path planning allows the robotic system to change its pose without colliding with itself. As a subset of motion planning, it is an important part of robotics as it allows robots to find the optimal path to a target. This ability to find an optimal path also plays an important role in other fields such as video games and gene sequencing.  Concepts  In order to create a path from a target point to a goal point there must be classifications about the various areas within the simulated environment. This allows a path to be created in a 2D or 3D space where the robot can avoid obstacles. = Work Space = The work space is an environment that contains the robot and various obstacles. This environment can be either 2-dimensional or 3-dimensional. = Configuration Space = The configuration of a robot is determined by its current position and pose. The configuration space is the set of all configurations of the robot. By containing all the possible configurations of the robot, it also represents all transformations that can be applied to the robot. Within the configuration sets there are additional sets of configurations that are classified by the various algorithms.  Free Space  The free space is the set of all configurations within the configuration space that does not collide with obstacles.  Target Space  The target space is the configuration that we want the robot to accomplish.  Obstacle Space  The obstacle space is the set of configurations within the configuration space where the robot is unable to move to.  Danger Space  The danger space is the set of configurations where the robot can move through but does not want to. Oftentimes robots will try to avoid these configurations unless they have no other valid path or are under a time restraint. For example a robot would not want to move through a fire unless there were no other valid paths to the target space.  Methods  = Global = Global path planning refers to methods that require prior knowledge of the robot's environment. Using this knowledge it creates a simulated environment where the methods can plan a path.  Rapidly Exploring Random Tree (RRT)  The rapidly exploring random tree method works by running through all possible translations from a specific configuration . By running through all possible series of translations a path is created for the robot to reach the target from the starting configuration. = Local = Local path planning refers to methods that take in information from the surroundings in order to generate a simulated field where a path can be found. This allows a path to be found in the real-time as well as adapt to dynamic obstacles.  Probabilistic Roadmap (PRM)  The probabilistic roadmap method connects nearby configurations in order to determine a path that goes from the starting to target configuration. The method is split into two different parts: preprocessing phase and query phase. In the preprocessing phase, algorithms evaluate various motions to see if they are located in free space. Then in the query phase, the algorithms connects the starting and target configurations through a variety of paths. After creating the paths, it uses Dijkstra's shortest path query to find the optimal path.  Evolutionary Artificial Potential Field (EAPF)  The evolutionary artificial potential field method uses a mix of artificial repulsive and attractive forces in order to plan a path for the robot. The attractive forces originate from the target which leads the path to the target in the end. The repulsive forces come from the various obstacles the robot will come across. Using this mix of attractive and repulsive forces, algorithms can find the optimal path.  Indicative Route Method (IRM)  The indicative route method uses a control path towards the target and an attraction point located at the target. Algorithms are often used to find the control path, which is oftentimes the path with the shortest minimum-clearance path. As the robot stays on the control path the attraction point on the target configuration leads the robot towards the target.  Modified Indicative Routes and Navigation (MIRAN)  The modified indicative routes and navigation method gives various weights to different paths the robot can take from its current position. For example a rock would be given a high weight such as 50 while an open path would be given a lower weight such as 2. This creates a variety of weighted regions in the environment which allows the robot to decide on a path towards the target.  Applications  = Humanoid Robots = For many robots the number of degrees of freedom is no greater than three. Humanoid robots on the other hand have a similar number of degrees of freedom to a human body which increases the complexity of path planning. For example a single leg of a humanoid robot can have around 12 degrees of freedom. The increased complexity comes from the greater possibility of the robot colliding with itself. Real-time path planning is important for the motion of humanoid robots as it allows various parts of the robot to move at the same time while avoiding collisions with the other parts of the robot. For example, if we were to look at our own arms we can see that our hands can touch our shoulders. For a robotic arm this may pose a risk if the parts of the arms were to collide unintentionally with each other. This is why path planning algorithms are needed to prevent these accidental collisions. = Self-Driving Vehicles = Self-driving vehicles are a form of mobile robots that utilizes real-time path planning. Oftentimes a vehicle will first use global path planning to decide which roads to take to the target. When these vehicles are on the road they have to constantly adapt to the changing environment. This is where local path planning methods allow the vehicle to plan a safe and fast path to the target location. An example of this would be the Embark self-driving semi-trucks, which uses an array of sensors to take in information about their environment. The truck will have a predetermined target location and will use global path planning to have a path to the target. While the truck is on the road it will use its sensors alongside local path planning methods to navigate around obstacles to safely reach the target location. = Video Games = Oftentimes in video games there are a variety of non-player characters that are moving around the game which requires path planning. These characters must have paths planned for them as they need to know where to move to and how to move there. For example, in the game Minecraft there are hostile mobs that track and follow the player in order to kill the player. This requires real-time path planning as the mob must avoid various obstacles while following the player. Even if the player were to add additional obstacles in the way of the mob, the mob would change its path to still reach the player.

Web. Street art in San Francisco is considered controversial because it vandalizes public spaces, while also providing art that people like to look at. On one hand the art that created vandalizes public property but on the other hand it is creating something for tourists and people in general to look at in their daily lives. Another main controversy is that most street artists do not get the punishment that is stated in California law for vandalizing public property. Street art is illegal and the law enforcement agency in this area has been strictly implementing laws against street art to prevent further damage to city property.  History  Graffiti began in the Bay Area around the early 1980s. It began as a means of expression for young children in this area. This changed when paint became illegal for anyone under 18 to buy. People began to get into street art later in life and art became more developed.KQED Art School (2014-03-30), Bay Area Graffiti: The Early Years  KQED Arts, retrieved 2016-11-17 When graffiti started it was generally neighborhood or gang related. Around the mid-1980s graffiti became about placing one's signature everywhere they possibly could. Everyone had a unique tag and would be able to differentiate whose was whose. Artists from New York and other areas came to the Bay Area and developed the Bay Area's style. The Hip Hop movement further developed the street art culture as well. Eventually these individual graffiti artists got together and formed separate crews. Around the time that crews began to form street art developed dramatically. The art went from simple name scribbles to bigger more colorful pieces of art. Street art from here on out slowly developed through different big movements in this area. Separations between different graffiti crews caused people to create new forms of graffiti. There are many places in the Bay Area that were designated as very big places for artists to showcase their work. = Movements = Early 1980s  Initially graffiti was limited to tagging, and the main point at this time was to write your tag in as many places as possible. People developed their tags in different ways, and the majority of people dedicated their lives to painting this tag. At this time major pictures and big pieces were not important but rather getting a signature on the wall. At this time graffiti artists consisted of young kids and adults who were able to buy or steal spray paint.  The Mission District  This movement began in the 1990s, started by San Francisco art students who made their art in public places. The Mission School was a graffiti movement that developed for these students to get recognition for their work. The Mission District in San Francisco has developed into one of the most well known places for street art. The art in this area developed simple graffiti into more accepted and appreciated art. A major work in the Mission District is the mural on the Women's Building. This is a central piece of the area and attracts many tourists. The mural captures much of San Francisco's ideals, with the different women painted on the building and the diversity it represents. The mural was painted by a group of women, including a few former members of the all-female muralist group, the Mujeres Muralistas. The Mission District is home to many different alleys and walls of murals. The street art in this area tends to be bigger pictures rather than small tags and is more widely accepted because of the visual appeal of the pieces.\\"San Francisco Mural Arts  Mission\\". www.sfmuralarts.com. Retrieved 2016-11-26.  Public opinion  Although street art is illegal, it covers the streets of the Bay Area.

Many tourist spots in the city are graffiti centered areas where people take pictures by these pieces of street art.Douglas Mahoney . \\"The Pioneer : Graffiti: Street Art and Public Menace\\". thepioneeronline.com. Retrieved 2016-11-17. The acceptability of street art varies throughout the Bay Area. In bigger cities such as San Francisco, Oakland, and Berkeley it is more widely accepted than the smaller suburbs of the Bay Area. Street art in this area is used mainly as a form of communication between the kinds of people creating this art. Therefore, it is more accepted where these people are present.  Artists  One of the most well known Bay Area street artists is Riff. In the early 1980s Riff began tagging, causing more and more people to tags in the Bay Area. TMF is one of the best-known crews from the Bay Area. Their focus was to develop from the tag to a fuller piece of art. They used more color than any artist had before them. Their graffiti began a separation in graffiti art. TWS began the new San Francisco art scene. A little bit after TWS and TMF began their separate styles an artist named DREAM came along. DREAM created art that made people think about their styles and he died in the middle of his fame and from this so many people were inspired to create pieces to commemorate him. These pieces challenged the graffiti style at that time and furthered the works of many people. Graffiti was about \\"leaving tags on the blank canvas of a building was a way to mark territory in a city where he often felt marginalized\\" to these artists. It was more important than just putting their name on the wall to these artists but rather a way to feel accepted somewhere they often felt like they weren't. = Issues between artists = Early in Bay Area Graffiti there were problems that arose between two major graffiti art crews, TWS and TMF, who had different styles. Since the styles of the groups were so different people chose one or other to support, and as soon as one put up a new piece the supporters of the other crew would cover it with simple tags. For a while the division occurred before artists like DREAM brought them back together. DREAM made art that unified all street artists and eased disputes such as that between TWS and TMF. The Graffiti war in the Bay Area is between taggers and picture artists. Taggers are covering more modern art pieces on the streets and creating a war between these two groups.Ehrilic, Richard. \\"San Francisco's Graffiti War.\\" CNN. Cable News Network, 3 Sept. 2014.

It is a Chinese Indonesian classic, due to its simplicity and popularity among Chinese Indonesian households. It is also popular among non-Muslim Indonesians, such as the Balinese, Batak and Minahasan, and in the Netherlands, where it is known as babi ketjap, owing to colonial ties with Indonesia. In the Netherlands, the dish might also be served within an opulent rijsttafel banquet. The dish is believed to be based on Southern Chinese braised pork in soy sauce. However, it is more Indonesian in nature, because of the mild sweetness introduced by Indonesian kecap manis (sweet soy sauce). It is sometimes prepared with a sweet chili sauce. In Bali, babi kecap is consumed at festivals such as Galungan and Nyepi. Ingredients Babi kecap with vegetables and rice The basic recipe, commonly used by Chinese Indonesians in their households, usually requires cuts of pork belly simmered with sweet soy sauce, spiced with garlic, shallot or onion, and a dash of salt. The popular recipes employed elsewhere ‚Äî from restaurants in Chinatown in Indonesia, to Bali and the Netherlands, may include additional ingredients, such as lemongrass, ginger, tomato, shrimp paste, salam leaf (Indonesian bay leaf), white pepper and red chilies. If sweet soy sauce is not available, it can be substituted with normal soy sauce mixed with ground palm sugar or brown sugar. The less hot and spicy sweet pepper may be used to replace red chilies. Variations Pork belly is usually the preferred cut of pork meat for babi kecap. However, other cuts of pork meat or offal may also be used in similar soy sauce-based recipes. Derivatives of this recipe which substitute the use of pork belly include sengkel babi kecap, which uses pig trotters, and sekba, which is a Chinese Indonesian pork offal stew that may also include pork liver, nose, tongue, ear, tripe and intestines. Similar dishes It is very similar to another Indonesian favorite called semur daging, although semur is usually made of beef and potatoes with slightly different spices. The chicken variant is called ayam kecap.

History Just Fabritius was born in Copenhagen to German immigrants. His father was a wine merchant. He established his own trading house and had close ties to the state, both under the reign of Christian VI and Frederik V. He participated with great success in the expeditions to China and India which were planned and supported by Bernstorff on behalf of the state. He was one of the founders of Kurantbanken in 1736 and for a while served as its director. He became part of the board of directors of the Danish Africa Company in 1755. He took part in the preparations for the expedition led by Verrayon to the Lavant with the aim of opening a new, lucrative market. The expedition was a failure but Fabritius avoided losses. Fabritius was appointed to Agent in 1743. In 1746, the king gifted him the Christiansholm estate north of Copenhagen. He later established a Calico textile manufactury at the site. He was appointed to Etatsr√•d in 1751. In 1745, he took part in Johan Frederik Classen's development of an establishment of a cannon and munitions factory at Frederiksv√¶rk, contributing mainly with contacts and funding. In 1757, he was sent to Paris to negotiate loans for the Danish state and, in 1760‚Äì61, he negotiated a substantial loan for the Danish state in Genova. Personal life He married Elisabeth Mariane de Bruguier. One of their daughters, Charlotte Fabritius, married Peter van Hemert. Another daughter, Anna Susanne Fabritius (1737-1792), married Johann Schultze. Just Fabritius owned the country house S√∏lyst from 1753 to 1756. He died on 7 May 1766 in Copenhagen and is buried at the Cemetery of Holmen.

Further works have been attributed to the artist but there is no unanimity among art historians about certain attributions. Life The Mourning Madonna c. 1272/75 The anonymous painter probably trained in Assisi around 1255 ‚Äì 1265, where he was likely influenced by the Master of Santa Chiara and the Master of Saint Francis who painted frescoes in the nave of the lower church of San Francesco. Other influences by local artists have also been postulated. The Master of the Franciscan Crucifixes appears to have worked almost exclusively for Franciscan churches and may have been a Franciscan friar. He was also active in the Marches and Emilia-Romagna area. He finally settled in Bologna, where he is known to have executed painted crucifixes but also a fresco in the church of Santo Stefano.

At eight years old, she was sold into slavery by her parents to a rich family in Cairo. Hall was given to the family in order to repay her older sister's debt of about thirty dollars. She worked for Abdel Nasser Eid Youssef and Amal Admed Ewis-Abd El Motelib for two years among other slaves. The family moved to Irvine, California where Hall was forced to live in a small room in the family's garage and do chores for the parents and their three children. A neighbor reported their suspicions to child protective services. In 2002, immigration officers came into her captors' home and took her away. She was put into foster care and lived with three foster families until she was 18. In 2014, she and Lisa Wysocky published Hidden Girl, which detailed her childhood as a slave. She now lives in Banning, California with her boyfriend and four-year-old daughter, advocating against human trafficking by sharing her story of captivity and rescue.  Childhood and family  = Alexandria, Egypt = Born in Alexandria, Egypt, Hall was the seventh child out of eleven children in total. Her two oldest siblings were female twins. Next in line was Hassan, the first brother in the family. After Hassan was another sister, than two brothers. Hall had four younger siblings. Closest in age was a brother, then her sister and another brother. Last was her baby sister, whom Hall had to help her mother birth. She was sold to Abdel Nasser Youssef Ibrahim and Amal Ahmed Ewis-Abd El Motelib by her parents when she was eight years old. It is said that she was sold to repay a debt owed by Hall's oldest sister, Zahra, one of the twins, who had stolen from the Ibrahim family. While speaking at Sam Houston State University, Hall recalls about her home life in Alexandria, \\"we were a very poor family, but it was a happy family and I was okay with it.\\" = Cairo = In describing the family who kidnapped her, Hall says \\"they were a very, very wealthy family‚Ä¶They had five kids, three girls and two boys, twins. They were very powerful people in Egypt.\\" At their home in Cairo, Hall claims her job was to wash dishes, take care of the twin boys, and take orders from Abdel Nasser Youssef Ibrahim and Amal Ahmed Ewis-Abd El Motelib. She recalls among the five to seven other people who worked in the family's home, she was the only child. Hall remained in Cairo, Egypt for almost a year and a half until the father got into trouble with the Egyptian government and decided to move the family to the United States. Hall says that the Ibrahims approached her parents and explained that because Shyima had not yet finished paying off the family's debt, that she would have to move with them to the United States. She recalls her parents promising her that she would only be in the United States for six or seven months. The Ibrahims would smuggle Hall into the United States. She claims that the family coached her on what to say if anyone questioned her passport at the airport. She remembers the last time she saw her parents was when they saw her off at the airport. She flew with a man she had only met once who pretended to be her father. Hall says that in the airport, security did not notice her at all nor did security question the man who posed as her father. = Irvine, California = Shyima Hall arrived in the United States in 2000 stayed for a total of two years under the Ibrahims' captivity. At the Ibrahims' new home in Irvine, California, Shyima was the only slave in charge of the family's large home. Abdel Nasser Youssef Ibrahim and Amal Ahmed Ewis- Abd El Motelib kept her in a room in the garage. Hall says that she had nothing more than a blanket, a bed, and a light in her room. According to Hall, her daily routine consisted of waking up at five in the morning, getting the children ready for school and cleaning the house. Hall recalls trying wash her clothes in the washing machine when Amal Ahmed Ewis-Abd El Motelib forbid her from washing her clothes in the same place as the family because, according to the Ibrahims, she was \\"dirty.\\" Amal Ahmed Ewis-Abd El Motelib even slapped her. In the two years that she lived with the Ibrahims, Hall spoke to her parents twice on the phone. When approached by strangers in public, the Ibrahim's children were taught to say that Hall was a step sister.  Rescue  On April 9, 2002, upon noticing that Hall never left the house or went to school, a neighbor called Child Protective Services. Three days after the tip, the police entered the Ibrahims' home. Hall was taken into the police's custody. Through years of convincing Hall that police would hurt her, Hall was skeptical to speak to them. Hall was placed in a group home in Orange County. A day later, the police called Hall's parents who, Hall claims, said, \\"How dare you to leave these people's home. These are the people that put a roof on top of your head, cared and treated you as part of the family.\\"  Trial and restitutions  Hall's case lasted from 2001 to 2007. It was decided that Hall not be put on the stand. Hall's oldest sister came to testify against Hall with the support of the Ibrahims. The Ibrahims pleaded guilty and were sentenced to time in prison. Amal Ahmed Ewis-Abd El Motelib received twenty-two months in prison and was deported to Egypt while Abdel Nasser Youssef Ibrahim received a sentence of three years in prison. The charges brought against the Ibrahims were keeping a child in involuntary servitude and harboring an alien. Part of the Ibrahims' plea deal entailed that they pay Hall $152,000. Hall's case served as the first federal prosecution case of human trafficking in Orange County.  Foster care  Shyima Hall had lived with a total of three foster families. Her first family, whom she stayed with for three years, was Arab and Muslim and would not allow her to speak English. Hall was then transferred to a second family in San Jose. She was adopted by Chuck and Jenny Hall, her third foster family. All of the money that was paid to Hall in restitutions was stolen by her new family who had access to her bank account.  Activism  On January 21, 2014, Hidden Girl was published by Simon and Schuster. The book was co-authored by Shyima Hall and Lisa Wysocky. Hall's book details her life from before her capture up until obtaining citizenship. Hall has done multiple appearances and talks at high schools and colleges across the United States. She has appeared on a panel to bring awareness for human trafficking for the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.  Current life  Shyima is now United States citizen (as of 2011) and currently lives with her boyfriend, daughter Athena, and son in Banning, California.

(2001). \\"Mather, Arthur\\". The Bibliography of Australian Literature, Vol. 3, pp. 332‚Äì333. University of Queensland Press. It was published from 1948 to 1954, with 64 issues and it also appeared as strips in a number of Australian newspapers. The protagonist, the first to use the name, has no relation to the later American superhero Captain Atom, published by Charlton Comics in 1965 and subsequently by DC Comics in 1987.  Background  The fledgling publishing company Atlas Publications achieved its first major success with its Captain Atom. It was drawn by Arthur Mather, who like Yaroslav Horak and Andrea Bresciani, became a regular artist for Atlas. The character was co- created and written by Jack Bellew under the pen name \\"John Welles\\". The character is based on a combination of Fawcett Publications' Captain Marvel and Quality Comics' Captain Triumph (first published in 1941 and 1943 respectively). The character's origin had identical twin brothers being caught in an atomic bomb blast and becoming fused into one, with Dr. Bikini Rador (a nuclear physicist) being the dominant persona. By shouting the magic word, Exenor!, Rador transforms into his now atomic-powered twin. Rador takes on the identity of Larry Lockhart, an FBI agent, to fight crime, switching places with his brother when situations call for a superhero. The comic was originally published entirely in colour, but Atlas followed its chief rival, K.G. Murray, and switched to black and white two years later when the cost of colour printing became prohibitive. Despite the switch to black and white, the Captain Atom series remained successful, running to 64 issues over the next six years.Burrows, Toby and Stone, Grant (1994).

Early issues featured backup stories provided by Mather (Dopey Dan), Stan Pitt (Jim Atlas, Dr Peril of Igogo) and Michael Trueman (Crackajack ‚Äì Daredevil Trapeze Star). Captain Atom was one of the few original Australian comic heroes to have his own merchandising and fan club. In the 1950s the fan club boasted that it had \\"over 75,000 members\\". The character was revived in 1985 and again in 2016 by Gerald Carr, appearing in Meteor Comics' Vixen.Vixen Magazine. Great Australian Comic Book Creations: \\"Captain Atom\\" Captain Atom, renamed as the Atomic Warrior, featured alongside another 1950s Australian comic book hero, The Panther (created by Paul Wheelahan), and Carr's Vixen and Brainmaster. There is a visual reference to Captain Atom in the Watchmen comic book. In the origin story of Dr Manhattan (who is based on the Charlton Comics Captain Atom), the character is shown rejecting a helmet which is part of his US Government-supplied costume.

Anand Vihar ISBT was built in 1993, but it became fully functional with effect from March 1996. It is spread over an area of approximately 25 acres and operates bus services between Delhi and two other states, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand. Background Delhi has one of India's largest bus transport systems. Buses are the most popular means of transport catering to about 60% of Delhi's total demand. The Kashmere Gate ISBT, opened in 1976 was the only ISBT in Delhi till 1993 when it was transferred to the Transport Department of Government of Delhi. In order to decongest the Overcrowded Kashmere Gate ISBT, two new ISBT's were created in Sarai Kale Khan and Anand Vihar. The Anand vihar ISBT, located in trans-Yamuna region focused mainly on passenger traffic from eastern part of Delhi, from the States of Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand. The Terminal The ISBT at Anand Vihar is the city's closest link to neighbouring states of Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand, with 1,400-1, 500 inter- state buses plying from the bus terminus to these states every day. The local DTC and cluster buses also ply from Anand Vihar ISBT, where around 1,800 to 2,000 local buses operate every day. Built in 1993, the inter-state bus terminus is one of the busiest transport hubs in the area, connecting east Delhi with the rest of the city and the NCR through Metro. Day-to-day functioning of the ISBT is managed under the control of a general Manager, who is subordinated by Deputy General Manager, Accounts Officer, Executive Engineer and other staff including the Engineering, financial and administrative. Besides one estate manager is posted to lookafter the functioning of the ISBT. Renovation After the renovation of Kashmere Gate ISBT in 2013, there have been plans to Renovate ISBT Anand Vihar. The Delhi Development Authority forwarded a proposal on behalf of DIMTS to the Delhi Urban Arts Commission in 2012 regarding the renovation. The ISBT was to be developed by DIMTS on an area of 9.2 hectares in an estimated cost of Rs 200 crore. The project, once started, was likely to take 20 months for completion. Connections Anand Vihar ISBT is located adjacent to the Anand Vihar Terminal railway station and Anand Vihar metro station. In 2003, Union Railway minister Nitish Kumar announced that Delhi would get a new rail terminal at Anand Vihar. The station was commissioned in the 2003 rail budget The Anand Vihar Terminal railway station was officially inaugurated on 19 December 2009 by the then Union railway minister, Mamata Banerjee and the Chief Minister of Delhi, Sheila Dikshit. The terminal, spread over 42 hectares (100 acres) is one of the largest railway stations and caters to East‚Äìbound trains from Delhi.

Overview  There are more than 50 sites including Cinema Complexes and Convention Centers. TOHO Cinemas Co., Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of Toho, is responsible for management, but there are also theaters operated by other companies of the Toho Group. The predecessor of Toho Cinemas Corporation is Virgin Cinemas Japan Ltd., a foreign capital company. A Japanese-American businessman, Mark Yamamoto, was funded by the British Virgin Group and founded Virgin Cinemas on September 12, 1997. The first Virgin Cinemas theatre, \\"Virgin Cinemas Trias Hisayama\\" opened in Fukuoka Prefecture on April 23, 1999. At the end of 2002, the company expanded from 8 theatres to 81, and became the 6th largest film entertainment company in Japan. On April 4, 2003, Toho purchased Virgin Cinemas for 10.3 billion yen, renaming the company as Toho Cinemas. Since then, parent company Toho and other companies have developed cinema complexes under the Toho Cinemas brand. In addition, many of the cinema complexes that the Toho Group had previously operated were renamed to TOHO Cinemas after the renewal. Toho Cinemas also integrated the ticketing system and point cards. On October 1, 2006, Toho Cinemas succeeded Toho's film and entertainment division as parent company, due to the restructuring of the Toho Group's film entertainment division, with the aim of improving management efficiency as a wholly owned subsidiary of the company's film entertainment business. As a next step, Toho East Japan Kogyo Co., Ltd., Chubu Toho, Toho Kansai Koki Co., and Kyushu Toho merged into Toho Cinemas, Ltd. on March 1, 2008.

The World Extreme Pencil Fighting League is an organization of pencil fighters based in Seattle, Washington. Overview Pencil fighting typically involves two players attempting to break one- another's pencils. Players take turns in which one player holds their pencil horizontally with both hands while the other player flicks their pencil at it in attempts to break it. The first player to break the other's pencil is the winner. Foul plays have been suggested, such as intentionally hitting a player on the fingers, dropping the pencil, and missing the pencil when striking. When a foul has occurred, the offender may be required to allow a free extra strike against their pencil. Risks Some risk of eye injury exists in pencil fighting, because pieces of wood and graphite inside the pencil can be launched when pencils are struck. History It has been suggested that pencil fighting became popular toward the end of the 1970s, played by students despite the disapproval of school educators, i.e., \\"the teachers who would commonly issue two pencils to each student at the beginning of the school year and later only as required.\\" Pencil fighting in the late 1970s was also and more commonly known as \\"Pencil Break\\" or \\"Pencils.\\" Elementary, Middle (Junior High) School, and High School students played the game often. It was such a beloved activity, students would either purchase, seek out, and or trade certain brands of pencils, known for their design and durability characteristics, e.g., strength of the wood, ability to bend backwards without breaking, so as to develop the greatest possible amount of force. Often, students would simply walk up to classmates & hold one end of their pencil with both hands in a state of readiness. The other student almost instinctively knew and understood the meaning and request to play on sight. Students held word of mouth competitions before, after, and even during class in some instances; often near the back of a classroom, as students were required to line-up in order to use one of two industrial strength and wall mounted pencil sharpeners for regular pencil sharpening before, during, and after classes. Students sometimes would gather in small and even large circles and groups to play. Often, most one-on-one competitions were held on the school grounds, i.e., classroom hallways, in the school bathroom, in the school yard, next to and by the side or back of a class, while riding the school bus to and from school, and while on the way to events, trips, etc. Games commonly lasted less than half of one minute. Pencil break was enjoyed the most when the opponent's pencil was either a new or freshly sharpened. However, the game was often played twice or several times, based on the final length left after a loss. Advanced or Expert level players were able to break a pencil of any size brought before them. A standard No. 2 pencil could be realistically broken four times by an expert player. Novice players required several strikes before their opponents pencil was broken if ever. Some players removed the rubber eraser, forming the metal clamp into an edged point that was able to concentrate the cutting, sawing, and breaking power for each strike. Other players might chew on their pencil, compressing the wood so as to make it tougher to break a pencil. In most cases however, superior technique and method over the type of pencil and any upgrade was the preferred approach to winning consistently. It was common for an advanced player's pencil to last over several games before his pencil broke. World Extreme Pencil Fighting League The World Extreme Pencil Fighting League (WXPFL) is an organization and competitive league of pencil fighters based in Seattle, Washington that engages in pencil fighting competitions. WXPFL events include wrestling-style theatrics, and are held monthly at a Seattle bar named Re-Bar. Number 2 style pencils are used, and the referee is the only person allowed to distribute the pencils. The events are monitored by referees, and penalties exist for delaying the event, pencil tilting and dropping a pencil. Those called on a foul can have their pencil struck with any sized pencil, as long as \\"it‚Äôs made of wood and you can actually write with it\\". The competition includes a champion who holds a championship belt. References Further reading * External links * Pencil Fighting.

He was the fourth recorded son of Giuseppe Turroni by his marriage with Virginia Magnani. The family was highly politicised. His brother, Mauro (born 1891) was a socialist while Luigi Egisto (born 1893) and Urbano (known as Adolfo and born 1900) were committed republicans. =Between two world wars= In 1920 Turroni took part in an Errico Malatesta rally in Cesena. During the post war years Europe underwent intensified political polarisation, and by 1923 Pio Turroni, now aged 16, was already listed in police files as a \\"subversive\\" or \\"anarchist\\". In 1923, in the course of violent clashes with fascist gangs that accompanied a general strike, two of his brothers were seriously wounded by gunfire: one lost a leg. Pio himself was repeatedly beaten up. In October 1923, holding valid passports, the three brothers Luigi Egisto, Urbano and Pio Turroni emigrated to Belgium, where they probably settled in or near Liege.On 10 February 1925 Pio Turroni was declared a \\"recalcitrant\\" member of the cohort born in 1906 because of his failure to report for military service. However, the notification of recalcitrance was cancelled on 31 January 1927 because its subject was resident abroad. Authorisation for the cancellation was based on a (temporary) dispensation issued by the Italian consulate in Liege. Details are sparse, but it is thought he remained in Belgium for approximately two years, working in the construction sector and continuing to pursue his political agenda of social activism. He then moved to France, arriving in Paris probably towards the end of 1926. A Fascist government under Benito Mussolini had been appointed in Italy in 1922, and by 1926 Paris was becoming a focus for Italian political exiles: in Paris Turroni participated actively in Italian antifascist activism. Unable to find work in the French capital, he moved to Normandy in the west, but at the end of 1928 he was able to return to Paris. He was one of those who campaigned energetically (though ultimately unsuccessfully) to prevent the execution in the United States of Sacco and Vanzetti. It was while campaigning to prevent the execution of Sacco and Vanzetti that Turroni first met the Ukrainian anarchist, Nestor Makhno (1888-1934). During the later 1920s Turroni also became increasingly active as a propagandist, writing under the pseudonym \\"Camillo da Lodi\\" for various regionally produced libertarian publications in Italy such as Umanit√† Nova, Pensiero e Volont√†, L'avvenire anarchico, Non mollare and Volont√†. Between 1933 and 1935 his principal activity involved editing and publishing \\"Agitprop\\" material for the Edizioni libertarie group, based at Brest in the extreme northwest of France. Particularly significant contributions included an article entitled Reflections on war by Simone Weil and one entitled L'Operaiolatr√¨a by Camillo Berneri. In March 1933 Pio Turroni's name was placed on a list of wanted men in connection with a detention order issued by the prefecture in Forl√¨ back home in Italy, and it may be partly for this reason that his precise whereabouts within becomes increasingly hard to track in the sources, but there are records of his presence in towns and cities including Brest, Bordeaux, Marseilles and Vichy. Between 1932 and November 1935 he was informally married to Nara Cremonini, daughter of another anarchist exile, Bernardo Cremonini. Although Cremonini was treated as an exiled anarchist and an opponent of fascism, it later transpired that since 1927 he had worked as an agent provocateur and spy on behalf of the Italian fascist secret police, and Turroni would later hold Cremonini culpable for the extent to which the Italian authorities often seemed disconcertingly well briefed about his activities and whereabouts. Directly after the Spanish Coup d'√©tat led by the fascists under Francisco Franco, in October 1936 Turrano volunteered for service in the Spanish Civil War, becoming a militiaman in the platoon headed up by Francisco Ascaso, which following Ascaso's death, became the Rosselli platoon. In March 1937 he was badly wounded in fighting at Belchite. Shortly after this he was one of those, together with Attilio Bulzamini, who came up with a plan for an attempt on the life of Mussolini during the first week in August, while the dictator was in holiday with his family in Riccione. Turreni moved from Barcelona to Marseilles to wait for the necessary \\"materials\\", but there were delays and nothing came of the plan in 1937. Following Bulzamini's death, there are suggestions that Turroni revived the project in 1938. Details remain unclear, but Mussolini was not assassinated and Turroni returned to France. The Italian authorities evidently knew more about Turroni's movements than he anticipated, and on 3 September 1939 he was arrested in Marseilles at the request of the Italian government and placed in the military prison of Fort Saint-Nicolas by the entrance to the Old Port of Marseilles. According to official reports he was accused of espionage on behalf of a foreign power and of holding significant sums of money for which he could not account. =War years= War was declared between France and Germany in September 1939, although at this stage Italy remained formally neutral. On 16 March 1940 a judge announced that Turroni's case would not proceed to trial: he was served with a deportation order, despite which he was released from the Marseilles military prison two days later, on 18 March 1940. Italy invaded France towards the end of June 1940. On 8 July, without any obvious reason, the police arrested Turroni in Vichy. At about this time a collaborationist government was being established in the town to administer the southern half of France, but it is not apparent whether either Turroni's presence in the town or his arrest were in any way connected with these developments. He was imprisoned at Saint-Pierre till 29 July 1940, when he was transferred to the internment camp at Villemagne (Gard). It was probably at the end of August that he was moved again, this time to the collection camp for foreigners (Centre de rassemblement des √©trangers) at Remoulins. On 22 October 1940 he was moved to the Le Vernet concentration camp. Four days later, however, on 26 October 1940, he managed to escape, apparently in the course of another transfer. Turroni spent the next few years attempting to evade recapture: precise timelines are not all easy to discern. On 15 or 16 December 1940, with fellow anarchist fugitive , he attempted to embark for Morocco, but was arrested. He escaped the next day and was rearrested on 18 December 1940 and detained till 9 January 1941: he was accused of escaping. Having evidently escaped again, he made another attempt to reach North Africa, this time accompanied by Leo Valiani and ten other members of the Giustizia e Libert√† resistance movement. The attempt succeeded: the anarchists arrived in Algeria at the end of January 1941 and crossed the frontier into Morocco at Oujda. Arriving in Casablanca they found many more Italian anarchist exiles. For ten months he supported himself working clandestinely in the construction trade. Pio Turroni's preferred destination turned out not to be Morocco, but Mexico, however. On 20 November 1941, after several months of waiting at Casablanca, and armed with a false (or \\"recycled\\") passport, he embarked for Veracruz on board the Serpa Pinto, a Portiguese cargo boat converted for passenger use. His fellow passengers included political refugees mainly from Spain, but also Jews and political dissidents from Germany and the countries it had conquered. There were, in addition, 14 Italian antifascists. Most of these Italians were bound not for Mexico but for New York. The boat had been chartered by the Genevsa- based Red Cross, and the fares of the Italians had been paid for by a committee of fellow anti-fascists based in New York, who had also pledged to pay for return trips of the escapees once the war was over. Cabins were expensive and there were only a hundred of them: most of the approximately 1,200 passengers slept in a large improvised dormitory below the ship's bridge. Not all of the passengers were in good health. One of them, Giale Franchini, the son-in-law of the Italian politician Cipriano Facchinetti, suffered with travel sickness and ate only oranges and lemons for the first week of the voyage, which Turroni was able to get hold of for him. Three of the passengers died during the voyage. As part of the Italian community of regime opponents exiled in Mexico, Turroni pursued his political agenda energetically, while supporting himself with work as a bricklayer. However, in June 1943, possibly anticipating the fall of Mussolini and Italy's de facto withdrawal from the German alliance during the ensuing months, he decided the time had come to return home, embarking on board a Swedish ship sailing via Halifax in Canada and Liverpool in England to London. However, progress was interrupted when the ship docked at Liverpool: Turroni and another victim of fascism, Giuseppe \\"Beppe\\" Petacchi, with whom he had been travelling, were arrested and placed in a concentration camp near London. One source attributes the actions of the English authorities to a clerical error. It was only after they had been interned with \\"real\\" Italian fascists, and become involved in endless politically driven skirmishes with these, that the English authorities determined that Turroni was a \\"genuine\\" antifascist. During the final months of 1943 he arrived in Naples. Together with Giovanna Berneri, the widow of Camillo Berneri, and others including Cesare Zaccaria and Armido Abbate, he established the Alliance of Libertarian Groups and Revolutionary Libertarians (Alleanza dei Gruppi Libertari e Rivoluzione libertaria). He became editor of Volont√†, an anarchist newspaper. =After a second world war= After the war ended, in 1950 Turroni became the editor of L'Aurora in Forl√¨, back in his home region. With Gigi Damiani he founded the fortnightly L'Antistato, also based in Forl√¨, and to which the two of them were the principal contributors, working closely together for several years. In 1951 his journalistic work led him into court when he was accused of \\"insulting the judiciary\\" (\\"vilipendio alla magistratura\\"). Further trials followed, including one in Bologna in 1959 in which he was charged with producing \\"anti-electoral propaganda\\" (\\"propaganda antielettorale\\"). (In Genoa Aurelio Chessa faced similar charges at this time.) Turroni was a delegate at the founding postwar conference of the Italian Anarchist Federation at Carrara in 1945. However, he became critical of several aspects of the federation and at the ninth conference, again at Carrara, in 1965 he was one of those \\"individualist\\" anarchists who broke away, forming the \\"Anarchist Initiative Groups\\" (Gruppi di iniziativa anarchica / GIA).

Sir Richard did not speak Spanish and the captain did not speak English, so it was with difficulty that Sir Richard attempted to inform him that his orders were to return the Amfitrite back to Cadiz. Sir Richard allowed the captain three minutes to decide whether he would comply with the order, but after waiting for six minutes without an answer, opened fire on Amfitrite. The engagement lasted only eight minutes, and resulted in a number of deaths, including the first Spanish captain, who fell to a musket ball. Amfitrite surrendered and after being searched, was found to be laden with stores and carrying dispatches from Cadiz to Tenerife and Havana. She was taken over and later commissioned into the Navy as HMS Amfitrite.Rif Winfield, British Warships in the Age of Sail, 1793-1817: Design, Construction, Careers and Fates.

J.-N. Bouilly to M. Malibran (Library of the Royal Conservatory of Brussels, B-Bc, FC-2-MM-003/6) = Contracts = Drafted in Italian or French and extending over an eight-year period (1828-1836), the twenty-four contracts of the collection shed light on the working conditions, the ‚Äì sometimes steep ‚Äì remuneration, or the repertoire imposed on the singer by some European theatres.
