This island is part of the municipality of Saint- Andr√©, in the Kamouraska Regional County Municipality, in the administrative region of Bas-Saint-Laurent, in the province of Quebec, in Canada. The island has a walking path. The ferry route between Saint-Sim√©on and Rivi√®re-du-Loup passes on the south side of √éle aux Li√®vres.  Geography  This uninhabited island is the largest in the Saguenay‚ÄìSt. Lawrence Marine Park. It has a length of and a maximum width of in its northern part. It is surrounded by a few small islands upstream and downstream. The northern channel separates √éle aux Li√®vres from the Charlevoix coast; the distance between this island and the cape of T√™te au Chien, in Saint-Sim√©on, is . The Chenal du Sud separates √éle aux Li√®vres from the coast of Bas-Saint-Laurent; the distance between this island and the Pointe du Parc-de-l'Amiti√© in the parish of Saint-Fran√ßois- Xavier in Rivi√®re-du-Loup, is . The \\"Passe de l'√éle aux Li√®vres\\" is used for navigation between the southern tip (designated \\"Le Petit Havre\\") of √éle aux Li√®vres and √éle aux Fraises (located to the south). Three small islands located in Le Chenal du Pot √† l'Eau-de-Vie, east of Anse √† Warden in the northern part of √éle aux Li√®vres, are identified: Le Gros Pot, Le Pot du Phare and Le Petit Pot. The eastern shore of √éle aux Li√®vres includes Anse des Bergeron and Petit havre √† Souverain (southern part), Les Cayes (sandbank), Anse de la Souche, Anse des Rioux and Anse Double (central part), as well as Anse √† Warden and l'Anse √† Bonhomme-Bouchard (north part). The western shore of √éle aux Li√®vres includes Anse de Sable (northern part), Anse du Noy√© and Anse √† Arthur-Jean (central part) and Roche Blanche (southern part). The northern part of the island is designated \\"Le Bout d'en Bas\\". Almost the entire island is surrounded by sandstone at low tide. The flats of the White Island are located to the north of the island.  Geology, fauna and flora  The rocky base of √éle aux Li√®vres is made up of clay shales containing locally beds of conglomerate, limestone, orthoquartzite and feldspathic sandstone. These shales are covered with a thin layer of loose deposits of coastal origin. The soils are thin and abundant rock outcrops. The maximum altitude of the territory is 86 meters. The majority of √éle aux Li√®vres is covered by white birch, except in the highest areas. The island's forest cover was affected by a fire in 1922, by intensive logging in the early 1950s and by several epidemics of spruce budworm between 1975 and 1985. The island's shrub flora is relatively poor due to the abundance of snowshoe hare and the browsing of woody species that make up this stratum, which is dominated by balsam fir, white birch, trembling aspen, dogwood dogwood, edible viburnum and Canada yew. Of the fifty species of forest birds inhabiting the island, the most abundant are the olive-backed thrush, the white-throated sparrow, the bay-breasted warbler, the American robin, the gray-cheeked warbler, the tawny bunting and dark warbler. Several species of diurnal or nocturnal raptors have been observed there, including: the little owl, the Eurasian screech owl, the great horned owl, the barred owl, the wood pigeon, the osprey, the swivel falcon and the harrier Saint-Martin. The ruffed grouse, introduced in 1990 and 1991, is now omnipresent. Except for the occasional presence of the red fox, the snowshoe hare, the muskrat, the field vole and the deer mouse are the only land mammals on the island. We also observe the presence of the brown bat.  Duvetnor Company  The island is owned by the Soci√©t√© Duvetnor at 7%, a non- profit organization dedicated to the protection of wildlife and their habitat in the islands of the middle estuary of the St. Lawrence. This NPO offers, among other destinations, ecotourism activities on √éle aux Li√®vres including hiking, bird and nature observation as well as stays in wilderness camping, inn or cottages. Duvetnor also collects down from the eider, a sea duck that nests on certain islands in the estuary. Also, we find among other species on the islands that the Company owns and / or manages, an abundant colony of seal s and birds of the Alcidae family such as the little penguin, the common murre and the common guillemot mirror. Note that the Soci√©t√© Duvetnor owned 100% of √éle aux Li√®vres for more than 30 years until almost all of it was purchased by the Quebec government in 2013.  Protection of the territory and conservation interest  Following the acquisition of 93% of √éle aux Li√®vres in December 2012, the Ministry of Sustainable Development, Environment, Wildlife and Parks in August 2013 creation of the proposed √éle-aux-Li√®vres biodiversity reserve, pursuant to the Conservation of natural heritage.Ministry of Sustainable Development, Environment, Wildlife and Parks, \\"Creation of the proposed √éle- aux-Li√®vres biodiversity reserve\\", August 27, 2013. Posted on August 27, 2013, accessed September 2, 2013. Li√®vres Island is part of about twenty islands between Kamouraska and the confluence of the Saguenay and the St. Lawrence. These islands and the marine space between them are of major importance to waterfowl and marine life. These islands are the property of several partners, namely, the Canadian Wildlife Service, the Nature Conservancy of Canada, the Duvetnor Society and now, the MDDEFP. Note that the latter has the central element of this conservation area, the Hare Island which also happens to be the largest of all the islands. The location and size of this island make it the cornerstone of the conservation of the St. Lawrence estuary's wildlife. Any development or major event that goes against the conservation of this island would seriously jeopardize the survival of all bird colonies and the integrity of the satellite islands. Note in particular that the flats on √éle aux Li√®vres are very popular with the fauna of the estuary. They are, among other things, an important breeding site to help common eel in addition to being a site widely used by gray and harbor seals and a notable spawning site for herring.  Toponymy  Its name, very stable over the centuries, dates back to May 16, 1536. Jacques Cartier indeed approaches there that day, finds \\"large number of hares\\" on which his men feed and, for this reason, names it \\"isle es Liepvres\\".

Its primary subsidiary, Miller Industries Towing Equipment Inc., manufactures a variety of light- to heavy-duty wreckers, car carriers, and rotators under several brand names, including Century, Vulcan, Chevron, and Holmes. Miller Industries also operates international brands with Boniface (U.K.) and Jige (France). It is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the stock ticker symbol, MLR. History Miller Industries was founded in 1990 by William G. Miller in Ooltewah, Tennessee. He formed the company (originally known as the Miller Group) after acquiring three under-performing wrecker and towing equipment manufacturers in Holmes, Century, and Challenger. Other early brand acquisitions included Champion and Eagle. In August 1994, the company made its initial public offering (IPO) and began trading on the New York Stock Exchange with a split-adjusted share price of $7. The company's IPO raised $22.4 million and, by 1996, Miller Industries was nearly free of debt. That year, Miller Industries expanded internationally, acquiring both Boniface Engineering in the U.K. (Thetford) and Jige International in France (Revigny- sur-Ornain). 1996 also saw the company's acquisition of Mississippi-based towing equipment maker, Vulcan International, and the purchase of a manufacturing facility in Hermitage, Pennsylvania. Its headquarters during this time were located in Atlanta, Georgia. In 1997, the company opened a plant in Greeneville, Tennessee to build car carriers and other products for its recent Vulcan acquisition. In November of that year, Jeffrey I. Badgley was named the President and sole CEO of the company. Badgley had been serving as co-CEO with William G. Miller who remained Chairman of the company after the announcement. Miller would resume the role of co-CEO in October 2003 alongside Badgley. In December 1997, the company acquired Mercer, Pennsylvania-based Chevron Inc., another tow truck manufacturer. Throughout the late 1990s and until 2014, Miller Industries was the official provider of wreckers and recovery equipment for various NASCAR races. In 2006, the company announced an expansion of the manufacturing facility at its Ooltewah headquarters. In 2009, Miller Industries introduced a hybrid recovery truck at that year's Daytona 500. In 2011, William G. Miller's son, William G. Miller II, was appointed President of the company. The elder Miller remained chairman and Jeffrey Badgley became sole CEO again. In 2013, the younger Miller was appointed co-CEO alongside Badgley. Between 2015 and 2018, Miller Industries expanded and renovated its plants in Hermitage, Pennsylvania, Greeneville, Tennessee, and Ooltewah, Tennessee. In October 2019, the company introduced the world's first rolling rotator with a 100-ton recovery capacity. Products and brands Holmes Traffic King Wrekcer service body on 133 inch wheelbase Nash Truck in 1948. Miller Industries manufactures and sells a variety of wreckers. It also produces car carriers and rotators via a number of different brands. Many of the brands are operated as part of Miller Industries' primary subsidiary, Miller Industries Towing Equipment, Inc., which is considered the largest manufacturer of towing and recovery equipment in the world. Miller brands include all of the following: =Holmes= The Holmes brand of wreckers came into existence in 1916 when Ernest Holmes invented the first tow truck in Chattanooga. The Ernest Holmes Company then became an leader in the towing and recovery industry. It was one of the first companies acquired by William G. Miller when he started Miller Industries in 1990. =Century= Century Wrecker Corp. was founded in 1974 by Ernest Holmes' grandson, Jerry Holmes. It was the first wrecker company to incorporate hydraulic towing equipment onto each wrecker, a feature that is now standard across all tow trucks. Century was another brand the William G. Miller acquired to start Miller Industries in 1990. It is considered the company's flagship brand and features a collection of light- to heavy-duty wreckers and car carriers. =Other brands= Other brands under the Miller umbrella include Vulcan, Chevron, Boniface, and Jige. Vulcan International was an independent tow truck manufacturer based in Olive Branch, Mississippi before being acquired by Miller Industries in 1996. Likewise, Chevron Inc. was an independent manufacturer of tow trucks based in Mercer, Pennsylvania until its acquisition by Miller in 1997. Boniface Engineering, a tow truck and equipment manufacturer based in Thetford, Norfolk, England, was founded in 1982. It was acquired by Miller Industries in 1996 and became one of two major European brands for Miller. Boniface wreckers can be found throughout Europe and in parts of Asia. Jige International was another overseas towing equipment manufacturer acquired by Miller in 1996. The brand is based in Revigny-sur-Ornain in France. The company was originally founded in 1969.

It was established at Okinawa in July 1945 and conducted three operations into the East China Sea before the end of the war in mid-August that year. Task Force 95 was active as late as November 1945. The designation was reactivated for use during the Korean War, when it was used for the United Nations Command Blockading and Escort Force, often helmed by the British Flag Officer Second in Command Far East Fleet. Vice Admiral William Andrewes served as Commander, Task Force 95 (CTF 95), for a period. World War II operational historySurface sweeps= Task Force 95 (TF-95) was established in early July 1945 at Buckner Bay in Okinawa under the command of Vice Admiral Jesse B. Oldendorf. The formation was responsible for protecting American forces at Okinawa, including by providing radar pickets to detect incoming air raids, and sweeping the East China Sea of Japanese shipping. Upon formation, TF-95 comprised the large cruisers and , four light cruisers and several destroyers. TF-95 undertook its first anti-shipping sweep into the East China Sea between 17 and 24 July. At this time it comprised Alaska and Guam, light cruisers , , and and nine destroyers. No Japanese ships were encountered. Official historian Samuel Eliot Morison noted that \\"direct results were few but the fact that a surface sweep of Japan's home waters could be made with impunity demonstrated how low the enemy's air and naval power had sunk\\". Three destroyers assigned to TF-95 were struck by Japanese kamikaze aircraft in July. was hit while in Buckner Bay on 19 July. This resulted in two members of her crew being wounded and damage which was judged to be beyond repair. was sunk on 28 July while operating as a radar picket off Okinawa; 47 members of her crew were killed. was also damaged by a kamikaze on 29 July during a radar picket patrol near Okinawa, with 22 of her crew being killed and 45 wounded. TF-95 also included Task Group 95.7 in the Philippines, which was responsible for delivering training. The heavy cruiser was en-route to join this Task Group for training ahead of joining the main body of TF-95 when she was torpedoed and sunk on 30 July. The Task Force's second operation began on 1 August. This operation involved the ships used in the first attack, which were designated Task Group 95.2, as well as a covering force designated Task Group 95.3. The covering force comprised battleships , and , escort carriers , and , heavy cruiser , light cruiser , six destroyers and three destroyer escorts. During this operation Task Group 95.2 patrolled along the Chinese coast north of the Yangtze Delta each night. As with the first operation, no Japanese ships were located. The escort carriers conducted two anti-shipping strikes which resulted in the sinking of a coastal barge as well as damage to a small cargo ship and shore installations. One of these attacks was made on 6 August, during which aircraft from all three escort carriers struck shipping in Tinghai. Fighters flying from the carriers also shot down four Japanese aircraft. One American fighter, a Grumman F4F Wildcat, was shot down by anti- aircraft guns. Two other Wildcats and three Vought F4U Corsairs were damaged. TF-95 broke off the operation on 6 August, and reached Buckner Bay the next day. In his report on the 1-7 August operation, Oldendorf noted that Japanese shipping in the East China Sea had been \\"practically eliminated\\" by air and submarine attacks. He judged that \\"appropriate targets for Naval guns no longer existed in the area near the Yangtze mouth. Historian Brian Lane Herder has observed that despite its lack of results, \\"TF-95 tightened the pressure on Japan, and its mere existence demonstrates the extravagance of naval power the Allies were bringing to bear [in] the final weeks of the war\\". =Minesweeping and post-war= A large minesweeping force, designated Task Group 95.4 also operated in the East China Sea during the final days of the war. Task Group 95.4 departed Buckner Bay on 11 August. At this time it comprised four light minelayers, 40 minesweepers, 10 motor minesweepers and several support ships. The Task Group returned to Buckner Bay on 25 August; during this operation it destroyed 578 mines. The battleship arrived at Okinawa on 12 August, and became Oldendorf's flagship. That night a Japanese aircraft penetrated Buckner Bay and torpedoed Pennsylvania. A total of 20 American sailors were killed, and Oldendorf and many others were wounded. Oldendorf continued as the commander of TF-95 until November 1945.

Since 1985, she has been the Executive Director of Peace Over Violence, a nonprofit agency that functions as a sexual, domestic and interpersonal violence prevention center providing crisis intervention and support for healing from violence. The organization was founded in 1971 and was formerly known as Los Angeles Commission on Assaults Against Women, or LACAAW. Denim Day In 1999, Giggans initiated Denim Day in LA which has since grown to be a national rape prevention and education campaign to combat sexual violence and support its victims. The campaign began after a 1998 ruling by the Italian Supreme Court where a rape conviction was overturned because the justices felt that, due to the fact that the victim wore very tight jeans, she must have assisted the perpetrator and helped him remove them, thus the act was consensual. Women in the Italian Parliament protested by wearing jeans on the steps of the Italian Supreme Court. The protest was picked up by international media and inspired Giggans, who felt that, ‚Äúeveryone should be wearing jeans to protest all of the myths about why women are raped.\\" Peace Over Violence has organized Denim Day every April since 1999 in honor of Sexual Assault Awareness Month. Awards and appointments In 2016, Giggans was appointed to the Los Angeles County Sheriff Civilian Oversight Commission, which works to boost transparency and increase trust between communities and the Sheriff's Department.

Chli is a leader in the field of computer vision and robotics and was on the team of researchers to develop the first fully autonomous helicopter with onboard localization and mapping. Chli is also the Vice Director of the Institute of Robotics and Intelligent Systems and an Honorary Fellow of the University of Edinburgh in the United Kingdom. Her research currently focuses on developing visual perception and intelligence in flying autonomous robotic systems.  Early life and education  Chli grew up in Cyprus and Greece. She pursued her undergraduate degree at the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom. She conducted her studies in Information and Computer Engineering at Trinity College. After receiving her bachelors, she continued at Trinity to conduct her Masters in engineering as well. In 2006, Chli pursued her graduate work at Imperial College London under the mentorship of Andrew Davison. She worked in the Robot Vision Group where she worked towards developing novel ways to manipulate data to enable efficient autonomous navigation of mobile devices. Since vision-based methods are the key to enabling autonomous navigation, Chli tried to address the challenges that lie in preserving precision while achieving efficient information processing. She used the principles of Information Theory to guide the estimation based decisions made after gathering information from the environment and showed that these principals improved the efficiency and consistency of the algorithms used to estimate motion and form probabilistic maps of the environment. Her algorithms also enabled dense feature mapping even in the presence of ambiguity and inconsistencies in camera dynamics. Chli completed her graduate work in 2009 and worked for one year as a research associated in the Robot Vision Group.  Career and research  After completing her PhD, Chli joined the Autonomous Systems Lab at ETH Z√ºrich for her postdoctoral research, and soon became the Lab Deputy Director. While at ETH Z√ºrich, she taught the Autonomous Mobile Robot Course, and this was later turned into an online course to train thousands of researchers worldwide for free. In 2013, Chli was awarded the Chancellor's Fellowship, and became an Assistant Professor at the Institute of Perception Action and Behavior at the University of Edinburgh. She held this prestigious fellowship for two years. In 2015, Chli was promoted to the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF) Assistant Professor in Vision for Robotics at ETH Z√ºrich and relocated her lab from Edinburgh. She still holds an Honorary Fellowship at the University of Edinburgh. Her lab, the Vision for Robots Lab, or V4RL, focuses on developing intelligence robots to improve the quality and safety of human life. Chli has several lines of research going on in her lab to achieve these goals. With the SHERPA project, Chli aims to use intelligent and autonomous robotic systems to help with alpine search and rescue. Chli also participates in research towards the myCopter project whose goal is to design personal automated aerial transportation systems such that one could travel from work to home by air at low altitudes. Lastly, Chli's team develops methods to enable micro aerial vehicles to map out unknown environments through the SFly project (Swarm of micro flying robots). All of these projects require immense innovations in the field of computer vision and robotics, essentially demanding the ability that robots can handle large amounts of data in efficient ways to ‚Äúsee‚Äù their environments and respond quickly and autonomously. Chli's team aims to develop these intelligent systems with the capability of visual perception through the use of deep learning and robot collaboration. = Improving methods of computer vision = Chli's early work helped to improve computer vision approaches to enable the construction of autonomous robotic systems. Chli first tackled the issue of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) in which a robotic system has difficulty estimating its new and changing environment while also keeping track of its own location. Since dividing the map into smaller submaps would allow for individual parts of a scene to be processed independently and thus more efficiently, Chli created an innovative method to perform submap division on SLAM maps. She used hierarchical clustering to group similar features together into subgroups and she revealed novel insight into the structure of visual maps which helped to guide the field in addressed the computational issues associated with SLAM. The next computer vision issue that Chli tackled during her time as a postdoctoral fellow at ETH Z√ºrich, was key point detection in images. She developed a method called BRISK (Binary Robust Invariant Scalable Key points) and it performed much faster and at a much lower computational cost compared to previous key point detection algorithms such as SURF and SIFT. = Autonomous helicopter = During Chli's postdoctoral work at ETH Z√ºrich, she was part of a team that developed the first autonomously flying small helicopter. The helicopter had a monocular camera as the only inertial sensory and was able to navigate in novel environments. It achieved SLAM with extreme robustness to enable its autonomous flight. = Robot navigation = Chli has conducted fundamental research to improve the methods of autonomous robot navigation. One way Chli and her team worked towards improving robot navigation is by creating an algorithm to better integrate information from multiple sensors on the robot. Previously, multisensory integration was challenging due to sensory outages and differences in measurement rates and delays. Due to this, Chli and her team developed a framework called MultiSensor-Fusion Extended Kalman Filter (MSF-EKF) which is able to process delayed, relative, and absolute information from unlimited sensors and sensor types. They tested their framework with a micro aerial vehicle (MAV) that had a GPS receiver as well as visual, inertial, and pressure sensors and they found that it was able to self calibrate and show efficient re-linearization in response to state updates. With improvements and advances in SLAM capabilities, Chli became interested in creating multi-robot collaborative SLAM. Collaborative scene perception and mapping by a group of autonomous robots would serve a broad spectrum of uses from environmental data collection to surveillance and rescue. In her framework, each individual unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) would have a local SLAM with limited capacity as a part of its design and computational power, while there would also be a central grounded server to collect and gather all of the information from each individual UAV. This central controller also distributes this information back to all individual UAVs so that they can update their maps as well. Chli has recently been working with convolutional neural networks (CNN) to improve their ability to perform place recognition for use in robot navigation. She proposed novel CNN-based image features for use in place recognition by creating regional representations of salient regions directly from convolutional layer activation. They found that their system has improved robustness in the face of viewpoint and appearance variations and they shared their insights about the process of feature encoding that make it robust to external variations in their system.

They are shown a skeleton of a large creature with wings and horns at a place called Uncle Willie's Desert Museum. Dr. Boley dismisses it as a hoax assembled from unrelated bones, but Uncle Willie insists that he found the bones together as a whole skeleton. While Uncle Willie tells them tales of demons from Native American folklore, an unseen force attacks the building, causing a rafter to collapse and kill the proprietor, and starting a fire that consumes the building. Dr. Boley and Diana escape with the horned skull and take it to a motel. The next morning they report to the police and return to the site of the fire. There they find a group of young men, James Reeger and four others, riding motorcycles around the ruins. The police arrest them on suspicion of causing the fire, against the advise of the Boleys. That night, two Gargoyles, appearing much smaller than the skeleton and without horns or wings, invade the motel room to retrieve the skull. Dr. Boley chases them to the road where one is struck and killed by a truck and the other gets away with the skull. Boley takes the body back to the room. The alcoholic hotelier, Mrs. Parks, complains but Diana tries to assure her that it was only a family argument. (There is never any word from the truck driver who stopped but then seems to have driven away without suspicion, and no further mention is made of the bathroom door that was destroyed by a gargoyle.) Diana returns to the police station and pleads for the bikers' innocence but the police refuse to release them. She tells Reeger about the dead gargoyle but does not mention it to the police even though it would prove their innocence, apparently because her father wants it for study. She returns to the motel. Two slightly larger gargoyles return to recover the gargoyle body, but the Boleys escape with it through the window and stow it in their station wagon. The gargoyles rip the passenger door off and kidnap Diana, then overturn the car rendering Dr. Boley unconscious. The gargoyles take Diana to their cave, where they have many eggs. She meets the gargoyle leader, who is larger and has wings and horns like the skeleton. He tells Diana that they have only been alive for a few weeks after a 500 year incubation, and that humans have repeatedly killed them off in the past, but he vows that they will survive this time. He has several of Dr. Boley's books, apparently also taken from the car, and insists that Diana read to him. As she reads a passage that describes a mythical encounter between a human female and a demon who molests her, the leader approaches from behind and startles her, but assures her that he has no interest in humans. Dr. Boley convinces the police to release the bikers and search for Diana, and Reeger joins them. Mrs. Parks and her helper drive away to get assistance, but the search party later finds her pickup truck empty and bloodied, and her body hanging upside down from a telephone pole with no sign of the helper. The gargoyle leader has a queen, who also has wings, and she informs him that \\"men, horses, and dogs\\" are approaching the cave, and that many more eggs will hatch the next day. The leader orders that the humans must be stopped in the desert. Over a dozen gargoyles charge the humans and both sides have casualties. The leader takes Dr. Boley to the cave and vows that \\"this is the end of your age, the beginning of mine.\\" The queen appears jealous of the leader's attention to Diana, and she leads Dr. Boley to his daughter and lets them escape.

Members of this gens are mentioned in the time of Cicero, but none of them achieved any of the higher offices of the Roman state.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol.

Chase classifies the nomen among those gentilicia that either originated at Rome, or cannot be shown to have come from anywhere else. However, several early inscriptions of this gens are from Campania, and many others are concentrated in the Campanian cities of Casilinum and Pompeii, strongly hinting at a Campanian origin.. Praenomina The Suettii employed a variety of common praenomina, chiefly Aulus, Gaius, Lucius, Servius, and Sextus. Of these, only Servius was relatively distinctive, although by no means rare. Other praenomina are found on occasion, and in one inscription we find an Anthus Suettius, perhaps an example of a cognomen being used in place of a praenomen, or perhaps an old praenomen more typically found as a surname.

The play was adapted into the 1937 film of the same name, and was also adapted for television.  Production history  By 1935, Ferber and Kaufman had already collaborated on two successful Broadway plays, The Royal Family (1927) and Dinner at Eight (1932). On New Year's Eve of 1935, the team met to discuss potential projects, and Ferber revived one of their old ideas: to write a play with an all-female cast.\\"Origins of 'Stage Door,'\\" The New York Times October 25, 1936. Inspired by a visit to the Rehearsal Club, she also suggested that the play be set in a theatrical boardinghouse for young actresses, with \\"a retired character actress\\" serving as the landlady.Meredith, Scott. George S. Kaufman and His Friends. Garden City: Doubleday & Company, 1974. 502-4. In early 1936, Ferber and Kaufman developed a detailed synopsis for Stage Door while visiting the Florida home of producer Sam H. Harris; some details of the plot were hashed out while the duo rode bicycles side by side. After they returned to New York, the script was written in two months, with the pair \\"work[ing] for four hours daily in Miss Ferber's apartment, generally from 11 o'clock in the morning until 3 o'clock in the afternoon\\".

The Iraqis invested a lot of money in the production of the missile, however Iraq failed to produce the facilities required to produce the missile and consequently it did not enter mass production. Development In 1984/1985 Iraq entered in a program with Argentina and Egypt to develop a high-technology two-stage ballistic missile system of approximately 1000 km based on the Pershing II ballistic missile which would be called Condor-II in Argentina, BADR-2000 in Iraq. and Vector in Egypt The missile system under development consisted of all the systems required like computation, command and communication, transport and handling, launch preparation, power supply e.t.c. Argentina would develop the missile while Egypt would help in procuring new technology and Iraq would finance the project. A number of Aerospace and defense companies from Italy and Germany aided the project and technical support was handled by a consortium of 16 European companies under the name Consen based in Switzerland. The project was supposed to be carried out in close collaboration with the Arab League Industrial Development Organisation (ALIDO) centered in Baghdad. When it came to the missile Iraq preferred to use solid propulsion in both stages as opposed to solid propulsion in first stage and liquid propulsion in the second. The liquid propelled engine which was being developed along with the Iraqi engines could be used in third stage and would turn the missile into a Space delivery vehicle for limited payloads. Iraq concentrated its efforts in the Belat al-Shuhada Factory. The project was supposed The Iraqis in 1985 would then commence Project 395 in effort to construct facilities to produce solid-propellant motors indigenously, many American firms were involved in Project 395 and helped Iraq build Infrastructure to produce the Condor-II missile. Since the project was mostly covert and Iraq was itself lacked the production facilities the program was slow. In 1987 and 1988 Disputes arose between Iraq and Argentina and Egypt regarding the provision of missiles, Iraq had grown suspicious regarding where its investment was going and in 1987 Iraq had signed a contract for 17 Badr-2000 missiles however it realized that it would not get these missiles. By 1987 the building of three key sites required for the manufacturing of Badr-2000 missile had started. Collaboration ended in 1988 when Iraq was taking the project all by itself, in summer 1988 Egyptian scientist Abdel Kader Helmy was arrested in California for transferring missile technology to Iraq. Iraq declared that in 1989 it took the entire project on its own, by 1989 Iraq had invested $400 million in the project and had build a factory to manufacture propellants. In 1989 the Technical Corps for Special Projects(TECO), which was an affiliate of the Ministry of Industry and Military Industrialization (MIMI) which managed Iraq's military procurements, designated Project 395 to the Condor-II missile Program. Some additional military procurements were also imported by Iraq in 1989 and 1990. Iraq had erected an R&D; research facility and three other facilities for Project 395, one facility managed production of solid propellants of the Badr-2000 missiles, the other motor cases, the third did final assembly and testing, all of which were part of the Belat Al-Shuhada missile factory. Despite that however the missile could not enter mass production and Iraq did not use any Badr-2000 missiles. Characteristics The Badr-2000 was to be a mobile medium-range dual stage ballistic surface-to-surface missile. The Badr-2000 missile was intended to have a range of 1000 km although UNSCOM estimated that the actual range was around 620-750 km. The missile had a weight of 4800 kg and a payload of 350 km, the payload itself was a separating reentry vehicle. The Badr-2000 missile had a length of 10.3 m and a width of 0.8 m which was the booster, all of this would amount to a CEP of 30-50 m. =First stage rocket= The first stage booster was 800 mm in diameter cased in maraging steel and filled with cast HTPB. Thrust vectoring for missile control in pitch and yaw for this stage was provided by a flexible joint nozzle with Hydraulic cylinders by stored and pressurized Helium. The flexible joint consisted of rings of elastomeric material enforced with steel. =Second stage rocket= The Argentinians used the MMH fuel and N2O4 Oxidizer for the liquid propelled version. The Iraqis however would use UDMH as fuel and MON 7 as oxidizer. For Thrust vector control the missile used a gimbaled nozzle controlled by electromechanical systems. The second-stage engine would burn for no more than 40 seconds, two pyrotechnic valves would be responsible for shutting the engine down when desired altitude and velocity has been achieved. At the sustain phase the roll axis would be controlled by cold gas thruster systems located in the reentry vehicle. Legacy After the Gulf War UNSCOM supervised the destruction of all Badr-2000 missiles as well as production facilities. All production facilities were reduced to facilities that could only produce non-proscribed missile under UNSCOM supervision, nine solid propellant facility buildings were destroyed and two testing facility buildings were also destroyed however no motor-case production facility was damaged. Iraq would later use the technology used in Badr-2000 for the single- stage Short-range \\"Badr-2000 Junior\\"(Ababil-100 which is also called al Fat'h) which lacked the flexible joint nozzle. Iraq would later attempt to acquire the 120 km single-stage rocket called Sakr-200 from Egypt, the fate of this attempt is unknown. Some sources also suggest that Iraq sought to design another long-range ballistic missile whose design was again based on the Badr-2000 and Al-Fat'h ballistic missiles.

Stone inscriptions indicate that the complex was founded during the Konbaung dynasty by Dagon mayor U Shangalay and royal messenger and port-officer Maung Tu, who built and donated a monastery to Sayadaw U Mani of Inwa, during the reign of King Tharrawaddy Min. On 11 March 1854, Queen Victoria issued a royal decree that conferred the complex religious freehold title. As colonial authorities demolished the pre-colonial town of Dagon in favor of a city grid, authorities evicted many monasteries scattered throughout the town, especially around Sule Pagoda; consequently, under the orders of Arthur Phayre, Thayettaw became the site of all the town's displaced Buddhist monasteries. By 1900, Thayettaw housed more than 50 monasteries and zayat (rest houses).

Additionally, many special events, such as weddings and the annual Christmas Candlelight Service, are hosted in the chapel. It is located on the Avenue of Remembrance, directly across Summerall Field from Padgett-Thomas Barracks. It stands between Daniel Library and Mark Clark Hall. Construction The chapel, designed by C.R. MacDonald, was started on September 7, 1936 and dedicated on Palm Sunday, April 10, 1938. The first services, however, were held in the chapel on September 19, 1937. The chapel was named in honor of Citadel president Gen. Charles Pelot Summerall. A $1 million repair program was developed for the chapel in 1985. Decoration Inside, there is a set of thirty stained glass windows designed by H.G. Wilbert depicting the life of Jesus Christ which were executed by the Pittsburgh Stained Glass Studios in the 13th century Gothic style.

The book documents experiences the author and others have had with machine learning programs, and discusses what \\"intelligence\\" means in the context of \\"artificial intelligence\\" (AI).  Overview  The main title of the book refers to a phrase generated as a pickup line in 2017 by a neural net that Shane trained on pickup lines gathered from the Internet. Shane discusses the dangers of \\"artificial stupidity\\", describing for example a 2016 crash at a city street intersection, which Shane attributes in part to Tesla Autopilot being trained for highway use and therefore failing to properly perceive a blocking flatbed truck from a side view. Shane provides \\"Five Principles of AI Weirdness\\", including \\"AIs don't understand the problems you want them to solve\\" and \\"AIs take the path of least resistance to their programmed goal\\". Shane gives many examples of AI \\"shortcuts\\", including the (possibly apocryphal) legend of an AI that appeared to reliably recognize tanks from photos, by noticing whether the photos were taken on a sunny or a cloudy day. Another of Shane's examples is a hypothetical scenario where a simulated AI evolved to keep people from entering a hazardous hallway during a fire emergency, learns the optimal strategy is to just kill everyone so they cannot enter the hallway. Because AI lacks general intelligence, Shane is skeptical of efforts to power self- driving cars or to detect online hate speech using artificial intelligence. Shane also pushes back against concerns artificial intelligence will replace people's jobs.  Reception  A reviewer in the Christian Science Monitor found the book \\"eye-opening\\" and \\"fun\\", stating \\"I found this book comforting: Shane makes a convincing case that AI isn't going to be stealing jobs in the near future.\\" A review in ZDNet called the book \\"approchable\\" and \\"insightful\\". A capsule review in the Philadelphia Inquirer called Shane a \\"great guide\\", and a capsule review in Publisher's Weekly called the book an \\"accessible primer\\" with \\"charming\\" and \\"often-hilarious\\" content. A reviewer in E&T judged the book \\"stands out for Shane's madcap sense of humour and affection for the subject\\". In The Verge, a December 2019 list of \\"the 11 best new sci-fi books\\" included Shane's book, stating \\"Science fact, rather than science fiction, (the book is) incredibly informative\\". A similar list in Ars Technica praised that \\"anybody, not just the engineer-minded or the tech- savvy, can understand the often abstract concepts she details.\\" The book also made Scientific American's list of \\"Recommended Books\\" for November 2019.

Origin The nomen Spellius appears to belong to a large class of gentilicia derived from surnames ending in diminutive suffixes such as ', ', or ', or in some cases directly from surnames with similar stems, without diminutive suffixes.Chase, pp. 122‚Äì124.

After Niven and his family left Newburgh, the house was said to be the residence of architect Frederick Clarke Withers. It is considered to be one of the first examples of Italianate architecture in America.  History  In the late 1820s, Niven occupied a house on Montgomery Street, formerly at the northeast corner of Fifth Street. Downs, 19 This house, located in what was swiftly becoming a fashionable neighborhood for merchants and professionals, no longer stands. It is unknown exactly how long Niven stayed there, but it sold for $1400 on May 1, 1841 to James H. Leeds. In 1842, Niven supplied the house's design to the publishers Gaylord & Tucker‚Äîhis first publicly offered architectural service. Downs, Supp. A It assured him at least one commission, and he called the design \\"Genteel Farm House\\". Downs, Supp. C The small wing at the left side of the house appears larger, and with a detailed kitchen chimney. Niven's bracketed style of roof shown predates Downing's, but the latter architect received credit through his publication of Cottage Residences (1842) by a few months.  Design  Italianate influence = The design of the house's exterior is similar to that of the Walsh-Havemeyer House in neighboring New Windsor, meaning the general square shape of both could be from Niven's imagination. The two have the same hipped roof shapes and corbels, are made of brick, and used distinctive stucco covering. The Walsh-Havemeyer House is considered a Greek Revival design for its Doric veranda, erected prior to A. J. Downing's criticism of the unfitting style. Niven turned from Greek Revival, which he had built his career upon, for the construction of his house.Downs, 33-34 This uniqueness places an emphasis on his personal ties, and he selected more Italianate features: arched windows, a hipped roof, horizontal lines. These choices make the house of the first Italianate villas in America, John Notman, a Philadelphia architect, being the first to experiment with the style in 1837.JDF Downing is considered the first to publish an example of the Italianate villa in 1841. He could have been inspired by Niven's house, but both men could have seen the rapid growth of the style in New Haven. Originally, the stucco had scores to resemble ashlar, and Niven inlaid the veranda with black and white marble tiles, which still exist. = Regency influence = An influence of the house was thought to be the American Regency Wickham House (1812) by Robert Mills in Richmond, Virginia, where Niven visited in the 1820s for a stonecutting project. Downs, 13 Another Southern design ostensibly emulated is the Chisolm Plantation, The Launch (c. 1830), on Edisto Island, South Carolina. The rear elevation, seen from the water, bares a slight resemblance to the street- facing veranda of Niven's house. South Carolina Dept. of Archives and History = Old English influence = The kitchen wing is derived from an Old English style of building appropriated in the 1830s, being slightly popularized by Notman. Downing drew from Notman's porch plans, which featured two low side projections such as the Chisolm Plantation's. Notman's design for the Nathan Dunn residence in Mount Holly, New Jersey contains a kitchen wing in the style Niven favored for his, used by Downing in A Treatise on the Theory and Practice of Landscape Gardening (1841).

Description Leptospermum purpurascens is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of with thin, rough bark that is shed annually to reveal shining purple new bark. Younger stems are hairy at first and have a conspicuous flange near each leaf base. The leaves are elliptical to broadly lance-shaped, about long, wide and glossy on the upper surface, silky hairy on the lower surface. The flowers white, sometimes reddish, wide and usually arranged in pairs. The floral cup is hairy, about long and the sepals are about long. The petals are about long and the stamens are long. Flowering occurs from June to July and the fruit is a capsule about in diameter with the remains of the sepals attached, but that falls from the plant when the seeds are released. Taxonomy and naming Leptospermum purpurascens was first formally described in 1989 by Joy Thompson in the journal Telopea. The specific epithet (purpurascens) is a Latin word meaning \\"purplish\\" or \\"becoming purple\\", referring to the colour of the new bark. Distribution and habitat This tea-tree grows on rocky hillsides in far north Queensland.

It is located at the northern entrance of the Spanish city of M√°laga. This garden is one of the few gardens with subtropical plants that exist in Europe. It has more than fifty thousand plants, of two thousand species of tropical, subtropical, and autochthonous, highlighting the collection with more than one hundred different species of palms, bamboos, aquatic plants and its historical garden . It originally was a recreational estate of a family of the upper bourgeoisie of the city from the mid-19th century until 1990 when it became public property. The M√°laga City Council founded for its management the Municipal Botanical Board 'Ciudad de M√°laga'. History La Concepci√≥n was built around 1855 thanks to the work of the marriage formed by Jorge Loring y Oyarz√°bal and Amalia Heredia Livermore, marquis of the Casa Loring . Jorge Loring, one of the most influential people of the M√°laga of the 19th century and personal friend of C√°novas del Castillo and of Francisco Silvela, was a successful businessman in addition to deputy to Cortes. His wife Amalia Heredia Livermore, daughter of the industrialist Manuel Agust√≠n Heredia, was a cultured woman, interested in plants, books and archaeology. Thus, in La Concepci√≥n they treasured a substantial archaeological heritage of which there are still some remains in the form of Roman sculptures and mosaics; and a rich botanical heritage, thanks to the skill of a French gardener named Chamoussant among others. Templete tetr√°stilo of Doric order, built by the Loring family. Following the financial bankruptcy of the Loring-Heredia family, the estate was bought in 1911 by the Echevarr√≠a Azcarate family (from the marriage of Rafael Echevarr√≠a Azcarate with Amalia Echevarrieta Mauri, making important improvements and expanding the collection of trees and palm trees. In 1943 the garden is declared a historical-artistic garden, today it's Bien de Inter√©s Cultural. When the couple dies, the estate is managed by Amalia's brother, Horacio Echevarrieta, who maintained it until his death in 1963. From this point, the property goes into decline and progressive abandonment. In 1990, the garden was acquired by the City Of Malaga and after four years of renovations and adaptation it opened up to the public. Since then, new spaces and gardens have been incorporated around the Historic Garden, in the form of themed gardens, highlighting those dedicated to palm trees, carnivorous plants and orchids, others to cacti and succulents or that of Around the World in Eighty Trees. La Concepci√≥n occupies an area of fifty-five hectares, of which twenty-five belong to the historic garden. Next to it, there are thematic gardens and a large area of natural native Mediterranean forest that can also be visited; they are the so-called forest route and the viewpoints route in the upper area of the garden. Modern gardens From the acquisition of the property by the Malaga City Council, different gardens were created with the modern characteristics of a botanical garden. These were gardens with collections arranged in such a way as to enable a more systematic and academic study than the historical garden allowed, originally conceived as a promenade garden. Among the largest routes and collections, it is worth highlighting the areas named: \\"Around the world in eighty trees\\", \\"The world map of palm trees\\", \\"The cactus garden\\", \\"The garden of Primitive plants\\", \\"The Rockery of Biodiversity ‚Äùand‚Äú The hot stove ‚Äù, as well as some minor collections of bamboo, aquatic plants or vines.

The expedition lasted from September 1960 to June 1961. In 1958 Hillary and Pugh had discussed whether Everest could be climbed without oxygen; with improved acclimatising by wintering at say for six months beforehand. But Pugh‚Äôs plans involving two bases on Everest (Base camp, and on the Western Cwm at feet) had been dropped by Hillary as a request to the Chinese had been rebuffed because of troubles in Tibet. And finance was needed; Hillary wrote to Pugh in 1959 \\"I‚Äôm damn certain that we‚Äôd get someone on the top (of Everest) without oxygen but we‚Äôd need a lot of cash\\". In 1959 Hillary was awarded the Explorer of the Year Award by Argosy magazine; $US1000 and a trip to New York to address the award banquet. His speech and personality impressed Dienhart who invited him to their Chicago headquarters. Hillary proposed a \\"Yeti search\\" plus a party of climbers who would winter for the first time at () and then attempt the summit of Makalu () without oxygen. Hillary estimated the expedition cost at $US120,000 and after meeting him in Chicago in October 1959 the World Book board gave him $US125,000 and a \\"practically free hand\\".  Nepal and the Silver Hut base The expedition gathered in Kathmandu in September 1960, destination the Rolwaling Valley; reputed to be a Yeti stronghold and where Shipton with Ward and the Sherpa Sen Tenzing had photographed the footprint in 1951. At the end of October the expedition went via the Tashi Laptsa Pass to the Khumbu region. Norman Hardie led a party of 310 Nepali porters with parts of the hut, the laboratory equipment and winter supplies. He set up a base at the village of Changmatang near the entrance to the Mingbo Valley. Research accommodation was in the prefabricated Silver Hut and an adjacent tent. The Silver Hut was six meters long and three meters wide with a panoramic view from windows at the laboratory end. The setting was spectacular, between the \\"vertiginous walls\\" of Ama Dablam and behind them the cirque of steep ice and rock of the Mingbo La. A kerosene stove separated the living-space with eight bunks and a dining table from the laboratory with a bicycle ergometer and equipment benches. Hillary had originally picked the crest of the Mingbo Valley, located on the col of the Mingbo Valley for the research base. But the pass () was up a feet slope of steep ice and winds funnelled over the pass. So Hardie and Hillary agreed that the n√©v√© 500 feet lower was better and safer. But the absent Pugh (though he agreed that it was safer there) was displeased at not being consulted, though he had been at Changmatang for two weeks; an early indication of the difficult relationship between Hillary and Pugh. The scientific phase of the expedition here lasted from November 1960 to March 1961. The \\"wintering party\\" was Pugh with Bishop, Gill, Lahiri, Milledge, Ward and West and Sherpas Siku, Dawa Tensing and Mingma Norbu. The physiological measurements at , an altitude in the grey zone between acclimatisation and deterioration, were unique; at that altitude the oxygen content of the air was half that at sea level, and initially work capacity was half that at sea level though it increased to two-thirds with acclimatisation. The party all lost weight, an indication of high-altitude deterioration. For lung and heart function assessment, oxygen and carbon dioxide is measured in lungs and blood. At sea level blood leaving the lungs is nearly fully saturated with oxygen but there it dropped to seventy percent. An important finding was that during exercise saturation dropped further, sometimes below fifty percent despite a huge increase in the breathing rate; this explains why climbing upwards at high altitude is extraordinarily exhausting even if feeling comfortable at rest. Later the Silver Hut was disassembled and given to Tenzing Norgay (now Director at the Mountaineering institute in Darjeeling) for the institute‚Äôs high training base in Sikkim.  The Yeti Hunt  The Yeti Hunt was to find evidence either proving or disproving the existence of the Yeti. It was supported by Marlin Perkins the Director of the Lincoln Park Zoo in Chicago well-known for the TV programme \\"Wild Kingdom\\" and he hoped that they could capture a yeti. Perkins thought that the best evidence was the 1951 photos of yeti tracks by Eric Shipton, Michael Ward and Sherpa Sen Tenzing; although these were later dismissed as a joke, with Shipton and Bill Tilman having a \\"running yeti joke\\" rivalry. Hillary said in 1984 of the 1951 photo that \\"Eric (Shipton) was a joker ... he‚Äôs gone around it (the footprint) with his knuckles, shaped the toe, pressed in the middle. There‚Äôs no animal could walk with a foot like that. He made it up ... \\" Hillary chose the Rowaling Valley to start after three weeks acclimatizing; it was reputed to be a Yeti stronghold and where the supposed 1951 photographs of Yeti footprints had been taken. Doig said he would pay for a yeti, dead or alive, or for parts. They got a supposed yeti scalp, three Tibetan blue bear skins, a goat skin, a dried human hand, two small red pandas and a fox. They set up cameras, telescopes, tripwires and capchur guns around the Ripimu Glacier at feet. At the end of October they left for the Khumbu region via the Tashi Laptsas Pass, and borrowed a 200-year old Yeti relic at the Jhumjung Monastery. Hillary and Doig took the \\"scalp\\" to Chicago in December 1960. Ama Dablam from the southwest  The Assault on Ama Dablam  A party of leader Mike Ward and Barry Bishop, Mike Gill and Wally Romanes made the first ascent to the summit of Ama Dablam on 13 March, starting on 11 March. Hillary had expected just a preliminary look at what looked to be an \\"impossibility difficult\\" challenge; he was surprised, but wondered if the Nepalese government would have a problem about (lack of) permission to climb. The difficult section, the vertical rock of the first step, had been investigated on 24 and 25 March. In 1979 Peter Hillary‚Äôs party was climbing the face when they were struck by an ice avalanche. But eight days later a message arrived from the Nepali Foreign Secretary cancelling the party‚Äôs permit to climb Makalu in view of the \\"unauthorised ascent of AMADABLAM\\"; although their permit did authorise work in the Mingbo and to \\"climb adjacent peaks\\". However, through Desmond Doig who knew the new Prime Minister Dr Tulsi Giri, Hillary got permission to continue as a \\"special case\\" after writing an unqualified apology. Possible reasons for the official displeasure were international criticism of King Mahendra for shutting down Parliament, the wide publicity given to the ascent, and even because Hillary attended the state banquet on 27 February during Queen Elizabeth‚Äôs state visit in a lounge suit rather than in a dinner suit wearing his decorations (Sir Edward (sic) Hillary and Mrs E. (sic) Hillary had been invited at the last minute). Makalu from the southwest  The Assault on Makalu  The third object of the expedition was to acclimatise a party of climbers who would summit Makalu () without oxygen. There were to be three scientific camps where the bicycle ergonometer would be used: Base Camp (), camp 3 on the neve () and Camp 5 ( on Makalu Col. At Camps 6 () and 7 () and the summit only alveolar air samples would be taken. Camp 3 was established by the end of April 1961 then Camp 4 (). Camp 2 was at Mt Makalu is the fifth-highest mountain in the world. Hillary had been at near-death on the mountain in 1954 with cerebral and pulmonary edema. On 4 May at Camp 4 he was unwell and went back to Camp 2 then Base Camp and back to Khumjung; it was the end of his days as a serious climber. But while the Silver Hut group were better acclimatized at there was no consistent difference between the two groups at on the Col. The first assault on 13 May (Gill, Romanes and Ortenberger) got above camp 6 in gale force winds but had to turn back; they found the altitude \\"much tougher than they expected.\\" The second assault team (Mulgrew & Nevison) left Camp 6 on 17 May but Mulgrew had severe chest pain from a pulmonary embolism at . and had a desperate five-day struggle back to camp 5 on the Col where Ward also suffered cerebral edema; Mulgrew had to be carried part-way by a Sherpa (Urkien). He was an appalling sight and it was a miracle he was still alive. Doig arranged a helicopter which took Mulgrew with Ward and Ang Temba from the Barun Valley () to Shanta Bhawan Hospitlal in Khatmandu His life had been saved by the efforts of Nevison, Ortenburger and the Sherpas Urkien, Pemba Tharkey, Siku and Pemba Tenzing. A third assault team of Harrison and Ward had been planned. In 1955 a French team using oxygen put nine French climbers and a Sherpa on the summit. Gill says that while pulmonary infarcts are rare, the French team in 1954 was fitter and used oxygen day and night from Camp 4 (); and also that the mountain was very windy: Jean Franco wrote that Makalu Col was \\"the kingdom of the wind\\". Everest was first climbed without oxygen by Reinhold Messner and Peter Habeler in 1978.  The Personnel  Edmund Hillary, Griffith Pugh and fellow climbers Norman Hardie, George Lowe, Peter Mulgrew, Michael Ward, John Harrison (NZ), Leigh Ortenberger (US), Wally Romanes (NZ) and American photographer Barry Bishop. Several doctors, most with expertise in respiratory physiology and also mountaineering: John West, Jim Milledge (UK), Sukhamay Lahiri (India), Tom Nevison (US, USAF) and Michael Gill (NZ, medical student). Journalist Desmond Doig from the \\"Calcutta Statesman\\" who spoke Nepali (having fought with the Gurkhas). Sherpas Siku, Dawa Tensing, Mingma Norbu and others.  Achievements  The scientific programme was an unqualified success, and the expedition became one of the classic studies in high-altitude physiology. West, Ward and Milledge wrote a textbook \\"High Altitude Medicine and Physiology\\" which by 2012 was in its fifth edition. Pugh showed that Mount Everest could be climbed without oxygen, after a period of acclimatisation; the team lived at for six months. Hillary‚Äôs search for the fabled Yeti or \\"abominable snowman\\"found no evidence, and footprints and tracks were proven to be from other causes. Hillary travelled to remote temples which contained \\"Yeti scalps\\"; however after bringing back three relics, two were shown to be from bears and one from a goat antelope. Hillary said after the expedition: \\"The yeti is not a strange, superhuman creature as has been imagined. We have found rational explanations for most yeti phenomena\\". All the Yeti relics were from Tibetan blue bears, red pandas or goats, and Hillary said that another yeti-hunt would be a \\"sheer waste of money\\" But with the permission to remove for examination a \\"Yeti scalp\\" in the Khumjung Monastery in the Khumbu region he was asked to build a school in Khumjung; this led to a new project for Hillary; schools and healthcare for Sherpas through the Himalayan Trust. While Hillary had money from books and bees, he did not get any business or diplomatic jobs in New Zealand. In January 1962 the family left for Chicago where Hillary flew every week to speak to \\"World Bookers\\" the company‚Äôs sales staff throughout America. Then he became a director of the Australasian branch of World Books for an annual salary of $10,000 (until computers replaced paper books). In January 1982 he joined the Ted Williams Sports Advisory staff of Sears Roebuck, Sears tents were provided for school-building; and a salary which increased from $1000 to $40,000 per annum.

It is noted for its exhibitionist atmosphere and popularity as a cruising destination. Described as \\"a rarified taste of old New York and the cruisy gay scene that existed [there] in the '80s and '90s\\", the venue experienced frequent police raids in the late 1990s and early 2000s under Mayor Rudy Giuliani. The bar has relocated twice, and its 2015 move up Second Avenue was initially met with community opposition. Description The Cock is one of a few remaining cruising spaces in New York City, and photography is prohibited inside. The bar consists of two levels, with the basement serving as a dark room. New York magazine describes the venue as having \\"a rollicking backroom sex scene\\". The bar's street presence is minimal, marked only by a neon sign of a rooster. It is owned by Allan Mannarelli, a straight proprietor who also operates Albion, a bar in Kips Bay, and who used to manage Superdive, a now-closed establishment in the East Village. History Interior of The Cock, 2013 The Cock opened in 1998, originally situated on Avenue A in Manhattan. Since then, it has relocated twice‚Äîmost recently in 2015, when it moved to its present Second Avenue location. In its early years, the venue hosted exhibitionist shows organized by promoter Mario Diaz. According to New York magazine, \\"[the] sordid acts and general carefree air... [attracted] not only horny young men but also plenty of spectacle-seeking celebrities,\\" including Christina Aguilera, Boy George and George Michael. The bar was raided often during Rudy Giuliani's tenure as mayor of New York City, sometimes as frequently as twice per week. It was temporarily shuttered in 2000 for being a public nuisance. After the business reopened, it ran into legal trouble when patrons continued to smoke indoors after the 2003 statewide smoking ban, but its only formal citation was dismissed. Mannarelli attempted to move The Cock to Avenue B in 2014, but the local community board rejected his application after learning that the venue would offer \\"drag shows, 'art performances', and meat pies\\". The following year, The Cock successfully relocated up Second Avenue, into a space formerly occupied by Lit Lounge. This move was met with resistance by the East Fifth Street Block Association, which opposed new venues in the nightlife-saturated neighborhood, and the locale's community board, which attempted to block the bar's liquor license. In the 2010s, The Cock was managed by Nashom Wooden, a fixture of the New York City nightlife scene who performed in drag as Mona Foot and was a member of the Ones. Wooden also worked there as a bartender. During the same period, pornographic actor Boomer Banks began his career as a go-go dancer at the bar. Reception Of The Cock's current location, New York magazine said: \\"Despite the new space, [the bar] retains its penchant for irony-laced depravity: A young and young-acting crowd swells appropriately for a variety of theme parties, with go-go dancers and DJs every night.\\" Alexander Cheves of them. magazine called the venue \\"the last filthy gay bar in New York\\", and he stated, \\"[T]here is‚Äîalarmingly‚Äîno other bar like it in the city and very few bars like it left in the country.\\" In a list titled \\"The Absolute Best Gay Bar[s] in Manhattan\\", Mike Albo of GrubStreet.com ranked The Cock second with the following remark: \\"Rough-edged, covered in band stickers, and carved with little weird nooks and dark corners, this place is like a filthy, seductive, alluring alleyway.\\" Time Out magazine wrote that The Cock \\"is just the sort of dark, sketchy dive where you can unleash your inner sexy beast. The dearth of uptown attitude (or any apparent concern for cleanliness) pulls artists, musicians, writers, fashionistos , tourists and closeted rebels, all of whom can appreciate a little dirty fun.\\" Politico called The Cock \\"the neighborhoods most notorious gay bar\\".

The killings coincided with the start of trials related to the 1994 Rwandan genocide. Biography Flors Sirera was born in Tremp and lived in Las Palmas where she worked as a nurse at the Escaleritas Health Center. In 1994, she worked at the Mugunga refugee camp, east of Zaire. She was selected by M√©decins du Monde, a non-governmental organization, to work in Rwanda due to her high professional qualifications and her previous aid experience. She moved to the African Great Lakes area in November 1996 to participate in an emergency action. She worked alongside doctor Manuel Madrazo from Seville and photographer from Madrid. After completing the mission, she asked to stay in the area to work on a project to assist small hospitals in Africa, and specifically in Rwanda, a country that was in a difficult political and social situation. Trials had just begun for crimes committed during the Rwandan genocide. In early 1997 the country was also still immersed in the First Congo War and gave support to the forces of Laurent-D√©sir√© Kabila. Killing During the night of 18 January 1997, newly installed in a new house in Ruhengeri in northwest Rwanda, next to the border with Zaire and Uganda, Flors Sirera, Manuel Madrazo, and Luis Valtue√±a (who worked as manager of administration and logistics), were shot dead by a group from the RPF. An undetermined number of Rwandans also died in the attack. Socorro Avedillo, the fourth member of the Spanish team, survived because she was in Goma, Zaire. Honors and tributes In October 1997, the singer Dyango released a new album in collaboration with the tenor Giacomo Aragall, with the song \\"Quan l'amor √©s tan gran\\" (When Love is So Great) in tribute to the slain aid worker. In 2003, a Manresa-based organization dedicated to solidarity projects was created, called Casa para la Solidaridad y la Paz Flors Sirera (Flors Sirera House for Solidarity and Peace). This organization aims to promote the culture of peace, and is a meeting space for the city's solidarity projects. In 2005 the Tremp City Council named a public park in her honor. In April 2007, Manresa paid tribute to Sirera with the participation of the director of the H√¥tel des Mille Collines in Kigali, Paul Rusesabagina, who saved thousands of Rwandans from genocide and inspired the 2004 film Hotel Rwanda. In 2015, Flors Sirera's family was presented with the Santi Vidal Award from the Manresa Red Cross, given to individuals and entities for their experience in the field of solidarity.

Reviews Stewart Wieck, the editor-in-chief of White Wolf Magazine, stated in 1988 that, although of \\"lesser quality, the character pictures could be used as visuals to help players focus on the fact that they are talking to an actual person, not a faceless bystander.\\" He also observed that, \\"If you have trouble naming characters, then the list will do you good. The diagrams are interesting and apparently historically accurate.

It was written by Godfried Toussaint, and published by Chapman & Hall/CRC in 2013 and in an expanded second edition in 2020. The Basic Library List Committee of the Mathematical Association of America has suggested its inclusion in undergraduate mathematics libraries. Author Godfried Toussaint (1944‚Äì2019) was a Belgian‚ÄìCanadian computer scientist who worked as a professor of computer science for McGill University and New York University. His main professional expertise was in computational geometry, but he was also a jazz drummer, held a long-term interest in the mathematics of music and musical rhythm, and since 2005 held an affiliation as a researcher in the Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Music Media and Technology in the Schulich School of Music at McGill. In 2009 he visited Harvard University as a Radcliffe Fellow in advancement of his research in musical rhythm. Topics In order to study rhythms mathematically, Toussaint abstracts away many of their features that are important musically, involving the sounds or strengths of the individual beats, the phasing of the beats, hierarchically-structured rhythms, or the possibility of music that changes from one rhythm to another. The information that remains describes the beats of each bar (an evenly-spaced cyclic sequence of times) as being either on-beats (times at which a beat is emphasized in the musical performance) or off-beats (times at which it is skipped or performed only weakly). This can be represented combinatorially as a necklace, an equivalence class of binary sequences under rotations, with true binary values representing on-beats and false representing off-beats. Alternatively, Toussaint uses a geometric representation as a convex polygon, the convex hull of a subset of the vertices of a regular polygon, where the vertices of the hull represent times when a beat is performed; two rhythms are considered the same if the corresponding polygons are congruent. tresillo rhythm As an example, reviewer William Sethares (himself a music theorist and engineer) presents a representation of this type for the tresillo rhythm, in which three beats are hit out of an eight-beat bar, with two long gaps and one short gap between each beat. The tresillo may be represented geometrically as an isosceles triangle, formed from three vertices of a regular octahedron, with the two long sides and one short side of the triangle corresponding to the gaps between beats. In the figure, the conventional start to a tresillo bar, the beat before the first of its two longer gaps, is at the top vertex, and the chronological progression of beats corresponds to the clockwise ordering of vertices around the polygon. The book uses this method to study and classify existing rhythms from world music, to analyze their mathematical properties (for instance, the fact that many of these rhythms have a spacing between their beats that, like the tresillo, is near-uniform but not exactly uniform), to devise algorithms that can generate similar nearly uniformly spaced beat patterns for arbitrary numbers of beats in the rhythm and in the bar, to measure the similarity between rhythms, to cluster rhythms into related groups using their similarities, and ultimately to try to capture the suitability of a rhythm for use in music by a mathematical formula. Audience and reception Toussaint has used this book as auxiliary material in introductory computer programming courses, to provide programming tasks for the students. It is accessible to readers without much background in mathematics or music theory, and Setheres writes that it \\"would make a great introduction to ideas from mathematics and computer science for the musically inspired student\\". Reviewer Russell Jay Hendel suggests that, as well as being read for pleasure, it could be a textbook for an advanced elective for a mathematics student, or a general education course in mathematics for non- mathematicians. Professionals in ethnomusicology, music history, the psychology of music, music theory, and musical composition may also find it of interest. Despite concerns with some misused terminology, with \\"na√Øvet√© towards core music theory\\", and with a mismatch between the visual representation of rhythm and its aural perception, music theorist Mark Gotham calls the book \\"a substantial contribution to a field that still lags behind the more developed theoretical literature on pitch\\". And although reviewer Juan G. Escudero complains that the mathematical abstractions of the book misses many important aspects of music and musical rhythm, and that many rhythmic features of contemporary classical music have been overlooked, he concludes that \\"transdisciplinary efforts of this kind are necessary\\". Reviewer Ilhand Izmirli calls the book \\"delightful, informative, and innovative\\". Hendel adds that the book's presentation of its material as speculative and exploratory, rather than as definitive and completed, is \\"exactly what [mathematics] students need\\".

Planned in 1911, construction of the base commenced in 1913 but was abandoned during World War I and cancelled in 1920. Temporary naval facilities subsequently existed in the state during World War II but a permanent facility was not established until 1978, when HMAS Stirling was commissioned. History Studies into the establishment of a naval base in Western Australia date back to 1887, when Sir John Coode, the head of the firm of Coode and Matthews and a respected English civil engineer, visited Australia to select a location for a naval base. He provided a report on his activities four years later, in which he suggested Cockburn Sound as a location. His recommendation was, to drill into Success and Parmelia Banks to establish whether ships could pass through the sandbanks through dredged channels to allow access to the sound. Following a visit to Australia, British Admiral Sir Reginald Henderson suggested Cockburn Sound as the location of a naval base once more in 1910, as part of a report compiled by him. At the time, the Royal Australian Navy in Western Australia consisted of fourteen men and four sail boats, based in a boats shed. Henderson's report came at a time of radical change in the plans for the Royal Australian Navy. Prior to 1909, the navy's role was a domestic and defensive one, with naval ships no larger than destroyers required for this task. From 1909, the thinking of the Australian naval staff evolved towards a blue-water navy, equipped with larger surface ships. This ambitious plan saw Australia as a major naval power in the Pacific by 1933. The events of World War I prevented the execution of such plans and the financial constraints and a return to Britain as a source of naval protection for Australia put an end to plans of a large Australian naval force altogether.Cowman, p. 43 The new Henderson Naval Base was envisioned to be home to 7,500 men, 17 armoured ships and nine submarines and to be Britain's main base in the Indian-Pacific region. The Commonwealth of Australia acquired much of the land on the coastal strip from Woodman Point in the north to Cape Peron in the south following the announcement of the future base and the land remained under federal government ownership even after the naval base plans were abandoned. Consequently, development of the area stalled and settlers moved to other areas. The official opening of the Henderson Naval Base took place on 7 May 1913, in the presence of Senator George Pearce, with speeches from Admiral Creswell and the Premier of Western Australia of the time, John Scaddan. The project suffered from unfortunate timing, starting just a year before the outbreak of World War I, and domestic issues like labour shortages and delays in the harbour dredging. By late 1913, only about 30 men worked on the Henderson Naval Base, the number of workmen having been scaled back, something that was registered with indignation in Western Australia. In 1914, Irish engineer Maurice Fitzmaurice was involved with the selection and design of the harbour, with Jervoise Bay, just south of Woodman Point, selected over Mangles Bay. The cost of construction, on top of the financial cost of the war effort, proved to be a heavy burden on Australia's economy. By 1917, ¬£1.5 million had been spend on the Henderson base, which was envisaged to cost ¬£5.5 million over a period of ten years to construct. The project was officially abandoned in 1920 in favour of a British naval base in Singapore. By 1923, the blue-water navy strategy for the Royal Australian Navy had been abandoned, the navy drastically reduced, suffering from coal shortages, and its only capital ship, HMAS Australia, scuttled a year later. Leading Australian politicians like Senator Pearce felt that, with the Washington Naval Treaty from 1922, the potential threat of Australia from Japan had been eliminated for at least the following decade.Cowman, p. 64 & 65 Legacy HMAS Warramunga and HMAS Perth at the Australian Marine Complex in 2019 Also never completed, the Perth suburb of Naval Base derives its name from the proposed facility while the suburb immediately north of it, Henderson, is named after the admiral and base. The camp facilities of the Henderson base were used for training during World War II and as public housing in the post war years. The camp was located east of the Naval Base to Rockingham road, now Cockburn Road, on the high ground south of the fence of the Woodman Point Quarantine Station. The area is now part of the Woodman Point Waste Water Treatment Plant. Fremantle was extensively used by the Australian and allied navies during World War II but no permanent base was established in Western Australia in the decades after the war. A feasibility study for Cockburn Sound was carried out in 1966 and, three years later, the Australian Government announced the construction of a naval base on Garden Island. From 1975, the new facility came in use but was officially commissioned in July 1978 as HMAS Stirling, the Fleet Base West. Henderson, today, is home to the Australian Marine Complex, a maintenance facility that serves the Royal Australian Navy.

Biography  Flight from Hungary, theological studies, and priestly ordination = His baptismal name was Mikl√≥s; his father was a mechanical engineer. As a schoolboy he attended the school run by Cistercian priests in his home town of Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r. After it was closed down by the communist government, in 1948 he transferred to the famous school run by Benedictines in Pannonhalma. He graduated in 1954 and became a clandestine Cistercian novice for Zirc Abbey in 1955; the monastery was officially suppressed at the time. His name in monastic life was Dionysius (Hungarian: D√©nes, English: Denis). After the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 he took the advice of his novice master L√≥r√°nt Sigmond (1911‚Äì1964) and abbot Vendel Endr√©dy and fled. His journey led him via Austria (Heiligenkreuz Abbey) to Rome, where he enrolled at the Benedictine university St. Anselm's. He received his doctorate there in 1962. He made his solemn vows (for Zirc) in 1960 in the Abbey of Lilienfeld. This Austrian abbey also hosted his priestly ordination in 1961. = Headmaster and abbot in Texas = Since most of the Zirc monks had fled Hungary for the US in 1954, Fr. Denis was sent to Irving, Texas in order to teach at the Our Lady of Dallas monastery school. Since the need for math teachers was great, he studied for and received a master's degree at Texas Christian University in Fort Worth. As a student, he served as the chaplain to the School Sisters of Namur, who in turn helped him learn English. He was made Headmaster of Cistercian Prep, which was rapidly becoming an elite prep school, in 1969 and ran it for 12 years. He also taught several courses at university level at the University of Dallas. He was abbot from 1988 to 2012. Under his leadership, the abbey built a new and monumental church in the trademark Cistercian style, attracting international attention and many vocations. The entire abbey was renovated in the course of the project. He died at 83, having been in ill health for several years and then contracting COVID-19. = Theologian and translator = Farkasfalvy published widely on theology, writing in English,Denis Farkasfalvy, The First Step in Spiritual Life: Conversion.

She is a professor emerita at the University of Toronto. Wigdor was the director of the University of Toronto's gerontology program, the first of its kind in Canada. She founded the Canadian Association of Gerontology and was the first editor of the Canadian Journal of Aging. She was named a member of the Order of Canada in 1989.  Biography  Wigdor (n√©e Temkin) was born in Montreal, Quebec, on June 13, 1924. Her parents were Russian Jewish immigrants. She earned an undergraduate degree from McGill University in 1941. Wigdor married engineer Leon Wigdor in 1945 and moved to Toronto. She completed a master's degree in psychology from the University of Toronto, under the supervision of Mary Louise Northway. Wigdor worked as a clinical psychologist in Toronto's Sunnybrook Hospital in the 1940s, then at Montreal's Queen Mary Veterans' Hospital. Wigdor returned to Montreal to in 1947 and began her PhD at McGill in 1949. After earning her PhD in clinical psychology in 1952, she taught at the university for another 27 years. She continued her clinical work during this time, and was named chief psychologist of Queen Mary Veterans' Hospital in 1961. At McGill, Wigdor developed an interest and specialization in gerontology. At the suggestion of collaborator Donald O. Hebb, she studied the cognitive development (including intelligence and memory) of older adults. Wigdor joined the University of Toronto in 1979 and became the founding director of its gerontology program, the first at a Canadian university. In 1989, Wigdor's book, The Over-Forty Society: Issues for Canada's Aging Population (co-written with economist David Foot), was published. The book examined the impacts of an aging population on Canadian society. In 1990, Wigdor was named chair of Canada's National Advisory Council on Aging. The same year, she oversaw the official opening of the Centre for Studies of Aging at the University of Toronto. Wigdor retired in the 1990s and became a professor emerita at the University of Toronto. Her husband, Leon, died in 1991. Wigdor remarried in 2002.

Scandals in art occur when members of the public are shocked or offended by a work of art at the time of its first exhibition or publication, (e.g. visual art, literature, scenic design, or music). The provocativeness of the scandal may relate to a controversial subject or style, being context-sensitive, according to the personality of the artist, along with transient political, religious, social, and moral factors. The Gleaners by Jean-Fran√ßois Millet seems innocuous today, but the large size of a painting, generally reserved for religious and mythological subjects, depicting the rural poor was seen by the upper class as an endorsement of the type of grievances that had erupted in the revolutionary violence of 1848, just 9 years earlier. In contrast, the 90 cans of Artist's Shit (Italian: Merda d'artista, 1961), each labeled as containing 30 grams of feces of the artist Piero Manzoni, were regarded as social commentary rather than scandal; collectors began buying the cans and they soon fetched high prices at auction; in August 2016, at an auction in Milan, can #69 sold for ‚Ç¨275,000, including auction fees. History16th century= Venus of Urbino Venus of Urbino by Titian scandalized through its profane character. Originally, the young nude woman not identified as a goddess; rather, she was reclining in a setting that could be identified as the bedchamber of Guidobaldo della Rovere, who had commissioned the painting. She was deliberately called \\"Venus\\" by Giorgio Vasari to minimize the scandal, in the context of a decree issued by the Council of Trent, imputing to artists the responsibility for everything arising from their creative representations. During 1536‚Äì1541, the profusion of nude figures in The Last Judgment raised the ire of religious authorities. In spite of this, the work continued under Popes Paul III and Julius III, but in 1564, under the order of the Council of Trent, the genitalia were painted over by the Mannerist painter Daniele da Volterra, who became known as \\"Il Braghettone\\" (\\"the breeches maker\\"). The Feast in the House of Levi (1573) by Paolo Veronese was investigated by the Roman Inquisition, who asked, \\"Does it seem suitable to you, in the Last Supper of our Lord, to represent buffoons, drunken Germans, dwarfs, and other such absurdities?\\"Transcript of Veronese's testimonyTranscript translated per Crawford, Francis Marion: \\"Salve Venetia\\". New York, 1905. Vol. II: pages 29‚Äì34. and gave him three months to make changes. Veronese simply retitled it The Feast in the House of Levi. =17th century= Saint Matthew and the Angel (1602) was refused for its triviality, the realism of the saint, and the ambiguity of the angel (original painting destroyed during World War II). Many of Caravaggio's works were rejected by his patrons, judged as being too vulgar, scandalous, like the first version of Saint Matthew and the Angel (1602). The canons of the Contarelli Chapel were appalled by the dirty legs and arms, minutely reproduced from the peasant model, and the ambiguity of the angel his side. The painting was passed over, and Caravaggio was made to do a second that conformed better to the idealized representation preferred by the churchmen, The Inspiration of Saint Matthew. Caravaggio created a stir by his provocative Conversion of Saint Paul, with its prominent portrayal of the rump of the horse, who is poised to trample the saint. The Death of the Virgin (1606), intended for the Carmelite church of Santa Maria della Scala in Trastevere, Rome, was rejected as blasphemous. =18th century= Girodet, Mlle Lange as Danae (1799) At the Salon of 1799, Girodet exhibited a painting of Mademoiselle Lange which provoked the famous actress and merveilleuse. She wrote him a letter, \\"Please, Monsieur, do me the favor of withdrawing from the exhibit a portrait which, people say, does nothing for your glory, and which compromises my reputation for beauty.\\" Furious, Girodet ripped up the original painting and made another, the Portrait of Mademoiselle Lange as Dana√´, a satirical allegory in which the heads of most figures are crowned with peacock feathers, but her husband Michel-Jean Simons, a wealthy purveyor to the French army, is represented by a turkey, while golden coins fall from the sky. In Spain, La Maja desnuda, painted sometime during 1797‚Äì1800 by Francisco Goya, shows a reclining nude with pubic hair looking at the viewer without any sense of shame. Although hung in a private room of Manuel Godoy, it came to the attention of the Spanish Inquisition in 1808, along with other works. Godoy and his curator, Don Francisco de Garivay, were brought before a tribunal and forced to reveal the artists behind the confiscated art works which were \\"so indecent and prejudicial to the public good.\\"Connell, Evan S.

Cornell University Press, 1980. In 1831, the lithograph Gargantua by Honor√© Daumier in the satirical periodical La Caricature, depicting Louis Philippe I as Gargantua, with scatological implications, resulted in six months of imprisonment for the artist. At the Salon of 1850, the monumental painting A Burial At Ornans by Gustave Courbet was denounced for the unflattering faces of the mourners and their plainness. The \\"explosive reaction\\" brought Courbet instant fame.Gustave Courbet's A Burial at Ornans, PBS Critics were divided in 1857 by The Gleaners painted by Jean-Fran√ßois Millet: some saw the gleaning women as a symbol of a popular uprising (\\"the scaffolds of 1793\\",) others complained about the realistic representation of the rural poor on a large canvas of the size reserved for religious scenes. The nudity in The Pearl and the Wave (1862) by Paul-Jacques- Aim√© Baudry was judged too \\"annoying\\" in overly resembling an actual mortal rather than a goddess viewed from afar. Painted in 1862‚Äì1863, Le D√©jeuner sur l'herbe by √âdouard Manet was exhibited at the Salon des Refus√©s in 1863, provoking scandal for both aesthetic and moral reasons. Gustave Courbet's L'Origine du monde, painted in 1866, spent most of its time in private collections up until 1995, but continued to be polemical well into the 21st century. In 1872, the painting Impression, Sunrise by Claude Monet was greeted with sarcasm for its audacity. In 1874, the atmospheric Nocturne: Blue and Gold ‚Äì Old Battersea Bridge by James Abbott McNeill Whistler was described as \\"flinging a pot of paint in the public's face\\" by critic John Ruskin; Whistler sued Ruskin for libel, and the case was brought to court in 1878. =20th century= * 1926‚Äì27 Br√¢ncu»ôi's Bird in Space is classified as a kitchen utensil, subject to duty, by U.S. Customs. \\"If that's art, hereafter I'm a bricklayer.\\" * 1934 Balthus's The Guitar Lesson, depicting a young girl nude below the waist in a sexual context, was rejected by MoMA. * 1945 April, during the final days of World War II in Europe, Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion by the then unknown Irish-born artist Francis Bacon unnerved everyone who saw it, overnight turning Bacon into the most controversial painter in the country.Chilvers, Ian. \\"A Dictionary of Twentieth-Century Art\\".

Biography  Born in the village of Zielona, near Vilnius, Karpowicz lived there until the outbreak of World War II in 1939. Karpowicz debuted as a journalist in 1941 under the pseudonym Tadeusz Lirmian for the Vilnius-based newspaper Prawda Wile≈Ñska. During the Nazi occupation of Vilnius he was a member of the Polish underground resistance movement. When the war came to an end in 1945, Karpowicz was resettled to Szczecin where he worked for Polish Radio. It was here Karpowicz published his first prose piece titled \\"Legendy pomorskie\\" (Pomeranian Legends). Karpowicz moved to Wroc≈Çaw studied Polish philology at Wroclaw University where he received his M.A. and Ph.D. and became an assistant professor. He later received the Literary Prize of the City of Wroclaw in 1958. =Life after leaving Poland= In 1971, Karpowicz received the prestigious fellowship of the \\"Foundation pour une Entraide Intellectuelle Europeenne\\" in Paris. Two years later in 1973 he was invited to join International Working Program at the University of Iowa. In 1974, he was appointed visiting associate professor of Polish literature at the University of Illinois at Chicago, where he taught for two years. Although he has never received any official literary awards in Poland because of his stance as a political dissident, he was awarded the prestigious Alfred Jurzykowski Prize in New York City and was twice a recipient of the Illinois Arts Council Annual Award. He spent the next two years in West Germany (1976‚Äì78) in Bonn, West Berlin, Munich, and Regensburg Universities. In 1978, he returned to the University of Illinois at Chicago Department of Slavic Languages and Literatures as a full professor. After Lithuania declared its independence in 1990, Karpowicz wrote several articles in the Polish press encouraging Poland to recognize Lithuania. Karpowicz retired from the now Department of Slavic and Baltic Literatures at the University of Illinois at Chicago in 1993. Karpowicz died on June 26, 2005 at his home in Oak Park, Illinois. He was buried on August 3, 2005 along with his wife Maria in Osobowice Cemetery in Wroc≈Çaw. Legacy Contemporary Polish-Italian sculptor Krzysztof Micha≈Ç Bednarski dedicated his 2016 art exhibition Gravity to Karpowicz. It was announced in 2019 that Karpowicz's villa in Wroc≈Çaw would become the future home of the Nobel Laureate Olga Tokarczuk's Foundation. Aside from Tokarczuk, Agnieszka Holland and Ireneusz Grin will join her on the foundation's board of directors.

His brother Henry Sainsbury was a Member of the Legislative Assembly for Creswick from 1877 to 1880. After school Sainsbury worked as a junior clerk at the Oriental Bank Corporation.  Police career  Sainsbury joined Victoria Police on 17 May 1878, he was assigned registered number 2944 and was appointed to Colac as a mounted constable.

After the retirement of Thomas O'Callaghan, Sainsbury was appointed Acting Chief Commissioner of Police and then formally appointed to the role on 1 April 1913. Taking command of the force for the duration of World War 1 Sainsbury had to oversee a wide range of extra duties undertaken by Victoria Police, including alien registrations, internments and the investigation and arrest of military deserters. It also included working with military intelligence conducting surveillance and investigations. His tenure as chief commissioner also saw the appointment of the first woman police constables in Victoria and formation of the Police Association of Victoria in 1917. Sainsbury had initially blocked attempts to form the association believing it to be against the principles of the semi-military nature of the police force.

Hamburg-Harburg. * Engineer Replacement Battalion 30. L√ºbeck. * Fahr Replacement Detachment 10. Neum√ºnster. * Kraftfahr Replacement Detachment 10. Hamburg-Alsterdorf. On 15th April 1942, Wolff was replaced as divisional commander by Emil Markgraf. Markgraf was then replaced by Justin von Obernitz on 22 June 1942, who was in turn replaced by Albert Newiger on 1 November 1942. Also on 1 November 1942, as part of the reorganization of the Replacement Army, the replacement battalions of the 160th Division were formed into the 520th Regiment and transferred to Division No. 190. Newiger was replaced as divisional commander by Ernst Hammer on 10 November 1942. Hammer would command the 190th Division until the end of the war. On 1 April 1943, the 20th Motorized Regiment was taken out of Division No. 190 and put directly under the supervision of the Wehrkreis as Commander of Panzer Troops X. In December 1943, Division No. 190 consisted of the following elements: * Grenadier Replacement Regiment 30.Battalions: 6, 46, 490. L√ºbeck. * Grenadier Replacement Regiment 520.Battalions: 26, 209, 220, 333, 376, 377, 469. Schleswig. * Artillery Replacement Regiment 225.Detachments: 30, 58, 290. Itzehoe. * Engineer Replacement and Training Battalion 20. Hamburg-Harburg. * Engineer Replacement and Training Battalion 30. L√ºbeck. * Fahr Replacement and Training Detachment 10. Neum√ºnster. * Kraftfahr Replacement Detachment 10. Hamburg-Alsterdorf * Kraftfahr Training Detachment 10. Wentorf. In response to the British paratrooper landings near Arnhem that were part of the Allied Operation Market Garden, the codeword \\"Alarm K√ºste\\" was given out to all replacement units of Wehrkreis X, including Division No. 190 on 18 September 1944. These forces were hurriedly deployed to the Netherlands for combat. The combat strength of the division, which had been reinforced by the Commander of Panzer Troops X, was as follows, for a total of 9607 personnel: * Divisional HQ: 190 personnel. * Commander of Panzer Troops X, with Grenadier Replacement and Training Battalions 76 and 90, as well as Field Replacement Battalion 90: 1960 personnel. * Grenadier Replacement Regiment 30, with Grenadier Replacement and Training Battalions 6 and 46, as well as Grenadier Replacement Battalion 469: 2105 personnel. * Grenadier Replacement Regiment 520, with Grenadier Replacement Battalions 26 and 376: 2235 personnel. * Artillery Replacement and Training Regiment (mot.) 225, with Artillery Replacement and Training Detachments 30 and 58: 980 personnel. * Panzerj√§ger Replacement and Training Detachment 20: 674 personnel. * Engineer Replacement and Training Battalions 20: 785 personnel. * Supply Troops 180: 645 personnel. Near Nijmegen, Division No. 190 clashed with Allied forces including the American 82nd Airborne Division. = 190th Infantry Division = On 4 November 1944, Division No. 190 was restructured into the 190th Infantry Division. Its divisional structure was as follows, with each of the three Grenadier Regiments consisting of two battalions each: * Grenadier Regiment 1224. * Grenadier Regiment 1225. * Grenadier Regiment 1226. * Division Fusilier Battalion 190. * Panzerj√§ger Detachment 1190 (later Panzerj√§ger Detachment 190). * Artillery Regiment 890. * Intelligence Detachment 1190. * Engineer Battalion 1190. * Field Replacement Battalion 1190. * Supply Troops 1190. This promotion made the 190th Infantry Division one of the few units to be restructured directly from a replacement division into a full infantry division, whereas most comparable formations first had to go through the stage of reserve divisions. In March 1945, the division's strength was refreshed in the Hilversum-Utrecht area. Following an order on 4 April 1945, the division was dissolved and most of its soldiers used to reinforce the newly formed Infantry Division Ulrich von Hutten. The divisional staff of the 190th Division continued to exist until 13 April 1945, when the division's commanding general, Ernst Hammer, was captured in the Ruhr Pocket.  Noteworthy individuals  * Kurt Wolff, divisional commander starting 17 May 1940. * Emil Markgraf, divisional commander starting 15 April 1942. * Justin von Obernitz, divisional commander starting 22 June 1942. * Albert Newiger, divisional commander starting 1 November 1942. * Ernst Hammer, divisional commander starting 10 November 1942.

It forms part of the Low Prussian dialect that was spoken in the region before the mass-expulsion of the speakers following the end of World War II. Nowadays, Danzig German is only passed within families. Famous modern speakers are G√ºnter Grass, Klaus Kinski, and Donald Tusk History In the 12th century, a German merchant settlement in the area of today's Long Market of Gdansk arose, close to a Prussian- Kashubian language Kashubian settlement, creating a language contact between Slavic languages, Baltic languages, and Germanic languages. The settlement attracted more German settlers, mainly from Lower Saxony, Westphalia and Hannover, whose Low German language became the dominating language. As subject of the Teutonic Order the town grew to a German town granted Magdeburg law. As part of the Hanseatic League, the town acquired a Platt dialect that also derived elements from the Dutch, Russian, and from local Polish language and Kashubian as well. For example, 'pl√ªz', zuk, Pomuchel (cod), Kujel (boar) are borrowings from the neighboring Polish language. The city's official communication employed Low German until 1563, when a letter in Low German was sent to Nieuport, while neighboring Elbing and Braunsberg switched to High German already in the middle of the 15th century. With the spread of High German through education, Danzig Platt was spoken only by a small fraction of the city's population. Still, a Danzig Platt literature started to evolve at the end of the 18th century. After havin switched to High German, the major part of the town came to speak Danziger Missingsch, a Middle Low German dialect as part of the adjacent Low Prussian dialects. When Danzig became loyal to Polands along with Royal Prussia, German was maintained as the town's language. Linguistic properties  Danzig Platt deviated significantly from North German Platt. While Platt has the pronunciations \\"maken\\" (to make), \\"slapen\\" (to sleep), \\"seggen\\" (to say), \\"vertellen\\", in Danzig Platt the pronunciations are \\"moake\\", \\"schloape\\", \\"saje\\", \\"vertalle\\". mochum Walter Petter, \\"Vom Danziger Deutsch\\".

Danzig Missingsch, as other Middle Low German dialects, employ spirantization of initial \\"g\\" to \\"j\\" in e.g. \\"jelaufen\\" (walked) instead of High German \\"gelaufen\\". Typical for Danzig Missingsch is the wide use of the diminutive \\"-chen\\", such as \\"was-chen\\" (what is the matter?)- Danzig German typically deviated in employing grammatical feminine genus for words that are masculine in High German such as \\"die Weiz\\" (der Weizen - the wheat) and \\"Die Taback\\" instead of \\"der Taback\\" (the tobacco), and employing neutral genus for words that are masculine in High German such as \\"das Monat\\" \\"das Leib\\" LiteratureReferences Category:German dialects Category:History of Gda≈Ñsk ","title":"Danzig German"},{"id":"64050919","title":"Women's Professional Soccer on television"},{"id":"64050985","text":"Finbarr Donnelly (25 April 1962 ‚Äì 18 June 1989) was a singer and songwriter from Northern Ireland, best known as the vocalist with the post-punk band Five Go Down to the Sea?

He met guitarist Ricky Dineen in 1978, and having bonded over a shared interest in UFOs, they formed a band, initially known as Nun Attax that year. The band grew a live following in Cork, centered around gigs in the Arcadia ballroom.

But they were good to have in the club if there was ever any threat of violence.\\" According to writer David Cavanagh, during band's gigs at the Living Room, \\"Donnelly...snatched pints from the hands of people in the crowd, and shouted surreal, Flann O'Brien-esque lyrics while his colleagues clonked out ramshackle, all-elbows rhythms.\\" Creation Records head Alan McGee remembers that \\"they were bananas.

Dineen had been out with him that day, and they had planned to meet up at a pub later in the evening. Dineen was there with his girlfriend, along another of their female friends. He said \\"It was just an accident. It was one of those boiling hot days that you get in London in the summer. We were in Hyde Park and it was a natural thing for Donnelly to take of his clothes down to his jocks and go for a swim. He took off and the lifeguard people came out on a boat and tried to get him out. Mischievous person that Finbarr was, he tried to go under the boat, and he didn't come up. I think he got caught in the undergrowth underneath the water. We were sitting down having a few cans or whatever it was at the time, with girlfriends, shooting the breeze.\\" Dineen later said, \\"If you went out for the craic with your friends on a Sunday afternoon and one of them didn‚Äôt come back, it‚Äôs surreal like. Even though we were both 27, you‚Äôre still young. It changes your whole life because we went from planning our future, thinking we were going to be in England for a while, to the next minute being on the flight back to Ireland.\\" The planned second single was never released.

They instead encountered endless thick forest, which they cleared over several years with axes and handshaws. The timbers, stump and logs were then burnt. Some of this work was done by cheap labourers on farming cadetships. A meeting of residents at a stump led to the opening of a school in 1894. The school house was the first public building in the area. By about 1895, the farming community had its own rugby team.

Patel is the recipient of the prestigious Ten Outstanding Young Persons of World (1997) award, Outstanding Woman Panchayat Leader of India award, and was awarded the Jagdish K Patel Award by the President of India.  Early life  Patel was born in a farming family in Changa village of Petlad taluka in Gujarat‚Äôs Anand district, about 120 km from Ahmedabad. Her father was previously the village sarpanch; both she and her sister have been visually-impaired since birth. She reveals that she is alive today only because a good harvest the year she was born that prevented her parents from infanticide as some villagers thought her to be lucky as Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth. Patel is the first blind post-graduate in law from the Sardar Patel University in Anand, Gujarat, India. Due to her gender and her disability, she turned heads when she expressed her desire to become the sarpanch, but won elections to become the first woman sarpanch of her village.

Returning to Lisbon she founded the Radiochemistry Laboratory, where she continued her research for three decades. Career Marques' father died when she was just eight years old. After high school she joined the University of Lisbon. From there she graduated in Physics and Chemistry from the Faculty of Sciences. Having turned down a chance to do geological work in Angola, she taught at the faculty after her graduation in 1926, where she was the only woman carrying out teaching or research in chemistry. She married Ant√≥nio Silva Sousa Torres (1876-1958), professor at the Faculty of Sciences of the University of Lisbon, but only on condition that she could go to Paris to study for a Doctorate. Wishing to specialize in radioactivity, she applied for and received a grant from the National Education Board () to study in 1931-32 at the Radium Institute in Paris (now the Curie Institute) on radioactivity topics. At her husband‚Äôs request she was accompanied by her mother. Impressed by Marques‚Äô work, Curie wrote to the Portuguese government in 1932 requesting an extension of her fellowship but the grant was not renewed. However, the Institute found a way to allow her to continue with her research, which was later turned into work on a doctoral thesis. In her first three years she worked under the guidance of Marie Curie and, in the last year, after Curie‚Äôs death, under the supervision of Andr√©-Louis Debierne. Her notes of classes given by Curie and Debierne form part of her valuable scientific estate. In 1935 she defended her doctoral thesis on Nouvelles recherches sur le fractionnement des sels de baryum radif√®re (New research on the fragmentation of radiferous barium salts) at the Sorbonne University. With the support of two Nobel Prize winners, Jean Baptiste Perrin and Fr√©d√©ric Joliot-Curie, her Doctorate was awarded with three honourable mentions, the highest grade possible. She published her results in three articles in 1936 in the Journal de Chimie Physique and also published six articles in the Comptes rendus de l'Acad√©mie des Sciences of Paris. Despite being invited to continue her research career in Paris, Marques chose to return to Lisbon and resumed her activity at the Faculty of Sciences, where she developed research in the field of radioactivity. In 1936, she created the Radiochemistry Laboratory, which led, in 1953, to the formation of the Centre for Radiochemistry Studies of the Nuclear Energy Studies Commission. She continued to be the Director of the Centre until well after her formal retirement from the university. On her return to Lisbon Marques had been awarded a Doctorate in Physical-Chemical Sciences, on the strength of her French qualifications. She continued to do research on nuclear chemistry and radiochemistry and on the therapeutic applications of radioisotopes. She published regularly in Portuguese and international journals. However, despite her excellent qualifications, her career progression was relatively slow. The fact that she was a woman in a profession dominated by men appears to have been a major cause of this. She is quoted as saying that men considered it an insult to have to work with women. A contributory factor was that research was not a high priority in her university at that time: the laboratory she established was the first at the university. She finally became a full Professor only in 1966, when she was the first woman to obtain a Chair in Chemistry at a Portuguese university. Towards the end of her professional life she developed serious problems with her eyesight. In October 1967 she attended ceremonies in Paris to mark the 100th anniversary of the birth of Marie Curie. Branca Edm√©e Marques died on 19 July 1986 at the age of 87. In September 2009, the Lisbon City Council approved the name Branca Edm√©e Marques for a street in the university area as a way to honour her achievements.

Geography Augherskea is bounded on the north by the townlands of Baronstown and Mooretown, on the east by Bedfanstown, Cultromer, Kilcooly, Knockmark and Merrywell, on the south by Culmullin and on the west by Tullaghmedan & Warrenstown. The early Ordnance Survey maps show the hamlets of Old Cross Keys and Cross Keys (Irish= Croseochracha, named after a signboard on the local pub showing keys) situated in the townland. Its chief geographical features are the Derrypatrick River, spring wells, a dug well and a gravel pit. Augherskea is bisected by the regional R154 road (Ireland) and R125 road (Ireland). The townland covers 656 statute acres. History In medieval times the townland belonged to Kingdom of Meath. It is probable that it belonged to the medieval church of Knockmark as an early medieval burial ground has been found in the townland. After the Norman Invasion of Ireland, Meath was granted to Hugh de Lacy, Lord of Meath. In 1186 he was killed and the lands passed to his son Walter de Lacy, Lord of Meath. In 1200 Walter granted his lands in the parish of Knockmark (which would have included Augherskea) to the Abbey of Saint Thomas Becket in Thomas Street, Dublin. This reinforces the theory that it was church land originally. The townland would have been owned by the abbey until 25 July 1539 when King Henry VIII of England appropriated the lands during his Dissolution of the Monasteries. The earliest surviving mention of the townland name is in 'The Rental Book of Gerald Fitzgerald, Ninth Earl of Kildare. Begun in the Year 1518', which mentions- The myll of Aghersketh. Other early references are- 1. Probate to the will of James Talbot of Agherskeethe issued on 24 April 1584; 2. 'The Irish Statute Staple Books' for 12 May 1597, where it is spelled Agherneskine. The Down Survey map of Meath depicts it as Aghersken with several crosses beside the name, again indicating it was church land. The 1836 Ordnance Survey map also depicts part of the townland as Glebe land, again indicating it belonged to the church. The Tithe Applotment Books for 1829 (which spells it as 'Agherstown') list 16 tithepayers in the townland. Griffith's Valuation of 1857 lists 41 landholders in the townland. In the 1901 census of Ireland, there are twenty families listed in the townland.Census of Ireland 1901 In the 1911 census of Ireland, there were 61 people listed in the townland.Census of Ireland 1911 Antiquities * A medieval burial ground. * Old photos of Augherskea ReferencesExternal links *The IreAtlas Townland Data Base Category:Towns and villages in County Meath Category:Townlands of County Meath ","title":"Augherskea"},{"id":"64051389","text":"The Myrskyl√§ church village (also known as Myrskyl√§; , ) is a village and the administrative center in the municipality by the same name in Eastern Uusimaa.

She first appears in the early Welsh Myrddin poems and in the 12th-century Latin Vita Merlini by Geoffrey of Monmouth, where she is represented as being a figure in the Old North of Britain, the sister of Myrddin or Merlin, and a prophet in her own right. Geoffrey also makes her the wife of the northern king Rhydderch Hael. She was remembered in Welsh traditions recorded in the 16th century by Elis Gruffydd, and even as late as the 18th century. Since the late 19th century she has occasionally appeared as Merlin's sister or lover in Arthurian fiction, poetry and drama by writers such as Laurence Binyon, John Cowper Powys, John Arden, Margaretta D'Arcy and Stephen R. Lawhead.  Early Welsh verse  Gwenddydd first appears in literature as a character in those early Welsh poems that became associated with the poet and warrior Myrddin Wyllt, and in Geoffrey of Monmouth's Latin verse Vita Merlini. The relationship between these poems is contested. The poems Afallennau (\\"The Apple-trees\\") and Oianau or Hoianau (\\"The Greetings\\") both give us the prophecies of a wild man somewhere in the Old North (southern Scotland and northern England); he is not identified in either poem, but later generations were agreed in identifying him, correctly or not, with Myrddin. Gwenddydd is not said to be the wild man's sister in Afallennau, and indeed it has been argued that in the original form of the legend she was Myrddin's fairy lover; however she is twice mentioned in the poem, the poet complaining that Similarly, Oianau refers to her in the phrase \\"Gwenddydd does not come to me\\". Cyfoesi Myrddin a Gwenddydd ei Chwaer (\\"The Conversation of Myrddin and His Sister Gwenddydd\\") establishes their family relationship, and is unique among the Welsh Myrddin poems in showing Gwenddydd and her brother on friendly terms. Myrddin prophesies political events culminating in his own death and the end of the world, while Gwenddydd, herself a seer in this poem, questions him in a respectful manner and shows herself concerned about Myrddin's welfare. The poem ends with them commending each other to heaven. Gwasgargedd Fyrddin yn y Bedd (\\"The Diffused Song of Myrddin in the Grave\\"), another vaticinatory poem, has been seen as a sequel to Cyfoesi. In a passage of reminiscence Myrddin makes one obscure reference to Gwenddydd: Finally, Peirian Faban (\\"Commanding Youth\\") contains more prophecies and mentions both Myrddin and Gwenddydd. Gwenddydd predicts that  Vita Merlini  The Vita Merlini is a Latin poem by Geoffrey of Monmouth, written probably in 1150 or 1151, describing events in the life of Myrddin, or as Geoffrey calls him, Merlinus. The poem begins with Merlinus going mad after a horrendous battle, and running off to live as a wild man in the Caledonian Forest. His sister Ganieda and her husband Rodarchus, king of the Cumbrians, discover his whereabouts and bring him back to their court, where he has to be chained to prevent him returning to the woods. When Merlinus sees a leaf in Ganieda's hair he laughs, but refuses to explain his laughter unless he is freed. When this is done he tells Rodarchus that the leaf got into Ganieda's hair when she lay outdoors with her lover. Ganieda then seeks to discredit Merlinus by a trick. She produces a boy on three different occasions, dressed in different costume every time to disguise his identity, and asks her brother each time how he will die. The first time Merlinus says he will die in a fall from a rock, the second time that he will die in a tree, and the third time that he will die in a river. Rodarchus is thus persuaded that Merlinus can be fooled, and that his judgement is not to be trusted. The author now explains that in later years the boy fell from a rock, was caught in the branches of a tree beneath it, and being entangled there upside down with his head in a river he drowned. Merlinus returns to the woods, but after various adventures he is captured and taken back to Rodarchus's court. There he sees first a beggar and then a young man buying leather to patch his shoes, and he laughs at each of them. Rodarchus again offers Merlinus his freedom if he will explain why he laughed, and Merlinus answers that the beggar was unknowingly standing over buried treasure and that the young man's fate was to drown before he could wear his repaired shoes. When Merlinus' words are confirmed Rodarchus lets him go. Back in the woods Merlinus watches the stars in an observatory Ganieda has made for him, and prophesies the future history of Britain as far as the Norman kings. Rodarchus dies and Ganieda grieves for him. She and Rodarchus' visitor Telgesinus go to the woods to see Merlinus, and they discourse on various subjects. It is resolved that they will all remain together in the woods, in retirement from the secular world. The poem ends with a prophecy from Ganieda detailing events in the reign of King Stephen, and a renunciation by Merlinus of his own prophetic gift in her favour. Ganieda is, according to the Vita's editor Basil Clarke, the best- realised character in the poem apart from Merlinus himself, being shown as intelligent, practical, resourceful and, unusually for a female character in medieval lierature, prophetic. Her name and much of her story demonstrate her identity with the Gwenddydd of the Myrddin poems, but her position as wife of Rodarchus and as the adulteress with the leaf in her hair both have analogues in the character of Languoreth in the early Welsh story of Lailoken. It has also been suggested that Geoffrey's Ganieda may in part be inspired by the example of his contemporary Christina of Markyate, a well-born Anglo-Saxon lady who escaped an arranged marriage to become a hermit and clairvoyant.  Later Welsh tradition  The Chronicle of the Six Ages, by the early 15th- century soldier Elis Gruffydd, includes a collection of traditional stories about Myrddin. In one section we learn that Myrddin ran mad in the wilds of Nant Conwy in North Wales, that he prophesied, and that his sister Gwenddydd supplied him with food and drink. Gwenddydd has five dreams at various times, and eventually she comes to Myrddin and asks him to explain them, which he does in a vein of social criticism that calls to mind William Langland's Piers Plowman. A somewhat expanded version of the account of the five dreams also occurs in a late 17th-century manuscript written by Thomas ab Ieuan of Tre'r Bryn. Both seem to derive from an orally transmitted version which cannot be dated, though it seems to be quite independent of the Vita Merlini. A manuscript dated to c. 1640, now among the British Library Additional manuscripts, includes a prose Prophetic Mabinogi of Merddin and Gwenddydd. In the 18th century the poet Lewis Morris recorded an Anglesey folk-tale in which a young man, the young woman he loves, a middle-aged woman and a widow are in contention as to which of them the man should marry, and consult Myrddin and his sister Gwenddydd to resolve the issue. There are points of similarity which suggest some relationship with Elis Gruffydd's account of Myrddin's madness.  Modern literature  In 1870 the Scottish Arthurian scholar John Stuart-Glennie published The Quest for Merlin, the first in a projected but uncompleted cycle of five dramas collectively entitled King Arthur; or, The Drama of the Revolution. Set during the reign of Vortigern, it promotes the author's creed of \\"Nature-worship of Heathenism and the Fraternal Sentiment of Christianity\\", which is to be embodied in Merlin. One of its characters is Ganieda, who tells her brother that Merlin (1889), is a verse play by Professor John Veitch, with only three characters: Merlin, \\"Gwendydd (The Dawn) - His twin sister\\", and \\"Hwimleian (The Gleam) - His early love\\". Gwendydd is in Veitch's words \\"redolent of the nature-worship and the poetry of the time\\"; she redeems her brother from madness. It was one of the sources of Tennyson's poem Merlin and the Gleam. The first part of an unfinished work by Laurence Binyon, The Madness of Merlin, was posthumously published in 1947 in an edition by Gordon Bottomley. In this verse play, based largely on the Vita Merlini, Geoffrey's Ganieda is split into two characters, Merlin's sister Gwyndyth and Redderch's queen Langoreth. Their attitudes to Merlin in his madness are contrasted: Gwyndyth patient and comforting, Langoreth exasperated with how well he is being treated. The writer John Cowper Powys used the Gwenddydd of the Welsh poem Cyfoesi Myrddin a Gwenddydd as the basis of his Gwendydd, sister of Myrddin, in his Porius (1951), a historical novel set in the year 499. She has been described as \\"one of the most memorable minor characters\\". The Island of the Mighty is an epic drama in three parts by John Arden and Margaretta D'Arcy, first performed, in a truncated form, in December 1972 by the Royal Shakespeare Company at the Aldwych Theatre, London. Gwenddydd, played in the RSC production by Heather Canning, is not in this play Merlin's sister but his estranged wife. Merlin (1988), the second novel in Stephen R. Lawhead's Pendragon Cycle, introduces the character of Ganieda in one episode as the title-character's lover rather than his sister. In the 1995 novelette Namer of Beasts, Maker of Souls, by Jessica Amanda Salmonson, Merlin has a twin-sister called Ganicenda, described as \\"Divine Wisdom, with her head in heaven and her feet in Sheol\\". The American academic Jerry Hunter's Welsh-language novel Gwenddydd [cy] (2010) takes the story of Gwenddydd and Myrddin from the earliest Welsh poems and the Vita Merlini, and transposes it to the Second World War, Myrddin becoming a soldier suffering from PTSD who escapes from a military hospital and reunites with his sister Gwen in the family's home village. It won the at the 2010 National Eisteddfod of Wales, and has been called \\"an important contribution to war literature in Wales\\".  Works of art  In 1891 the German-born, British-naturalized artist Hubert Herkomer, a Royal Academician, produced a drypoint engraving of Gwenddydd. His interest in the subject was confirmed in 1893 when he chose the same name for his lastborn daughter. The Breton sculptor Louis-Henri Nicot's bas-relief Tali√©sin et Gani√©da (1925) forms part of the Monument n√©oceltique produced for the International Exhibition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts in Paris.

In Namibian service, it was utilized in the coastal patrol role. The ship was decommissioned 12th August 2012 By President Hifikepunye Pohamba. It was revealed during the decommissioning ceremony that it was intended to be at sea for only two years before mid life upgrades for the hull structure, piping and wiring systems and to the main and auxiliary engines had to be undertaken which could not happen due to financial constraints. During it service with Namibia the Ship spent 24 days at sea covering 5127 miles. Name The ship was named after Lieutenant General Dimo Hamaambo the First Namibian Chief of Defence Force. General Hamaambo was Chief of Defence between 1990 and 2000, a period in which the formative steps were taken to establish the Maritime wing of the Namibian Military.

History Several European farmers bought freehold land in the area in the 1870s and 1800s and began settling it. They cleared dense standing forest, laid grass, subdivided it into paddocks for sheep and cattle, and built roads. Alexander Perry, who was born in Wellington in 1852, purchased 900 acres in 1877. He died in 1894, leaving a large laid-out homestead to his two sons. Thomas Taylor purchased 380 acres in 1877. He was contracted to provide supplies for building a railway through the area in the 1880s and took up positions on the road board, hospital board and farmer's alliance, but did not move to the area until 1889. Taylor who was born in Staffordshire, England in 1843, educated in Wolverhampton, armed in Birmingham, mined for gold on the West Coast, managed a large butchery in Fiji, and ran a store in Turakina before raising the money to purchase the Kiwitea site. James Barrow, who was born in Johnsonville in 1852 and had been farming with his father in Pauatahanui, purchased 300 acres in 1878. William Morton, who was born in Yorkshire, England in 1848 and moved to Rangitikei in 1870, purchased 150 acres in 1882 and purchased another 220 acres in 1891. By 1897, he was farming about 700 sheep, 100 cattle and 20 milking cows for the local creamery, and was a member of the local council. A school was established in the area in 1884. Schoolmaster Richard French, a native of King's County, Ireland and graduate of Trinity College, Dublin, arrived in 1886 and took over the school in 1890. A school house was built on an acre section in 1891. In 1897, the Cyclopedia of New Zealand described Kiwitea as a \\"little settlement\\", four miles from the telegraph office in Cheltenham, and connected by daily coach trips to the nearest market town, Feilding. The school had a roll of 40, and was \\"well ventilated\\" and \\"well conducted\\". Mr. Foster's Store provided a daily mail service and general products. The owner was born in Devonport, England, settled in Foxton in 1874, and took over the store in 1893. Education Kiwitea School is a co- educational state primary school for Year 1 to 8 students, with a roll of as of . The school tripled its roll between 2017 and 2019. This bucked a long- term trend: three of the seven local had closed between 2014 and 2019. As of 2019, students from Feilding made up a quarter of the school's roll, with many parents preferring the open country atmosphere. The annual Lamb and Calf Day is a long tradition at Kiwitea School, featuring lamb, calf and vegetable scuplting competitions.

In the period of 1917 to 1924 she was one of the best Frisian kortebaan speed skaters. She won a total of 48 first prizes. Biography As a little girl, skating did not go very well. As a teenager, she became good at it, skating on Lantinga skates. She won her first prize in Oldeboorn on 24 January 1917 at a comptition with men's and women's where she finished second. On 26 January she competed, together with her brother Piet in Oldeboorn, winning the fourth prize. On 28 January she won for the second time a first prize in Terhorne. Days after this victory she won many 9 other races, including winning a golden watch in Bolsward. In later years she won many more competitions and was one of the best Frisian speed skaters. Her main rivals were: Feikje Rijpkema, Rienkje Paulusma and Gelsche Brouwer. Martha had a clear opinion about agreements who would win a competition and sharing the prize money (In Frisian sharingjen). Hemminga never shared because, in her opinion, sharing is like coming home with honor without money or coming home with money and without honor. Hemminga usually signed up for competitions via the Leeuwarder Courant the local news paper, which was delivered to their farm by post around noon every day. However, if the mail came too late, she was unable to register in time, and missed competitions. Sometimes she went to competitions by train. If it was possible she went on skates. If the ice wasn't strong enough, she walked. Sometimes it was a long journey across dark dikes and muddy trails, using a stall lantern if it was dark. For example, in February 1917, she went skating from Oldeboorn to Sloten where she won the competition. Arriving there, she had to compete in the first round against the strongest skater. For most competition the first round was a random draw who had to skate against who. According to Hemminga this method was not fair of organizing competitions. She also didn't like the timing races (instead of racing against each other). Hemminga could ride the 120 metre in 12 seconds (Bolsward, 1917) and the 160 metre in 16.8 seconds (Leeuwarden, 1922). During the last years of her career she lost of rising stars like Janna van der Meulen who was seven years younger. During the competition in Warga on 17 January 17 1924, Hemminga would have said to Van der Meulen: \\"Be a bit easy with me today, because I've been up all night, many of our pigs got piglets\\". Poet Cornelis Kasje wrote the poem about the Hemminga and Van der Meulen: Daar staat ze weer, die stoere ijsvorstin, Zij zal haar krachten nog eens tonen. Maar naast haar staat een jonge ijsheldin. Een nieuwe ster op het ijs, uit Frieslands schonen. Twee sterren op het ijs, een glorieuze kracht. De een straks zacht verbleekt, de ander een schitterpracht. Personal Hemminga was born on a form on Sitebuorren near Grou. She was one of the youngest the family Hemminga, consisting of 11 children. Her brother, Piet, was also a speed skater. She married Ruurd Jacobx Draaisma on 9 May 1923 in Grou. Hemminga is the aunt of successful speed skater Trijntje Hemminga. Achievements 300px List is not complete.

It is located on the Oroua River, just north of where the river meets Manawat≈´ River, and south- east if Himatangi. The settlement was known for many years as Oroua Bridge, but was renamed Rangiotu in honour of the local RangitƒÅne chief, Hoani Meihana Te Rangiotu. Te Rangimarie Marae was built in 1858 to commemorate peace between NgƒÅti Raukawa and RangitƒÅne. The marae currently runs programmes for schools, teaching the MƒÅori history of Manawat≈´. HistoryEarly history= A school was built at Oroua Bridge in 1896 on 2 acres of land gifted by Enereta Te Rangiotu. It later changed its name to Rangiotu School. Rangiotu Memorial Hall was opened on 18 October 1905 as a basic square building, using donations from the local community. In 1915, Manawaroa Te Awe Awe allowed the Government to use part of his farm as a military training camp for World War One, to replace the Trentham Military Camp that had to be evacuated. An engineer laid out the camp, to ensure it did not have the same draining, sanitation and water supply issues as Trentham. The camp was originally based on the Rangiotu School, and Rangiotu Memorial Hall was expanded to help accommodate the soldiers. The camp was later moved by hand one mile west, opposite Pyke's Road. The 3000 acre site could accommodate 2000 men, with a ban on wheeled vehicles to avoid cutting up the land. A photograph of the camp, held in the collection of the National Library of New Zealand, shows rows of cone tents laid out across a flat field. =Post-war history= The memorial hall was extended again in 1945 to welcome soldiers returning from World War II. Te Rangimarie Marae opened in 1858. In 1976, plans were drawn up for a playing field and speedway in Rangiotu, near the Hikatoto burial ground and Te Rangimarie Marae. A sound barrier was proposed as a way of reducing noise. In 1996, the Government closed down the Rangiotu School, with a roll of 24 pupils and four classrooms, as part of nationwide closures. The Government agreed to a request from Te Awe Awe family to return the donated school land back to RangitƒÅne ownership. Facilities Rangiotu Memorial Hall has a capacity for 110 people and hosts Anzac Day services, a weekly craft club, an annual community Christmas Party, and school and private events. It has also acted as a Civil Defence Centre during several floods. Rangiotu also has a war memorial, commemorating about 60 local men who died during World War I and World War II.

He was the Captain of the aircraft carrier during the Indo- Pakistani War of 1971 for which he was decorated with India's second-highest military decoration, the Maha Vir Chakra. He last served as the second Director General of the Indian Coast Guard from 1980 to 1982. Early life Parkash was born on 3 September 1923 to Pandit Milkhi Ram in Jalandhar Cantonment in the Punjab Province. He joined the Royal Indian Naval Reserve in December 1942 as a Midshipman. Naval career Parkash was commissioned as an acting Sub-lieutenant on 3 September 1943. In 1949, he was selected to attend the Long Navigation and Direction course and embarked for the United Kingdom. He served as the flag lieutenant to the Commander-in-Chief, Royal Indian Navy, Vice Admiral Sir William Edward Parry. He specialised in navigation and direction. He was promoted to the acting rank of Lieutenant Commander in December 1952. He attended the Defence Services Staff College, Wellington in 1955. He later served as the Directing Staff at the college. Parkash commanded the Black Swan-class sloop INS Krisna, the Leopard-class frigate , the Blackwood-class frigate and the Leander-class cruiser . In 1965, he attended the Naval War College at Newport, Rhode Island in the United States. He also served as the Naval attach√© to the Ambassador of India to USSR at the Embassy of India in Moscow. He subsequently moved to Naval headquarters and took over as the Director of the Submarine arm. He was awarded the Ati Vishisht Seva Medal on 26 January 1971. =Indo-Pakistani War of 1971= Parkash took command of the flagship of the Navy, the aircraft carrier before the outbreak of the war. The ship was part of the Western Fleet. In mid 1971, the Vikrant, along with her escorts, the frigates INS Brahmaputra and INS Beas were moved from the Western Fleet to the Eastern Naval Command. Thus, INS Vikrant became the flagship of the Eastern Fleet. The Vikrant, commanded by Parkash formed the core of the strike force of the Eastern Fleet. Aliz√© and Hawker Sea Hawk aircraft from the Vikrant and the ships of the fleet bombarded Chittagong and Cox's Bazar. The air strikes of INS Vikrant resulted in the sinking or rendering useless 11 merchant ships totalling 56914 tons. The newly-refitted submarine of the Pakistan Navy, PNS Ghazi set out to hunt the Vikrant, but it was the professional skill and strategic manoeuvres which foiled the attempts. Parkash was decorated with the Maha Vir Chakra for his command of the Vikrant. The citation for the Maha Vir Chakra reads as follows: =Flag Rank= After the war, in 1973, Parkash was promoted to the rank of Rear Admiral and appointed Deputy Chief of the Naval Staff (DCNS). After a short stint, he assumed command of the Western Fleet as Flag Officer Commanding Western Fleet in the rank of Rear Admiral. He subsequently moved back to Naval HQ as DCNS where he served for two years. On 2 April 1976, he was promoted to the acting rank of Vice Admiral and was appointed Flag Officer Commanding-in-Chief Eastern Naval Command. He relinquished command of the Eastern navy in 1977, handing over to his former Fleet Commander during the war, Rear Admiral S H Sarma. Parkash subsequently moved to Naval HQ as took over as Chief of Personnel (COP). Parkash was awarded the Param Vishisht Seva Medal on 26 January 1978. After serving as COP for about two years, Parkash was appointed the 6th Vice Chief of the Naval Staff, the second senior-most position of the Navy, succeeding Vice Admiral Ronald Lynsdale Pereira. He relinquished office of VCNS on 31 March 1980. =Director General Indian Coast Guard= The Indian Coast Guard came into being on 19 August 1978. The new service was to function under the overall command and control of a Director general.On 1 April 1980, Parkash took over as the second Director General of the Indian Coast Guard (DGICG), succeeding Vice Admiral V A Kamath. He served as the DGICG for two years and retired on 31 March 1982.

Biography  Herbers was born in Groenlo in 1540 or 1544 as the son of Roman Catholic parents. He was educated in a monastery. He joined the Mariengarden Monastery of the order of the Cistercians in Gross- Burlo, near Winterswijk. In 1566 he was appointed deputy to the pastor of Winterswijk, who died to the plague. Herbers developed sympathy for the ideas of Erasmus and for Protestantism. He settled in Bocholt, Germany, where a Protestant-friendly climate prevailed. Herbers married Ermken Dircks Raesveltsdr. He was appointed preacher of the new doctrine in 1569, but was deposed in 1570 by the bishop of M√ºnster and Osnabr√ºck. Despite the support that Herbers received from the city council and the population, he was expelled from the diocese. Bekentenisse des gheloofs by Herman Herbers (1591) Herbers then established himself as a Lutheran minister in Wesel where he wrote a creed. In 1577 he accepted an appeal to the Reformed Churches in Dordrecht. Already during his ministry of Dordrecht, he was loaned to other cities including Antwerp, Gouda and Mechelen. Gradually, Herbers developed into an open-minded pastor, who developed an understanding for dissenters. This brought him into conflict with both the local authorities in Dordrecht and the church council. He was dismissed as a preacher by the city council of Dordrecht in 1582. He was also not issued a certificate to his new municipality of Gouda. Despite this lack of cooperation by the Dordrecht authorities, he was received with open arms in Gouda by the Gouda city council and the church council there. Herbers is said to be Pastor of Gouda for a period of 25 years. He was given the opportunity to put his non-conformist views into practice. Despite objections from the ecclesiastical authorities, Herbers refused to teach the catechism. From 1591 to 1593, Herbers was declared suspended by the synod, but nevertheless maintained by the Gouda authorities as pastor of the Sint-Janskerk. Herbers' religious views were echoed in Gouda, among other things, in the work of his son the preacher Dirck Herbers and the preachers Harboldus Tombergen and Eduard Poppius. They were followers of Jacobus Arminius and in 1610 co-signatories of the Remonstrance. Herbers is considered one of the Arminian forerunners of the Remonstrants. His writings testify also to a mystical or experimental experience of faith. He died in February 1607 at the age of 66 in Gouda.

Curran worked for newspapers in Goulburn, established and edited the Burrowa Advocate and also worked in Sydney on the Freeman's Journal. Biography Curran was born in Gundaroo in 1843. His parents, Joseph Curran, a shepherd, and Margaret Conba, a dairy maid, both from Cork, arrived in Sydney through the assisted passage scheme on the Lascar in 1841. The Currans were indentured workers on the farms of the MacLeod family at ‚ÄòMaryvale‚Äô in Liverpool and then ‚ÄòBarnsdale‚Äô in Gundaroo, before moving to 'The Oaks' near Queanbeyan in 1847.B. Maher, In Praise of Pioneers: an Account of the Keeffe and Curran Families, Queanbeyan District, Canberra, 1981, p. 28; J. McDonald, Three Henry Currans, Canberra, 2018, pp. 37-40, 43-7. By 1861, Joseph Curran had deserted his wife and family. Although she had been left destitute and was taken to court by her husband‚Äôs creditors, she managed to keep the family together and raise her seven children on her own in Queanbeyan.J. McDonald, ‚ÄòMargaret Curran: Scrubbing against the Grain‚Äô, Quinbean, in two parts: vol. 10.1 (April), 2017, pp. 6-14 and vol. 10.2 (September), 2017, pp. 17-23. In 1857, thirteen-year-old Curran won an apprenticeship at the Goulburn Chronicle and Southern Advertiser, which had been recently established by William Vernon and Ludolf Mellin. Life was not easy for the apprentices at the paper, with the family of one boy taking Mellin to court over cruel treatment.J. McDonald, Three Henry Currans, Canberra, 2018, pp. 68-70. The Chronicle was taken over in 1864 by its less- liberal rival, the Goulburn Herald and County of Argyle Advertiser, owned by William Riley and Breadalbane‚Äôs absentee squire, James Chisholm. The two papers merged into the Goulburn Herald and Chronicle. Curran eventually became one of its senior journalists. During the 1860s, Curran also became active in Goulburn‚Äôs literary societies and a leader of the local Catholic community, including serving as president of the Goulburn Catholic Literary Society.J. McDonald, ‚ÄòHenry Curran, Bushrangers, and a Booroowa Dream‚Äô, Journal of the Australian Catholic Historical Society, vol. 38, 2017, pp. 26-8. He became closely aligned with prominent priests, Rev. Patrick Dunne and his nephew, Rev. John Dunne. The Dunnes had a history of promoting social issues and Curran promoted their causes in his work.For the Reverends Dunne, see The Australian Dictionary of Biography, vol. 4, Melbourne, 1972, pp. 117-18; B. Maher, Planting the Celtic Cross, Canberra 1997, pp. 150-5, 214-17, 237-41, 248-9, 254-9. In 1865, Curran married Anne Lodge, who was from a family of Catholic publicans of the Goulburn-Breadalbane district. Her father, Henry Lodge, was the proprietor of the John Barleycorn Inn.Goulburn Herald, 5 July 1862, p. 3; W. S. Gilbert and L. W. Wilson, Goulburn‚Äôs 19th Century Pubs (1830-1900), Goulburn, 1987, entry no. 21. Anne‚Äôs brother, Thomas Lodge, had been the proprietor of The Coach and Horses (known as the Red House) at Breadalbane as a tenant of James Chisholm, before building his own Breadalbane Hotel in 1858, which became a centre for the local Catholic community, before the church was built. It even hosted visits by Archbishop John Polding.M. Hannan, Where Were They and What Were They Doing in 1872?, Wagga Wagga, 2007, pp. 17-18; J. McDonald, Three Henry Currans, Canberra 2018, pp. 447-8. In 1865, Curran and Lodge were caught up in the colonial government‚Äôs efforts to quash bushranging, in particular, curtailing Ben Hall. The government was suspicious that Catholic enclaves were sheltering Hall and his gang.J. McDonald, ‚ÄòHenry Curran, Bushrangers, and a Booroowa Dream‚Äô, Journal of the Australian Catholic Historical Society, vol. 38, 2017, pp. 22-6. When Curran wrote up his account of Hall‚Äôs hold-up of the Yass Mail in which the passengers were taken to his brother-in-law‚Äôs Breadlabane Hotel and shouted lunch by the gang, the authorities came down hard.They did not want Hall presented as a hero and Chisholm was no friend of Lodge. The police raided Lodge‚Äôs hotel, and he faced trumped-up charges of receiving stolen goods. This occurred shortly before an early morning raid on nearby Byrne‚Äôs farm, where Hall‚Äôs gang was surprised and almost captured after a fierce gunfight.The Tumut and Adelong Times, 2 March 1865, p. 2. Inadvertently, Curran‚Äôs article had been instrumental in his brother-in-law‚Äôs demise. Lodge lost government mail and road contracts and then his publican‚Äôs license. His father-in-law was also bankrupted and walked away from the John Barleycorn.J. McDonald, Three Henry Currans, Canberra, 2018, pp. 165-7. In 1873 he was approached by the Dunnes to set up a new paper at Boorowa, where John Dunne was the new priest tasked with reforming the parish. H. V. Lloyd, Boorowa: Over 160 Years of White Settlement, Panania, 1990, pp. 142, 158, 177; B. Maher, A Slice of Tipperary: a Story of Boorowa NSW Catholic Community, Bruce, 2016, p. 16. Curran established the Burrowa Advocate in August 1873, but due to divisions within the community arising from Dunne‚Äôs reforms, the paper failed to gather enough support to survive. Curran was financially ruined. Curran became a journalist with the Freeman‚Äôs Journal in Surry Hills, Sydney by 1785. After Anne died prematurely in 1880, he struggled with alcoholism and became gravely ill himself, unable to work. His youngest child, Francis, aged 16 months, was put into an orphanage, while his eldest son, Henry Roland Curran, tried to support the remaining children on a factory worker‚Äôs wage. Henry Joseph Curran died of liver failure in March 1882. His children were split between their uncles. Two were adopted by his brother-in-law Thomas Lodge, another two by his elder brother Patrick Curran, and Henry junior was apprenticed to his uncle, George Curran, at the Ginninderra Blacksmith's Shop.https://museum.hall.act.au/display/1939/person/1968/henry-harry- curran.html; J.

Since its birth, the elephant has spent most of his lifetime at the Islamabad Zoo in Pakistan. Kaavan was gifted by the government of Sri Lanka to the government of Pakistan in 1985 as a result of the positive relationship between the two countries. On 21 May 2020, the Islamabad High Court ordered that the elephant should be immediately relocated to a different sanctuary following a four-year campaign by pop singer Cher, who has since 2016 been demanding for Kaavan's release from the zoo. Kaavan is one of the few captive elephants to live in Pakistan. Biography Kaavan was born in Sri Lanka in 1985, and upon his birth, the Sri Lankan government gifted him to then-president of Pakistan Zia-ul-Haq. The elephant was kept at the Islamabad Zoo and remained as the only Asian elephant living in Pakistan. An elephant named Saheli was brought from Bangladesh in 1990 and remained as Kaavan's partner until its death in 2012. Kaavan was temporarily chained by zookeepers in 2002 after concerns regarding violent behaviour on the elephant's part. Campaign to free Kaavan In 2015, a petition was signed by many people demanding Kaavan's release, and the petition was reportedly sent to zoo authorities and to then-Prime Minister of Pakistan Nawaz Sharif. In September 2016, a news report highlighted the dire condition in which Kaavan was living, including being bound in chains for over two decades. The zoo consequently decided to send the elephant to Cambodia. In the same month, pictures of Kaavan living alone and in chains went viral on the internet and caught the attention of popular American pop singer Cher. The treatment of the elephant by zoo officials spawned global international attention. Animal rights activists criticised the zoo officials for chaining up the animal but these allegations were denied. Cher initiated a campaign called #SaveKavaan on social media. Another petition also circulated in 2016 and it was supported by over 200,000 people. The campaign also reported that the elephant was locked up in a small enclosure without adequate breathing space and with only a small pool of water in usual 40-degree summer temperatures. On 21 May 2020, the Islamabad High Court took up the case during the COVID-19 pandemic in Pakistan and handed down the verdict that Kaavan should be freed, ordering the wildlife officials to consult with Sri Lankan authorities to find a suitable sanctuary for Kaavan in another country within 30 days. The court also criticised the zoo officials for failing to meet the animal's needs in terms of the violation of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act 1890 and Wildlife Ordinance of 1979. Cher thanked the Islamabad High Court and Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan for the verdict. She tweeted that \\"We have just heard from the Pakistan High Court that Kaavan is Free. This is the Greatest moment of my life\\". On 17 July 2020, Free The Wild announced that the Pakistan Government had ruled that FTW had their consent to relocate Kaavan to Lek‚Äôs sanctuary in Cambodia ‚Äì \\"A place we have personally visited and vetted and are delighted for Kaavan to call home\\". On 4 September 2020, veterinarians Dr Amir Khalil with the animal aid group Four Paws International and Dr Frank Goeritz from the Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research (IZW) examined and approved him for travel to an elephant sanctuary.With songs and sedation, experts aim to rescue Kaavan the Islamabad elephant retrieved on 8.

This island has a few private wharves on the west shore of the Chambly basin. Since the second half of XXth, its vocation has been residential and focused on recreotourism activities. This island includes the R√©my-Nolet leisure park.  Geography  Channel separating √éle Demers (Carignan) and the city of Chambly (view towards the mouth) Demers Island occupies the western part of the Bassin-de-Chambly. This island is the third in area among the four islands separating the Bassin-de- Chambly and the Acadia River. The other islands are √éle aux Li√®vres, Goyer Island and √éle au Foin (Hay Island).

The canal continues on the northeast side, separating Demers Island and Hay Island. These narrow canals are bordered by a narrow strip of marshland. Demers Island is accessible through a small bridge built on Demers Street (which becomes Daigneault Street in Chambly), to span the stream. This bridge thus links the island to rue Martel which runs along the Chambly basin in the city of Chambly.Atlas of Canada from the Department of Natural Resources Canada - Characteristics extracted from the geographic map, the database and the instrumentation of the site - accessed May 22, 2020.  Spring floods  Spring floods often affected the land adjacent to the shores of Demers Island. The overflow of the Richelieu River is recurrent.  Toponymy  At the beginning of the 20th century, Demers Island was designated by the inhabitants of the \\"Ile au Beurre\\" sector. This unofficial name comes from a wild plant called \\"petit beurre\\". Formerly, this plant was very widespread on this island. The toponym \\"Demers Island\\" evokes the memory of the Demers family. Joseph-Honor√© Demers was the owner of this island in the first half of the 19th century. Demers Island has 12 streets which are designated by tree names (e.g. Cedars, Oaks, Elms, Maple, Pines, Fir, Aspens, Lime trees). These streets are linked to rue Demers which runs along the Chambly basin.OpenStreetMap - Map of Demers Island.

He also made decisions on which further buildings in Ireland should be brought into state ownership or guardianship. He was a founding member of the Irish Georgian Society.  Biography  Percy Le Clerc was born on 30 May 1914, in IrlamHistorically a village in Lancashire, Irlam is now a suburb of Salford., Greater Manchester, where his father was the general practitioner. Percy was the youngest of the three sons of Dr Robert Maurice Le Clerc and Edith Agatha Le Clerc (n√©e Baylee). Robert Maurice Le Clerc was a graduate of Trinity College Dublin and was descended from a Huguenot refugee Pierre Le Clerc (1686-1773) of Charente, France who became a wine merchant at Clarendon Street, Dublin. Edith Agatha Baylee had qualified as a nurse at Huddersfield General Hospital, having grown up at her family ancestral home, Mount Baylee, Kilkishen, County Clare. She was a great-granddaughter of Austin Cooper (1759-1830), of Abbeville, Kinsealy, County Dublin, who had created a unique record of Ireland's architectural heritage by compiling two large albums of beautifully executed pen and ink drawings of Ireland's castles, abbeys, churches and round towers. In 1926 Le Clerc's family moved from Irlam to Kidlington, near Oxford. Having attended the Magdelen College School he matriculated to study engineering at Exeter College. He subsequently trained as an architect, specialising in history of architecture. He always maintained that his engineering studies greatly enhanced his ability to undertake major restoration projects. In 1941 Le Clerc began work at the Office of Public Works in Dublin, becoming Inspector of National Monuments following the retirement of Harold G. Leask in 1949. He retired from this post in 1974 but continued work on the restoration of Holycross Abbey, Duiske Abbey and private commissions. At the age of 70 he moved to France where he could continue research into his Huguenot ancestry. He died in Versailles on 4 March 2002.  Restorations carried out under his direction  Le Clerc wrote: \\"Returning a building as close as possible to its original form, while making it the setting for present day activity should be the aim of restoration\\".Le Clerc collection, Library of Trinity College, Dublin: MARLOC/Ms. 10049 Some of the projects directed by him: * Bunratty Castle, County Clare was purchased by Standish Vereker, 7th Viscount Gort in 1953. The castle was opened to the public, after extensive restoration, in 1960 and over the years has been developed into a major tourist hub. * Rothe House, Kilkenny was completely restored for The Kilkenny Archaeological Society. The work commenced in 1961 and is described in detail by Luke Feeley,Clerk of Works, in the Old Kilkenny Review.Louis Feeley; Rothe House Restoration,pt.1. The Old Kilkenny Review, Vol. 66, 2014 pp.31-35.Louis Feeley; Rothe House Restoration, pt. 2. The Old Kilkenny Review, Vol. 68 2016. pp.167-172. * Ballintubber Abbey, County Mayo, \\"the meticulous restoration of the nave\\" was carried out for Fr. Tom Egan and the parishioners. The work was completed in time for the 750th Anniversary celebrations in 1969, of \\"the abbey that refused to die\\".Rev. Thomas Egan, The Story of Ballintubber Abbey, published in 1967. This project was awarded the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland Triennial Silver Medal for Restoration.Architecture in Ireland : Special Quarterly Review Issue:no.3: 1980. p.17 * Duiske Abbey, Graiguenamanagh, County Kilkenny, a partial restoration of this Abbey Church was carried out for Fr William Gavin and the parish, commencing in 1974.Sean Swayne; Duiske Abbey, Graiguenamanagh. second edition,1993; p.6. * Holycross Abbey, County Tipperary was returned ecclesiastical use by the Holycross Abbey Act which was passed in 1969. The extensive restoration work which followed, \\"from roofless ruin to the Abbey that stands today\\", was carried out for Dr. Thomas Morris, Archbishop of Cashel. It was sufficiently advanced for the re-opening to take place in 1975, European Architectural Heritage Year. Holycross Abbey and village were chosen as one of Irelands pilot projects for EAHY. The work on the Abbey directed by Le Clerc was completed in 1976.  Other works  * Clonmacnoise, County Offaly * Blarney castle, County Cork * Powerscourt House, County Wicklow * St. Nicholas Collegiate Church, Galway * Aughnanure Castle, County Galway * St. Canice's Cathedral, Kilkenny are some of the sites where work was carried out under the direction of Le Clerc. Privately, he worked with the owners of St. Mary's Church, Castlemartin, County Kildare, Doonagore Castle, County Clare, and Carragin Castle, County Galway where full restorations were completed. More details of these and other projects can be seen in his papers bequeathed to the Library of Trinity College, Dublin.Le Clerc Collection, Library of Trinity College, Dublin: MARLOC/Ms 10049. Percy Le Clerc was a founder member of the Irish Georgian Society,Irish Georgian Society History, http://www.igs.ie/about restarted by Desmond Guinness in 1957 in response to the demolition of buildings in Georgian squares close to the Office of Public Works at No. 10, Hume Street. Erika Hanna wrote in her book Modern Dublin, Urban Change and the Irish Past: \\"The quiet protest of Le Clerc (against his own organisation) was indicative of his dissatisfaction with the State's policies concerning the built environment.\\" This same frustration at the neglect of Ireland's architectural heritage is described by Campbell Spray, the journalist, in his article Percy the Monument written when he was Editor of 'Social & Personal' magazine. However, Le Clerc's sheer love of life, Dublin social life in particular, shines through. His projects were never finished without a Grand Opening Ceremony.

It is home to about 3,000 people, and the second largest village of the Saramaka Maroons, after Aurora. Pikin Slee has a school, clinic, and the Saamaka Marron Museum. Pikin Slee adheres to the Afro-Surinamese Winti religion. The majority of the population make their living from agriculture. Pikin Slee is home to a group of Rastafari wood carving artists, whose work is on display in the museum. A holiday eco-resort is located near the village. On 14 November 2011, the Saamaka Marron Museum was founded. The museum is dedicated to the cultural heritage of the Saramaccans with a special emphasis on art. The current chieftain of the village is Wanze Eduards. During the 1990s logging companies encroached on the village of Pikin Santi. Extensive flooding caused by faulty bridging resulted in the loss of large plots of agricultural land. Eduards was awarded the Goldman Environmental Prize in 2009, jointly with Hugo Jabini, for their efforts to protect their traditional land against logging companies, by bringing the case to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, and further to the Inter-American Court. In late 2019, solar energy panels were installed in the village to provide 24 hours of electricy. Pikin Slee can be reached by boat from Pokigron which is the end of the road. Villages to the south of Pokigron can only be accessed by boat. An unpaved road leads to the Botopasi Airstrip.

He notably served during the War of American Independence.  Biography  Trobriand was born to the family of Vincente Roulin and of Jean-√âlie Denis de Keredern de Trobriand. He was half-brother to Fran√ßois-Marie Denis de Keredern de Trobriand (1741-1810), cousin to Jean Fran√ßois Sylvestre Denis de Trobriand, and uncle to Fran√ßois- Marie Denis de Keredern de Trobriand (1769-1809), who all served in the Navy. Trobriand married Genevi√®ve Poissonnier des Perri√®res. Trobriand joined the Navy as a Garde-Marine on 1 April 1748. He was promoted to Ensign on 23 May 1754. He was promoted to Lieutenant on 15 January 1762. On 1 January 1773, he was given command of the fluyt √âtoile in Lorient. Between 1773 and 1777, she sailed to China and in the Indian Ocean. In 1773, Trobriand explored Denis Island, which was named in his honour. In 1775, √âtoile was in Borneo, where Trobriand was offered two islands for France, the largest one being Lemukutan. √âtoile surveilled the South-Western coast of Borneo. During the voyage, √âtoile received orders to mount a punitive expedition against Pangaram Serip, King of Koti, at the mouth of the Mahakam River, in retaliation for the massacre of the crew of the merchantman √âpreuve. √âtoile attacked the port held by Pangaram Serip, along with the frigate Indiscr√®te, under Boucault, and Badine, under Le Veyer de Beuzidou, destroying or capturing 31 ships, and killing around 300 people. He was promoted to Captain on 4 April 1777. In 1778, Trobriand captained the 50-gun Amphion, part of the White-and-blue squadron under Du Chaffault in the fleet under Orvilliers. He took part in the Battle of Ushant on 27 July 1778. Seriously damaged, Amphion returned to Brest while the fight was still raging, carrying the first news of the battle. In consequence, Trobriand was replaced at the command of Amphion. In 1779 and 1780, Trobriand commanded the 64-gun Alexandre. In February 1780, he transferred to √âveill√©, but died a few days later.

This island has several private marinas or wharves. Since the second half of XXth, its vocation has been residential and focused on recreotourism activities.  History of the island  The vocation of this small archipelago to which Goyer Island belongs has evolved over the course of history, in particular because of its strategic position downstream from the Chambly Rapids on the Richelieu River. However, it represented a temporary isolation constraint due to the absence of a bridge to connect the mainland during spring floods or major floods. The Amerindians used these islands as a stopover on their route to go up or down the river. Native American stops were often used to hide their equipment or as a meeting point for Native American trade. Under the regime of New France, the Lord of Chambly conceded this island in 1721 to his censitaires in order to graze their animals there; thus, fences were not required to keep control over the animals. After the War of 1812, the Grande Isle was considered in the British defense projects of the Vall√©e-du- Richelieu. According to an ordinance of 1815, the British army planned to erect important fortifications on this island in order to replace Fort Chambly; however, this military strengthening project was never implemented. Subsequently, a farm was established on this island. In the 1940s, the only real estate assets consisted only of an old farm house and a barn. In 1946, three business figures and politicians joined forces to buy the island to undertake a housing construction project: Conrad Williams, Ars√®ne Burelle and Arthur Dupr√©. This group of business people undertook to build a single-lane wooden bridge there to connect Goyer Island to the road along the west bank of the Acadie River (formerly known as \\"Little Montreal River\\") and the Richelieu River. A first street has been built in the western part of the island. Of the three associates initially resident in Beloeil, only Conrad Williams settled on the island with his family. Their families first settled in a chalet, then in a building serving from June 1948 as permanent residence and convenience store to serve new residents of the island and vacationers. In 1954, the brothers √âdouard and Charles-Emile Goyer became owners of the island with the aim of accelerating residential construction there. These businessmen notably owned a sand and gravel quarry in Saint-Bruno-de-Montarville where they resided. Charles-Emile Goyer already owned a house on Goyer Island. Their first initiative for the development of Goyer Island was to replace the old wooden bridge with a metal bridge sold by the Quebec government. Thus, the metal bridge is dismantled from its original site and rebuilt at the site of the wooden bridge over the L'Acadie river. The Goyer brothers thus favor the permanent development of the island which will henceforth be named according to their patronymic.  History of business places on the island  In accordance with the town planning regulations of the city of Carignan, two commercial sites are authorized on this island, including a convenience store in a building that had been erected around 1946-48 next to the wooden bridge. Initially, this convenience store was operated by Conrad William, a businessman.Article \\"An island in the Chambly basin in development, Goyer Island\\" by Paul-Henri Hudon, newspaper Le Mont√©r√©gien.com, May 15, 2020.Commission de toponymie du Qu√©bec, book \\"Names and places of Quebec: illustrated dictionary\\", Quebec, Les Publications du Qu√©bec, 2006, 925 p.

Unraced as a two-year-old she won her first four races in 2011 including the Coral Distaff and the Prix de l'Op√©ra before finishind second in the Breeders' Cup Filly & Mare Turf. She struggled to find her form in the early part of the 2012 season but returned to her best to take the Flower Bowl Stakes. She made an immediate impact as a broodmare, with her first foal being Benbatl. Background Nahrain is a chestnut mare with a broad white blaze bred in England by the Darley Stud. During her racing career she carried the yellow and black colours of Ahmed Al-Maktoum and was initially sent into training with Michael Jarvis at Newmarket, Suffolk. When Jarvis retired in early 2011 the stable was taken over by his assistant Roger Varian, who trained Nahrain throughout her racing career. She was sired by Selkirk an American-bred miler who won the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes in 1991. As a breeding stallion, his other successful offspring included Wince, Sublimity, Kastoria and Cityscape. Nahrain's dam Bahr was a top-class middle-distance performer who won the Musidora Stakes and Ribblesdale Stakes as well as finishing second in the Epsom Oaks. She was a granddaughter of the outstanding New Zealand racemare La Mer. Her name means 'two rivers' (ŸÜŸáÿ±ŸäŸÜ) in Arabic, which refers to the Euphrates and Tigris rivers in Iraq. Racing career2011: three-year-old season= Nahrain did not race as a juvenile, owing to an injury sustained in July 2010, and made her racecourse debut in a maiden race over one mile on good to firm ground at Windsor Racecourse on 16 May. Ridden by Neil Callan she started at odds of 11/2 and won by a length from Paoletta after taking the lead approaching the final furlong. William Buick took the ride when the filly started 8/15 favourite for a handicap race over the same distance at Haydock Park on 9 June and won \\"very easily\\" by five lengths under a weight of 131 pounds. At Sandown Park on 2 July Nahrain was stepped up in class and, with Callan in the saddle, started 4/6 favourite in a six-runner field for the Listed Coral Distaff. After starting poorly she settled in fourth place before taking the lead approaching the final furlong and won \\"readily\\" by one and a half lengths from Primevere. After the race the filly lost her form: according to Varian \\"she fell away on us. She lost a lot of condition, and with a huge team effort in the yard, she has [was] nursed back\\". After an absence of three months, Nahrain returned to the track on 2 October when she was sent to France to contest the Group 1 Prix de l'Op√©ra over 2000 metres at Longchamp Racecourse. Ridden by Frankie Dettori she started second favourite behind the four-year-old Announce (winner of the Prix Jean Romanet) in a ten-runner field which also included Banimpire (Ribblesdale Stakes), Sandy's Charm (Prix de Lieurey), Epic Love (Prix Vanteaux) and Djumama (Schwarzgold-Rennen). After tracking the leaders, Nahrain looked unlikely to obtain a clear run in the straight before accelerating into the lead in the last 200 metres and held off a challenge from Announce to win by a nose. After the race Varian alluded to the fact that Michael Jarvis had died in September as he commented \\"It was a real special day, and that's understating it. It was dreamy stuff. To coincide with such an emotional two weeks was incredible. My first Group 1 winner on Arc Day in Paris ‚Äì it really hasn‚Äôt sunk in yet. Nahrain is a very talented filly, and she has overcome a lot to get to Group 1 level so quickly\\". For her final run of the season, Nahrain was sent to the United States for the Breeders' Cup Filly & Mare Turf at Churchill Downs on 4 November and started the 3/1 second favourite behind Stacelita. After being settled in mid-division by Dettori she took the lead in the straight but sustained her first defeat as she was overtaken in the final strides and beaten into second place by the four-year-old outsider Perfect Shirl. Varian said \\"I'm really proud of her. She ran a really great race. I thought we had it off the bend\\". In the 2011 World Thoroughbred Rankings Nahrain was given a rating of 117, making her the 136th best racehorse in the world and the best three-year-old filly trained in Britain. =2012: four- year-old season= Nahrain was ridden by Callan in her first three races of 2012. On 20 June at Royal Ascot her second campaign began disappointingly when she tired badly in the closing stages of the Group 2 Windsor Forest Stakes and came home ninth of the thirteen runners behind Joviality, beaten almost eight lengths by the winner. The Nassau Stakes at Goodwood Racecourse on 4 August saw little improvement in her form as she finished last of the eight runners behind The Fugue, looking to be outpaced by her rivals in the last quarter mile. On 9 September the filly was sent to Ireland for the Blandford Stakes at the Curragh and produced a better effort as she stayed on well to take third place behind the three-year-olds Up and Caponata. Three weeks after her run in Ireland Nahrain ran for the second time in the United States when she was partnered by John Velasquez and started at odds of 5/1 for the Grade I Flower Bowl Invitational Stakes at Belmont Park. Dream Peace (Prix de la Nonette) started favourite, while the other six runners included I'm A Dreamer (Beverly D. Stakes), Zagora, Hit It Rich (Glens Falls Stakes) and Halo Dolly (Yellow Ribbon Handicap). She settled in fifth place as Hit It Rich set a slow pace, before launching a challenge on the outside as the field rounded the final turn. The closing stages saw a four-way struggle between Zagora, I'm A Dreamer, Nahrain and Dream Peace, with the British filly gaining the advantage fifty yards from the finish to win by half a length. The racecourse stewards held an inquiry into possible interference caused when Nahrain bumped into Dream Peace as she angled right on the final turn but left the result unchanged. Roger Varian commented \\"She showed us in her last start when she was third at the Curragh that she was coming back to herself... We‚Äôre in [the Breeders‚Äô Cup] now, aren't we? We were second last year. From when she was second last year we were keen to have another toot at it this year. She's shown up today, hasn't she?\\" At Santa Anita Park on 2 November Nahrain made her second attempt to win the Breeders' Cup Filly & Mare Turf. Ridden by Dettori she started the 8/1 third choice in the betting but was never in serious contention and came home tenth of the eleven runners behind Zagora. A month later it was announced that the filly had been retired from racing, with Varian saying \\"She has been a huge asset to the start of my training career... She has been a pleasure to train, and I now hope she has a long and successful career as a broodmare.\\" In the 2012 World Thoroughbred Rankings Nahrain was given a rating of 116, making her the 170th best racehorse in the world. Breeding record At the end of her racing career Nahrain was retired to become a broodmare for the Darley Sud. She produced at least four foals and two winners: *Benbatl, a bay colt, foaled in 2014, sired by Dubawi. Won ten races including the Dubai Turf, Bayerisches Zuchtrennen and Caulfield Stakes. *Ta Allak, chestnut colt, 2015, by New Approach. Third on only start. *Basford Dan, bay colt (later gelded), 2016, by Dansili. Unraced. *Fooraat, bay filly, 2017, by Dubawi. Won one race.

Launched in 1905, the double-ended timber-hulled steamer was built for Sydney Ferries Limited in response to the early twentieth century boom in cross-harbour ferry travel prior to the opening of the Sydney Harbour Bridge. She was the first of Sydney Ferries Limited's boats to have a fully enclosed upper deck. She survived the 1932 opening of the Sydney Harbour Bridge when many ferries were removed from service, and also the early 1950s rationalisation of the fleet following NSW Government takeover. Nicknamed \\"The Box\\", she had a relatively incident free career apart from a collision with a wharf that killed three of her passengers. She was sold in 1959 and broken up. \\"Kareela\\" is thought to be an Australian Aboriginal word meaning \\"south wind\\". Background Kareela was built for Sydney Ferries Limited during the early twentieth century boom in cross-Harbour travel prior to the 1932 opening of the Sydney Harbour Bridge. At the time, the company ran one of the largest ferry fleets in the world. A population boom in the suburbs of Neutral Bay, Cremorne, and Mosman saw them served by an increasing number of ferries. The ferry was part of a broader type of around 20 double-ended timber screw ferries the Sydney K-class ferries that the company commissioned between the 1890s and early 1920s to meet the booming demand. Kareela followed the Sydney Ferries Limited tradition of naming their vessels after Australian Aboriginal words starting with \\"K\\". \\"Kareela\\" is thought to mean \\"south wind\\". Design and construction Kareela on stocks at builders, likely on her launch day, 1905 Built in 1905, Kareela's hull, cabins and deck fittings were by Morrison & Sinclair Ltd, of Balmain. Her hull was flamed right out with no overhanging sponsons. The sponsons were made of 14 x 10 inch iron bark girders, and the vessel was double framed of hard wood making it one of the harbour's strongest ferries at the time. The hull of the ferry was designed by Scolt, s foreman shipwright of the North Coast Steam Navigation Co, from a specification by T Brown, the Sydney Ferries Ltd works manager. The cabins and other deck fittings were designed by the companies' officials, under the supervision of T Brown. She had one iron bulkhead and four of wood. She was built with lodging knees around the inside of the hull and 24 hanging knees. The keel consisted of three lengths of iron bark, the longest being 50 feet. There were 20 iron stanchions in the engine and boiler rooms. Under the deck over the boilers were galvanised iron sheets minimise fire risk. She was 186 tons, 34.4 m in length, and had a passenger capacity of 784. Kareela was the first of Sydney Ferries Limited to have upper decks fully enclosed. The earlier K-class vessels, including Kurraba, Kirribilli, Koree and Kulgoa had only the sides of their upper decks enclosed leaving the ends open, with the roofs being squared off. On Kareela and all subsequent K-class vessels had an upper deck structure with curving roof lines that met at the rear of the wheelhouses thus the upper deck saloon was fully enclosed. Kareela had four companionways, two on each side, leading to the upper deck. Her boilers 40 hp triple expansion steam engine was supplied by Chapman & Co Ltd and pushed her to 10 knots. The compound surface condensing engines had cylinders 14 inches x 27 inches in diameter, with a stroke of 18 inches. The electrics, including 83 16-cp incandescent light fittings, were provided by Scott, Henderson and Co. Her two steering wheels were made from teak taken from the former . Service history thumb Kareela was launched on 31 May 1905. Among those present were Mr Russell (Chairman of directors), W G Todd (secretary Sydney Ferries, Limited), and Mr Sinclair (of Morrison and Sinclair). The vessel was christened by Miss Enid Russell (thought to be the chairman's daughter), who broke a bottle of champagne on the propeller of the vessel. Her trials were on 7 September 1905 and she entered service 4 days laterFerries of Sydney ‚Äì Kareela initially on the Neutral Bay run. Kareela earned the nickname \\"The Box\\", which may have been due to appearing to not float any lower in the water no matter how many passengers she was carrying. In 1932, the Sydney Harbour Bridge was opened, and Sydney Ferries Ltd's annual patronage dropped from 40 million to about 15 million. Almost 20 Sydney Ferry Limited boats were put up for sale, however, Kareela was one of the boats kept on. The post-Bridge drop in demand for the ferry fleet was somewhat mitigated as many could not afford their own transport in the Great Depression of the 1930s and rationing of fuel during World War 2 made the coal required for the steam ferries relatively cheap.Kirawa on ferriesofsydney.com However, the post World War II years saw the drop in demand pick up pace. In 1951, with annual patronage down to 9 million, the NSW State Government took over Sydney Ferries Limited and its remaining fleet and assets. The Port Jackson and Manly Steamship Company, which ran the Manly service, was paid to run the services. The services and fleet were quickly rationalised with most of the larger remaining timber K-class steamers being decommissioned. Kirrule, Kiandra, Kamiri and Kirawa were all broken up at this time. Kareela, however, was again retained in service. The reprieve was short-lived and in 1959, she was sold for breaking up after Kosciusko returned to service following her conversion to diesel power. Incidents Kareela is towed from the old P&O; wharf with which she collided killing three passengers, 28 August 1924 The worst incident in Kareela's career was on 28 August 1924, when she crashed into the P&O; wharf on Bennelong Point having just left Circular Quay for Taronga Zoo. A three week old baby, his mother and grandmother died. The three, and other injured family members, had been sitting outside at the front of the ferry. The ferry hit with such force that the wharf deck sliced deep into the ferry under the roof of its main deck. The steering pole was smashed, much of the bulwarks ripped out, a lifeboat thrown onto the wharf and much of the cabin's walls and windows were destroyed. The front part of the ferry's upper deck collapsed as it was later towed from the wharf. Her hull, however, remained intact. The wharf also suffered significant damage with decking smashed and four piles broken. Damage to the ferry was estimated at ‚Ç§600 while damage to the wharf was around ‚Ç§200. A jammed steering gear was found to be the cause, and the master's ticket was suspended for two year's for not testing the wheel at departure. Over the rest of her career, Kareela had other incidents, but none as serious as the fatal 1924 collision: * On 29 January 1911, Kareela collided with Balmain New Ferry Company steamer Lady Carrington near Bradleys Head. Neither ferry was carrying passengers. Much of Lady Carrington's starboard bulwark was torn away, however, Kareela suffered little damage. * In 1914, she collided with a then new Barrenjoey.SS Barrenjoey/MV North Head Ferries of Sydney * On 26 May 1921, she collided with Manly ferry Balgowlah. * On 9 January 1924, whilst leaving Sydney Cove on a trip to Taronga Zoo, Kareela collided with Manly ferry Barrenjoey, which was entering the Cove to berth at Circular Quay. The smaller timber Kareela suffered significant damage to her port bow, while the larger steel Barrenjoey had damage to her sponson. * Returning to Circular Quay with a weekend load of passengers from Taronga Zoo on 15 March 1930, she failed to stop and hit the retaining wall, shattering both her bow timbers and the Quay pavement. * On 28 October 1932, Kareela collided with the oil lighter, Voco, whilst traveling from Waterview Bay to McMahons Point to coal. The Voco sustained light damaged, however, 5 drums of oil were swept from the Voco, only four of which were recovered. * On 2 August 1937, she ran into piles at Circular Quay damaging her superstructure.

It ran from 1984 through 1996 and was held in New York City during the autumn season. The show was owned and managed by the Blenheim Group. Origins The first Unix Expo was held in October 1984 and was split between the Sheraton Centre Hotel and the Marina Expo complex in New York and had the formal title of Unix Operating System Exposition & Conference. It was organized by the Unigroup users' group for Unix, and some seventy Unix-related vendors signed up to display at it. The shows AT&T; Corporation, owner of Bell Labs, the creator of Unix, was the company behind the early commercial push for Unix adoption; accordingly it had the anchor display position in early shows. By 1987, in its fourth year, the show had some 16,000 attendees, with commercial interest rising in Unix due to its portability and strengths in development tools and networking. Due to acquisitions of various promotions firms, the show was run under the names of several different companies, ending with the Blenheim Group. The show grew in significance; in 1985 it was where AT&T; unveiled Xenix System V, and in 1989 it was the site of AT&T;'s unveiling of the much-talked-about System V Release 4 version of Unix. Similarly, it was a site where discussions to end the divisive Unix wars could take place. Numerous other product announcements and company alliances were also announced during a Unix Expo. In its peak years, the show was held within the Javits Center and had upwards of 35,000 attendees. Along with Uniforum in San Francisco in the spring, Unix Expo was considered one of the two big Unix- themed trade shows and conferences that one could attend during a year. The show featured keynote addresses by the likes of Oracle Corporation head Larry Ellison, O'Reilly Media founder Tim O'Reilly, the Santa Cruz Operation CEO Alok Mohan, and Sun Microsystems president Ed Zander. It also featured panel discussions, technology- and business-oriented breakout sessions, and floor space for exhibiting vendors such as the aforementioned companies as well as DEC, HP, IBM, Novell, and numerous others. Two well-known industry CEOs not normally associated with Unix gave keynotes at Unix Expo: Steve Jobs in 1991, when he was head of NeXT (whose innovative NeXTSTEP operating system was built on top of Unix) in between stints at Apple Computer, and Bill Gates in 1996, when he was running Microsoft. The latter appearance was much anticipated, as Microsoft's Windows NT server operating system product was the major rival of Unix and Gates was often seen as an industry villain. As industry chronicle Computerworld headlined a story to portray it: \\"Gates to step into pro-Unix lion's den.\\" while Computer Reseller News said that Gates was taking \\"the Windows NT battle right into the belly of the beast at Unix Expo\\". In a large presentation area filled to capacity, Gates gave a message centered around the notion that Windows NT and Unix were not as far apart as one might think. But the rivalry was still manifest. During the keynote Gates oversaw a staffer running a demo of a beta version of the Microsoft Internet Explorer browser running on the Unix-based Sun Solaris operating system. And as SunWorld magazine reported, \\"to the delight of the crowd, it crashed the first time around.\\" End As it happened, 1996 was to be the last Unix Expo. During the final two years of its run, vendor participation and attendee numbers had both declined. This was attributable to Unix having become a well-established technology that had found widespread acceptance and a level of maturity; as such, it was no longer the sort of leading-edge technology that tended to warrant a demand for dedicated trade shows and conferences. That role was beginning to be taken on by the Linux operating system, which had had some small exhibits within Unix Expo and now was attracting more industry interest as a leading-edge development. Accordingly, in 1997 Unix Expo ceased to be its own entity and was folded into a new larger and more general show called IT Forum '97 and run by Miller Freeman.

Prior to independence, the country was known as British Guiana, and it had issued its own revenue stamps since the 19th century. Guyana used dual-purpose postage and revenue stamps until 1977, and it issued revenue-only stamps between 1975 and the 2000s. The country has also issued National Insurance stamps, labels for airport departure tax and excise stamps for cigarettes and alcohol. Revenue On 1 November 1975, Guyana issued a series of revenue stamps by overprinting a number of postage stamps which had been issued between 1971 and 1973 with the text REVENUE ONLY. The overprint was applied to stamps with denominations ranging from 2c to $5, all of which depicted flowers. Despite the overprint, the stamps were also valid for postal use until 30 June 1976, and they are therefore regarded as postal fiscal stamps. Some of these stamps were later additionally overprinted for use as postage or official stamps. Also in 1975, revenue stamps with denominations of $10, $20 and $50 which depicted a map of the country were printed by Bradbury Wilkinson and Company, and they are believed to have been issued in Guyana sometime in 1975. Some time later further revenue stamps with this design were printed by Harrison and Sons, this time with denominations ranging from 2c to $50. Some of the Harrison stamps exist postally used, and some were overprinted for postal use in the 1980s. In the 1980s, some Guyanese postage stamps which depicted butterflies were issued with revenue overprints, and in around 1990 one of the map stamps printed by Harrison was issued with a $300 surcharge. A new design of revenue stamps which depicted the country's coat of arms was issued in around 2000. This was printed by BDT International Security Printing and it has face values ranging from $1 to $1000. A modified version of this design was later issued in self-adhesive format, and it had the same denominations and was also printed by BDT. Apart from revenue-only issues, Guyana also issued dual-purpose postage and revenue stamps. Postage stamps ceased to be valid for fiscal use on 1 January 1977. Other typesNational Insurance= Guyana ordered a set of six National Insurance stamps from the printer Harrison and Sons in 1969. No examples of these stamps have been recorded. =Airport tax= The Guyana Revenue Authority issues adhesive labels as receipts for the payment of the travel or departure tax upon leaving the country. As of 2020, the price of such a label at Cheddi Jagan International Airport is $4000, consisting of a travel tax of $2500 and an airport security fee of $1500. =Excise on cigarettes and alcohol= Since 16 November 2017, the Guyana Revenue Authority has issued self-adhesive excise stamps for cigarettes and alcohol. These are affixed to cigarette packets and alcohol bottles to show that the appropriate tax has been paid, and they were introduced as an anti-smuggling measure. The stamps are printed by the Canadian Bank Note Company and they have a number of security features aimed at preventing forgery. Impressed duty stamps Guyana used impressed duty stamps depicting the coat of arms and inscribed INLAND REVENUE GUYANA in the 1960s.

He was also a test pilot and airline captain. He became the oldest active pilot in the US, making his first flight on his 18th birthday and ending at the age of 101. He died aged 102.  Early life  At the age of four Miller saw Glen Curtiss fly from a field opposite his father's farm as one of two permitted refuelling stops during his successful attempt to win the New York World newspaper prize of $10,000 for a flight from Albany to New York City, and decided to become a pilot. In 1915 Miller met and talked to famous aviator Ruth Law and sat in the cockpit of her Wright Model B aircraft. He studied Horatio Barber's flying instruction book Aerobatics given to him by an uncle. Miller took his first flight in a Curtiss JN-4 Jenny in the summer of 1922 at Asbury Park, New Jersey.  Barnstorming  In 1923 a barnstorming pilot, Sloan \\"Swanee\\" Taylor, gave pleasure flights in a decrepit Jenny from a field near his home, and the 17-year-old Miller, who was working in a machine shop during school holidays, helped him with maintenance and repairs. The aircraft was actually the Canadian version of the Jenny, a Canuck, but was modified with larger wings, giving slower take-offs and landings. It was previously owned by Ruth Law, and had a brand new engine. At the end of the season, Taylor gave Miller a 5-minute ride, then gave him the Jenny, saying that it would be cheaper to buy a new aircraft rather than repair this one. After doing a lot of repairs to it himself, Miller practised on the ground for a few weeks, and on his 18th birthday found himself rapidly approaching a stone wall, so rather than crashing into it, he applied more power and took off. After around an hour's flying, exploring the effect of the controls, he eventually managed a reasonable landing, whereupon a local farmer who had been watching him, asked him if he gave rides. Miller said yes, and took him up for a handful of change, and on landing two other passers-by asked for rides, which he also did, charging $5 a flight, the amount painted on the side of the aircraft. Miller did some more pleasure flights, then at Christmas he took it to a local barn and with the help of friends did extensive repairs. By the summer of 1924 he had finished, did more flights, mainly with the friends, and then sold it before starting college. Miller made the trip to Roosevelt Field on 20 May 1927 to watch Charles Lindbergh take off on his pioneering transatlantic flight. A month later he graduated from a mechanical engineering course at Pratt Institute of Technology in 1927, gained his A&P; (airframe and powerplant) licence (no. 2906) and then worked for a while as a mechanic with Gates Flying Circus. He gained his transport pilot's licence (no. 5945) in 1928 with the Curtiss School of Flight at Mineola, Long Island, New York, and did more barnstorming and pleasure flights with his four-passenger Standard J-1 which he had rebuilt over six months from a near-wreck. He started air racing in a Travel Air 2000. In 1927 the mayor of Poughkeepsie, John Kelsey Sague, (later to become Miller's father-in-law), established Poughkeepsie Airport at Red Oaks Mill to the south-east of the town, which in 1931 Miller took over and ran. He established his company, Giro Flyers Ltd in the hangar there. His main business was repair and maintenance of the aircraft, many of them New Standard models, used by bootleggers to bring alcohol in from Canada. Miller's interest in this lucrative business carried on until the end of prohibition in 1933, but the airport carried on until it was closed in 1938. A New Standard D-25 with four passengers in the front cockpit In 1931 he acquired New Standard D-24 c/n102 registered NC193E. Its fuselage had been damaged when Anthony Fokker wrecked a line of parked aircraft while landing his Express aircraft at Teterboro Airport,. It was powered by a Hispano-Suiza E engine. Miller rebuilt it with a Wright J-5 engine, turning it into a D-25. Assisted by efficient ground crew to marshal the passengers and refuel the aircraft, he would do up to 350 short flights (less than a minute each) a day. While doing aerobatics in the New Standard, Marine Corps officers saw him and invited him to join the Reserve at Pensacola, Florida, and he served for a while at Quantico, Virginia, as a qualified naval aviator. Miller sold the D-25 in 1935.  Autogyros  Pitcairn = A Pitcairn PCA-2, 'Miss Champion', NC11609, at the EAA Museum, Oshkosh, Wisconsin In 1923 Miller read about the progress that Juan de la Cierva was making with autogyros in Madrid. Miller wrote to him, and received two letters in return, explaining how autogyros work. In 1929 Cierva had visited the USA and sold the licence for his designs to Harold Pitcairn, forming the Pitcairn-Cierva Autogiro Company. Miller's correspondence had continued, and he visited Pitcairn, soon ordering a PCA-2, becoming the first private individual in the USA to purchase an autogyro, at a cost of $15,000. He then formulated a plan to perform the first transcontinental autogyro flight, which he soon discovered would be in competition with Amelia Earhart, whose Pitcairn autogyro was sponsored by the Beech-Nut food company, then well known for its chewing gum. Miller realised that Kellett was keen for the famous Earhart to get her aircraft first to ensure maximum publicity, but Miller arranged to learn to fly a similar machine at Pitcairn's plant before his own aircraft was ready. This enabled him to do detailed training and planning before the long distance flight, and to set off before Earhart was ready to undertake her flight, for which she was evidently under-prepared. He did practice flights at the Pitcairn plant at Willow Grove, Pennsylvania, between 9 and 12 May 1931, making 110 practice landings with a total of 5.5 hours of flying logged. Miller took delivery of his new machine, a black PCA-2 c/n B-13, registered NC10781, which he named 'Missing Link' on 12 May 1931. Two days later, on 14 May, he transferred it to his newly formed company, Giro Flyers, Ltd. On the same day he set off from Willow Grove on his transcontinental flight. He stopped off at the Omaha Air Races, where he did 14 demonstration flights, finally reaching Naval Air Station San Diego, now Naval Air Station North Island, on 28 May. He had spent 43.8 hours in the air and had no mechanical problems with the aircraft. His flight set a record which lasted 72 years, when it was broken by Andrew Keech in his Herron-Keech Little Wing LW-5 on 3 October 2003. While he was in San Diego, Miller demonstrated the PCA-2 to the military at the North Island, Coronado, base, including giving passenger flights to two admirals. These were the first ever autogyro flights on the west coast of the USA. F√™ted by oil companies and film star Mary Pickford, his departure was delayed until 21 June, when he started the return flight to Willow Grove, arriving on 1 July. When Pitcairn mechanics inspected the aircraft, all that was needed was an oil change. Earhart flew her PCA-2. NC10780, setting out from Newark Metropolitan Airport on 28 May and after an unhurried journey with many publicity stops reached Oakland, California on 6 June. She and her sponsor were extremely disappointed to learn that Miller had beaten her, and resolved to try to beat his west-to-east performance. However, she crashed at Abilene, Texas during the attempt, finishing her journey by train but still garnering more publicity than Miller. Miller carried on over the next four years demonstrating the autogyro at air races, and air shows, and developed the skill of looping it, becoming the first person ever to loop a rotorcraft (though not the first person to demonstrate it publicly). He incorporated the manoeuvre into his displays, often adding a roll at the top. He was being paid $1,000 per display. In the 1932 Cleveland National Air Races he was performing a mock dogfight against a modified Curtiss Pusher and on landing, his autogyro was hit by the Curtiss as it overflew him, probably the result of a strong wind on the fragile biplane. Miller and his passenger were unharmed, but the Curtiss pilot, his friend Al Wilson, died two days later of his injuries. The autogyro was damaged and was grounded for 27 days waiting for new rotors and a rudder. There is film of the crash. On 26 January 1934 he was banner-towing in the PCA-2. He took off from Newark for a flight around Manhattan. The engine stopped over North Arlington, New Jersey and he landed safely in a cemetery, fixed the engine and took off from among the gravestones. United Air Lines Boeing 247D NC13369 on display in the NASM In 1936 he joined United Air Lines as a Boeing 247D co-pilot flying the Cheyenne to Salt Lake City and New York to Chicago routes. He flew with United for around 18 months, and was about to be promoted to captain when he was contacted by W. Wallace Kellett. = Kellett = Kellett had obtained a licence to produce Pitcairn autogyros, and asked Miller to be the test pilot for his new wingless version, the two-seat KD-1. The D in the name stood for Direct control, meaning that the rotor was responsible for all aerodynamic control, so that ailerons (and therefore the wings), elevators and indeed airspeed were no longer required. Other test pilots had declined to fly it, fearing for the safety of the aircraft, but Miller, thoroughly understanding the principles involved, was convinced that the radical new design would be safe, and accepted Kellett's offer. The testing went well, Miller even becoming the first pilot to dive an autogyro ‚Äì the advancing rotors went near-supersonic and caused severe problems for Miller, but he survived, shaken but unscathed, and the aircraft sustained only minor damage, mainly to the rotor blades. The inspector who had asked for this test then declined to pass the aircraft but Miller told him that any aircraft subject to that level of abuse where it and the pilot both survived was obviously worthy of a certificate, and the inspector agreed. This success emboldened Kellett and Miller to lobby Washington to enable regular autogyro mail services to start, and an act was passed on 15 April 1938. Remarkably, the act released rotary-winged aircraft from most of the safety provisions that applied to fixed-wing aircraft, mainly on account of their ability to land safely almost anywhere in the event of an emergency. This exemption largely continues into the 21st century. Kellett then approached several airlines to bid on mail contracts for an autogyro service. At first only TWA was interested, but Miller thought that they just wanted the publicity. He made two demonstration flights for them between the Chicago postal facility and Chicago Municipal Airport (now Midway Airport), but TWA then rejected the idea. Kellett and Miller then approached Eddie Rickenbacker of Eastern Air Lines with a view to using Kellett autogyros to fly the mail between the main post office in Philadelphia and the nearby Camden Central Airport in New Jersey, a distance of just under six miles, crossing the Delaware River and saving a considerable amount of time. Rickenbacker was very enthusiastic and agreed to run a one-year trial. He offered Miller the job as chief pilot of the operation. To Kellett's surprise, Miller asked for twice the amount that Kellett was paying him, and Rickenbacker agreed, even offering to take him on as a regular pilot if the mail service ended. Johnny Miller flying into Washington in the KD-1A on 19 May 1938 On 19 May 1938, on behalf of Eastern Air Lines, Miller made a demonstration mail flight in the prototype KD-1, now modified into a KD-1A with a mail compartment in place of the front cockpit, from the Bethesda, Maryland, postal station to a temporary post office tent outside the main DC post office (now the National Postal Museum), as well as a trip from the DC post office to Washington Hoover airport. Kellett then designed a new version, the KD-1B, with a canopy enclosing the rear, pilot's seat, a radio, blind-flying instruments, a landing light and other changes to Eastern's requirements. Eddie Rickenbacker hands a mailbag to KD-1B pilot Johnny Miller at the start of the airmail service The Eastern Air Lines mail service, no AM2001, started on 6 June 1939. after Miller had done several practice flights, mainly to get used to the often severe turbulence experienced on the roof of the post office. The new KD-1B was used, with the KD-1A held as a backup. A reserve pilot was recruited after Miller had to take two weeks off with influenza. This was John \\"Skipp\\" Lukens, the Pitcairn test pilot who had checked Miller out before he took delivery of his PCA-2. The service, the world's first rotary-wing mail service, and the first to use the roof of a building, ran five return flights a day, six days a week, with Miller doing the majority of the flying. and was a complete success, exceeding regularity expectations. There was only one minor incident when the autogyro, piloted by Lukens, was blown over by a wind on the post office roof while taxiing. Some debris from damaged rotor blades fell into the street below, leading to false reports that the autogyro itself had crashed. Miller repaired the damage himself. There was also one precautionary landing in a vacant lot by Lukens due to suspected carburettor icing. After a short wait, he took off again without further problems. The contract was completed on 5 June 1940 but was not renewed, so Miller then joined Eastern as a fixed-wing pilot.  Later career  Grumman (Columbia) J2F-6 Duck of the type test flown by Miller With Eastern Air Lines, he flew the Douglas DC-2 and DC-3. He also formed Miller's Machine Works, and on his days off, he manufactured small parts for the Columbia Aircraft Corporation, who had started producing Grumman J2F-6 Ducks at their Valley Stream plant on Long Island. In late 1941, as he was a reservist but too old for combat duty, he was invited to become their chief test pilot. In 1946 he also tested both prototypes of the unsuccessful Duck replacement, the monoplane Columbia XJL-1. Returning to Eastern, over the next 25 years he went on to fly the Douglas DC-4, DC-6, DC-7, Lockheed Constellation and Electra, and the DC-8. For the latter part of his career he commuted daily in his Beech V35A Bonanza N19WC from Poughkeepsie to whichever New York airport he was scheduled to fly from ‚Äì he claimed that he was the only airline pilot in the area to do that. Miller left Eastern Air Lines in 1965 with over 35,000 hours in his logbooks. Miller has stated that he retired a little early (Eastern had compulsory retirement at age 60) because he was tired of returning late at night to a cold, dark, empty house. There is another possibility: that he was fired or asked to leave ‚àí see Personal life below. Miller then bought a three-passenger version of the Bell 47G helicopter which he flew on contract work, often for the police until 1971 when they bought their own helicopter. He tried to interest a local hospital in getting a heliport, but they didn't like the idea, and he then retired from commercial aviation. In 1967 he was a founding director of the American Bonanza Society. He was also a member of the United Flying Octogenarians club (UFO), and a Charter member of the Quiet Birdmen.) In 2001, the 70th anniversary of his transcontinental autogyro flight, he made the trip again, now aged 94, in his Bonanza. A more leisurely affair, he stopped off at the EAA AirVenture show at Oshkosh, Wisconsin, and various other places. and reached his target, Gillespie Field outside San Diego. The return trip involved just two fuel stops, and the whole journey took 35.5 hours of flying. He continued to fly his Bonanza and latterly a Turbo Baron from Poughkeepsie until he finally gave up his license in 2006. For a few years before this the FAA insisted that he flew with a safety pilot, but Miller gave them strict instructions to never touch the controls. He had been the USA's oldest pilot. He wrote a book called Flying Stories: A Chronicle of Aviation History from Jennys to Jets by the Pilot Who Flew Through It All, published in 2002. He used 'jennys2jets' as his email address. Miller took his first glider flight in 2006 aged 100 and liked it so much he went up for another. Eastern Air Lines Douglas DC-3 NC18124 in the NASM Miller received the Sikorsky Award for his part in the evolution of the helicopter, a Certificate of Honour from the National Aeronautic Association for his contributions to aviation, and had been made an honorary fellow of the Society of Experimental Test Pilots for having ‚Äúpromoted the moral obligation of the test pilot to the safety of the aerospace world‚Äù. Two aircraft flown by Miller are on display at the National Air and Space Museum (NASM) on Washington Mall: Boeing 247D NC13369 of United Air Lines and Douglas DC-3 NC18124 of Eastern Air Lines. The two flying prototypes of the Columbia XJL-1 that he tested are also in museums, one at Pima Air Museum, Arizona, and the other at the Yanks Air Museum, California.  Personal life  Johnny's younger sister Elizabeth Lee Miller became a prominent photographer and associate of Man Ray. Miller married Katherine North Sague in 1933. They had three children. Three years after his first wife died he married Edith Mead, and also outlived her. In the 1960s he started cross-dressing, adopting the persona of Felicity Chandelle. He was arrested in New York city in March 1964, and charged with vagrancy, being disguised in public, and sentenced to two days imprisonment, suspended. Appeals were rejected by both the New York Court of Appeals and the US Supreme Court. Eastern Airlines subsequently fired Miller for having 'signalled homosexuality'. Miller claimed never to have taken alcohol, coffee or tobacco, and never took prescription drugs, except in his final days. He died 23 June 2008 aged 102 of natural causes at Vassar Brothers Medical Center, Poughkeepsie.

The interactions occur when individuals make mistakes or are unable to recognise their own species, labelled as ‚Äòincomplete species recognition'. Reproductive interference has been found within a variety of taxa, including insects, mammals, birds, amphibians, marine organisms, and plants. There are seven causes of reproductive interference, namely signal jamming, heterospecific rivalry, misdirected courtship, heterospecific mating attempts, erroneous female choice, heterospecific mating, and hybridisation. All types have fitness costs on the participating individuals, generally from a reduction in reproductive success, a waste of gametes, and the expenditure of energy and nutrients. These costs are variable and dependent on numerous factors, such as the cause of reproductive interference, the sex of the parent, and the species involved. Reproductive interference occurs between species that occupy the same habitat and can play a role in influencing the coexistence of these species. It differs from competition as reproductive interference does not occur due to a shared resource. Reproductive interference can have ecological consequences, such as through the segregation of species both spatially and temporally. It can also have evolutionary consequences, for example; it can impose a selective pressure on the effected species to evolve traits that better distinguish themselves from other species.  Causes of reproductive interference  Reproductive interference can occur at different stages of mating, from locating a potential mate, to the fertilisation of an individual of a different species. There are seven causes of reproductive interference that each have their own consequences on the fitness of one or both of the involved individuals. = Signal jamming = Signal jamming refers to the interference of one signal by another. Jamming can occur by signals emitted from environmental sources (e.g. noise pollution), or from other species. In the context of reproductive interference, signal jamming only refers to the disruption of the transmission or retrieval of signals by another species. The process of mate attraction and acquisition involves signals to aid in locating and recognising potential mates. Signals can also give the receiver an indication of the quality of a potential mate. Signal jamming can occur in different types of communication. Auditory signal jamming, otherwise labelled as auditory masking, is when a noisy environment created by heterospecific signals causes difficulties in identifying conspecifics. Likewise in chemical signals, pheromones that are meant to attract conspecifics and drive off others may overlap with heterospecific pheromones, leading to confusion. Difficulties in recognising and locating conspecifics can result in a reduction of encounters with potential mates and a decrease in mating frequencies.  Examples  Pair of mating American grapevine leafhoppers (Scaphoideus titanus) Vibrational signalling in the American grapevine leafhopper - Individuals of the American grapevine leafhopper communicate with each other through vibrational signals that they transmit through the host plant. American grapevine leafhoppers are receptive of signals within their receptor‚Äôs sensitivity range of 50 to 1000 Hz. The vibrations can be used to identify and locate potential female mates. To successfully communicate, a duet is performed between the male and female American grapevine leafhopper. The female replies within a specific timeframe after the male signal, and the male may use the timing of her reply to identify her. However, vibrational signals are prone to disruption and masking by heterospecific signals, conspecific signals, and background noise that are within their species- specific sensitivity range. The interference of the duet between a male and female American grapevine leafhopper can reduce the male‚Äôs success in identifying and locating the female, which can reduce the frequency of mating. Gray treefrog (Hyla versicolor) Auditory signalling in the gray treefrog (Hyla versicolor) and the Cope's gray treefrogs (Hyla chrysoscelis) ‚Äì The success of reproduction is dependent on a female‚Äôs ability to correctly identify and respond to the advertisement call of a potential mate. At a breeding site with high densities of males, the male‚Äôs chorus may overlap with heterospecific calls, making it difficult for the female to successfully locate a mate. When the advertisement calls of the male gray treefrog and male Cope‚Äôs gray treefrog overlap, female gray treefrogs make mistakes and choose the heterospecific call. The amount of errors the female makes is dependent on the amount of overlap between signals. Female Cope‚Äôs gray treefrogs can better differentiate the signals and are only significantly affected when heterospecifics completely overlap conspecific male signals. However, female Cope‚Äôs gray treefrogs prefer conspecific male signals that have less overlap (i.e. less interference). Furthermore, females have longer response times to overlapped calls, where it takes longer for them to choose a mate. Signal jamming can affect both males and females as difficulties in identifying and locating a mate reduces their mating frequencies. Females may have more costs if they mate with a male of a lower quality, and may be susceptible to a higher risk of predation by predators within the breeding site if they take longer to choose and locate a male. Heterospecific mating between the gray treefrog and Cope‚Äôs gray treefrogs also can form an infertile hybrid which is highly costly to both parents due to the wastage of gametes. Chemical signalling in ticks ‚Äì Female ticks produce a pheromone that is a species- specific signal to attract conspecific males that are attached to the host. Female ticks also produce a pheromone that is not species-specific which can attract males that are in a close proximity to her. Pheromones emitted from closely related species can mix and lead to interference. Three species of ticks: Aponomma hydrosauri, Amblyomma albolimbatum, and Amblyomma limbatum, are closely related and can interfere with one another when attached to the same host. When two of the species of tick are attached on the same host, males have difficulties locating a female of the same species, potentially due to the mixing of pheromones. The pheromone that is not species-specific also has the capability of attracting males of all three species when they are in close proximity to the female. The presence of a heterospecific female can also reduce the time a male spends with conspecific females, leading to a reduction of reproductive success. Furthermore, when Amblyomma albolimbatum males attach to Aponomma hydrosauri females to mate, despite being unsuccessful, they remain attached which physically inhibits following males from mating. = Heterospecific rivalry = Heterospecific rivalry occurs between males, when a male of a different species is mistaken as a rival for mates (i.e. mistaken for a conspecific male). In particular, heterospecific rivalry is hard to differentiate from other interspecific interactions, such as the competition over food and other resources. Costs to the mistaken males can include the wastage of time and energy, and a higher risk of injury and predation if they leave their mating territory to pursue the heterospecific male. Males that chase off a heterospecific male may also leave females exposed to following intruders, whether it be a conspecific or heterospecific male.  Examples  The Eastern amberwing dragonfly (Perithemis tenera) Eastern amberwing dragonfly (Perithemis tenera) ‚Äì Male Eastern amberwing dragonflies are territorial as they defend mating territories from rival conspecific males. The male will perch around their territory and pursue conspecifics that fly near the perch. When the male is approached by a species of horsefly and butterfly, they are similarly pursued. The horsefly and butterfly do not compete over a common resource with the Eastern amberwing dragonfly, have not been seen interfering with the mating within the territory, and are neither a predator nor prey of the Eastern amberwing dragonfly. Instead, they are pursued potentially due to being mistaken for a rival conspecific as they share similar characteristics in size, colour, and flight height. The similar characteristics may be cues used by the male Eastern amberwing dragonfly to identify conspecifics. The heterospecific pursuit is costly for the male as they waste energy and time, have a higher risk of injury, and may lose opportunities to defend their territory against subsequent intruders. = Misdirected courtship = Misdirected courtship occurs when males display courtship towards individuals of a different species of either sex. The misdirection is caused by a mistake during species recognition, or by an attraction towards heterospecifics that possess desirable traits. Such desirable traits are those traits that normally are an indicator of conspecific mate quality, such as body size. Costs associated with misdirecting courtship for males include the wasted energy investment in the attempt to court heterospecifics, and a decrease in mating frequency within species.  Examples  Red cheek (Uraeginthus angolensis) Waxbill ‚Äì Waxbills are monogamous, where an individual only has one partner. Parents also display biparental care, where both the mother and father contribute to the care of the offspring. The combination of monogamy and biparental investment suggest that both male and female waxbills should be ‚Äòchoosy‚Äô and have strong preferences to reduce the chances of mating with a heterospecific female. Males of the three species of waxbill: blue breast (Uraeginthus angolensis), red cheek (Uraeginthus bengalus), and blue cap (Uraeginthus cyanocephalus), have differing strengths of preferences for conspecific females when also presented with a heterospecific female. The differing preferences is affected by the body size of the females, potentially due to body size being an indicator of fecundity, which is the ability to produce offspring. Blue breast males prefer conspecifics over red cheek females that are smaller; however, have a weaker preference for conspecifics over blue breast females that are only slightly smaller. Red cheek males have no preference for conspecifics in the presence of a larger blue breast female or blue cap female. Blue cap males prefer conspecifics over red cheek females; however, have no preference for conspecifics in the presence of a larger blue breast male. Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) ‚Äì Atlantic salmon that were once native to Lake Ontario were reintroduced to the lake to study their spawning interactions with other species of fish, including the chinook salmon, coho salmon, and brown trout. Chinook salmon interacted with Atlantic salmon the most, where male chinooks attempted to court female Atlantic salmon. Male chinooks also chased away, and in some interactions, behaved aggressively towards other Atlantic salmon that approached female Atlantic salmon. A male brown trout was also observed to court a female Atlantic salmon. Misdirected courtship towards the Atlantic salmon can cause problems in waters that the Atlantic salmon currently occupy, and towards conservation efforts to reintroduce the Atlantic salmon to Lake Ontario. Implications of misdirected courtship on the Atlantic salmon can cause the delay or prevention of spawning, and the hybridisation of the Atlantic salmon with other species. = Heterospecific mating attempts = Heterospecific mating attempts occur when males attempt to mate with females of a different species, regardless of whether courtship occurs. During each mating attempt, sperm transfer may or may not occur. Both sexes have costs when a heterospecific attempts to mate. Costs associated with heterospecific mating attempts include wasted energy, time, and potentially gametes if sperm transfer occurs. There is also a risk of injury and increased risk of predation for both sexes.  Examples  The Cepero's grasshopper (Tetrix ceperoi). Cepero's grasshopper (Tetrix ceperoi) and the slender groundhopper (Tetrix subulata) ‚Äì Naturally the distribution of the Cepero‚Äôs grasshopper and slender groundhopper overlap; however, they rarely co-exist. The reproductive success of the Cepero‚Äôs grasshopper decreases when housed within the same enclosure as high numbers of the slender groundhopper. The reduction of reproductive success stems from an increase in mating attempts by the Cepero's grasshopper towards the slender groundhopper, which may be due to their larger body size. However, these mating attempts are generally unsuccessful as the mate recognition of female slender groundhoppers are reliable, which may be due to the different courtship displays of the two species. The reduced reproductive success can cause the displacement in one of the species, potentially a factor as to why the species rarely co-exist despite sharing similar habitat preferences. Agile frog (Rana dalmatina) Italian agile frog (Rana latastei) - The distribution of Italian agile frog and the agile frog (Rana dalmatina) overlap naturally in ponds and drainage ditches. In the areas of overlap, the abundance of agile frogs is higher than Italian agile frogs. When there is a higher abundance of agile frogs, the mating between Italian agile frogs is interfered with. Male agile frogs attempt to displace male Italian agile frogs during amplexus, which is a type of mating position where the male grasps onto the female. The Italian agile frog and agile frog have been seen in amplexus when co-existing. The mating attempts by the agile frog reduces the reproductive success of the Italian agile frog. The Italian agile frog also produces a lower number of viable eggs in the presence of the agile frog, potentially due to sperm competition between the male Italian agile frog and agile frog. = Erroneous female choice = Erroneous female choice refers to mistakes made by females when differentiating males of the same species from males of a different species. Female choice may occur at different stages of mating, including male courtship, copulation, or after copulation. Female choice can depend on the availability of appropriate males. When there are less available conspecific males, females may make more mistakes as they become less ‚Äòchoosy‚Äô.  Examples  Striped ground cricket (Allonemobius fasciatus) and Southern ground cricket (Allonemobius socius) - The striped ground cricket and the Southern ground cricket are closely related species that have an overlapping distribution. Both crickets use calling songs in order to identify and locate potential mates. The songs of the two species have a different frequency and period. Females of both species show little preference between the songs from conspecific and heterospecific males. The minor preference disappears if the intensity of the calls are altered. The lack of ability to differentiate between the two songs can result in erroneous female choice. Erroneous female choice has costs, including energy wastage, and increases in predation risk when searching for a conspecific. Additionally, it is highly costly when the mistake leads to heterospecific mating, which involves the wastage of gametes. However, the cost of erroneous female choice may be small for the striped ground and Southern ground cricket due to their high abundance. The lack of ability to differentiate between the calling songs is proposed to be due to the weak selective pressure on the females. = Heterospecific mating = Heterospecific mating is when two individuals from different species mate. After the male transfers his sperm into the heterospecific female, different processes can occur that may change the outcome of the copulation. Heterospecific mating may result in the production of a hybrid in some pairings. Costs associated to heterospecific mating include the wastage of time, energy, and gametes.  Examples  Spider mites ‚Äì two closely related Panonychus mites: the Panonychus citri and Panonychus mori, are generally geographically segregated and on occasion co- exist. However, the co-existence is not stable as the Panonychus mori is eventually excluded. The exclusion is a result of reproductive interference and also due to the higher reproductive rate of the Panonychus citri. Heterospecific mating occurs between the two species which can produce infertile eggs or infertile hybrid females. Furthermore, females are not able to produce female offspring after mating with a heterospecific. In addition to the wastage of energy, time, and gametes, the inability to produce female offspring after heterospecific mating skews the sex ratio of the co-existing populations. The high costs associated with heterospecific mating along with the higher reproductive rate of the Panonychus citri lead to the displacement of the Panonychus mori. Handsome Meadow Katydid (Orchelimum pulchellum) Black- legged meadow katydid (Orchelimum nigripes) and the handsome meadow katydid (Orchelimum pulchellum) ‚Äì The two closely related species of katydid have the same habitat preferences and co-exist along the Potomac River. Females of both species that mate heterospecifically have a large reduction in fecundity compared to conspecific pairings. Heterospecific mating either produces no eggs or male hybrids that may be sterile. Both individuals suffer a large fitness cost from the wastage of energy, time, and gametes, as they unsuccessfully pass on their genes. However, females may be able to offset this cost through multiple mating, as they receive nutritional benefits from consuming a nuptial food gift from the male, otherwise known as the spermatophylax. = Hybridisation = Main article: Hybridisation Hybridisation, in the context of reproductive interference, is defined as the mating between individuals of different species that can lead to a hybrid, an inviable egg, or an inviable offspring. The frequency of hybridisation increases if it is hard to recognise potential mates, especially when heterospecifics share similarities, such as body size, colouration, and acoustic signals. Costs associated with hybridisation are dependent on the level of parental investment and on the product of the pairing (hybrid). Hybrids have the potential to become invasive if they develop traits that make them more successful than their parent species in surviving within new and changing habitats, otherwise known as hybrid vigor or heterosis. Compared to each individual parent species, they hold a different combination of characteristics that can be more adaptable and 'fit' within particular environments. If an inviable product is produced, both parents suffer from the cost of unsuccessfully passing on their genes.  Examples  California Tiger Salamander (Ambystoma californiense) California Tiger Salamanders (Ambystoma californiense) x Barred Tiger Salamanders (Ambystoma mavortium) - California tiger salamanders are native to California, and were geographically isolated from Barred tiger salamanders. Barred tiger salamanders were then introduced by humans to California, and the mating between these two species led to the formation of a population of hybrids. The hybrids have since established in their parent habitat and spread into human modified environments. Within hybrids, the survivability of individuals with a mixed- ancestry is higher than individuals with a highly native or highly introduced genetic background. Stable populations can form as populations with a large native ancestry become mixed with more introduced genes, and vice versa. Hybrids pose both ecological and conservation consequences as they threaten the population viability of the native California tiger salamanders, which is currently listed as an endangered species. The hybrids may also affect the viability of other native organisms within the invaded regions, as they consume large quantities of aquatic invertebrate and tadpole.Red deer (Cervus elaphus) x Sika deer (Cervus nippon) hybrid Red deer (Cervus elaphus) x sika deer (Cervus nippon) - The sika deer were originally introduced by humans to Britain and has since established and spread through deliberate reintroductions and escape. The red deer are native to Britain and hybridise with the sika deer in areas which they co-exist. Heterospecific mating between the red deer and sika deer can produce viable hybrids. Sika deer and the hybrids may outcompete and displace native deer from dense woodland. As the complete eradication of sika and the hybrids is impractical, management efforts are directed at minimising spread by not planting vegetation that would facilitate their spread into regions where the red deer still persist.

The author, a former partisan, analyses the resistance in multiple aspects, focusing on the motivations, behaviour, expectations and objectives of partisans themselves. The work is an attempt to shift the historiographic focus from the overtly political, in which the parties are agents and at the centre of history, to ethics, that is, analysing subjective motivations, aspirations, delusions and hopes within the partisan movement. Pavone's book significantly shaped historical debates relating to the Resistance and to the crucial period between the armistice of Cassibile and Italian liberation. The work proposes that the period be considered as three simultaneous wars: \\"patriotic\\" against the German invader, \\"civil\\" between Italian fascists and anti-fascists, and \\"class\\" between revolutionary and bourgeois. Although contentious upon publication, the work is considered to have facilitated a wider acceptance that the events of 1943-45 should be considered as a civil war rather than, as in the previously dominant understanding, a war of liberation. Mark Mazower of Columbia University, called A Civil War a \\"great work\\" and \\"among the few indisputable masterpieces of contemporary history.\\" David Ellwood, in the English Historical Review, noted, \\"Pavone‚Äôs book will always remain as the outstanding monument to the Resistance movement in its philosophical and political dimensions.\\"  Editions In Italian= * * =In English= *  References  Category:1991 non-fiction books ","title":"A Civil War (book)"},{"id":"64053237","text":"Delta is a monthly, popular science magazine published by the University of Warsaw in cooperation with: * The Polish Mathematical Society, * The Polish Physical Society, * The Polish Astronomical Society, * The Polish Information Processing Society.

Biography  James Thorne was born at North Furze Farm, Shebbear, Devonshire, on 21 Sept. 1795. He was the son of John Thorne, farmer, by his wife, Mary Ley, daughter of a farmer in the neighbouring parish of Bradford. On 9 Oct. 1815 the Society of Bible Christians was formed by William O'Bryan. Among its members were John and Mary Thorne, with their five children. James, who was known among his companions as \\"a lad o' pairts,\\" rapidly acquired a position of pre-eminence among his associates. He almost immediately began preaching, and for four years continued to journey throughout the various parts of Devonshire. The effect of his labours was very great. When he began preaching the Bible Christians were twenty-two in number. At the end of four years they were numerous in many parts of Devonshire. Thorne endured many hardships and much actual persecution, though his eloquence and earnestness generally disarmed opposition when he could obtain a hearing. In 1820 he visited Kent, where he also met with considerable success, and aided in founding several congregations of \\"Arminian Bible Christians.\\" In 1824 he was sent to London, where he placed the congregation in a prosperous condition, and in 1825 he again visited Kent as a missionary. From 1817 onwards Thorne was also foremost in the work of founding chapels for his co-religionists both in Devonshire and Kent. The first chapel was finished at Shebbear in 1818, and three more were built by his exertions in Kent by 1821. From 1827 to 1829 he was superintendent preacher of the Shebbear circuit, from 1830 to 1831 he filled the same office in Kilkhampton, and in 1831 he presided over the general conference of Bible Christians. From this time onwards until 1844 he was chiefly occupied in journeying through Southern England, organising the society, and forming local congregations in various districts. Thorne was fitted for evangelical work by a ready wit and considerable dialectical skill, which stood him in good stead in controversy. He was no less aided by the fascination of his discourses, which rendered indifference impossible. In the after work of building up congregations his counsels were always on the side of prudence, without discountenancing enterprise. Labouring among people of small means, he deprecated building chapels with a heavy debt attached. In addition to his other duties Thorne shared in the pastoral work in the circuit of Shebbear, and after the resignation of William O'Bryan in September 1828, he became editor of the ‚ÄòBible Christian Magazine,‚Äô continuing in that office until 1866, when he was succeeded by F. W. Bourne. In 1844 he settled at Shebbear, and confined himself more to local work, though still undertaking frequent mission tours. In 1870 failing health compelled him to relinquish his \\"connexional duties,\\" and to restrict himself simply to preaching. He removed to Plymouth, where he died on 28 Jan. 1872, and was buried at Shebbear. He was without doubt by far the ablest man among the early Bible Christians. On 23 Sept. 1823 he married Catherine Reed of Holwell, by whom he had six children. Portraits of Thorne are prefixed to the memoirs of 1873 and 1895.

Pour the milk over it and let it soak. Cut the Cantal cheese into thin cubes, as finely as possible, and set aside. Drain the bread, then press it into a colander to remove the milk. Heat the butter in a large, thick-bottomed skillet. As soon as it starts foaming, add the bread crumb and stir with a wooden spatula to soak up melted butter. Then add the cheese gradually without ceasing to stir. Continue the operation on medium heat, while the cheese starts to melt. Season with pepper, salt, onions and garlic. Halfway through cooking, the patranque can be turned over like a large patty.

The corresponding Lie algebra is the Virasoro algebra, which has a key role in conformal field theory (CFT) and string theory. The group is named after Miguel √Ångel Virasoro and Raoul Bott.  Background  An orientation-preserving diffeomorphism of the circle S^1, whose points are labelled by a real coordinate x subject to the identification x\\\\sim x+2\\\\pi, is a smooth map f:\\\\mathbb{R}\\\\to\\\\mathbb{R}:x\\\\mapsto f(x) such that f(x+2\\\\pi)=f(x)+2\\\\pi and f'(x)>0. The set of all such maps spans a group, with multiplication given by the composition of diffeomorphisms. This group is the universal cover of the group of orientation-preserving diffeomorphisms of the circle, denoted as \\\\widetilde{\\\\text{Diff}}{}^+(S^1). Definition The Virasoro group is the universal central extension of \\\\widetilde{\\\\text{Diff}}{}^+(S^1). The extension is defined by a specific two-cocycle, which is a real-valued function \\\\mathsf{C}(f,g) of pairs of diffeomorphisms. Specifically, the extension is defined by the Bott‚ÄìThurston cocycle: \\\\mathsf{C}(f,g) \\\\equiv -\\\\frac{1}{48\\\\pi}\\\\int_0^{2\\\\pi} \\\\log\\\\big[f'\\\\big(g(x)\\\\big)\\\\big] \\\\frac{g(x)\\\\,\\\\text{d}x}{g'(x)}. In these terms, the Virasoro group is the set \\\\widetilde{\\\\text{Diff}}{}^+(S^1)\\\\times\\\\mathbb{R} of all pairs (f,\\\\alpha), where f is a diffeomorphism and \\\\alpha is a real number, endowed with the binary operation (f,\\\\alpha)\\\\cdot(g,\\\\beta) = \\\\big(f\\\\circ g,\\\\alpha+\\\\beta+\\\\mathsf{C}(f,g)\\\\big). This operation is an associative group operation. This extension is the only central extension of the universal cover of the group of circle diffeomorphisms, up to trivial extensions. The Virasoro group can also be defined without the use explicit coordinates or an explicit choice of cocycle to represent the central extension, via a description the universal cover of the group.  Virasoro algebra  The Lie algebra of the Virasoro group is the Virasoro algebra. As a vector space, the Lie algebra of the Virasoro group consists of pairs (\\\\xi,\\\\alpha), where \\\\xi=\\\\xi(x)\\\\partial_x is a vector field on the circle and \\\\alpha is a real number as before. The vector field, in particular, can be seen as an infinitesimal diffeomorphism f(x)=x+\\\\epsilon\\\\xi(x). The Lie bracket of pairs (\\\\xi,\\\\alpha) then follows from the multiplication defined above, and can be shown to satisfy \\\\big[(\\\\xi,\\\\alpha),(\\\\zeta,\\\\beta)\\\\big] = \\\\bigg([\\\\xi,\\\\zeta],-\\\\frac{1}{24\\\\pi}\\\\int_0^{2\\\\pi}\\\\text{d}x\\\\,\\\\xi(x)\\\\zeta(x)\\\\bigg) where the bracket of vector fields on the right-hand side is the usual one: [\\\\xi,\\\\zeta]=(\\\\xi(x)\\\\zeta'(x)-\\\\zeta(x)\\\\xi'(x))\\\\partial_x. Upon defining the complex generators L_m\\\\equiv\\\\Big(-ie^{imx}\\\\partial_x,-\\\\frac{i}{24}\\\\delta_{m,0}\\\\Big), \\\\qquad Z\\\\equiv (0,-i), the Lie bracket takes the standard textbook form of the Virasoro algebra: [L_m,L_n] = (m-n)L_{m+n}+\\\\frac{Z}{12}m(m^2-1). The generator Z commutes with the whole algebra. Since its presence is due to a central extension, it is subject to a superselection rule which guarantees that, in any physical system having Virasoro symmetry, the operator representing Z is a multiple of the identity. The coefficient in front of the identity is then known as a central charge. Properties Since each diffeomorphism f must be specified by infinitely many parameters (for instance the Fourier modes of the periodic function f(x)-x), the Virasoro group is infinite-dimensional. = Coadjoint representation = The Lie bracket of the Virasoro algebra can be viewed as a differential of the adjoint representation of the Virasoro group. Its dual, the coadjoint representation of the Virasoro group, provides the transformation law of a CFT stress tensor under conformal transformations. From this perspective, the Schwarzian derivative in this transformation law emerges as a consequence of the Bott‚ÄìThurston cocycle; in fact, the Schwarzian is the so-called Souriau cocycle (referring to Jean-Marie Souriau) associated with the Bott‚ÄìThurston cocycle.

It was produced by Cin√©graphic, the production company of Marcel L'Herbier. Plot In a town in Spanish Castile, a young man, reluctantly living with a roaming band of gypsies, and a local orphan girl want to marry, but when the girl's grandfather forbids their plan, they decide to run away together. A few years later, they have become Riquett's, a clown, and Ralda, a dancer, in a travelling circus which arrives in Toledo. Despite being still in love and having a young child together, the couple's situation is made unhappy by continual attempts to break them apart: by Sveti, a false friend in love with Ralda, by Flossie, an American dancer who constantly flirts with Riquett's, and especially by Buffalo, the tyrannical director of the circus, who lusts after Ralda. Others in the troupe include a giantess, a dwarf, a mermaid, and a bearded lady. When Buffalo's attempts to seduce Ralda are rejected, he provokes a lion and releases it from its cage on to the stage where Ralda is dancing. She is badly mauled, but Buffalo claims it was just a small accident and forces Riquett's to continue with his act. Madame Violette, the downtrodden wife of Buffalo, has witnessed the true story and secretly helps the couple to escape with their child. Once they are safe, she denounces her husband. Cast * Jaque Catelain as Riquett's * Lois Moran as Ralda / Of√©lia * Claire Pr√©lia as Mme Violette * Jean Murat as Sveti * Yvonneck as Buffalo * Florence Martin as Flossie * Lili Samuel as Pirouette * Jean-Paul Le Tarare as Stryx * Philippe H√©riat as the giantess * Kiki de Montparnasse as the bayad√®re * Marcel Rosar as the lion tamer Production The film was financed by Marcel L'Herbier's production company Cin√©graphic and it was the second to be directed by the actor Jaque Catelain, following the relative success of his previous film Le Marchand de plaisirs. In December 1923 L'Herbier offered the project to Catelain, provided that within a fortnight he could produce a scenario which should be set in a circus or menagerie. In addition to Catelain in the leading role, the cast included the film d√©but of the American dancer and actress Lois Moran who was only 15 at the time. Jean Murat also appeared in one of his earliest film roles, and Kiki de Montparnasse made a short appearance as a circus dancer. Alberto Cavalcanti was the assistant director as well as contributing to the set designs along with Djo Bourgeois. In his supervisory role for the production, Marcel L'Herbier was credited for \\"direction artistique\\".La Galerie des monstres at Cin√©-ressources [retrieved 23 May 2020]. Filming then began in February 1924 with location shooting in Spain, in Toledo, Pedraza and Segovia, where much of the landscape was covered in snow. The remainder of filming took place at Studios √âclair in √âpinay. The large number of characters and extras (plus circus animals) made the process a difficult one for Catelain as actor/director, and despite the film's warm reception it contributed to his decision to limit his role to acting in the future. Reception The film received a preview screening for the \\"Amis du Cin√©ma\\" at the Artistic-Cin√©ma in Paris on 18 May 1924. It was then released simultaneously in France and Spain in September that year, with a positive reception. For the central sequences of Riquett's frenetic dance on stage and the lion's attack, the film used montages of rapid editing, sometimes almost subliminal, to create a complex impression of parallel action or thought (a technique which was also employed in other 'avant-garde' French films of the period such as La Roue, C≈ìur fid√®le, and L'Inhumaine).Review by Ren√© Jeanne, in Paris-Soir, 13 sept. 1924, p.5 : \\"Indiscutablement ce film est, du moins en ses moyens d'expression, un film d'avant-garde\\" (\\"assuredly this film is, at least in its means of expression, an avant-garde film\\"). These devices were variously received in reviews, either as over-elaborate and distractingReview by Andr√© Tinchant, in Cin√©magazine, no.20, 16 mai 1924: \\"... nous ne ferons plus alors qu'une restriction, quant √† la qualit√© de cette ≈ìuvre, qui atteindrait presque la perfection si elle n'√©tait pourvue d'une technique quelquefois trop riche, trop √©tourdissante, et ce fatalement √† la d√©pense de la simplicit√© et de l'√©motion\\" (\\"...we will make only one reservation, as to the quality of this work, which would almost attain perfection if it had not been provided with a technique that is sometimes too rich, too overwhelming, and inevitably at the cost of simplicity and emotion\\". or as dynamic and essential.Review by Jacques Parsons, in Paris-Midi, 17 juin 1924, pp.1-2: \\"...un tr√®s bon film ... le mouvement et le rhythme imp√©rieusement n√©cessaires\\" (\\"...a very good film ... movement and rhythm masterfully necessary\\".Marcel L'Herbier. La T√™te qui tourne. (Paris: Belfond, 1979) p. 111: \\"...la salle go√ªta fort la dynamique de ce spectacle\\" (\\".... the audience greatly relished the dynamics of this display\\"). The film was also released in Japan in 1925 and made an impact there: when the film magazine Kinema junp√¥ asked its readers to vote on the best films of the year, La Galerie des monstres achieved first place.Aaron Gerow. A Page of Madness: Cinema and Modernity in 1920s Japan.

He was a former member of Unionist Party and then Indian National Congress. Master Gurbanta Singh wss one of the tallest Dalit leaders of Punjab till date.  Early life  Master Gurbanta Singh was born in Dhaliwal village, Jullundur, Punjab in British India. Master did his education from the Jalandhar town and became a school teacher at Sain Dass A.S Sr. Secondary School (Jalandhar). His political career started when he became village sarpanch. After the influence of Ad Dharm movement he declared himself Ad Dharmi in 1931 census along with other Dalits of Punjab, especially in Doab.  Ad-Dharm Movement  In mid 1920s, Gurbanta Singh came into contact of Mangu Ram Mugowalia, a fellow casteman and also founder member of Ghadar Party. Mangu Ram had started Ad- Dharm movement and established many mandals in Doab regions of Punjab, where Dalit formed major share of population. Though in initial years, Singh's closeness to movement was because of oppression and illireracy among Dalits of Punjab. But later he fully got involved in this social movement and became General Secretary of Ad-Dharm Mandal of Jalandhar. Both Mangu Ram and Gurbanta Singh took Ad-Dharm movement to it's zenith and it became most successful Dalit's reform movement in North India. At the same time he joined Unionist Party and fought election unsuccessfully. After years of long contribution into the movement but due to differences with Seth Kishan Dass another prominent leader of Ad-Dharm movement, he left the mandal and became active into politics.  Politics  Master Gurbanta Singh again fought elections from Jullundur (Reserved Seat) and became successful. He was made Parliamentary Secretary in the Ministry of Malik Khizar Hayat Tiwana (Premier of Punjab). In 1947, India gained independence and he joined Indian National Congress. He fought elections in 1952 and 1957 also but lost elections. In 1962, he won from Kartarpur constituency and was chosen as cabinet minister in the Cabinet of Pratap Singh Kairon from 1956-1964. He became Agriculture Minister of Punjab and played an instrumental role in establishment of Punjab Agricultural University (Ludhiana), which paved the way for Green Revolution in India and also was a key player in construction of Bhakra Dam. Gurbanta again elected unopposed in 1972 Punjab Assembly Elections and joined the Ministry of Giani Zail Singh (former C.M of Punjab). He he became six times a member of Punjab Assembly and slowly came to be known as biggest Dalit leader of Punjab in those times even Republican Party of India which was founded by Dr.Ambedkar himself became small infront of his stature.  Gurbanta's political clan  Master Gurbanta's family is known to be one of the biggest political families of Punjab. His elder son, Chaudhary Jagjit Singh became his sucessor who became Zila Parishad of Jalandhar and later became five-time MLA from Kartarpur seat and then Minister in Beant Singh, Rajinder Kaur Bhattal and Amarinder Singh's ministry. His son Chaudhary Surinder Singh, also became MLA and Zila Parshad but both father son failed to become like Gurbanta Singh. Gurbanta's youngest son, Santokh Singh Chaudhary became his real political successor even without his declaration and became MLA of Phillaur and then Member of Parliament from Jalandhar. He was also made Chief Parliamentary Secretary, Vice-President of Punjab Congress, four times Cabinet Minister in Punjab govt., also member of Central Board of Film Certification and served parliamentary committees. His wife, Karamjit Kaur Chaudhary is a retd. principal of Govt. Sports and Arts College (Jalandhar) and also contested from Phillaur seat. Their son, Vikramjeet Singh Chaudhary, was President of Punjab Youth Congress and General Secretary of PPCC.  Legacy  Master Gurbanta Singh Memorial Janta College at Kartarpur, Punjab (India) was established by him which was later re-named after him. Master Gurbanta Singh Marg at Basti Bawa Khel in Jalandhar is also named after him.

Biography  Johan David Carel Pagenstecher was born in Osnabr√ºck to Gabriel Christoph Pagenstecher and Clara Elisabeth G√∂sling. His father was a lawyer and senior councillor in Osnabr√ºck and belonged to the , which enjoyed good relations with the Dutch royal House of Orange-Nassau. On 1 November 1816, Pagenstecher joined the Dutch army √† la suite for six years and went over to the battalion for the colonies on 1 January 1817. He departed to the Gold Coast on 11 December 1817. Following the death of acting commander Hendrik Adriaan Mouwe on 11 February 1824, Pagenstecher was designated acting commander of the Dutch Gold Coast on 17 February 1824, and took his oath of office on 21 February. He served until Friedrich Last arrived three days later to succeed him. Pagenstecher had a troubled working relationship with colonial administrators and Euro-Africans on the coast. In late 1824, several colonial administrators complained to acting commander Friedrich Last about the conduct of Pagenstecher, which apart from heavy drinking included making condescending remarks about the abilities of virtually all Europeans and Euro-Africans on the Dutch Gold Coast and spreading rumours about their misconduct. It was also alleged that Pagenstecher had threatened acting commander Hendrik Adriaan Mouwe with a gun when Pagenstecher was sentenced to imprisonment in Fort St. Jago for taking ammunition from the commander's room without authorization, and that he deleted references to this incident from the governor's journal after Mouwe died and he took over as acting commander. He was also accused of having poisoned commander Willem Poolman, whose death was considered suspicious by the British surgeon major Beresford. When Pagenstecher was again accused of transgressions on 22 January, acting commander Last decided to send Pagenstecher back to the Netherlands, \\"so that he could explain his grievances to the Minister\\". At the end of March a ship was found that was willing to take Pagenstecher, and after selling his last belongings, Pagenstecher left the Gold Coast on 24 March 1825.

Szwederowo population is the second largest of all Bydgoszcz districts.  Location  Szwederowo district borders the following districts: * Old Town to the north, subsuming a part of the southern hill chain of Bydgoszcz; * G√≥rzyskowo and B≈Çonie to the west; * Wzg√≥rze Wolno≈õci to the east, along Kujawska street; * Biedaszkowo and Bielice to the south. In geomorphological terms, the district lies within the Toru≈Ñsko-Eberswaldzka urstromtal, in the Kotlina Toru≈Ñska mesoregion and the City of Bydgoszcz microregion, i.e. a terrace to above sea level. The actual district includes fragments of suburban municipalities incorporated into Bydgoszcz territory between the second half of the 19th century and 1920.  Etymology  The name Szwederowo comes from Swedes, or Schwedenh√∂he in German. Indeed, Swedish armies attacked Bydgoszcz during the Swedish Deluge in 1656, from the very hills of today's district. Swedish military engineer Erik Dahlbergh depicted the view of the Swedish troops looking over Bydgoszcz from the Szwederowa hills on a 1657 sketch. The name also refers to a legend published in 1935 by editor Wincenty S≈Çawi≈Ñski in a book called Babia Wie≈õ, from the suburban legends of old Bydgoszcz (). As the story goes, during the Swedish Deluge, Poles strived to resist the invader by all means. On the southern hills opposite the Wool Market square, a band of 200 Swedish partisans camped, nearby a tavern called Swedes. One day, they were all disarmed and captured in their sleep by townspeople, then later carted and sent to the Baltic Sea. This place was named at that time Szwederow and remains as such to this day. Through the 19th and the 20th century, the district bore the following names: * Sweiderowo from 1789; * Schwedenberg in 1818; * Schwederowo in 1860; * Szwederowo since 1920.  History  Polish period (before 1772) = Studies have located the existence of two 11th century-hillforts in Bydgoszcz: * the Bydgoszcz stronghold was situated at the place where the city castle was erected in the 14th century (between present day Ko≈õcielecki Square and Grodzka Street); * a second stronghold is supposed to have stood on the hills of today's Szwederowo district. Szwederowo's settlement appeared in the early 16th century, as a minor village of the city parish. During the Swedish Deluge, invading units were stationed there, as described on Erik Dahlbergh's sketches from 1657. Old manor house at 66 Orla street Settlements and villages in today's Szwederowo district welcomed a portion of colonizing Olƒôders in the 17th and 18th centuries: Bielice (nowadays a district of Bydgoszcz) was the first village to receive such settlers before 1660. During the first half of the 18th century, the city of Bydgoszcz promoted further settlements, in a search to recover from the disaster caused by successives wars. Thus additional settlers contracts were awarded for nearby villages (Biedaszkowo (1732), G√≥rzyskowo (1733) and Szwederowo (1743)), or renewed for Bielice (1744). Such villages were organized as folwarks and located above meadows and watercourses, in the area between present day airport and the Five ponds valley. In the middle of the 18th century, Szwederowo was a middle range folwark as far as farm income in Bydgoszcz region is considered. In 1743, city council leased this farm for 40 years to Barbarza and Adam Lasom. At the end of the 18th century, around ten farm-villages were registered in the vicinity of Bydgoszcz: Nowy Dw√≥r ( Gross Neudorff or Neuhof), Nowy Dw√≥r Ma≈Çy, Nowy Dw√≥r Wielki, Szwederowo, Goryczkowo, Nowy Dw√≥r, Biedaczkowo, Bielice and Bielice Nowe. In the 16th and 17th centuries fresh water was supplied from the Five ponds valley in Szwederowo down to public municipal wells, using hollowed tree trunks chiseled to fit together. = Prussian period (1774-1920) = In the 19th century, Szwederowo farm-village occupied an area within today's following streets: Orla, Kujawska, Brzozowa and Nowa. The abutting farm Nowy Dw√≥r was demarcated by Nowodworska, Nowa and Ugory streets. From 1850 on, a suburban area already bore the name of Schwedenberg, comprising New Szwederowo (, ) and Old Szwederowo (, ). Under Prussian rule, Bromberg city authorities handed out Szwederowo farm for perpetual lease to several senior Prussian officials. They parcelled the area into many properties so as to obtain enough income, thus creating more than 160 new farms between 1818 and 1860. Settlers came from former Polish territories, Prussia, but also from France, living peacefully in the same community. During the 19th century, thanks to the rapid industrial development of Bromberg, the number of inhabitants in Szwederowo increased dramatically. People worked in majority in city factories, workshops or on the railways. A local census of the region recorded in 1833 that 275 people lived in the village and farm of Schwedenberg (German for Szwederowo): 174 with Evangelical faith, 94 Catholics and 7 Jews in 27 houses. The same study revealed that 60 people (57 Evangelicals, 3 Catholics) lived among 8 houses in the nearby farm of Nowy Dw√≥r ( Neuhoff): in 1858, this farm was incorporated into Bromberg territory. According to a description by Jan Nepomucen Bobrowicz, both Szwederowo and Nowy Dw√≥r belonged in 1846 to the city. Building at 4 Kujawska street As mentioned in another census from 1860, two locations coexisted: Old Szwederowo, a 31-houses village with 322 people (167 Evangelicals, 98 Catholics, 57 Jews) and New Szwederowo, a 23-houses hamlet with 229 people (164 Protestants, 65 Catholics). Both places were subsumed under Catholic and Evangelical parishes of Bromberg. Despite these organic relationships with the main city, Szwederowo and the neighboring villages (Ma≈Çe Bartodzieje, Okole, Wilczak and Bielawy) formed separate urban bodies outside of the administrative area of Bromberg, leading to a somehow chaotic spatial development. Until the end of the Prussian period, several projects to incorporate these suburban hamlets into the main city territory were drawn, but none was ever carried out. In the years 1870 to 1910, Szwederowo streets were mostly made up of wooden or brick one-story houses, since the majority of its inhabitants were workers. In 1897, the village was connected to the municipal gasworks grid. According to Prussian statistics, the village gathered the highest concentration of Polish-Catholic population (51%) in the area; conversely, they were only 16.2% living in the center of Bromberg. In 1910, Szwederowo had a population of 8801 people: 4495 speaking Polish, 4161 German and 145 Hebrew. Large parks have been created during Prussian times, on the edges of the hills overlooking the old town: * Henryk DƒÖbrowski Park in 1832, at the initiative of Carl von Wissmann, then president of the administrative region of Bromberg; * initial schemes of the Aleja G√≥rska in 1890; * Park on Wolno≈õci Hill, Bydgoszcz in 1911‚Äì1913. = Interwar period (1920-1939) = Detail of the portal of the High school No.2 After World War I, Szwederowo commune () has been incorporated into Bydgoszcz territory on April 1, 1920, together with Bielice Nowe (), on the south-east east of Szwederowo (between today's Szubi≈Ñska and Inowroc≈Çawska streets). During this period, with a few exceptions, Szwederowo district had a poor housing records. In the 1920s, urban projects were unveiled, in particular aiming at building in the estate a market and new residential houses, but nothing was implemented for financial reasons. However, some programmes were completed: * in 1928, the constrution of the Church of Our Lady of Perpetual Help; * in 1927, the 'Bydgoszcz brewery (); * in 1928 the City Bath (), today a culture and health center. Two schools operated in Szwederowo, an evangelical-Catholic school (named after Stanis≈Çaw Leszczy≈Ñski) and a 7-grade public general school (named after Jan Henryk DƒÖbrowski), as well as a kindergarten, a care home, an orphanage and a makeshift hospital (Clinic of the Social Insurance Company). Inhabitants of the district usually went picnicking on Sundays to the so-called Bielicki Forest (), stretching eastward between Bydgoszcz and Toru≈Ñ, organizing orchestra concerts, gastronomic f√™tes and competitions. There, they also picked up fire wood, berries or mushrooms. At the time they moved along Bielicka street from Szwederowo district to the forest: today, the street ends its course at Bydgoszcz airport. =Nazi occupation (1939-1945) = Portal at 40 Nowodworska Detail of a 1914 map of Bromberg with Jewish cemeteries highlighted: the old one (in red) and the New one (in yellow) During Nazi occupation Szwederowo has experienced a particularly brutal repression campaign. It started with the controversial events of Bydgoszcz Bloody Sunday: on September 3, the Polish army entered the city from the northern forest district () and was attacked by saboteurs recruited from among the German minority. One of the heavy fighting place was located in Szwederowo, around Martin Luther's Church (then standing at 42-44 Leszczy≈Ñskiego street). As a result, the church burned down and intense skirmishes were carried out on Orla, Bielicka and ≈ªu≈Çawy streets, opposing Polish soldiers, citizens' guard and Polish citizens on one side, German citizens and saboteurs on the other. After seizing the city, Nazi forces investigated the events, while retaliating upon Polish citizens. One of the report mentioned the following regarding Szwederowo: We have been informed by various Volksdeutsches that an uncertain reliability is to be found in the southern district of the city [i.e. Szwederowo] and still remains to a large extent. Szwederowo was presented as a criminal district where radical elements reside(...). Among the Polish victims of the sundry roundups and searches performed from September 5 to 30, about 300 residents of Szwederowo are recorded. On the churchyard of Our Lady of Perpetual Help at Ugory street lays a mass grave of 21 murdered Poles detained while leaving the church after a service on Sunday, September 10, 1939. During this period, the German security police settled in Szwederowo and NSDAP cells were created in the district. The Nazis liquidated both Jewish cemeteries, the Old one at Henryk DƒÖbrowski Park (est. 1816) and the New one on Szubi≈Ñska street (est. 1874). In 1943, a monumental cross standing next to the Church of Our Lady of Perpetual Help was razed by a German tank (it has been rebuilt in 1947). One of the local Polish resistance movement HQ was located in Szwederowo: at its head was Ludwik Suszy≈Ñski, aka Sowa. One of its mottos when addressing the Polish government- in-exile was: In Szwederowo, almost exclusively Polish language is heard. () =Post war period (since 1945) = After the war, Szwederowo district became a residential district: for several years, its largest industrial plant has been a clothing factory, Modus, at 33 Lenartowicza street. Alfa a successful firm producing photographic plates, film and photographic papers, founded in 1926 at 3 Garbary Street, was nationalized under the name Foton after WWII: the factory then moved to 13-15 Piƒôkna street. At the beginning of the 1950s, authorities erected a high wooden tower in the eastern part of Henryk DƒÖbrowski Park in order to jamm Radio Madrid, an anti-communist radio station. In the wake of the Polish October, a spontaneous demonstration burned down this radio jamming contrivance on November 18, 1956. Although perpetrators were victims of repression during the following years, the device was never rebuilt. Building at 17 Wiatrakowa street In 1958, an anti-nuclear shelter with a capacity of 70 people was built for the city authorities at 23a Nowodworska street, along with a 32-meter high tower for communication. Starting from the late 1950s, the city authorities have been identifying places where to erect large housing projects: a first cluster of 11-storey buildings was constructed in the second half the 1960s in Stroma street, following a typical functionalist design. By the end of the 1960s, additional and larger ensembles were completed, such as the Maria Konopnicka estate accommodating about 3700 people or the housing estate at Ugory street for 1800 residents with modest income. Built using poor quality materials, these housing projects offered modest equipped apartments. At the time, the area of Szwederowo was reclassified for high, multi-family buildings in the new general spatial development plan of 1964, and the project of airport development was finally abandoned. Under the supervision of architect Janusz Go≈Çƒôbiewski, urban planning works called Miastoprojekt - Bydgoszcz were carried out by the Design and Research Office of General Construction (). First stage aimed at Szwederowo Po≈Çudnie estate (Southern Szwederowo) edged by Wojska Polskiego, Kujawska and Leszczy≈Ñskiego streets. The project intended to build multi-family ensembles with estate greenery, of which 40% comprised 12-storey buildings, along with schools and kindergarten. First edifices were completed in 1977, as part of the Wzg√≥rze Wolno≈õci (Freedom Hill) estate. The next step of the project was the realization of Szwederowo P√≥≈Çnoc estate (Northern Szwederowo), bordered by Ludwika Solskiego, Kujawska, Leszczy≈Ñskiego streets and hills in the north. The concept was developed in 1977 and the technical project was carried out a year later. Construction work began in 1980 with high-rise and five-storey buildings on the vicinity of Nowodworska street. The scheme included the redesign of Kujawska street, the nearby main thoroughfare. Since the 1980s, the newly built Kujawski roundabout () has been connecting the Aleja Wojska Polskiego in the east to the new housing estates organized under the calling G√≥rny Taras (Bydgoszcz upper terrace). In the 1990s, the path was extended to Piƒôkna street and christened Ludwika Solskiego street, cutting through Szwederowo. In 2007, it has been enlarged to a dual carriageway: future urban plans propose an expansion to the west of the tram line along this axis up to Szubi≈Ñska street, as the street car network is being extended from Bernardy≈Ñska roundabout up to Rondo Kujawskie.  Main streets  View of Nowodworska street View of Podg√≥rna street The network of streets in Old Szwederowo dates back to the 18th-19th centuries, created from individual routes connecting barns with each other and with the city center. Principal paths of Szwederowo districts are: * Bielicka, from Bielice, an early village which became a district of Bydgoszcz in 1920. The street conducted to Bielice Stare farm, standing in the area of today's Bydgoszcz airport. Both Biedaszkowo and Bielice farms were located in the meadows surrounding a rivulet which flowed down to the Brda river; * Brzozowa, from broza (). It was a former road to Rupienica and Glinki, small farms built at the end of the 18th century; * Halicka; * Jesionowa, from jesion (); * Marii Konopnickiej; * Juliusza Kossaka; * Kujawska, from Kujawy (); The street is an old communication route connecting Bydgoszcz with settlements located in south Kujavia. The road used a ravine in the slope of the Bydgoszcz urstromtal, stretching towards the forest. Along the axis was built in the 13th century Saint Giles church, near the Brda river, probably funded by Casimir I of Kuyavia. In the 17th and 18th centuries, the route connected the town with southern villages such as Rupienica or Glinki. Further on, past the forest, it led to Przy≈Çƒôki and towards Jezioro Jezuickie ().Karte von Ost-Preussen nebst Preussisch Litthauen und West-Preussen nebst dem Netzdistrict aufgenommen unter Leitung des Preuss. Staats Minister Herrn von Schroetter in den Jahren von 1796 to 1802 In 1920, as Bydgoszcz territory expanded, a dozen of surrounding suburban communes were included in the city borders (including Szwederowo, Bielice and Rupienica): as a consequence, Kujawska street has been running since that year entirely within the municipal administrative boundaries. In the 1980s, the street was thoroughly modernized, widened up to two carriageways with 3 lanes and the large Kujawski roundabout built, with underground passages which were never used, then razed in 2019. The southern segment of Kujawska street was renamed in 2005, Aleja Jana Paw≈Ça II in honor of John Paul II. * Teofila Lenartowicza.

An old manor house from these times survived to this day at N¬∞66; * Piƒôkna (); * Podg√≥rna (); * Nowa Sieroca, from sierociniec (); * Ksiƒôdza Ignacego Skorupki. The road initially led to Biedaszkowo farm, located on present day Bydgoszcz aeroclub grass field; * Ludwika Solskiego; * Stroma (). At the crossing with Ksiƒôdza Ignacego Skorupki street, the Kozi Rynek () used to exist during the interwar period. There were sold dairy products: butter, eggs, cottage cheese and poultry; * Szubi≈Ñska, from Szubin, the outskirt village where the avenue led to; * Szwedzka, from Szwed(ka) (); * Ugory, from ugora (). The street was a dirt road connecting farms G√≥rzyskowo (now a Bydgoszcz district) with Rupienica (on today's Park on Wolno≈õci Hill). At the beginning of the 20th century, two- storey tenements were built at Ugory street () for poor people; * Wiatrakowa, from wiatrak ().  Chief distinctive elements  Greenery = View of the Five ponds valley Detail of the 5 Ponds park on a 1905 map Per≈Çowa Dolina estate at Orla street Szwederowo district started to develop green domains in the 1830s, with the initiative in 1832 of Carl von Wissmann, then president of the administrative region of Bromberg. In 1900, a water tower was built there, offering an extensive panorama from the top viewing terrace was arranged. In 1920, the park received the name of General Jan Henryk DƒÖbrowski, who led the capture of Bydgoszcz during the Ko≈õciuszko Uprising in 1794. This park was extended to the east in the 19th century with the creation of the Aleja G√≥rska, built between 1890 and 1940‚Äì1942. The other significative green area in Szwederowo is the so-called Five ponds valley (). A watercourse ran there in the Middle Ages and ponds were used for economic and agricultural purposes. In 1523, Bydgoszcz set up its first waterworks, using Brda river flow near Mill Island: a few decades later, this network had to be rebuilt. In 1541, municipal authorities commissionned master Walentem from Bochnia to carry out the construction of a new city waterworks, drinking water intake, with the reservation that water could not be drawn from the Brda river. The engineer used the ponds on the southern hills (then outside of the city) as tanks from which originated by gravity the new water network. Operating to long wooden pipes made from hollow oak trunks linked with metal joints, the grid ran along the following paths: Szubi≈Ñska street, Pozna≈Ñski square, Pozna≈Ñska street and D≈Çuga street, ending at Zbo≈ºowy Rynek (). The pipe network reached breweries throughout the city, supplying water to public wells and even to some houses. This wooden ensemble lasted about 250 years: at the end of the 18th century, although renovation works started, the waterworks was decommissioned in the 19th century, as the system could not cope with the needs of the growing population. On this very spot, one can observe today five small water reservoirs, surrounded by streets Piƒôkna, Orla, Stroma and Szubi≈Ñska. In 2000, negotiations for the construction of a DIY Castorama supermarket in the area specified a proviso related to the funding of a city park close by. Works, completed by 2003, included dredging out 3 ponds and their surroundings (walking paths, shrubbery, hornbeams, maples). In 2007 and 2008, two additional ponds have been created near Orla street. With these additions, the ensemble matches the original 1900s lay out of the greenery. Since 2003, two housing estates have been erected around the Five ponds valley: Nad DolinƒÖ () and Per≈Çowa Dolina (). The old soviet-time Foton tower still stands in the northern fringe of the park, waiting to be converted. = Buildings =School at 8 DƒÖbrowskiego street The building boasts historicism forms, a basement, two floors, with an attic covered by a hip roof. Two symmetrical avant-corps stand out. The 1912 superstructure part has been plastered, while the lower levels still display brick fa√ßades. View of the building from Henryk DƒÖbrowski Park The building is located on the former territory of Gorzyszkowo farm: at its inception (1828), it was a paid private school run by Dawid Retzlaff, who covered the rent of the classroom and school assistance from his own income. At that time, it was one of the busiest private schools with about 90 students. Despite this, a 1829 report indicated that children from Gorzyszk√≥w, Nowy Dw√≥r, Szwederowo and Bielice were mostly without schooling. In the 1830s, the construction of an evangelical commune school began on a site donated by a tenant of Gorzyszk√≥w, referendary at the regional administration. The design was prepared by Kienitz, a building inspector. Between 1842 and 1846, a school building was added here, still designed by Kienitz. Franz Schmidt was the first teacher. Almost 200 children from neighbouring farm villages (Gorzyszk√≥w, Nowy Dw√≥r, Szwederowo, Bielice, Biedaszkowo and Wilczak) attended this Protestant school. From 1850 on, with the population growth, several municipalities developed their own schools, and in 1875 joint schools were created for all children of the school district. A new, larger building was erected near the old one by the owner of the Volkmann brick factory, who in 1876, leased it to the municipality. In 1889, 588 children were registered in six classes. Several extensions occurred to fit the rising number of students (1890, 1898, 1901): in 1913 the school was entirerly rebuilt to its present state. The grand oak in the courtyard has been planted March 1897, during the Prussian period, to commemorate the 100th birth of the German emperor Wilhelm I. On February 4, 1920, a Polish, seven- grade school opened in the premises, part of the extended Bydgoszcz territory. The headmaster W≈Çadys≈Çaw Lange initially supervised there 950 students in 21 classes. From 1926 onwards, the institution took the name of Bydgoszcz Third Degree General Public School No. XI - Jan Henryk DƒÖbrowski (). The school literally flourished during the 1930s. Under Nazi occupation, the building housed a German primary school for boys and Germanized Poles: the aim was to educate young people in the Nazi militarist spirit. The basement then sheltered anti-aircraft warfare equipment. At the end of World War II, a military hospital was set up in the edifice. In February 1945, classes at the Polish primary school resumed, with 600 students and 16 teachers. On October 29, 1986, a memorial plaque was unveiled, in memoriam of Seweryn Sobecki, a school teacher murdered by the Nazis in the Valley of Death. In 1996, the school sponsored the memorial obelisk in honor of general DƒÖbrowski, unveiled in the abutting Henryk DƒÖbrowski Park. The 1999 Polish school reform act re- categorized on September 1, 2004, the institution as Junior High School No. 22 (). In 2017, the latter was liquidated and the following year the building was bought by a private school that rented it so far. Bydgoszcz High School No.2 () The building from Nowodworska street The building was built in 1916, by Prussian municipal authorities. In 1920, two Polish classes were created in the then Realschule. On October 15, 1921, the Municipal Middle School of Mathematics and Natural Sciences-Miko≈Çaj Rej was established, as a replacement of the German Realschule. In 1923, in the wake of the celebration of the 450th anniversary of Nicolaus Copernicus birth, the school was given his patronage name. In 1928, the school changed to a Municipal Junior High School, and a few years later to a Municipal High School and Mathematical and Natural Junior High School (). In 1960, the institution received its current name: High School No.2 - Nicolaus Copernicus. In 1999, following a Polish eduction reform Act, the Junior High School No.46 was established. In 2018, the facility has been renovated (roofing replacement, lightning protection system and attic insulation), while a bit earlier, the pitch underwent refurbishing. It stands at 13 Nowodworska street. Bydgoszcz care and educational facility at 5 Traugutta street The building boasts historicist red brick facades with plastered panels. The multi-storey edifice possesses a basement and an attic under a gable roof; it has a symmetrical shape, with side gabled wings. First floor openings are topped by arches. A separate building was also erected next to the main building, housing playrooms, a gymnasium and utility rooms. The ensemble is registered on the Kuyavian- Pomeranian Voivodeship Heritage List, N¬∞601363, Reg. A/784 (May 5, 1992). In 2019, conservation works on the facade have been implemented, including bricks cleaning and maintenance, replacement of damaged mortar and other elements, and renovation of the gutter system. Eastern facade side The building was erected between 1905 and 1907, by the Heinrich Dietz foundation. Heinrich Ernst Dietz (1840-1901), was a German MP to the Landtag of Prussia, a councilor and a Bromberg magistrate: his will (August 8, 1911) established a foundation for the construction of an orphanage in Bydgoszcz, leaving 400,000 Deutsche Mark at the disposal of the city authorities. The sum was so important for that time that it became necessary to obtain the consent of German Emperor Wilhelm II who issued a permission on August 4, 1903. Western side, view from Traugutta street It was decided to locate the house on the heights of the city next to Wiatrakowa street. The design was realized by Carl Meyer, a city construction councilor. The building had 10 rooms, 2 dormitories, 2 rooms for practical handwork, a kitchen and a chapel. The city donated an adjacent area of for the vegetable garden and orchard. Works started in the middle of 1905: the building was officially unveiled on July 18, 1907. The ceremony officials comprised city and region authorities and representatives of the Catholic and Evangelical church. It was the first orphanage house () in Bydgoszcz, fit for 30 to 40 children from 6 to 16 years old. They were looked after by a caretaker who also educated them and lived with them, together with the supporting staff. The orphans attended a city primary school. After completion, they moved away to have a vocational education with local craftsmen. In tribute to the Dom Sierot founder, the street where the house stood was renamed Heinrich Dietz Stra√üe in 1908. Before WWI, a second orphanage was built at today's 32 Karol Chodkiewicza street. During the interwar period, the orphanage kept operating, as Henry Dietz Shelter for Orphans (). In 1923, after an agreement with the municipality authorities, Daughters of Charity of Saint Vincent de Paul from Che≈Çmno took over the house caretaking role. During Nazi occupation, German forces established an Hitlerjugend branch in the building. At the end of the war, the street was renamed Romuald Traugutt: the former orphanage then housed a laic State Children's Home. In 1974, the institution harboured about 100 pupils, mostly orphans without shelter or morally endangered. In 1978, the orphanage was transformed into an Emergency Care house () and in 2006, into the Bydgoszcz Care and Education Center (). In 1996, as part of the celebration of the 650th anniversary of Bydgoszcz settlement, a bilingual (Polish-German) memorial plaque dedicated to Heinrich Dietz was placed on the wall of the house fencing. Bath house Until 1926, only few bath houses were available in Bydgoszcz, apart from downtown area or in newly built houses: * Kasa at 2 Warmi≈Ñskiego street; * Sanitas at 27 Gda≈Ñska street; * three smaller private facilities. Building of the old bath house As a consequence, the City Council decided in 1927,to have a new bath house ensemble erected in Szwederowo, a populated suburb. The edifice was located at 2-4 Ignacego Skorupkiego street, designed by Kazimierz Skici≈Ñski (Dec. 4, 1903-Sep. 27,1939), a young architect born in Slonim. The City Bath was opened on November 15, 1928: the building displayed a modernist lines and modern technical solutions. Bathroom booths were spacious, with a separated undressing room, comprising six bathtubs and 16 showers. The facility was met with a successful attendance: people from all over the city came, however, the majority of them lived in the area of Szwederowo where at that time only a few apartments had bathrooms. The complex was rebuilt in 1940 and in 1954: in 1956, there were 17 bathtubs and 10 showers, plus a waiting room, an undressing room and disinfection chamber. In the 1950s, daily average numbers showed 280 customers in winter and 90 in summer. The bathhouse was closed in 1981. The city administrative real estate () was then billeted in the building until 2010, when it moved to private hands, after a renovation in 2007. The edifice houses today a Health Center City Baths, run by the Araszkiewicz family: it provides medical services, combined with a Development and Culture Center. Old water tower View from Filarecka street The Old Water Tower is a historic water tower belonging to the municipal water supply network of Bydgoszcz, Poland. Its importance in the local history has been acknowledged in 1986 by a registering on the Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship Heritage List, N¬∞601290, A/741, January 15, 1986.zabytek-kujawsko-pomorskie-28.02.2014 The tower has been completed in 1900, as part of the design and construction of a new waterworks for the city of Bromberg. Our Lady of Perpetual Help View from the churchyard The Church of Our Lady of Perpetual Help is a wood and brick Catholic church, located on the southern heights of Bydgoszcz, at 16 Ugory street. Designed by architect Stefan Cybichowski, it was consecrated on October 28, 1928. Building of the Army Recruiting Command () at 1 Szubi≈Ñska street View from Szubi≈Ñska street This large building was erected in 1884‚Äì1885, as a request from the will of Luiza Gisse-Rafalska, owner of an estate at Rupienica (today's Glinki district). Known as Luisen Stift (), it was located at the time at Bromberg's 1 Schubiner stra√üe. The villa was to be built at the foot of the Wiessmann Hill, rich in alleys, fountains and observation terraces, as a home for lonely well-off gentlemen and wealthy maidens. The facility provided shelter to 42 people, including 17 permanent residents, who, against appropriate fees, were provided with housing, lighting, heating, medical care and (when necessary) funeral. Residents had to be over 55 years old and had to be living in Bydgoszcz for at least 20 years. After WWII, with the building of a retirement home on Mi≈Ñska street (along Bydgoszcz Canal), the villa became a tenement house and on February 15, 1951, it was taken over by Army Recruiting Command. Beforehand, WKU'seat (or initially called Powiatowej Komendy Uzupe≈Çnie≈Ñ-PKU) moved from 145 Gda≈Ñska street (1921), to 9 Bema street (1925) to 9 Dworcowa Street (1945). The edifice underwent a full restoration in 2017. = Monuments = The cross seen from streets crossing Foutain Szwederowo - Children playing with fish Location of the memorial plaque DƒÖbrowski memorial stone Memorial to the fallen of September 1939 Monument to Maria Konopnicka Wooden sculpture after a tale from Maria Konopnicka Monumental cross (1935) In 1935, a high monumental cross with the figure of a larger-than-normal crucified Jesus Christ was erected on the place facing the bathing house. It was the work of a local sculptor, Teodor Gajewski. The latter also co-created in 1932 the Statue of the Sacred Heart of Jesus: a copy stands today in Seminaryjna street. The blessing of the cross by Father Jan Konopczy≈Ñski happened on May 3, 1935. In the first weeks of Nazi occupation, the monument was demolished by the Germans. In 1992, on the initiative of the parish of Our Lady of Perpetual Help and the Association of Szwederowo's friends (), the monument has been rebuilt. A fragment of the original sculpture -the head in a crown of thorns- saved from destruction during WWII by the inhabitants, has been incorporated back. On September 1, 1992, the new cross has been consecrated by the archbishop of Gniezno and primate of Poland Henryk Muszy≈Ñski.  Fountain Children playing with fish (1934) In 1934, local sculptor Teodor Gajewski realized Children playing with fish (), incorporating a foutain facing the new city baths inaugurated on November 10, 1928. The monument was made from artificial stone and depicted three children sitting on a fish, from whose mouth the foutain water flowed into a pool. The devastated sculpture was renovated in 2014‚Äì2015, during which all the missing elements were reconstructed and a retaining wall around the fountain was built. In 2016, the installation work began and the water fountain was operating back in October 2017. 18 November 1956 plaque (1996) At the beginning of the 1950s, communist authorities erected a tall wooden tower in the eastern part of Henryk DƒÖbrowski Park in order to jamm Radio Madrid, an anti-communist radio station.

Early Life  Rita de Morais Sarmento was born in the city of Porto in 1872, to an Aveiro family with liberal constitutionalist views who had suffered as a result of the Portuguese Liberal Wars (1828 to 1834), fought between constitutionalists and absolutists over the succession to the Portuguese throne. Rita was the youngest of five children of Anselmo Evaristo de Morais Sarmento, a journalist and graphic artist, and Rita de C√°ssia de Oliveira. Her father editied the liberal left wing periodicals \\"Gazeta Liter√°ria do Porto\\" and \\"A Actualidade\\" and later the \\"A Ideia Nova ‚Äì di√°rio democr√°tico\\". The household was a gathering place for his friends and colleagues, who were part of the liberal cultural and political scene, including Oliveira Martins, Ramalho Ortig√£o, Camilo Castelo Branco, Antero de Quental and Te√≥filo Braga.  Education  The family had a strong belief in the value of education and of service for the public good. After attending private schools in Porto, alongside her siblings, Rita enrolled to study Civil Engineering and Public Works at the Academia Polit√©cnica de Oporto (the Polytechnic Academy in Porto) when she was 15 years old. Her sisters Laurinda, Aur√©lia and Guilhermina also went into the scientific field, training to become some of the earliest women doctors in Portugal. The two eldest opened a short lived medical clinic for women and children in the early 1890s.  University  Rita de Morais Sarmento completed her degree in Civil Engineering and Public Works in 1894, receiving distinctions in some of the categories, and frequently scoring at the top of her class. Two years later, on 30 July 30 1896, she applied to the university for a \\"Carta de Capacidade\\" the equivalent of chartered or licensed engineer certification for professional purposes. This was a particularly noteworthy achievement and a significant first for a woman, and was covered by several Portuguese newspapers. Within the next few years, women in other European countries earned engineering degrees. Agnes Klingberg and Betzy Meyer (Denmark, 1897), Alice Perry (Ireland, 1906) and Elisa Leonida Zamfirescu (Romanian student in Germany, 1912)  Career  Rita de Morais Sarmento never really worked as a professional civil engineer, partly due to her fragile heath, coupled with the difficulties in getting work as a female engineer in conservative Portuguese society.  Marriage  She settled in the city of Lisbon after her marriage in late 1898 to Ant√≥nio dos Santos Lucas, professor, future director of the Lisbon Faculty of Sciences, and for a brief time Minister of Finance in 1914. They had children. Her father and sister Guilhermina signed as witnesses to the marriage, Guilhermina de Moraes Sarmento giving her profession as doctor. Rita de Morais Sarmento died at 59 years of age in 1931 and was buried in the Prazeres Cemetery in Lisbon.

No members of this gens are mentioned in ancient writers, but many are known from inscriptions, and several were locally important, serving as duumvirs at Antinum in Samnium, Pompeii in Campania, and Sarmizegetusa in Dacia. Origin The nomen Spedius is probably of Oscan origin, as many of the inscriptions of this gens are from Samnium and surrounding regions in central and southern Italy, and the early Spedii used a number of Oscan praenomina. Praenomina The Spedii used a variety of common praenomina, chiefly Lucius, Gaius, Publius, and Quintus. The older epigraphy shows that they used the less-common praenomina Vibius, Numerius, and Salvius, all of which were typical in families from Oscan-speaking regions.

Lady Tankerville's collection of botanical illustrations are held at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. Phaius tankerville was named in her honour by Sir Joseph Banks because it was the first tropical orchid to flower in England and it flowered in her greenhouse. Life She was one of two daughters of Mary (born Skyner) and James Colebrooke. Her father was a member of parliament from 1751 to 1761 and the owner of Gatton Park. She married Charles Bennet, 4th Earl of Tankerville on 7 October 1771 at Gatton, Surrey. He was a cricket enthusiast and a collector of shells. They would have eight children. While her two eldest children were young she was painted by Daniel Gardner. The painting shows her, her two daughters, Carloline and Anna, and unusually flowers hinting at her interest in botany. Phaius tankerville named for Lady Emma Tankerville. Walton Bridge by Canaletto (dated 1756) - Mount Felix is the house on the hill and the bridge was on their estate She was co-heir to her father Sir John Colebrooke. She and her husband had interests in the lands and slaves on Antigua and they owned agricultural land in Northumberland. They also owned a very profitable lead mine. They divided their time between Chillingham Castle in Northumberland and their house Mount Felix at Walton on Thames in Surrey. Lady Tankerville collected and funded hundreds of botanical illustrations. Her collection is held at the Royal Botanical gardens. Phaius tankerville was named in her honour by Sir Joseph Banks. Her Phaius tankerville was the first tropical orchid to flower in England and it flowered in her greenhouse. The gardens at Mount Felix were well regarded many years after her death. It was the first tropical orchid to flower in England. In addition, their daughter Lady Mary Elizabeth Bennet (21 May 1785 to 27 Feb, 1861) worked with their gardener (William Richardson) to cultivate new strains of tri-colored viola pansy flowers that were presented to the botanical society and horticulture groups in 1812. Lady Mary Elizabeth Bennet was an accomplished artist in watercolor and was invited to many exhibitions. She was trained by London artist John Varley. Her works are in private collections including a composition of her home at Belsay Castle rendered in 1834 after her marriage on 26 July 1831 to Sir Charles Miles Lambert Monck, Bt. The painting of her home at Belsay Castle in Northumberland by Lady Mary Elizabeth Monck was found to be included as part of the Monck estate in 1912 and now resides in a private collection in the US. Another of her works is the Burial Place of the Breadalbanes from the Churchyard at Killin done in 1826-1827 on a trip to the Scottish highlands with her brother. This haunting graveyard work may have been inspired by the seat of her father's estate as the Earl of Tankerville being at Chillingham Castle. Lady Mary Elizabeth Bennet also trained and worked with the London artist John Linnell in engraving as well as miniature painting on ivory. They together produced a set of (12) engravings about Chillingham Castle that were started in 1815 and not finished and published until 1818. Linell gave Bennet lessons in painting on ivory in 1822/3. The Hon Henry Grey Bennet, their second son, became the member of parliament for Shrewsbury in 1806 whilst their third son, The Hon John Astley Bennet, became a captain in the Navy but died in September 1812. The 5th Earl, Charles Augustus, who was born on 28 April 1776 was treasurer of the household during the short administration of Mr Fox in 1806.

Location  The Saarschleife begins near the Besseringen section of the town of Merzig and ends in Mettlach. Although Besseringen and Mettlach are only separated by approximately two kilometers, the Saar makes a winding path that lasts nearly ten kilometers. On the forested mountains within the Saarschleife, there are the historical sites of the former cloister church of St. Gangolf in addition to remnants of the former cloister complex as well as the ruins of Montclair fortress. The only locale located immediately on the Saarschleife is the village of Dreisbach, which can be reached by ferry. On both the inner and outer riverbends run hiking and biking paths. An area west of the Saarschleife known as the \\"Steinbachtal\\" of approximately 100 hectares has been designated as a protected area.  Geography  The narrowing of the Saarschleife between Besseringen and Dreisbach stems from the fact that the Saar, coming from the colored sandstone of the Merzig Basin, enters a section of hard quartzite rock. It is not exactly clear why the Saar failed to follow the more direct route between Besseringen and Mettlach. One possible explanation is that the Saar followed fractures of the Devonian quartzite, a weak zone, although a river tracking a rock weakness longer than two kilometers would be unusual. Investigations showed that the colored sandstone of the Saarschleife and its surroundings is only unevenly deposited on the underlying quartzite. When it was formed, the colored sandstone did not cover a previous layer level, but rather built upon an already existing relief. The quartzite divide most likely predated the colored sandstone layer that had gathered atop it, which was then later cleared away by the waters of the Saar. Together with the river's large meandering, the Saarschleife gradually deepened at a later mountain uplift. This step-by-step incision of the Saar is clearly visible to observers at the Cloef observation point when viewing the terraced sliding slope across the river. This mountain spur around which the Saar flows has a length of 4 km and reaches its highest point at 318 m above sea level, while the surface of the Saar is around 166 m above sea level. The entire area around the Saarschleife is largely covered by a forest that is largely untouched. A beech forest grows on the remnants of the colored sandstone while hornbeam and oaks predominate on quartzite. On the steep slopes, the forests transition into a bush forest of hornbeam and oak. Due to the favorable climate, the evergreen sub- Mediterranean Atlantic holly grows here. Only lichens and mosses settle on the so-called \\"Rosseln\\" the scree heaps created by weathering.  History  Archbishop Poppo von Babenberg (Babenberger Family Tree, Stiftsgalerie Klosterneuburg, Nieder√∂sterreich) Ruins of Castle Montclair The advantage offered by a spur surrounded by a river attracted the original Celtic inhabitants of the area to erect a protective wall that lies two kilometers to the east of the ruins of Castle Montclair that dates from the Middle Ages. It is likely that the spur of the Saarschleife was used by these Celts as a refuge castle. On the escarpment, traces of a Roman presence have also been found. During a period of great migration following the fall of the Roman Empire and the establishment of Francia, a noble family from Ardennes erected Skiva Castle (also recorded as \\"Skipha\\" or \\"Sissiva\\") on the spur around 1000 AD. The inhabitants of the castle were in constant conflict with their feudal lords, the archbishops of Trier. In 1016, Poppo von Babenberg, the Archbishop of Trier, succeeded in taking and destroying the castle.Herbert Liedtke, Karl- Heinz-Hepp, Christoph Jentsch: Das Saarland in Karte und Luftbild, Ein Beitrag zur Landeskunde, hrsg. vom Landesvermessungsamt des Saarlandes, Neum√ºnster 1974, S. 80‚Äì81. Nearly two centuries later in 1180, Arnold I., another Archbishop of Trier, authorized the construction of a new castle on the grounds. Given the name Montclair (Latin \\"mons clarus\\" or \\"bright mountain\\"), the castle's construction was completed in 1190. Over the course of time, the castle fell into the hands of the Duchy of Lorraine and was subsequently destroyed during a conflict in 1351 with the Erzstift of Trier. Some 75 years later, the von Sierck family obtained the right to build a much smaller castle on the site. This second Castle Montclair was left to ruin in 1620. In 1661, King Louis XIV of France reached an agreement with the Archbishop of Trier Karl Kaspar von der Leyen to leave the castle ruined since it would be useful in case of a war with France. As a result, the castle's remains would only be stabilized two centuries later when Frederick William IV of Prussia initiated preservation efforts upon his first stay in Mettlach in 1835. Herbert Liedtke, Karl-Heinz-Hepp, Christoph Jentsch: Das Saarland in Karte und Luftbild, Ein Beitrag zur Landeskunde, hrsg. vom Landesvermessungsamt des Saarlandes, Neum√ºnster 1974, S. 80‚Äì81. During the Third Reich, plans were drawn up to turn the area near Castle Montclair into an Ordensburg that would have encompassed 170 hectares. The proposed facility would have included a Thingst√§tte to hold 4000, a tower, a \\"Hall of Honor for the Victims on the Saar\\" as well as a school building for 600 students stretching out over 800 meters. The plans for the massive complex were drawn up by Clemens Klotz, the Cologne-based architect who built the Kraft durch Freude facilities of Prora on the island of R√ºgen as well as the Vogelsang Ordensburg in the Eifel region, and the responsibility for the project's planning fell to Robert Ley, the NSDAP Reichsleiter, and the German Labor Front. The planned complex was announced as a gift of gratitude to the inhabitants of the Saarland following the results of the 1935 Saar status referendum. However, because of military activities involved in fortifying Germany's western border (the Westwall), construction of the Ordensburg was indefinitely delayed, and the Saarland ultimately received instead the \\"Gautheater Saarbr√ºcken\\" known today as the Saarl√§ndische Staatstheater in Saarbr√ºcken.Gisela Tascher: Das erste Geschenk des F√ºhrers - Noch vor dem Gautheater in Saarbr√ºcken planten die Nazis eine Ordensburg an der Saarschleife, in: Saargeschichten Ausgabe 1, 2012, S. 4‚Äì9.Dietmar Klostermann: Hitlers irrer Saarschleifen-Plan, Saarbr√ºcker Zeitung, 14.

That the author's first novel should have had such a rocky start seems characteristic of the life of both author and protagonist. The novel follows the brilliant but impoverished Ca√Øn Marchenoir, an intransigeant Catholic writer of great promise living in Paris at the beginning of the French Third Republic as he struggles to balance two pairs of seemingly opposite and incompatible forces in his life. The first pair of incompatible forces he struggles with is an intense love for God with the need to follow honestly and thoughtfully the teachings of the Catholic Church, which is at odds with his strong extramarital sexual desire for a beautiful but naive ex- prostitute cum devout Catholic and aspiring saint (who later ends up in the booby hatch). The second pair is a real and pressing need for stable income (a job) which is at odds with an intense disgust for, and rage against, the hypocritical, self-serving, corrupt attitudes and behaviors of the contemporary press and literary world of the time, as he sees it. It begins with a death (his father's) and ends with a death (his own), which makes it a tragedy arguably, while everything in between treats of the semi- autobiographical, extreme, and ostensively manic-depressive ups and downs of several months or telescopic years 'in the life' of a talented but desperate man. Publication J.-K. Huysmans, a friend of the Bloy's at the time, helped him to find a publisher for the work, -- Huysmans' own publisher at the time, Tresse & Stock. Because of the atrabilious, satirical, contentious, and arguably libelous portrayal of many of the thinly-veiled and pseudonymous characters in the novel, many of whom in real life were still alive at the time and some of whom in powerful places (e.g., Francis Magnard and Albert Wolff, both editors of Le Figaro), Tresse & Stock got cold feet and delayed or refused to go forward with its publication. Consequently, another publisher was found (Alphonse Soirat) who fearlessly published the novel, with the author's permission, on January 15, 1887. When, in 1893, after several years had passed, Tresse & Stock realizing that the original publisher was not being, and had not been, hauled into court for libel, they proceeded to dust off and put out for sale, without the author's permission by this time, the thousand or so copies they had printed in 1886 with an introductory note that leaves \\"to the author the entire responsibility of his judgments and assessments\\" and keeps \\"ourselves simply within our right as publishers and merchants of literary curiosities.\\"  Critical response  \\"... Bloy's force [in this novel] owes as much to the rigor of his morality as to his resplendent polemical style; an inspired, Gothic Cathedral style. Flamboyant! The words are spewed out with rage in this novel with its rocky peaks, and complex and diffuse style. Backbreaking because it's made of granite, it's a literary sword that exhorts each one of us to forge a soul in fire! For this novel has really to do with the soul... This soul which ought to be the only human concern!\\" \\"There are quite a few ways of presenting The Desperate Man, but all of them I think would have to evoke its extraordinary verbal violence, which is none other than the counterpart of a whole, inconceivable in our day when geldings are recompensed by so-called literary prizes as if they were battle steeds, his stylistic invention, which French literature has never perhaps seen to such a degree of concentration, or preciptiation, since L√©on Bloy, except in Louis-Ferdinand C√©line.... L√©on Bloy's incendiary violence [in this novel] is parabolic, apocalyptic... it deploys a magnificent canvas that a half-mad painter would have patiently painted to try and replace reality, and offers to its spectators, dumbfounded, a second reality enriched by a symbolic interpretation of History and its arcana.\\" \\"The Desperate Man is the autobiographical recitation of that poor wretch who will pass his life in filthy poverty, hurling his hatred at the stupidity of the middleclass, all the while cherishing the prostitutes whom he removes from their misery while devoting themselves to Christ above all with supernatural delectation. But it's not a blissful smile that characterizes this love, absolutely not. Rather, it's a torrent of tears. The bleeding feet of the Messiah are inundated, the pale face of the poor are as well. Incredible work!\\" \\"Inspired by the 1846 apparition of the Virgin Mary at La Salette, Bloy had been convinced by the Virgin‚Äôs message that, unless the wicked reformed and the people observed the Sabbath, the end time would come and engulf Christendom in fire. Along with J.-K. Huysmans, Bloy subscribed to a belief in Dolorism, a doctrine affirming the sanctity of suffering, holding that through mystic substitution, the martyrdom of innocents could redeem the transgressions of the guilty... This is the hermeneutic principle of Le D√©sesp√©r√©, Bloy‚Äôs parable of human misery: to disclose the occult truths concealed in this ‚Äúpalimpseste de douleur.‚Äù \\"If The Desperate Man... is autobiographical at the very least: one does not need to be a great scholar to observe how the character of Ca√Øn Marchenoir 'gifted, by nature, to the observation of social hideousness' and looking at the modern world as if it were 'an Atlantis submerged in a garbage dump,' corresponds with the idea that L√©on Bloy has of himself, at least the effort with which he wants to constrain his existence and the direction he wants to impose on it. Mystical, misanthropic, revolutionary, anti-bourgeois, ascetic, contemnor of his times, this hero is the spitting image of the common representation one has of Bloy.\\"  References  Category:1887 French novels Category:Works by L√©on Bloy ","title":"The Desperate Man (novel)"},{"id":"64054580","text":"The 2019‚Äì20 Liga IV BrƒÉila was the 52nd season of the Liga IV BrƒÉila, the fourth tier of the Romanian football league system.

Deering Caswell (1847 ‚Äì February 11, 1924) was an American educator and writer, founder of the Marlborough School in Los Angeles.  Early life  Mary S. Deering was born in Paris, Maine in 1847 (some sources give 1850), the daughter of Mark Deering and Alice Bailey Deering. She had two sisters, Georgianna and Sarah. She was quite young when her parents died, and she was educated at various schools, including the Freehold Young Ladies Seminary in New Jersey. Her Deering cousins in Maine founded the Deering Harvester Company, which was a precursor of International Harvester.  Career  Caswell founded a girls' school in Portland, Maine in 1883, and sold it in 1888, to move to southern California, for her daughter's health and her own prospects. She founded and ran the Marlborough School in Los Angeles, a private school for girls. \\"There are absolutely no rules at Marlborough,\\" noted a 1902 report, \\"but at the beginning of each year the principal makes known to the twenty-five girls in the family their privileges and their obligations; explains to them certain laws of cause and effect,\\" and \\"shows them that she will do all in her power to help them.\\" While still in Maine, Caswell published several books, including Loring, Short & Harmon's illustrated guide book for Portland and vicinity (1873), An Average Boy's Vacation (1876), Phil, Rob, and Louis, or Haps and Mishaps of Three Average Boys (1878), and Letters to Hetty Heedless and Others (1880). She co-wrote The Marlborough Course in Art History (1919) with Anna McConnell Beckley. In Los Angeles, she was vocal in her \\"vehement\\" opposition to women's suffrage, saying the vote would \\"rob women of privileges they currently enjoyed and impose responsibilities they did not want.\\" She also lectured on art history to community groups.  Personal life  Mary Deering married George A. Caswell in 1878; he died in 1880. Caswell died in California in 1924, in her seventies. Her grave is in the Hollywood Forever Cemetery. Her daughter, Georgia Caswell Overton, was headmistress of the Marlborough from 1948 to 1962. The Marlborough School still exists, and is the oldest independent girls' school in Southern California.

The station was founded in October 2015 by Alexander Blackman and Joshua Blackman. TruckersFM is run by a team of volunteer radio presenters who broadcast a variety of live shows consisting of music, entertainment and related gaming news. The station predominately plays chart music, pop music as well as rock and country music. TruckersFM is available online, on various audio streaming services such as TuneIn and is featured within the in-game radio directories of the simulation game titles Euro Truck Simulator 2, American Truck Simulator and Farming Simulator 19. Eurogamer describes TruckersFM as \\"an alternative to listening to real-world radio stations inside a game, (which) has become an alternative to real-world stations out in the real-world.\\" The station is primarily funded by on-air advertising from community-related groups, streamers and virtual trucking companies as well as listener donations.  History  Launched in October 2015, TruckersFM was created as a dedicated radio station by the Truck Simulator and TruckersMP multiplayer modification communities. The idea behind the station is to allow players to tune into a radio station that provides news, entertaining stories, virtual traffic reports and on-air competitions for them to interact with. TruckersFM was added to the Euro Truck Simulator 2 in-game radio player on 6 January 2016 and later into the American Truck Simulator in-game radio player on 2 February 2016. On 11 May 2017, TruckersFM partnered with Discord, a proprietary freeware VoIP application designed for creating communities ranging from gamers to education and businesses. Its Discord community has over 10,000 members, which makes it one of the more popular communities in the music category on Discord. In February 2018, members of the TruckersFM team visited the headquarters of SCS Software, the developers of Euro Truck Simulator 2 and American Truck Simulator. The visit resulted in a closer relationship between the station and game developers, as well as the creation of exclusive radio imaging for TruckersFM, consisting of members of the game's development team saying the TruckersFM slogan. On 8 August 2019, TruckersFM was added to the Farming Simulator 19 radio directory for players to listen directly in-game whilst playing. In October 2019, TruckersMP, the community created multiplayer modification for Euro Truck Simulator 2 and American Truck Simulator, partnered with TruckersFM to provide exclusive updates, official events, and giveaways for the simulation community. On 26 May 2019, TruckersFM launched a new sister station called BigRigFM, a country music radio station, created to cater specifically for the American 18-wheeler truck drivers section of the Truck Simulator community. On October 16th 2020, TruckersFM celebrated their 5th Anniversary of broadcasting with a virtual in-game festival on the Euro Truck Simulator 2 multiplayer modification, TruckersMP. They also partnered up with gaming brands and developers such as HyperX, Focus Homer Interactive, SCS Software and Fanatec to giveaway over 2000 euros worth of prizes to listeners and followers on their social media channels.  Programming  TruckersFM broadcasts a variety of programming, produced by a team of volunteer radio presenters based across the world. It broadcasts around the clock, with programmes such as \\"The Most Played Chart\\", \\"Club Upside Down\\", \\"Rock & Flow\\", \\"Evenings with Mark\\", \\"Morning Coffee with Jay\\", \\"The Feel Good Friday Show\\", \\"The Texmix Request Show\\", \\"TFM @ Nite\\", \\"TFM Session\\", and many more.  Street Team  Being a heavily community- orientated radio station, TruckersFM launched its own virtual 'Street Team' in October 2018. The Street Team organize monthly online convoys on the TruckersMP multiplayer modification, allowing the presenters and staff of TruckersFM to directly interact with the community. These virtual convoys generally see over 200 online players attend and participate, and on occasions have seen between 300 and 500 attendees. The scale of Street Team Monthly Convoys assisted in the creation of a formal partnership with TruckersMP, who noted that TruckersFM \\"are one of the largest communities that contributes significantly to TruckersMP on a regular basis.\\"  References  External links  * Truckers.FM official website Category:Internet radio stations in the United Kingdom Category:Truck simulation video games ","title":"TruckersFM"},{"id":"64054679","text":"Rizal is a crater on Mercury, located near the north pole.

It was launched in the companion volumes by Robert Cox and Harrod ‚Äì Harrod's Power, Production and the Unprotected Worker (1987) and part 1 of Cox's Production, Power and the Making of World Order (1987). In this approach work and labour are viewed through different patterns of power found in forms of production ranging from peasant to corporate throughout the world. Both Cox and Harrod used this view in their teaching and work in international political economy.(2018) Murphy, Craig (Professor Political Science, Wellesley College, USA) ‚ÄúWith Jeffrey Harrod he (Robert Cox), developed his generation's most comprehensive understanding of the global political economy, one rooted in the condition of the least-privileged classes in all parts of the world.‚Äù http://ppesydney.net/tributes-to-robert-w-cox Harrod continued to revise and develop the original approachfor example (2015) ‚ÄúWork, Power and the Urban Poor‚Äù in van der Pijl, Kees (ed) Handbook of International Political Economy of Production, Edward Elgar pp.283-298 and other researchers expanded its use in the study of world politics.Davis, Matt and Ryner, Magnus (eds)(2006) Poverty and the Production of World Politics: Unprotected Workers in the Global Political Economy New York: Palgrave Macmillan Cox and Harrod have together been criticised for bias for their selective use of Marxian concepts. =Global political economy= Harrod's work in global political economy involves the power interplay between types of labour relations, corporations and non-governmental organisations.for example, de Vie, Kees (23 April 1993). \\"De tragiek van generaals\\" (The tragedy for generals).

He was Vice President of Peru, during the first government of Fernando Bela√∫nde Terry (1963‚Äì1968) and president of the Council of Ministers and Minister of Foreign Affairs, from September to November 1967 . He was also an ambassador in Mexico (1965‚Äì1967) and general secretary of the Popular Action party. Edgardo Seoane Early life He was the son of Guillermo Alejandro Seoane Avellafuertes and Manuela Corrales Melgar, and brother of Manuel Seoane Corrales, who became an important APRA leader . He studied at the Colegio Santa Rosa de Chosica, and then went to study at the National School of Agriculture, where he received a degree in agricultural engineering. He was elected as president of the Student association of Peru . He began his career at Huayto hacienda, first as a surveyor, and then was promoted at the administrative level. As an administrator, he went to the Vilcahuaura hacienda (1930) and then to the Pucal√° hacienda ( 1931‚Äì1948 ), where he carried out studies on the influence of irrigation on crops, as well as experiments in plant physiology. In the late 1940s he became the owner of the Mamape hacienda, in the Ferre√±afe district, near Chiclayo. Using modern techniques, he increased the production of this farm, and simultaneously promoted regional agricultural development through the formation of a cooperative credit organization . He considered himself as a reformer who \\"rode on a steed or tractor, carving furrows of Peru's agrarian modernity.\\" Political career In 1962, he ran for the first vice presidency of the Republic on the electoral alliance headed by the architect Fernando Belaunde Terry, but the elections of that year were annulled by the military, who called new elections for 1963 . In these, Belaunde triumphed, and Seoane was thus elected first vice president, coming to exercise the Executive Power when the president left Peru to attend the Continental Conference held in Punta del Este, Uruguay . Then he was ambassador to Mexico (1965‚Äì1967) and was elected secretary general of Popular Action at the congress of that party held in Cajamarca . When the government was forced to carry out a drastic currency devaluation in September 1967, it translated into deep disappointment for the citizenry and the subsequent fall of the Becerra cabinet. Seoane was then summoned to preside over a new cabinet, taking charge of the Foreign Relations office (from September 6 to November 17 of that year). He was already known as the leader of the radicals of his party, in the journalistic jargon -the \\"thermocephalus\\", who sought to deepen social reforms, especially regarding agrarian reform . He resigned from the ministry after the defeat of the ruling candidates in complementary elections for Parliament (November 1967). Shortly after the signing of the Talara Act (agreement signed between the government and the International Petroleum Company ), the ‚Äúpage eleven scandal‚Äù broke out . Seoane demanded the annulment of the Talara Act.When his demand was neglected, he announced that the Popular Action organization had broken ties with its formal leader, Fernando Belaunde ( September 17, 1968 ). In response, Belaunde expelled Seoane from his party. This produced conflict within the party, creating another faction, called Acci√≥n Popular Socialista (or Seoanista). After the coup d'√©tat led by General Juan Velasco Alvarado on October 3, 1968, Seoane collaborated with the military government on matters related to his professional knowledge and experience .

He had his first solo exhibition in 2001, at I-20 Gallery in New York.I-20 Gallery (2001). \\"Jo√£o Onofre solo exhibition press release\\". Since then, he has made over 35 solo shows and taken part in over 200 group exhibitions in both Portuguese and in International museums and galleries. He lives and works in Lisbon.  Work  Onofre's work encompasses a variety of media, such as drawing, photography, objects, installation and primarily video. In the footsteps of the pioneers of performance from the 60s and 70s, his video works consist mostly of delegated performances to non-actors, whose \\"talents and skills are not merely a backdrop in his work, but serve as primary structuring elements. Like a Minimalist choreographer studying a gesture or movement, or a composer isolating a tone or rhythm, Onofre breaks things down and reconstructs them, creating a new form in the process.\\"Schwendener, Martha (2003). \\"Jo√£o Onofre: Experimental Machines\\". Jo√£o Onofre: Pas d'action- Instrumental version. Barcelona: Galeria Toni T√†pies. This practice of delegation, as noted by Claire Bishop, \\"is not just a one-way, downward gesture. The performers also delegate something to the artist: a guarantee of authenticity, through their proximity to everyday social reality, conventionally denied to the artist, who deals merely in representations.\\"Bishop, Claire (2012). \\"Delegated Performance: Outsourcing Authenticity\\". CUNY Academic Works, p. 110. Intrinsic to this desire to place the artwork within reality and thus, in the sphere of action, is the concept of duration which Onofre has been exploring since his first video work, Untitled (we will never be boring) (1997), which features a performing couple, formally dressed, opposite each other, walking on separate treadmills, for the duration of a video tape ‚Äì one hour; it is in the unwinding of this fortuitous and yet undetermined action that the duration, a necessarily tense duration, is established. This tension, which arises from a certain amount of indeterminacy that marks the unfolding of the action, is evident in most of Onofre's video works, such as Casting (2000) (exhibited at the 49th Venice Biennale\\"49th Venice Biennale - Plateau of Humankind (2000)\\".), Instrumental version (2001), or Pas d'action (2002). At play in these pieces is also the notion of collective as both three feature a group of people. In Casting, a group of young advertising models is asked to recite to the camera, one at the time, a line from the movie Stromboli, unaware that the casting is the art project itself, \\"showing us the emptiness of the modern fast-moving and narcissistic society wherein the single individual might have just one single possibility of being successful, a chance that is decided by the camera's eye and the capacity to deal with it\\";Cinel, Andrea (2009). \\"Jo√£o Onofre ‚Äì Casting\\". In Willemsen, P., & Trummer, T. (Eds.). Actors & Extras. Munich: ARGOS Edition, pp. 138‚Äì139. in Instrumental version, a chamber choir interprets Kraftwerk's theme \\"The Robots\\", vocalizing the song's synthetized sounds, giving \\"a human aspect to the composition, while erasing the textual/communicative qualities of the song\\",Schwendener, Martha (2003). \\"Jo√£o Onofre: Experimental Machines\\". Jo√£o Onofre: Pas d'action-Instrumental version. Barcelona: Galeria Toni T√†pies. while in Pas d'action, a group of ballet dancers is asked to endure in semi and demi points (classical ballet's positions) throughout the duration of the video: \\"A position that is usually a unit in a greater artistic vocabulary is immobilised and now becomes simply a trial of endurance; what appears initially light and effortless is changed by Onofre's intervention into a physically strenuous act. One by one the dancers become exhausted and drop to a standing position.\\"Charlesworth, J.J. (2004). \\"Expressive Malfunctions\\". Jo√£o Onofre. Bregenz: Magazin 4 Vorarlberger Kunstverein. Between 2002 and 2004 he directs four videos set on his studio, a choice intended to reflect on the artist's studio not only as the place of artistic creation but as a subject in itself, reiterating in a sense, the words of Bruce Nauman: \\"If I was an artist and I was in the studio, then whatever I was doing in the studio must be art. At this point art became more of an activity and less of a product;\\"Bruce Nauman\\". Art21.

Having been presented in over ten cities across Europe over the past 13 years ‚Äì Basel, Bordeaux, Barcelona, Copenhagen, Aalst, Porto, Vitoria- Gasteiz, Madrid, Paris and London ‚Äì Box sized DIE was first exhibited in Lisbon, Portugal, in 2007, at Cristina Guerra Contemporary Art, featuring the band Sacred Sin, and most recently, with the band Holocausto Canibal, at Onofre's solo show Once in a Lifetime [Repeat],Culturgest (2019). \\"Jo√£o Onofre - Once in a Lifetime [Repeat\\"]. at Culturgest, Lisbon, in 2019. A sense of inadequacy is felt throughout the 2007 video Untitled (I See a Darkness), in which two young boys aged 11 and 12 interpret Johnny Cash's cover of Will Oldham's theme I See a Darkness ‚Äì a grievous song about a tragic and hopeless future, a sentiment that neither one, due to their age, lack of maturity and life experience, is able to understand and convey appropriately, for their voices and facial expressions reveal a candidness contrary to the severity of the theme. This sense of inadequacy is furthered by the image of the video which starts pitch black and ends in an obfuscating white, thus inverting the meaning of the title: \\"This video thus reveals its macabre dimension, which makes the viewer all the more uncomfortable as it depicts the innocence and fragility of childhood.\\"Brunel, Rapha√´l (2009). \\"Jo√£o Onofre\\", La Mesure du D√©sordre.

Dorit Chrysler's BBGV dub) (2009), is another example of this creative appropriation, as the soundtrack of the video, which shows the best five attempts of a European free fall champion to stabilize a spirit level at 200 km/h, is a Theremin cover of The Beach Boys's theme \\"Good Vibrations\\" composed and interpreted by Dorit Chrysler who, in 2011, performed it live in the context of Onofre's solo exhibition at the Palais de Tokyo in Paris.Palais de Tokyo (2011). \\"Jo√£o Onofre: Projet Sp√©cial\\". Another case is the 2010-11 video Untitled (N'en Finit Plus), which stars a teenage girl singing acapella Petula Clark's \\"La Nuit n'en Finit Plus\\" (itself a cover from the theme \\"Needles and Pins\\" popularized by The Searchers, only with different lyrics), inside a hole on the ground of a prairie. In 2010 Onofre was commission a work for the Portuguese Representation at the 12th International Exhibition of the Venice Biennale of Architecture: Untitled (SUN 2500) features a 9-metre sailing boat being placed by a crane in a 10-metre swimming pool of a private house in the centre of Lisbon. In 2012 he completes the work GHOST, initiated in 2009, a video which documents the silent journey of a 15x9-meter floating island, inhabited by an 11-metre tropical palm tree, which crosses the city of Lisbon along the Tagus River, from east to west, until it gets lost on the horizon. In 2014 Onofre directs Tacet, in which he retrieves the subject of silence (or of its impossibility), through a delegated performance based on a double appropriation from John Cage ‚Äì his work 4'33' and the program of the Prepared Piano ‚Äì, which consists of a pianist interpreting Cage's 4'33', after preparing the piano with flammable liquid and setting it alight; the pianist must then endure the dense wall of fire which grows in front of him, while performing the silent piece.Mu√±oz, M.

In the 2015 video VOX the Portuguese guitarist Norberto Lobo plays his theme \\"Eu Amo\\" under an umbrella on a promontory of the Portuguese coast. His performance is documented in a sequence-shot by a giro-stabilized camera mounted on a helicopter, which responds to the crescendo and diminuendo of the music which confers the video its performative character. Between 2016 and 2017 Onofre produced the site-specific performative work Untitled (orchestral) for the Museum of Art, Architecture and Technology in Lisbon, a sound installation controlled by the luminous intensity of the sun, performed in robotic percussion from a spatialized score created from a selection of ambient sounds of its location, an inactive boiler room. In 2017 he created another site-specific work, Untitled (bells tuned D.E.A.D.), a spatialized real-time composition in which four bell towers in the city of Coimbra, Portugal, ringed their bells in a specific order every day at 6 p.m. playing the notes D, E and A, creating a sense of dialogue between them. His most recent work, and longest video to date, Untitled (zoetrope) (2018‚Äì2019), is a 2h39min sequence shot of a performance starring a gospel choir, several young rugby players and a 4 elements' band interpreting live Foreigner's iconic theme \\"I Want to Know What Love Is\\" (1984), documented in a circular travelling that follows the musicians playing but also the players' attempts to sing the chorus of the track before being tackled by their counterparts. Alongside his artistic practice, Onofre has been working as a teacher since 2001. He began as a coordinating teacher at Escola Superior Artes e Design in Caldas da Rainha, Portugal, having then taught at Faculdad de Bellas Artes ‚Äì Universitat de Barcelona, Spain, and since 2013, at the Faculdade de Belas-Artes of the University of Lisbon where he is currently Assistant Professor and the Regent of the Performance class.  Exhibitions  Onofre has exhibited his work extensively in solo shows at I-20 Gallery, New York (2001 and 2006), at MoMA PS1, New York (2002), National Museum of Contemporary Art - Museu do Chiado, Lisbon, Galicia Contemporary Art Centre (CGAC), Santiago de Compostela (2003), Project Space Karlsplatz, Wien (2003), Magazin 4, Bregenz (2004), Lighten Up at Centro de Artes Visuais (CAV), Coimbra (2010), Palais de Tokyo, Paris (2011), Fundaci√≥ Joan Mir√≥, Barcelona (2011), Neuer Kunstverein, Wien (2013),Neuer Kunstverein (2013). \\"Jo√£o Onofre\\".

Appointed by David Cameron, Hunt served in the Cameron‚ÄìClegg coalition and Cameron majority government. He was re-appointed by Theresa May and served in the majority and minority May governments. In January 2018, Hunt gained additional responsibility for social care in England and, in June, became the longest- serving Health Secretary in British political history. He left the role when he was promoted to Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs after the resignation of Boris Johnson, and was succeeded by Matt Hancock. Hunt pursued an ambitious agenda to address patient safety, regional variations in premature deaths, health tourism and A&E; waiting times. He oversaw increased spending on the National Health Service but was criticised for controversial reforms, manipulating figures and increased privatisation. He implemented policies working towards a seven-day NHS and oversaw the imposition of a controversial new junior doctors' contract in England, after the failure of negotiations during a dispute in which junior doctors undertook industrial action. Appointment Hunt was appointed Secretary of State for Health by David Cameron in a cabinet reshuffle on 4 September 2012, succeeding Andrew Lansley. Hunt had previously co-authored a book calling for the NHS \\"to be replaced by a new system of health provision in which people would pay money into personal health accounts, which they could then use to shop around for care from public and private providers. Those who could not afford to save enough would be funded by the state.\\" In an attempt to better understand the NHS, he shadowed workers which eventually established his keystone policy: patient safety.  Views  The Daily Telegraph science correspondent Tom Chivers expressed concern in 2012 that Hunt was known to have supported homoeopathy. In 2014 Hunt asked the Chief Medical Officer to initiate expert reviews of three homoeopathic studies carried out by Boiron, a French manufacturer of homoeopathic products. Later that year, Hunt denied personally being a supporter, and blamed his inexperience as a new MP for previously signing a pro-homeopathy early day motion. However, he did support NHS funding for it if recommended by a doctor. In 2012, Hunt said that he was in favour of reducing the abortion limit from 24 weeks to 12 weeks. In 2013, he said that the regional variations in premature deaths throughout the United Kingdom were \\"shocking\\". In February 2018, Hunt attracted attention after defending the universal coverage provided by the NHS against US President Donald Trump, saying \\"I may disagree with claims made on that march but not ONE of them wants to live in a system where 28m people have no cover. NHS may have challenges but I'm proud to be from the country that invented universal coverage ‚Äì where all get care no matter the size of their bank balance\\".  Health tourism  Jeremy Hunt during a trip to the US, in 2013 In 2013, Hunt announced plans to charge foreign nationals for using the NHS, claiming that the cost was up to ¬£200 million though official figures put it at ¬£33 million. However, ¬£21 million of that ¬£33 million was already recovered, putting the actual cost at ¬£12 million ‚Äì less than Hunt's crackdown could cost.  A&E; waiting times  Japanese Prime Minister Shinz≈ç Abe with Sir John Major, Jeremy Hunt and Hugo Swire, in 2013 It was reported in December 2013 that Hunt was personally telephoning the Chairs of NHS hospital trusts where targets in Accident and Emergency (A&E;) departments had been missed, a course of action which was described as \\"crazy\\" by David Prior, chairman of the Care Quality Commission and a former Conservative MP. Prior said that while Hunt, like his Labour predecessors, took responsibility, the result was money being diverted from primary and community care to A&E.; However, Dr Clifford Mann, president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, blamed the problems on the Health and Social Care Act 2012 for causing \\"decision-making paralysis\\" and leaving the country short of around 375 emergency doctors. In January 2018, Hunt apologised to patients in England affected by the decision to postpone tens of thousands of operations. Hunt made his comment as reports emerged of patients having to wait a long time to be treated, with ambulances left queuing outside A&E; departments. In March 2018, Hunt informed NHS trusts that they would not be required to meet waiting time targets for A&E; patients in the following year. The decision was criticised by the Patients Association and National Voices.  NHS pay  In March 2014, Hunt announced that the government would not give a recommended 1% pay rise to NHS non-medical staff receiving progression pay (around 55% of total non-medical staff). Later that year, he declared that patient choice was not key to improving NHS performance, in a major break from a policy favoured by Conservative and Labour governments over the previous 12 years. He stated that \\"there are natural monopolies in healthcare, where patient choice is never going to drive change\\". Following a pre-election report in April 2015 that hospital chiefs shared an average 6% pay rise totalling ¬£35 million, Hunt promised to investigate if the Conservatives won the election.  Outsourcing  In 2015, an undercover Daily Telegraph investigation showed that in some cases locum agencies, Medicare and Team24 owned by Capita were charging some hospitals higher fees than others and giving false company details. The agencies were charging up to 49% of the fee. Hunt criticised those who sought \\"big profits\\" at the expense of the NHS and taxpayers and promised to \\"reduce the margins rip-off agencies are able to generate.\\" NHS weekend cover In July 2015, Hunt indicated that he would be prepared to impose a new consultant contract on doctors in England which would remove the opt out for non-emergency work at weekends. He stated this was to prevent \\"about 6,000 avoidable deaths\\" resulting from a \\"Monday to Friday culture\\" in some areas of the NHS and to reintroduce \\"a sense of vocation\\" in consultants. The comments angered many doctors who responded by sharing photographs of themselves working at the weekends via social media using the hashtag #ImInWorkJeremy. It emerged in February 2016 that the \\"6,000 avoidable deaths\\" figure was based on Hunt's own understanding of an unpublished, unreviewed study by Freemantle et al. that he had access to before its publication in September 2015. The latter had been denied by NHS England's Freedom of Information Officer in October 2015. At the time NHS England also asked one of the authors to corroborate Hunt's figures who refused to do so, stating that it would interfere with the peer review of the unpublished paper; in response they reframed the figure as being based on earlier studies on its website in August 2015. In October 2015, Hunt was accused by the editor of The BMJ Fiona Godlee of repeatedly misrepresenting a study published in the journal in the same year by Freemantle et al. on the weekend effect to parliament and the public. He had used the study as key evidence when stating in parliament and in interviews with the media that reduced staffing levels of doctors at weekends directly led to 11,000 excess deaths. Godlee asserted that the study's authors did not specify that the excess deaths were avoidable or that staffing levels were the cause. The lead author of the study Nick Freemantle, when asked about the study in February 2016, stated that they did not identify a cause for the excess deaths or establish the extent to which they were avoidable. Co-author NHS Medical Director Sir Bruce Keogh in response to Hunt's comments in October also stated \\"It is not possible to ascertain the extent to which these excess deaths may be preventable\\". Hunt was also criticised for the fact that his claims about hospitals being more unsafe at weekends not merely misrepresented the facts but had potentially caused patients to delay going into hospitals and thus put them at risk. His critics described the Hunt Effect where patients who needed medical attention at a weekend had been deterred from doing so because they were persuaded that it would be better to wait until a Monday. Statisticians Professor David Spiegelhalter and David Craven, Dr Mark Porter, BMA council chair, Heidi Alexander, the shadow health secretary also denounced Hunt for making misleading statements about weekend hospital treatment after his assertion in parliament in the same month that \\"currently, across all key specialties, in only 10% of our hospitals are patients seen by a consultant within 14 hours of being admitted at the weekend.\\" Speigelhalter stated that the data from NHS England showed that on average 79% of patients are seen within 14 hours by a consultant across all specialities and that this data is collected for the whole week so it would be flawed to state figures for the weekend as Hunt did. NHS England confirmed that it would not be possible to separate weekend and weekday performance from the data. In January 2016, Hunt was criticised by top stroke doctors for using out-of-date data to try to show that stroke patients are more likely to die if they are admitted at weekends. They wrote that there had been significant improvements since 2004‚Äì12, when the data Hunt had referenced came from, and that new data showed there was \\"no longer any excess of hospital deaths in patients with stroke admitted at the weekend.\\" Stroke specialist David Curtis said even the outdated statistics did not support Hunt's claims. In February 2016, a mid-January internal report by the Department of Health was leaked. It stated the department was unable to find evidence to prove a link between increased consultant presence, availability of diagnostic tests, and reducing weekend mortality and length of stay. It also highlighted that the seven-day NHS could cost an additional ¬£900 million each year, required the recruitment of 11,000 more staff including 4,000 doctors and 3,000 nurses, and that community and social services could struggle to handle more discharges at the weekend. In May 2016, a report by the House of Commons public accounts committee criticised Hunt's plan for a seven-day NHS, saying \\"no coherent attempt\\" had made to understand staffing needs, the plan was \\"completely uncosted\\", and contained \\"serious flaws\\". Another study also concluded there was no evidence that people were more likely to die in hospitals at the weekend. In August, internal risk management documents produced by civil servants in the Department of Health in July were leaked. They described 13 major risks in delivering the \\"truly seven-day NHS\\" pledge promised by the Conservative party prior to the 2015 general election. These included a lack of staff and funding for the policy. The documents also discussed that no advance impact assessments had been made to show how the policy would affect the delivery of NHS services. Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, the organisation that represents NHS services in England described the seven-day NHS plan as \\"impossible to deliver\\" due to a lack of funding and staffing. He also highlighted pressures on the NHS with 80% of acute hospitals in England in financial deficit compared to 5% in 2013 and an increase of missed A&E; waiting time targets from 10% to 90% in the same time period.  No-confidence petition  In July 2015, Hunt became the subject of the first petition on a new UK government website to reach the threshold of 100,000 signatures required for a petition to be considered for debate in Parliament. The petition called for a debate on a vote of \\"No Confidence\\" in Hunt as Health Secretary, and ultimately recorded 222,991 signatures leading to a debate on the motion being scheduled in September 2015. However, the Petitions Committee does not have the power to initiate a vote of no confidence, the committee instead debated the contracts and conditions of the NHS staff. Junior doctors' contracts In September 2015, the Department of Health announced that they would impose new contracts for junior doctors in England after the British Medical Association (BMA), a professional association and trade union representing doctors said that they would not re-enter negotiations, despite the independent Doctors' and Dentists' remuneration review body recommending the deal. The new contracts would extend \\"normal hours\\", for which doctors would not be paid a premium, from 7 am to 7 pm Mondays to Fridays to 7 am to 10 pm on every day except Sunday while increasing their basic pay in a move that Hunt said would be cost neutral. In response the BMA balloted its members for industrial action, the first since the 1970s. They argued that the contract would include an increase in working hours with a relative pay cut of up to 40%, and refused to re-enter negotiations unless Hunt dropped his threat to impose a new contract and extensive preconditions, which he had refused to do. Many junior doctors said they would leave the NHS if the contract was forced through. Hunt later tried to reassure the BMA that no junior doctor would face a pay cut, before admitting that those who worked longer than 56 hours a week would face a fall in pay. He said that working these long hours was unsafe. In November 2015, He said he would offer a basic pay increase of 11%, but still removing compensation for longer hours. In response, the BMA junior doctors committee chair, Johann Malawana, requested further details of the offer and said that \\"The increase in basic pay would be offset by changes to pay for unsocial hours, devaluing the vital work junior doctors do at evenings and weekends.\\" In February 2016, Hunt announced he would be unilaterally imposing the new junior doctors' contract without agreement or further negotiation, with NHS trusts instructed to introduce it in August. This followed David Dalton, the chief negotiator for the government and NHS Employers, reporting that junior doctors contract negotiations had ceased after his final offer to the BMA had been declined. The decision to impose angered many junior doctors, with some indicating that they would quit the NHS. Hunt acknowledged this by saying that there would be \\"considerable dismay\\", and also announced an urgent inquiry led by the chair of the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges Susan Bailey into junior doctors' morale and welfare. The Academy Trainee Doctors' Group (representatives for junior doctors from different royal colleges) voted unanimously not to participate in the review under the offered terms. =Junior doctors' strikes= Junior doctors support badges On 19 November 2015, the result of the BMA strike ballot was announced, with 99.4% in favour of industrial action short of a strike, and 98% voting for full strike action on a turnout of 76%. After the results were announced, the BMA council chair Mark Porter appealed to the health secretary to resume negotiations facilitated by Acas. More than a week later, Hunt agreed to discussions overseen by Acas and withdrew his threat to impose a new contract without agreement, and the first day of strike action was called off hours before it was due to start, which was too late to avoid some disruption. An agreement was not reached by the junior doctors committee (JDC) 4 January 2016 deadline, so the BMA announced that a strike would go ahead, blaming \\"the government's continued failure to address junior doctors' concerns about the need for robust contractual safeguards on safe working, and proper recognition for those working unsocial hours.\\" The first day of strike action was in January 2016 and involved junior doctors only providing emergency care. This was the first junior doctors' strike for forty years. Hunt said it was \\"unnecessary\\", that patients could be put at risk, and that many junior doctors had \\"ignored\\" the strike call and worked anyway, but the BMA responded that many junior doctors were in work maintaining emergency care as planned. A second day of strike action occurred on 10 February where doctors again provided only emergency care. In February 2016, he was polled as the \\"most disliked\\" frontline British politician. In response to Hunt's announcement in February of the imposition of the new junior doctors' contract, the BMA announced three 48-hour long strikes where junior doctors would only provide emergency care. They also issued a legal challenge over the contract. Further talks after the strikes resulted in an agreement, to be put to a referendum. Hunt said he had lessons to learn, but continued to deny any personal responsibility for the dispute. The July referendum was open to BMA members who were junior doctors or medical students in the final two years of their degree. 58% of voters rejected the offer, with a 68% turnout. Following this, Malawana resigned, and Hunt rejected holding any further talks with the BMA and announced the imposition of the new contract on junior doctors starting from October. In the lead up to his imposition of the contract, Hunt had repeatedly stated publicly and in Parliament his intention to do so. Even when challenged, he reiterated this intent and also confirmed that he had the power to do so. This matter was challenged in the High Court by a group of doctors, \\"Justice for Health\\". In order to successfully defend the case against him, lawyers acting on his behalf conceded that he did not actually have the power to impose the contract, and asserted that Hunt was not to be held accountable for things he had said in Parliament. They also argued the High Court did not have the authority to rule over whether he had misled Parliament. Hospital closures In 2012, Hunt attempted to downgrade casualty and maternity units in Lewisham. Hunt stated that the cuts were necessary because neighbouring South London Healthcare NHS Trust had been losing more than ¬£1m every week. But a campaign led by GP Dr Louise Irvine defeated Hunt in court in 2012 on this issue, with the judge ruling that Hunt acted outside his powers when he announced casualty and maternity units at Lewisham Hospital would be downgraded.  Meningitis controversy  Hunt drew condemnation from medical professionals when it was reported in January 2016 he had suggested that parents should go online to look at photos of rashes if worried that a child may have meningitis. Specific disapproval was drawn to the fact that a rash caused by deadly meningitis can look very similar to other conditions, as well as professionals pointing out the time-critical nature of meningitis. The charity Meningitis Now said his advice was \\"potentially fatal\\". NHS funding In July 2016 a cross-party committee of MP's ascertained that Hunt had 'broken his pledges on NHS funding and is misleading the public about health service reforms'. Specifically, it found that 'contrary to government claims to be injecting an extra ¬£8.4bn into the NHS on top of inflation by 2020/21, the real figure was more likely to be ¬£4.5bn'. The committee claimed the 'Government has used a different definition of spending to calculate the figures which made it appear that a larger increase in spending had occurred than was actually they case'. In October 2016 Hunt was pressed on the issue of NHS funding by the Health Select Committee. Specifically, on the fact that in the previous November Hunt promised the NHS would receive an extra ¬£10 billion a year above inflation, in the five years to 2020. But when questioned he conceded that in the accounts offered for spending had been stretched to include the previous year. This would therefore act to misleadingly inflate the spending figure by ¬£1.5bn, according to a recent report. When challenged by the Health Select Committee, Hunt admitted \\"This amount of cash is being handed to the NHS... over the six years.\\" He confirmed the period \\"includes the spending review period and an extra year\\". It is this use of an 'extra year' in the accounts which added further fuel to the claim that Hunt has knowingly misled the public on public health funding. During 2017, Stephen Hawking publicly criticised Hunt's management of the NHS and supported legal action against further reforms, including accountable care organisations (ACOs). At a Royal Society of Medicine speech, Hawking accused Hunt of using studies that were not properly peer reviewed, and ignoring other papers. In January 2018, Hawking won a case to take Hunt to court for alleged \\"back door privatisation of the NHS\\".  May cabinet  When Theresa May became Leader of the Conservative Party and Prime Minister in July 2016, Hunt retained his post of Health Secretary. Prior to May's 2018 cabinet reshuffle, it was reported he was to be moved to become Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy and Business Secretary Greg Clark be moved to replace him. However, in an hour-long meeting with May, Hunt defended his position as Health Secretary and convinced May to allow him to remain in post, add social care in England to his brief and have the Department for Health be renamed the Department of Health and Social Care. In June 2018, Hunt became the longest-serving Health Secretary in British political history. In July, Boris Johnson resigned as Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs over disagreements with Theresa May's negotiated Brexit withdrawal agreement. Hunt was appointed by May to replace him, while Matt Hancock succeeded Hunt as Health Secretary. As Foreign Secretary, Hunt said in April 2019 he hoped to champion NHS reform upon his retirement from frontbench politics: \\"to do for patient safety what Al Gore has done for climate change\\".  Brexit  In 2016, Hunt called for a reduction in the number of foreign doctors working in the NHS after the UK left the EU. At the Conservative Party Conference later in the month, Hunt pledged that by 2025, the NHS would be \\"self-sufficient in doctors\\". He announced an increase of up to 1,500 extra places at medical schools in the UK in 2018, with it being partly funded by an increase in international medical student fees. Hunt also stated UK medical students would be forced to work in the NHS for at least four years or have to repay the cost of their training, around ¬£220,000.

Most tornadoes form in the U.S., although some events may take place internationally. Tornado statistics for older years like this often appear significantly lower than modern years due to fewer reports or confirmed tornadoes. EventsUnited States yearly total=January There were 16 tornadoes confirmed in the US in January. =January 20‚Äì21= All 16 January tornadoes touched down in an intense outbreak that struck the Southeast.

Biography  Jenkin Jones was born about 1700, was son of John Jenkins of Bryngranod, Llanwenog, Cardiganshire, and according to a custom common until lately in the principality, adopted his father's Christian name as his own surname. The father, who is said to have been a blacksmith by trade, owned some land, and when he died, 18 March 1759, he left among other legacies one of ¬£100 to endow Llwynrhydowen, the chapel founded by his son. Jones in 1721 entered the Presbyterian College, Carmarthen, then under Thomas Perrot, a president whose own orthodoxy was unquestioned, but many of whose pupils subsequently drifted into heterodoxy. In 1723 Jones translated into Welsh and saw through the press Matthew Mead's Almost Christian tried and cast, which was published at Carmarthen in 1723. William Spurrell, in his History of Carmarthen, erroneously describes it as the first book printed there. On leaving college, Jones seems to have become co-pastor with James Lewis of the congregation at Pantycreuddin, Llandyssul, Cardiganshire. His views soon inclined to Arminianism, and although his following was large, the majority of the congregation opposed his teaching. He therefore resigned his co-pastorate, and founded in 1726 Llwynrhydowen, the first Arminian church in the principality, and the first church established in the interests of free religious thought. For some years he was the only public advocate of Arminianism in Wales, though many of the younger ministers and Carmarthen students were probably in secret sympathy with him. In Whit week 1729 the spread of Arminian views was the subject of serious discussion at a meeting of the associated ministers at Llangloffan in Pembrokeshire, when it was resolved that certain works should be published \\"to counteract the Arminian doctrines which were then beginning to disturb the churches.\\" Towards the close of the year an anonymous pamphlet appeared professing to give from the Arminian point of view a \\"Correct Account of Original Sin.\\" It was attributed to Jones, but no copy is now known to be extant. It evoked numerous replies, among them one by Jones's old pastor, James Lewis, in conjunction with the Rev. Christmas Samuel, with the title, The most Correct Account of Original Sin, 1730. Jones's congregation increased, and six or seven influential ministers, together with their congregations, adopted his opinions. He died in 1742, in the mid-day of life, according to his elegy, and was buried on 4 June in the parish churchyard at Llandyssul. He married a daughter of David Thomas of Pant-y-defaid, Cardiganshire.  Works  Jones published, besides the works mentioned: * Dydd y Farn Fawr (i.e. The Day of Great Judgment), translation of a work by the Rev. Thomas Vincent, M.A., Carmarthen, 1727. * Catecismau; preface dated 2 August 1732. * Hymnau Cymmwys i Addoliad Duw, ynghyd a'i Farwnad [elegy] gan Evan Thomas Rees, Carmarthen, 1768; edited by his son-in- law and successor in the ministry, David Lloyd. Other works are attributed without authority to Jones in Rowlands's Cambrian Bibliography.

The civil parish is part of the barony of Smallcounty. The largest population centre is the village of Herbertstown. The south-eastern part of the parish borders the parish of Kilcullane. Geologically, the parish rests on a substratum of limestone, except in some few places where the basalt rises. History According to Lewis' Topography of Ireland (1837), the parish contained 867 inhabitants and comprised 1366 statute acres. The land was recorded as \\"in general good\\". The rectory was impropriate in Edward Deane Freeman. The tithes of the parish amounted to ¬£148, 18 shillings, of which two-thirds were payable to the impropriatorIn ecclesiastical law, appropriation is the perpetual annexation of an ecclesiastical benefice to the use of some spiritual corporation, either aggregate or sole. In the Middle Ages in England the custom grew up of the monasteries reserving to their own use the greater part of the tithes of their appropriated benefices, leaving only a small portion to their vicars in the parishes. On the dissolution of the monasteries the rights to collect \\"great tithes\\" were often sold off, along with former monastic lands, to laymen; whose successors, known as \\"lay impropriators\\" or \\"lay rectors,\\" still hold them, the system being known as impropriation. and the remainder to the vicar. Lewis recorded that there were two pay schools in the parish. The remains of \\"Ballynard Castle\\" were to be found on the hill by Ballinard townland itself. This castle was the main seat of a branch of the FitzGerald dynasty that was built in the fifteenth century. The Powel family, who gave their name to a neighbouring townland, had a mansion at Eaglestown. Ecclesiastical parish Like all civil parishes, this civil parish is derived from, and co-extensive with a pre-existing Church of Ireland parish of the same nameJohn Caillard Erck, The ecclesiastical register: containing the names of the dignitaries and parochial clergy of Ireland : as also of the parishes and their respective patrons and an account of monies granted for building churches and glebe- houses with ecclesiastical annals annexed to each diocese and appendixes : containing among other things several cases of quare impedit, (1927), page 113 in the diocese of Cashel and Emly. The church mentioned in Lewis's survey is located in the townland of Ballinard. At that time, the church was in ruins. Parishes of the Catholic Archdiocese of Cashel and Emly In the Catholic Church, the civil parish forms part of the ecclesiastical parish of \\"Herbertstown and Hospital\\" located at the western edge of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cashel and Emly.Catholic Archdiocese of Cashel and Emly - \\"Hospital and Herbertstown\\" There are two church buildings in the parish: the Sacred Heart Church, Herbertstown;National Inventory of Architectural Heritage - Sacred Heart Roman Catholic Church, BALLINARD, Register number 21903224 St. John The Baptist, Hospital.

The boat is owned by Brian Trautman, who often sails with his brother Brady and with Brian's wife Karin Syren and crew member Alex Blue. The team invites additional crew members aboard who contribute to sailing, boat maintenance, and filming. They film their experiences and adventures, which include island exploration, hiking, underwater diving, partying, meeting local people, in addition to sailing across oceans. Delos has made several ocean crossings, sometimes going through intense weather conditions such as severe lightning storms, and once tackling a 50-knot gale en route to Madagascar. Background Trautman grew up in Flagstaff, Arizona with a love of the outdoors, and worked as a diesel mechanic during his high school years and later earned a degree in electrical engineering from the University of Washington. He worked at Microsoft before starting his own software company but he soon grew tired of 60-hour workweeks. What inspired him to think about crossing oceans in a boat was reading the book Three Years in a 12-Foot Boat by Stephen G. Ladd. He spent several years researching and saving money and narrowed down his list of boats to the Amel Super Maramu. His voyage began in 2009 in Seattle, Washington in the United States. He sailed to Mexico where he was joined by his brother Brady, and the two of them along with Brian's then- partner sailed for New Zealand. There he met his future wife Karin Syren who began sailing with them. In their early days, they often had to work in local marinas to make money for boat repairs and fuel. In 2014, the crew re-thought their business model, and learned how to support their income from YouTube with crowdfunding and Patreon campaigns. The channel The Delos team has made over 200 videos. The channel had 90,000 subscribers in December 2016 and 585,000 subscribers . On Instagram, it had over 170,000 followers . It had 1.8 million views per month in December 2019. A report in Yachting World magazine in 2019 suggested that the crew made $14,000 for each video from paying donors, and produced about four videos each month. The boat Delos is a 53-foot long Amel Super Maramu. From 2008 to 2020, it sailed over 70,000 miles. Trautman bought it in 2009. As a former electrical engineer, he used his knowledge to make various improvements to the boat. He installed lithium- phosphate batteries to power the vessel, along with a battery management system, to provide energy to power laptops, electric cooking units, and the navigation systems. The crew has taken numerous steps to make their boat friendly to the environment. Philanthropy The crew has engaged in numerous philanthropic endeavors, such as contributing to restoration efforts on the island of Dominica which had been ravaged by Hurricane Maria in 2017. They gave $50,000 in 2019 to various charities such as the Surfrider Foundation which seeks to protect the world's oceans.

King belonged to the Matawai tribe, and performed his missionary activities for the Moravian Church. Adiri was born as a son of granman (paramount chief) Kodjo of the Matawai, near the plantations of Haarlem and Maho in Suriname. Adiri was born and raised in a completely illiterate society. In 1852, Adiri moved to Maripaston. During this period, he fell ill, and the illness lasted many years. In 1855, Adiri started to receive visions: a strange god pointed at an alien religion, told him to go to the city, and be baptized. Adiri went to Paramaribo, where he met van Calker, who was the preacher at the Moravian Church. He didn't stay long, and returned to his village soon after. Adiri returned in 1860, and had taught himself to read by then. He had used an A.B.C. (alphabet) book, and Singiboekoe, a book with psalms from the Moravian Church in Sranan Tango. Once again he didn't stay long, but when he returned home, he started to build a church in Maripaston. In 1861, he returned to the city, was baptized, and changed his name to Johannes King. King first started to preach under his own people for which King was paid by the mission. King was briefly granman when his brother died, but opted to be solely a preacher. In 1864, he was sent to the Ndyuka for a dual purpose: The Moravian Church had up to then been unable to reach the Ndyuka, and the Matawai wanted to make a peace treaty with the Ndyuka. In 1864, King published a book about the visit in Sranan Tongo. The book is hard to read, because he uses an autodidactic spelling and often confuses a with h. The original is archived by the Moravian Church in Zeist. During 1864 and 1865, King wrote and published over 1,000 pages on his visits to various tribes. His most important works are a 1868 book about the religions and customs of the Maroons, the 1886 Skrekiboekoe (book of horrors), which deals with his visions, and a 1886 history of the Maroons.. King also wrote dresibuku, a medical book, but decided to keep it secret. The fast majority of his writing are archived by the Moravian Church in Zeist or Herrnhut. On 29 May 1958, the Johannes King Hospital in Stoelmanseiland was named after Johannes King. In 1973, the dairies of Johannes King were published in Sranan Tongo as Life at Maripaston with summary in English by Henri Frans de Ziel.

Dated between 1508 and 1510, it is located in the third chapel on the right of the southern nave of the New Cathedral, Brescia. History On 5 January 1503, the discovery of the relics of Sant'Apollonio, the fourth bishop of Brescia, in the Basilica of San Pietro de Dom was officially announced.Archivio di Stato di Brescia, Archivio Storico Civico, provisions, 1528, c. 67r. The discovery had likely been made in September 1502 with the finding of documentation of works in his named chapel.Liber Buletarum Fabrice Ecclesie Maioris. 1486-1571 (BQ, Ms. F. VII. 24), cc. 33r-v. The same day, the General Council of the city decided unanimously to provide a worthy emplacement for the remains of the saint, in agreement with diocesan authorities and the cathedral. In June, another resolution of the General Council was made, bidding the College of Notaries to finance the new ark.Archivio di Stato di Brescia, Archivio Storico Civico, provisions, 519, c. 16r. However, the funds were not immediately committed, most likely because the notaries had had trouble to raise the funds. Another order from the Council dates to 1506, ordering the College of Notaries to fulfil the work.Archivio di Stato di Brescia, Archivio Storico Civico, provisions, cart. 520, cc. 80v-81r. Finally, in 1508, three people were appointed by the council to preside over the expansion of the chapel of Sant'Apollonio so that it could encompass the marble reliquary ark (archa marmorea et miro artificio fabricata de pecuniis collegii notariorum Brixie).Archivio di Stato di Brescia, Archivio Storico Civico, provisions, cart. 521, c. 128r. The works are thereby documented from December 1509 through November 1510, with fees for interventions such as the lowering of the floor and the remaking of the walls and the arch, the last by a master Benedictus lapicida.Liber Buletarum Fabrice Ecclesie Maioris. 1486-1571 [BQ, Ms. F. VII. 24], cc. 51r, 52r-52v. The expenses were considerable, nearly 300 lire planette (the Brescian currency of the time). The transfer of the relics, officiated by Bishop Mattia Ugoni and attended by notable city authorities as well as papal representatives, took place in July 1510,Archivio di Stato di Brescia, Archivio Storico Civico, Provvisioni, 1528, c. 171r. by which time the ark would have been completed. The execution of the work, therefore, can be placed between 1508‚Äì1510. The sculptural complex was transferred to the Old Cathedral in 1604, when the early Christian basilica was beginning to be demolished, to be replaced by the Duomo Nuovo. At this time, relics of Philastrius, another bishop of Brescia from the fourth century, were also placed in the ark. Finally, in 1674, the ark was moved to the Duomo Nuovo, where it is found to this day, in the last of the chapels on the right side of the southern nave, said nave being dedicated to the saints Apollonius and Philastrius. A new altar was built by Carlo Carra and collaborators, comprising two lateral shelves and a central dedicatory inscription, all on a high base.Partitario per le oblazioni e spese per S.M. del Duomo e altre chiese per le custodie notturne. Anno 1671-1700, archived in ASB, Archivio Storico Civico, cart. 954, cc. 61-64. The original supports, possibly columns or pillars, were removed. Description The ark comprises three stages: a base, a central body, and the cymatium. The base is made up of two distinct bands of equal width, the first smooth in gray stone and the second in white marble with a decoration of festoons. The central body is the most elaborate from an artistic point of view and has five historiated panels, three on the front and two on the sides, depicting some stories of the life of Saint Apollonius. From the left side panel, proceeding to the right, there are the Imposition of the priestly robes to Saints Faustino and Giovita, the Preaching to the people, the proof of the Eucharist, the baptism of Calocero and the death of Saint Apollonius. The painted panels are inserted in an architectural order of Corinthian pilasters with candelabra, which hold up a thick entablature with an elaborate frieze. The sculptural complex is topped by the cymatium, consisting of a pedestal bearing a dedicatory inscription, on which is inset a statue of Sant'Apollonio with a crosier in gilded bronze. The canopy is crowned with a lunette bearing a Madonna with Child and angels, in turn completed by a torch from which emanate false gold bronze flames. Two small pedestals flank the canopy, connecting to the central body via stone elements with characteristic wave profiles, above which are statuettes of San Faustino on the left and San Giovita on the right. Stylistic assessment and attribution From the seventeenth century onwards, the ark was considered a fine objet d'art in Brescia, especially in catalogues of Brescian saints, that is to say, from the time of its emplacement in the Old Cathedral. Bernardino Faino, for instance, praised the beautiful depiction of the saint (istorie picole del istesso Santo, bellissime), adding that its author is unknown, being from antiquity. Francesco Paglia's Giardino della Pittura (written between 1675-1713), in the chapter on the old Cathedral, admired the carved ark with beautiful white marble figurines, that is, the ark of Sant'Apollonio. The ark in front view In 1822, the work was selected from among the historical monuments of Brescia to be included in the Le tombe e i monumenti illustri d'Italia, and given a full page engraving. Paolo Brognoli, in his 1826 guide to Brescia, was the first to conduct a critical analysis of the sculptures in the ark. Following researches in the municipal archives, he was able to reconstruct partially the circumstances of the monument's commission, though he was unable to find the contract with the sculptor who produced the ark. This was of particular interest to him, he said, because he had identified a monument by the same artist, dated to 1494, that was dedicated to Luigi Caprioli. (This was the Caprioli Adoration, and marks the first time that an artistic connection was made with the ark, not based on literary or archival evidence, but purely on stylistic considerations.) In 1939, Antonio Morassi proposed an attribution of the ark to Maffeo Olivieri, which was reasserted by subsequent texts. Two studies by Vito Zani in 2001 and 2003 proposed the reassignment of the work to Gasparo Cairano, based on stylistic comparisons and historical context. Zani was able to locate identical characteristics between the summit statue of the ark of Sant'Apollonio and the keystone of the portico of the Palazzo della Loggia in Brescia, the latter documented with payments to Cairano in 1497. Zani noted the similarity in the execution of the faces, softening their features but providing the same expressive severity. The same face, austere and calm, can also be found in San Pietro on the portal of the cathedral of Sal√≤, which slightly predated the ark. The ark's two statues of Saints Faustino and Giovita, on the contrary, represent an extreme tribute to the Angels of Tamagnino for the Church of Santa Maria dei Miracoli, against which Cairano, almost twenty years earlier, had opposed his qualitatively inferior Apostles. These references however had been updated, with the heads and hair reshaped, according to the popular model of the contemporary Apostles at the Church of San Pietro in Oliveto. Furthermore, there were obvious technical and expressive similarities between the ark's San Faustino and the left-hand Caesar on the south side of the Loggia carried out between 1503-1508. The face of San Faustino has unfinished parts left close to smoothing, worked directly with a flat chisel, proving the virtuosity of the master in sculpting heads. Other points of similarity occur between the Madonna's face on the ark's cymatium and the female face of Justice on the Loggia's portico, which Cairano then reiterates in the Pala Kress. The middle frieze too supports the attribution to Cairano, its elaborate workmanship reminiscent of the Mausoleum of Martinengo and the altar of San Girolamo, both of which had very similarly executed friezes. The attention paid to the bold perspectives behind the foreground characters also has a precedent in Cairano's career, namely the Caprioli Adoration. The execution of the ark can be seen in the context of the rivalry between the Sanmicheli and Cairano, whose promotion of a classic style had supplanted the refined decorations of the Sanmicheli in public tastes. For instance, the 1505 Ark of San Tiziano installed in the Church of the Saints Cosma and Damiano by the Sanmicheli as an attempt to relaunch their studio, is largely supplanted by the monumentality and refinement of the figurative parts of the ark of Sant'Apollonio.

He served as Member of the Assembly of the Republic from 2011 to 2013, and as Secretary of State for Tourism in Pedro Passos Coelho's first and second governments from 2013 to 2015. Biography Adolfo Mesquita Nunes was born in Lisbon but raised in Covilh√£ with his paternal family. He earned his bachelor's degree in Law from the Catholic University of Portugal, and later a master's degree in Legal and Political Sciences in 2008 from the University of Lisbon. He has been a member of CDS ‚Äì People's Party since 1997. As a Member of Parliament, he became notable for being the only in the CDS caucus who voted for adoption by same- sex couples in 2012, and for being a member of the parliamentary committee on the international bailout programme in the wake of the 2010‚Äì2014 Portuguese financial crisis. As Secretary of State for Tourism under Minister of Economy Ant√≥nio Pires de Lima, he promoted deregulation of the sector. In 2020, Adolfo Mesquita Nunes was put forward as a potential candidate in the 2021 Portuguese presidential election, with the support of some in the moderate right-wing of the Social Democratic Party and the Liberal Initiative, as well as his own party. Mesquita Nunes publicly came out in an interview to the newspaper Expresso in 2018, saying he had not done so before because he found such an announcement unnecessary; while calling it as a private matter, he also said he had never made any attempt to conceal it, citing an incident during the campaign for the 2017 local elections in which one of his political campaign billboards in Covilh√£ was spray painted with the word \\"gay\\" and he specifically asked for it not to be taken down as it wasn't calumnious. Mesquita Nunes became the first person in a major party leadership position to come out in Portugal, something that infrequently happens among Portuguese politicians.

He began his career in journalism while still a student at Bates College and, by the end of his life, was a leading press figure in the state. For nearly a half century, Costello was one of the most prominent members of the Lewiston-Auburn community. In addition to running its largest morning and afternoon papers, he was a longtime trustee of both Bates College and the Androscoggin County Savings Bank, serving as the latter institution's president from 1931 to 1939. He was an active Freemason and member of the United Baptist church. Early life and education Costello was born in Wells, Maine on September 14, 1876. His father was Nicholas H. Costello (‚Äì1885), a sea captain who drowned when Costello and his sister were young. In 1889, his mother, Annie Hill Costello (1842‚Äì1927) remarried William S. Wells, a prominent York County lumberman who later served in the Maine House of Representatives. Board of The Bates Student in 1897, with business manager Costello second from left in the top row; Costello's future wife, Sadie Brackett, is second from right in the bottom row. Costello attended Berwick Academy and gave an oration at the school's 1894 class day. Thereafter he attended Bates College, where he was elected president of his senior class. He and Sadie Brackett, a fellow member of the class of 1898, wrote for The Bates Student. He was also a competitive debater and, after graduation, would participate in organizing a chapter of Delta Sigma Rho on Bates' campus. Costello and Brackett married in Lewiston on February 14, 1900 and had two children, Louise ( 1902) and Russell ( 1904). CareerNewspapers= In 1898, Lewiston publisher George W. Wood purchased the two-year old Lewiston Daily Sun, merging it with his weekly Maine Statesman, and hired Costello as the paper's business manager. Thanks largely to the arrival of Rural Free Delivery in the region, which allowed for wider distribution within the Lewiston-Auburn city and town area, circulation increased from around 2,000 copies per day to 8,000 over the following two decades. In 1926, Wood acquired the Lewiston Evening Journal and promoted Costello to treasurer and general manager of the papers' publishing company. Costello served in this position until Wood's death in 1945, when he took over as owner and president. By this time, the Sun and Journal were the fourth and fifth most-read dailies in the state with circulations of 27,480 and 14,088, respectively. Conservative in his management style, Costello stressed the importance of journalistic objectivity to those who worked under him. He strongly resisted the growth of non-print media, going as far as firing his general manager, Frank S. Hoy, when Hoy purchased the license for radio station WLAM without permission. His papers gained a reputation for being socially progressive but not so much as to alienate change-averse readers. Writing under the headline \\"A Leaf Out of My Notebook,\\" Costello shared with Sun readers reports of he and Sadie's cross-country travels. All the while, he remained devoted to his home state, with editorials focused on portraying local communities in a positive light. During his tenure, he served for a time as president of the Maine Daily Newspaper Publishers Association. =Banking= Costello was named a trustee of Androscoggin County Savings Bank in 1916 and remained on the board until 1956. Androscoggin was the largest savings bank by assets held centered in Lewiston and one of the largest in the state. In 1931, Costello was elected president of the bank when incumbent William J. Crawshaw resigned due to ill health. He served in this position for eight years, seeing it through the Great Depression, including its accepting of Emergency Banking Act aid in 1933. 1930s postcard featuring Lewiston United Baptist Church, where Costello was a member for four decades =Civic life= Costello was a United Baptist, a designation common among Maine members of the Northern Baptist Convention into the twentieth century. He was a founding member of the Lewiston United Baptist Church in the early 1920s and served on the building committee for that congregation's now-demolished English Gothic home at the corner of Bates and Main streets. In 1932, he was named second vice president of the Maine United Baptist Convention; that year, convention delegates passed resolutions praising the United States' involvement in the World Disarmament Conference and opposing repeal of the Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. He was also a Freemason, having served as a past master of Rabboni Lodge 150 and as a member of the Knights Templar fraternal order. Later life and death On June 15, 1952, in recognition of his achievements, including more than 30 years of service on Bates College's board of trustees, Costello was awarded an honorary Doctor of Laws degree by university president Charles Phillips. Other recipients honored at the ceremony were New Jersey Governor Alfred E. Driscoll, financier Frank Altschul, filmmaker Louis de Rochemont, and clergyman Daniel A. Poling. After a period of prolonged illness, Costello died at Central Maine General Hospital on May 6, 1959. Following services at the Bates College chapel, he was buried in Riverside Cemetery, alongside his wife, who preceded him in death two years earlier. In his will, he left $5,000 each () to Bates and the Lewiston United Baptist Church. As a result, the Costello Room in Bates' Chase Hall was named in his honor. His son, Russell, succeeded him as president of the Daily Sun company and oversaw the merger of The Sun and Evening Journal into the Sun Journal in 1989; Russell passed the presidency of the paper to his son, James, on own death in 1993. In 2017, the Costellos announced the sale of the Sun Journal to MaineToday Media owner Reade Brower. The Costello family home at 45 Campus Avenue was purchased by Bates College and held office and student organization space for a number of years, before being torn down in 2014. The site is currently occupied by the school's Bonney Science Center.

The decision taken by the National People's Congress on national security legislation and the alleviation of the COVID-19 pandemic in Hong Kong led to a new series of protests and international responses. On 30 June, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress passed the Hong Kong national security law which came into force the same day, leading to even more people protesting on 1 July.  Events  1 June = A petition in support of Beijing's plan to implement national security legislation was published online, which claimed to have been signed by over 2,500 actors, artists, and individuals from the entertainment and cultural industry in Hong Kong. The petition contained the name of veteran actor Ram Chiang, but Chiang later stated in his Facebook page that he did not sign the petition. It was reported that Barbie Hsu had also denied receiving an invitation or notification to join the petition. The petition also consisted of late artists such as Anita Mui and Leslie Cheung, with several netizens believing that the petition consisted of fake signatures. Sharon Cheung, a news broadcaster, clarified that she never did sign the petition. A restaurant in Ngau Tau Kok, which was supportive of the protests and youngsters, received a letter from the Hong Kong Housing Authority that the contract was no longer renewed and the eatery would shut down on 30 November 2020, despite the restaurant fulfilling social responsibility by giving out free lunchboxes to the elderly. Employees of the restaurant criticized the authority's decision, calling it a suppression of the Yellow Economic Circle. After learning that the contract was to be terminated through information from the Internet, citizens queued up to support them. In a press interview in the Legislative Council, Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po was seen with tears in his eyes, stirring controversy and discussion among social media on whether he was scared of the United States restrictions on Hong Kong. Chan later clarified in a Facebook post that the tears were due to the camera lighting during the interview, calling it a \\"misunderstanding\\". The annual Tiananmen Square massacre vigil in Hong Kong was banned for the first time since 1990 citing health concerns due to COVID-19. Lee Cheuk Yan, the chairman of the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements of China, which organized the vigil in the past years, said that the ban signaled the end of Hong Kong's \\"one country, two systems\\". = 2 June = United Kingdom response  United Kingdom Foreign Minister Dominic Raab addressed the Parliament with a statement which said that the imposition of national security legislation on Hong Kong by the Chinese central government would be in direct conflict with Article 23 of the Hong Kong Basic Law, as well as a violation of international law. He outlined the UK's possible response to support the Hong Kong people through providing a pathway to citizenship for British National Overseas-passport holders in Hong Kong.  Progress of court cases related to anti-extradition protests  A student, Lam Tsz-Ho, accused of rioting in Wong Tai Sin on 1 October was acquitted by judge Sham Siu-Man. The judge criticized the two police officers facilitating the accusations that they had not proven they had caught the person who had hurled a brick; and that the Court could not accept their affidavits. He went on to say that at least one of the two officers had failed to provide a full and truthful account of how Lam had sustained a head wound during his arrest. The protestor shot by a police officer in the 11 November shooting incident went on trial. The judge, Law Tak-Chuen, allowed the police officer who fired the shot to remain anonymous, stating that he had received death threats.  Other developments  Local activist group Demosisto urged the United Nations to discuss the National Security Law, and to advise the mainland government not to implement it. In a nine-page report filed on 2 June the group argued that the definition of 'National Security' was unclear and vague, and stressed that the law would allow those critical of the Chinese Communist Party to face potential arrest. They worried that slogans which have been familiar in the protests would be banned, and that there would be frequent abuse of power and rights from the top authorities. They also added that Hong Kong's freedom and autonomy would encounter a 'fatal' blow. In addition to the emerging threat, the report also complained about alleged police brutality and prison abuses. In a South China Morning Post commentary, Andrew Li, former Chief Justice of the Court of Final Appeal of Hong Kong, stated that it was reasonable for the mainland government to take steps towards enacting a security law, given that the Hong Kong government had failed to discharge its constitutional duty as required by Hong Kong Basic Law Article 23. He wrote that in his understanding, the proposed legislation would be \\"designed to fit Hong Kong's legal system\\" and especially must not be retroactive (to previous offenses). In addition, Yang Ti-liang, former Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Hong Kong, issued a statement, expressing that he felt assured that the national security law would be in line with common law principles, and that it was \\"understandable and justifiable\\" to have such a law. Prior to embarking on a trip to Beijing to discuss matters on National People's Congress Decision on Hong Kong national security legislation, Chief Executive Carrie Lam told reporters, referencing the protests that had recently erupted in the United States in connection with the death of George Floyd, that the United States was applying \\"double standards\\" in its response to violence that had occurred during the Hong Kong protests. In a report entitled 'New Law, New Threat', Human Rights First warned that the looming national security law would endanger human rights lawyers in Hong Kong to a further degree than what had already been the case. =3 June= United Kingdom response  Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced in an opinion piece written for South China Morning Post that if China were to continue pursuing the national security law, he would allow all Hong Kong residents born before the 1997 handover to claim a British National (Overseas) passport (BNO) and open a path to British citizenship for them. Raab said that the UK would sacrifice trade deals with China to support Hong Kong, but that presently it will remain in conversation with the international community on the matter. A late-May statement by Raab had offered a similar measure that would allow the 300,000 current BNO passport holders to apply for a visa; Johnson's 3 June announcement would cover a further 2.5 million Hong Kong residents born before the 1997 handover. China's foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian threatened \\"serious consequences\\", while many Hong Kong pro- democratic politicians and protesters were reported to wish for more protection for their city itself.  Other international responses  The internet platform of state-run Xinhua News Agency published a list of \\"many\\" countries that had announced their support for the National Security Law, and moreover had aligned with the central government's view that Hong Kong's affairs were an internal matter of China: Burundi, Myanmar, North Korea, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Syria, Tanzania, and Uganda. Previously on 1 June, the global edition of state-run China Daily published an article that mentioned the support of \\"various\\" countries for China's position regarding Hong Kong, naming Serbia, North Korea, Pakistan, Cuba, Russia, and Iran.  Other developments  Some protesters and citizens gathered outside the Lai Chi Kok Reception Centre to mourn the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, as well as to show solidarity with those who were detained for their actions in the current protests in Hong Kong. In an article for the Bauhinia Magazine, Pro- China politician Tam Yiu-chung stated that those members of the legislative council who disapproved of the national security law should be disqualified. Members of the pro-democracy camp sharply criticized Tam's statements. Demosisto started a petition to fight for European state leaders to support Hong Kong citizens. There have been 70,000 signatures already out of the 100,000 goal. = 4 June = At the United States Department of State, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo met surviving activists of the 1989 Tiananmen Square Protests. The State Department offered no details on what was discussed but said in a statement: \\"We mourn the victims of June 4, 1989, and we stand with the people of China who continue to aspire to a government that protects human rights, fundamental freedoms and basic human dignity.\\" 4 June 2020 was the 31st anniversary of the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre. The official gathering at Victoria Park was banned by police on 1 June, the first time in 30 years citing COVID-19 concerns. Although the official candlelight vigil was banned, multiple activities were planned to mourn in different districts such as Victoria Park, Shatin, Tuen Mun, Tsuen Wan. At around 5:00 pm, pro- democracy protesters handed out flyers outside Sogo in Causeway Bay, shouting slogans, and peacefully entering Victoria Park as groups of eight. The police used a broadcaster to warn citizens not to participate in unlawful assembly. Police stood on standby but did not prevent protesters inside the park grounds. Peaceful protesters lit candles or turned on their phone lights. In addition, Avenue of Stars, Shing Mun River in Shatin, Tuen Mun Park, Sai Ying Pun Station, Kwun Tong Promenade and Langham Place all featured events. Attendees held umbrellas with slogans, and formed chains by holding hands together. 3500 police officers were stationed at various checkpoints. At around 9:00 pm, several people blocked roads near Langham Place in Mong Kok. The police stated that they were using traffic cones and fences to block multiple streets. People were arrested by the police who sprayed pepper spray. After the event, the pro-Beijing camp accused Lee Cheuk-yan of encouraging unlawful assembly and unlawful behaviour. Pro-Beijing citizens further urged the Hong Kong Police Force to arrest Lee Cheuk-yan and Jimmy Lai for participating in unlawful assembly, and alleged that the two had disobeyed social distancing measures during the vigil. On 4 June 2020, the National Anthem Bill passed its third reading, with 41 legislators in favor of it and 1 against. 41 out of 42 pro-establishment legislators voted in favor of it, except the chairperson Andrew Leung who abstained. 1 out of 23 pan-democracy legislators voted against it, with the others abstaining, in protest. Before the voting, pan-democracy legislators Raymond Chan and Eddie Chu splashed a jar of reeking liquid in front of the rostrum in protest, accusing Andrew Leung of being a ‚Äúrubber stamp‚Äù and that what he did will ‚Äúreek for ten thousand years‚Äù. = 5 June = International response: USA  In accordance to the restrictions and sanctions placed on China and Hong Kong by the United States, Republican senator Pat Toomey urged the United States government to implement the sanctions as soon as possible. In a meeting, he stated that both Republicans and Democrats hoped to implement the restrictions quickly, so as to sanction those Chinese authorities and bank officials from spoiling Hong Kong's original autonomy. In a joint statement with Democrat Chris Van Hollen, he argued that those authorities responsible for implementing the National Security Law should have their assets frozen.  International response: Russia  Director of the Information and Press Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation Maria Zakharova stated that Russia treated the national security law as 'internal affairs' of China, and Britain and the United States should not interfere. In a press conference on 5 June, China Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang stated that China appreciated Russia's stance. He also expressed that this facilitated the friendly relationship between China and Russia, and that it was well-received within the international community.https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/xwfw_665399/s2510_665401/2511_665403/t1786290.shtml  International response: UK  After HSBC backed the national security law proposed by Beijing in a petition, Alistair Carmichael, chairman of the U.K. parliamentary group on Hong Kong, referred to the petition signed by the London-based bank's top executive in Asia, Peter Wong, in support of a move that critics say will diminish the city's freedom and autonomy. The British government is opposing the proposed law, with Prime Minister Boris Johnson saying he will give as many as three million residents of his nation's former colony the chance to seek refuge in the U.K. if China presses ahead. Member of Parliament Jacob Rees-Mogg criticized the bank of being pro-China instead of being pro-Britain, even though it was funded by the British. He publicly requested the bank to stop supporting the national security law. Former Governor of Hong Kong Chris Patten criticized China for exerting pressure on foreign companies through the threat of withholding business opportunities. He advised the United States to unite with other democratic countries to counter \\"underhanded tactics\\" by Beijing.  Private prosecution brought against taxi driver who rammed into a crowd  Pro-democracy legislator Ted Hui accused a taxi driver of driving towards a crowd during a protest in a private prosecution. It was the first private prosecution case which was allowed by the Court since the start of the large-scale protests in June 2019. Hui had initiated the proceedings in February 2020 after the Department of Justice had taken no legal action. Hui stated that this case could uphold justice to the victims of the car crash.  Progress of public prosecutions related to arrestees at anti-extradition protests  A Hong Kong Institute of Vocational Education student accused of owning a petrol bomb was sentenced to one year in jail. Another case which had gained notable attention in Hong Kong has begun on 11 May. Tong Wai-hung and To Yee-lan were arrested and charged of rioting in Sheung Wan on 28 July 2019 and had pleaded not guilty. In court today they claimed that the police officer who has arrested them had not given them a police caution warning. When asked by the defense, she stated that she had forgiven all the formal procedures she had learnt in the Police Academy.  Other developments  In an editorial published by Ta Kung Pao, a pro- China newspaper, pro-China commentator Wut Wing-yin voiced out support for the national security law. She stated that the Chinese Communist Party has granted Hong Kong 23 years of autonomy and freedom since the handover in 1997, yet the 'resistance' has retaliated with disobedience, rioting and damage. The national security law would be used to tackle those who intend to commit illegal crimes and participate in 'riots'. She advised general citizens of Hong Kong not to worry about its implications. She criticized the pro- democracy party of \\"instilling fear,\\" generating negative attitudes and reviews towards the law. According to information published on a Hong Kong government website, the Home Affairs Bureau said that the plan of 17 District Councils to hold a Joint Special Meeting on 6 June to discuss the National People's Congress decision on national security legislation was a violation of the District Councils Ordinance, which limited the functions of the District Councils to district related affairs. Later on 9 June, Kowloon City District Council Vice-Chair Kwong Po-yin rejected this criticism by saying that the Councillors had a \\"duty\\" to voice the concerns of citizens about the impact of the national security law on future generations \\"to the SAR government, the Chinese government and the world\\". Luo Huining, Director of the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in Hong Kong, insisted that the law should be dealt strictly so as to 'protect the legal rights and freedom of the majority of Hong Kong citizens'. Patrick Nip, Secretary for the Civil Service visited the Police Headquarters. Among the purposes of his visit was to meet those who had been injured in the protest movement over the past year.https://www.news.gov.hk/eng/2020/06/20200605/20200605_182316_926.html Nip stated that the national security law was the crucial step for One Country, Two Systems to succeed. Two days later in a press interview he urged civil servants working for the government to support the national security law. He said, while dealing with national security issues, there should only be the concept of 'one country', and not 'two systems'. In addition, he expressed that the sense of identity was not strong among civil servants. He agreed that there should be enhanced communication with the Greater Bay Area and to develop programs to enhance the sense of identity among civil servants. = 6 June = In a 1.5 hour phone call with China's paramount leader Xi Jinping, President of France Emmanuel Macron expressed that he supported the 'One China, Two Systems' concept that China uses to govern Hong Kong. He stated that France was closely following the situation in Hong Kong. Jeremy Tam, pro- democracy member of the Legislative Council, reported that he was followed by an unknown man speaking Cantonese with Chinese accents after leaving the Legislative Council in Wan Chai. They reportedly took pictures of him and followed him. When asked about his identity, the unknown man denied that he was a police officer. When Tam insisted on calling the police, the man suddenly ran towards the opposite direction. Tam stated that he has been followed since late May and has filed a police report. Tam expressed that 'Hong Kong has not been a totally safe place' after such incidents. He also claimed that if they were Chinese police, they could have abducted him on a car. Fellow pro-democracy Legislative Council member Alvin Yeung stated that society has been instilled with fear and terror. It has troubled politicians, social activists as well as commoners. Pro-democracy political party Hong Kong Civic Party executive member Cheng Tat-hung, also a member of the Eastern District Council, issued an official statement calling this incident 'totally unacceptable', and that it should be condemned. At a press conference, Lee Cheuk-yan, pro-democracy member of the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements of China, called for fundraising events for a virtual '4 June Museum of Memory and Human Rights', to permanently preserve historical archives and relics of victims of the protests on Tienanmen Square protests of 1989. Lee stressed the urgency to start such a project in view of the impending national security law and possible suppression of the Alliance's activities. Pro-China activist Man Shek and 2 other pro-China activists went to the British Council to protest against Dominic Raab's policies towards Hong Kong. They presented a joint statement and held the Chinese flag. In addition, they ripped and destroyed their BNOs and criticized the British government of failing to consult Hong Kong citizens before introducing policies relating to the national security law. In a meeting with pro-Beijing political group Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong on June 6, Commissioner of Police Chris Tang blamed the pro-democracy protests for the increase in robberies in the past year. The statistics he mentioned included 1) \\"crime rate\\" of 10-15 year-olds increased by about 80%, and 2) that of 16-20 year-olds increased by 120% from the year before. He also stated that last year over 4900 youths were arrested. He criticized netizens of encouraging citizens to participate in unlawful assembly, which also defied social distancing measures. It is worth noting that the number of arrests is different from number of convictions, as Hong Kong's legal system presumed one's innocence before proven guilty. Hong Kong government has spent millions of tax-payers money to denounce the year-long pro-democracy movement and is intended to increase public relation budget in 2020-2021 budget by about 20%, according to a budget proposal sent to the Legislative Council. For example, a 30-second advertisement produced by the Hong Kong Government warning citizens not to participate in illegal activities and violence cost HK$499,000 to produce. While some newspapers criticized the government of wasting public resources, others believed that the government should spend more. Secretary of Education Kevin Yeung stated that if students and teachers insulted the national anthem, schools could call the police. = 7 June = In an interview broadcast in the TVB news programme On the Record, pro-democracy veteran Martin Lee expressed his view that the only legislative body legally allowed to pass any laws and legislation in Hong Kong was the Hong Kong Legislative Council (LegCo). He considered the central government's bypassing of the LegCo in spite of having a majority in it, and directly mandating the security law, as a breach of the Hong Kong Basic Law. = 9 June = Japan, part of G7, expressed its concern over Hong Kong protests and arrests. A year ago over a million Hong Kong citizens took to the street protesting against the Hong Kong government's refusal to yield to citizens' demand to scrap the pro-Beijing extradition law. One year later Carrie Lam said in a press conference that \\"everyone has to learn a lesson. The SAR government has to learn a lesson, I hope each and every lawmaker will learn a lesson too.\\" The one-year anniversary memorials were characterized by grassroots, flash-mob pro- democracy events \\"Lunch With You\\", a type of protest that had been repeatedly seen over the past months. The rallies of that day took place in Wai Chai, Central, Tai Koo, San Po Kong, Kwai Chung, Kwun Tong, and Kowloon Bay. Hundreds of peaceful protesters, students and elders included, showed up with signs and sang the protest anthem \\"Glory to Hong Kong\\". In all, police claimed that they made 53 arrests. = 10 June = Reporters Without Borders (RSF) urged the Hong Kong government to drop the \\"riot\\" charge against the two journalists who were at the scene on 1 July 2019 covering the protest inside Hong Kong Legislative Council building. The two journalists were charged on 10 June 2020, almost a whole year after the live news coverage. RSF's East Asia bureau head C√©dric Alviani asked the Hong Kong Secretary for Justice to \\"immediately drop the absurd rioting charge.‚Äù One prominent policy proposed by the national security law was to enforce supervision and monitoring of schools and schoolchildren. Previously wrote about the danger of silencing schoolchildren and \\"brainwashing\\" them using fear of the new national security law in a Stand News article, today in an interview with NowTV, Ip Kin-yuen, pro-democracy member of the legislative council representing the education sector, continued to stress that the government, by supporting the law, was attempting to stop students from voicing out support for the movement. He said that schools were starting to have follow-up actions regarding students who participated in social movements such as 'Sing with You' and slogan-calling. Hong Kong's Secretary of Security Lee stated in an exclusive interview with South China Morning Post that Hong Kong Police is ready to enforce the not- yet-enacted National Security Law. At the time of the interview, the draft of the law had not been made public. = 11 June = Six-Monthly Report on Hong Kong  The UK released its regular Six-Monthly Report on Hong Kong documenting situations in Hong Kong from 1 July to 31 December 2019. When presenting this report British's foreign minister Dominic Raab stressed that the resolution to the Hong Kong pro-democracy protest must be done from within (the legislative procedures of) Hong Kong, and cannot be imposed by mainland China. He urged China to reconsider.  International response: Germany  In a phone call to Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang, Angela Merkel discussed the situation in Hong Kong along with other economic and business topics. The foreign policy expert for Merkel's conservatives, Roderich Kiesewetter, urged China to respect Hong Kong's autonomous status.  Progress of court cases  Four pro-democracy leaders, Jimmy Lai, Lee Cheuk-yan, Richard Tsoi, Albert Ho and 9 others were charged for inciting others to defy a police ban and gather in Victoria Park on 4 June. They received a call from police, informing them of the court summons. The alliance has been organising the vigil for 30 years, but the police issued an objection letter to the event this year, citing the prohibition on group gatherings of more than eight amid the COVID-19 pandemic. A taxi-driver who drove his taxi and attempted to ram into crowds of protesters in October last year resulting in multiple injuries had still not been arrested or prosecuted by the police. As a result, pro- democracy politician Ted Hui has filed a private prosecution against the taxi- driver and has been approved by the court.  Other developments  Secretary for Education Kevin Yeung issued a statement to all the principals of schools and education institutions of Hong Kong. He stated that, the bureau opposes any form of class boycotts as it was considered a case of poor discipline. The board would closely follow-up if any schools violated this principle. He stated that, the anthem of the protest, Glory to Hong Kong, was \\"clearly propaganda\\" and that it should be banned in schools. However, those which were related to the Basic Law would not be considered with political influence, as it was part of 'moral education' for students. Yeung stated that another popular song in the protests, Do You Hear the People Sing? from the musical Les Miserables, would be allowed in principle, but that the situation and intent would be taken into account. Teachers would be provided with material for teaching the security law, as well as accompanying training in how to use it. At a media session, Secretary for Security John Lee stated that the Hong Kong government would begin explaining the national security law once it was promulgated. He expressed confidence that the Hong Kong police would be quickly able to develop their skills and experience to discharge their function effectively. He said that police did have some prior experience in security matters, in particular through its actions against one Hong Kong independence society. The videoconferencing platform Zoom admitted that it had shut down the accounts of Hong Kong based human rights activist Lee Cheuk-yan and US-based activist Zhou Fengsuo, and twice shut down a Zoom event hosted by US-based activist Wang Dan, under pressure from the mainland government. The relevant Zoom meetings of the three human rights activists had been about the preparation of the anniversary and, in the case of Wang, the commemoration of the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, in which Zhou and Wang had taken part. In a statement, Zoom said that it would create ways to block, if requested to do so by authorities, participants of Zoom calls who are based in mainland China, but would not allow to let such requests affect participants from outside China where the same activity is legal. = 12 June = The day marked the one year anniversary of occupying LegCo in Admiralty that successfully stopped the second reading of the Fugitive Offenders amendment bill. Hong Kong citizens, in this one year memorial, continued to come out in droves to show solidarity against the government and demand the riot charge to be removed in addition to denouncing police brutality. The original mass protest plan was scrapped as police, using the pandemic as a reason, declined to grant a \\"letter of no objection\\" (LONO). In addition, police declared that there would be heavy armed forces in Central to prevent any citizens from unlawful gatherings. As a result, the mass protest turned into a more localized commemorative event throughout Hong Kong. Rallies and gatherings occurred in Causeway Bay, Mongkok, Tsim Sha Tsu, Sha Tin, Yuen Long, Tuen Mun, and Tseun Wan. Throughout the day, police detained dozens of pro-democracy protesters as crowds gathered to mark the anniversary of the start of the protests. and by the end of the day, police claimed that 43 individuals were arrested in Causeway Bay and Mong Kok, allegedly charged with unlawful gathering, among them several district representatives that had been elected in November 2019. One noticeable event was a pro-Beijing politician Kwong Sing-yu, who was arrested for wounding and attacking chanting citizens and an Epoch Times journalist in Kwun Tong. Secretary for Security John Lee stated that police officers would be given the authority to enforce the national security law as soon as possible after its implementation in Hong Kong. On the anniversary of 12/6, protest activities sprung out all across Hong Kong. Riot police was on standby at different districts and conducted stop and searches of pedestrians. Ted Hui, pro- democracy activist, was arrested due to unlawful assembly. Hundreds of students from Heung To Middle School in Kowloon Tong formed a human chain around the school in support of the school's music teacher. The teacher's contract was not renewed allegedly due to his failure to prevent his students from performing Glory to Hong Kong in a music test. At night, a riot police officer shouted, in what seemed to be mockery of the United States over the George Floyd protests and police brutality, slogans such as Black Lives Matter, I can't breathe towards the camera of a foreign journalist at the protest site. The video went viral after 'BeWater HK' uploaded it on Facebook. Pro-democracy politicians condemned the conduct and actions of the police as 'unprofessional, unethical' and that their attitude was generally poor and disrespectful. According to the police, the police officer concerned was reprimanded for unprofessional conduct. = 14 June = Legal scholar Johannes Chan of the University of Hong Kong said that the proposed security legislation had to be set out in detail, to avoid it being used to stifle dissent, and that waving flags and chanting slogans should not be prohibited under the law as these activities did not amount to \\"action\\". He said it was \\"highly undesirable\\" that, unlike in Hong Kong, laws were drafted in China in a \\"rather vague manner and general manner\\", leaving it to the government to fill it with content. Placed late at night on Beacon Hill top and seen in the early morning of June 15, a 25-meter vertical protest banner with black fabric and white font criticized the state of Hong Kong as \\"One Country One System Hong Kong Game Over\\" („Äå‰∏ÄÂúã‰∏ÄÂà∂È¶ôÊ∏ØÁé©ÂÆå„Äç). = 15 June = One-year memorial vigil for Marco Leung  One year ago on this day, Chief Executive Carrie Lam had declared that the anti-extradition law would be indefinitely suspended. The day also marked the one-year anniversary of the suicide of Marco Leung Ling-kit, which was linked to the anti-extradition protest; at the time of his fatal fall, Leung had worn a yellow raincoat with words written on the back that were seen as protest against Lam's decision not to withdraw the bill completely. Tens of thousands of Hong Kong citizens gathered in Admiralty to pay tribute and respect to the first death since the protest began. Hundreds more people gathered locally in Tuen Mun, Causeway Bay, and Tin Shui Wai. The crowd laid flowers and paid their tributes to Leung. Riot officers stopped and searched some people clad in black and a man dressed in a yellow raincoat.  Hong Kong protest art wins Prix Ars Electronica  Over the year, there have been thousands of various arts, flyers, stickers, and slogans in various forms such as songs, memes, posters, created by thousands of Hong Kong citizens, young and old, supporting the pro-democracy protest in Hong Kong. Everyone of them, as credited by the editors as \\"all Hong Kong protesters involved in the struggle to safeguard democracy\\", is the winner of this year's Prix Ars Electronica 2020's \\"Golden Nica\\" award in the \\"Digital Communities\\" category. Termed the \\"Oscar\\" and the \\"World's Most Time-Honored\\" of media arts, Ars Electronica Festival has been celebrating and recognizing media art since 1987. The title of the winning submission is called \\"Be Water by Hong Kongers\\", submitted by Eric Siu & Joel Kwong. In a Stand News interview, Eric and Joel emphasized that they are just the \\"messengers\\", sending Hong Kong talent and creativity to the world. They wanted Hong Kong people to know that the world is watching and supporting them regardless of the eventual end (of the protest).  International responses  In Vancouver, Canada, numerous Canadians wearing black shirts raised yellow umbrellas and held high 'HK' signs in a peaceful rally in support of Hong Kong protests. In Berlin, Germany, peaceful protesters brought flowers and a coffin draped with a black HK flag, signifying that freedom and autonomy of Hong Kong had died. They also raised a banner which stated 'Germany stands with Hong Kong'. In Halifax, Canda, protesters raised banners and signs showing 'Stand with Hong Kong' to voice out support for the movement. In May, US House of Representatives' Republicans formed the 'China Task Force' which analyses and collects data and information from China that poses as a threat towards the US, from aspects such as national security, economy, technology, competitiveness and awareness. They also proposed a law to sanction and punish technology theft targeting the US. This week, in response to the escalating tension with China, US legislators proposed the \\"Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors (CHIPS) for America Act\\" that hope to fund more technology research and development and wane the Chinese dependency. European Union parliament called for a \\"joint motion for a resolution\\" to defend Hong Kong's autonomy and freedom. There are 24 points on this motion ranging from demanding that \\"international community must work together closely to put pressure on Beijing to ensure that its actions are in line with the country‚Äôs international commitments under the 1984 Sino-British Declaration\\" to the \\"commemoration of the Tiananmen massacre not only in Hong Kong, but also in the whole territory of the PRC\\".  Other developments  A survey by Breakthrough Limited interviewed Hong Kong citizens regarding their views about the protests. 75% of those interviewed stated that they felt sad and upset, and 95% said that they felt the pain and despair. 94% teenagers stated that they would contribute towards the betterment of Hong Kong. It reflected that teenagers, in general, had emotional problem relating to this matter. 70% of those interviewed stated that the cause of the protest was based on decreasing amounts of freedom, democracy and human rights. Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office deputy director Deng Zhonghua stated that under the proposed national security law, Beijing should retain jurisdiction under 'very special' circumstances. He said that, when national security has been severely threatened, the central government would always have the right to retain jurisdiction. He added that the arrangement would not undermine the independent judicial power and the final adjudication power of the SAR enshrined in the Basic Law. = 16 June = In a jointly issued letter,https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/media_2020/06/200616%20NPCSC%20joint%20letter_EN.pdf letter 86 international civil and social organizations made a representation to Chairman of the National People's Committee Li Zhanshu emphasizing the urgent need for China to preserve Hong Kong's freedom. The day marked the one year anniversary of the record-breaking 2-million march opposing the extradition bill. Chief Executive of Hong Kong Carrie Lam accused the opposition of 'demonizing' the national security law. = 17 June = International responses  A rare high-level talk between top Chinese diplomat Yang Jiechi and US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo took place in Hawaii on 17 June. A senior State Department official said before the session, which lasted for seven hours and covered a wide range of topics, that Pompeo wanted to remind Beijing about its commitments to Hong Kong. Yang told his counterpart to \\"stop meddling in Hong Kong's affairs\\". UK foreign secretary Dominic Raab condemned the HSBC for voicing out support for the national security law. He stated that the law would violate the Sino-British Joint Declaration and that it would diminish Hong Kong's status, freedom and autonomy. He urged Beijing to revoke the law. In a statement released on 17 June, G7 countries condemned the national security law and urged Beijing to revoke the law. On 18 June, Chinese spokesman Zhao Lijian condemned these proposals, calling them an interference to the 'internal affairs' of China.  Other developments  Tam Yiu-chung, pro-Beijing politician, said that the CPC had never stated that all of the cases which would be related to the national security law would be held trial in Hong Kong; rather, extradition of the arrested to China for trial was possible. Pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong saw Tam's statements as the end of the 'One Country, Two Systems' framework and of judicial independence. James Tien, member of a pro-Beijing party but claimed to be a \\"moderate\\", stated that most people in Hong Kong disapproved of the national security law, and that the Hong Kong government had not eased their minds by raising the possibility that it may not adhere to the principles of common law. He said that he nevertheless hoped that Hong Kongers would eventually accept the law. After the protest movements, a lot of teachers were deterred to present their political opinions. According to a survey by Hong Kong Professional Teachers' Union, 80% of those teachers interviewed said that they were worried parents would make complaints based on political bias. 60% of them avoided participating in demonstrations and rallies. The union stressed that the personal freedom and rights of teachers had already diminished. Education Bureau advised secondary schools to provide counselling towards students and schoolmates who had been arrested in the protest movement. The bureau stated that the school should provide follow-up measures and assistance so as to implement positive values in the mindsets of the schoolchildren so that they would not break the law again. The private prosecution filed by pro-democracy politician Ted Hui to prosecute the police officer of shooting a protester in the 11/11 protests in Sai Wan Ho has begun and court date has been set to August 31. Kwan Kar-wing, a police officer, raised a handgun and fired shots towards an unarmed protester at a Sai Wan Ho junction. This incident marked the second event in the Protest movement involving protesters shot by police. Responding to this first case of private prosecution by citizen against police (and police brutality), Secretary for Justice Teresa Cheng said that it is her duty to intervene and stop private prosecutions that run against public interest or those brought by improper motives. The 32nd annual IMD World Competitiveness (2020) report was released on June 17. Amid year-long citizen protests and dissatisfaction of Hong Kong government, Hong Kong's competitiveness rank fifth, falling from second place last year. According to Hong Kong's ICAC website, one ranking criterion worth noting is that Hong Kong's \\"bribery and corruption\\" within the \\"Government Efficiency\\" category is ranked 12th. A 30-meter black-with-white font vertical protest banner written in English \\"HK Can't Breathe\\" was found on Beacon Hill. This phrase alluded to the death of George Floyd in the United State that caused a months-long protest against police brutality in the US but is used here to mirror similar police tactics used on protesters. = 18 June = UK condemned China's decision to propose the national security law. Politicians urged the Chinese government to respect the judiciary, human rights and organisations in Hong Kong, and to ensure the high level of autonomy and freedom of Hong Kong. However, China retaliated, saying that the UK has been interfering and meddling in internal affairs in China, and that the national security law was proposed in order to uphold national security and to fix the loopholes in the existing system. = 19 June = International responses  The European Parliament voted regarding matters of the National Security Law. In the voting session, 565 voted 'for' bringing the CPC to the International Criminal Court in The Hague, while 34 voted 'against'. Members stated that the law would diminish Hong Kong's autonomy, rule of law and freedom. Some members also urged the EU to sanction respective Chinese officials in accordance to their responsibilities over the security law. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that he would be 'closely monitoring' the 2020 Legislative Council Election in Hong Kong as he participated in the Virtual Copenhagen Democracy Summit. He said that the US was making impending decisions on further consequences and legal responsibilities to those who intended to diminish Hong Kong's freedom. President of Taiwan Tsai Ing-wen voiced out support towards Hong Kong protesters. She stated that Taiwan would continue providing humanitarian assistance towards those who are in need of help. The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet stressed that UN will closely monitor China's National Security Law and its impact on Hong Kong's human rights. She stated that the law must be clear in scope and definition.  Other developments  State-run China Daily published statements made by past Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority Joseph Yam in a television interview aired on 19 June. Yam stated that the national security law for Hong Kong would not affect Hong Kong financial markets, citing as one reason the seven-day rally of the Hang Seng index in June. He stated that it would be a chance to finally end the \\"social unrest\\" in Hong Kong. In addition, he also expressed that the US restrictions towards Hong Kong would be ineffective. As reported by the Standard, citing Xinhua News Agency as its source, the wording of one of the offences punishable under the security law had been changed in the most recent draft. In a resolution of the National People's Congress from 28 May, the final paragraph had made \\"activities of foreign and external forces to interfere in the affairs of the SAR\\" a punishable offence, while in Xinhua's report this was changed to \\"collusion with foreign or external forces to endanger national security.\\" Tanya Chan, the convener of the pro-democratic camp, and Dennis Kwok expressed their concerns about the unclear limitations of the notion of 'collusion'. Kwok said that it was \\"ridiculous\\" if international business or academic exchanges could be regarded as criminal activities. He also said that the law was \\"really about silencing Hong Kong's opposition\\". Secretary of Justice Teresa Cheng refused to comment on the wording of the law as it had not been finalized, but said that everyone should \\"have peace of mind\\" as the law intended to \\"safeguard the long-term stability of Hong Kong as well as Hongkongers' legitimate rights\\". About 80 pupils of renowned local school Ying Wa College staged a peaceful assembly to pay their condolences to Marco Leung Ling-kit, who had committed suicide as a means of protest in June 2019 by falling from scaffolding. Some students sang the protest anthem, Glory to Hong Kong. The school promptly issued a statement to express that the school authority did not agree with the actions of the students. In the statement, the school said students were not allowed to organise human chain activities, to shout slogans or to sing songs with political influence. If similar actions were proposed again, there would be proper counselling and disciplinary actions. However, the Education Bureau expressed concerns that follow-up actions would be initiated. Raymond Yeung, a teacher at Diocesan Girls' School who taught liberal studies had not had his contract renewed by the school after he got shot in the eye during protests last year. He said that his teaching career at the school would end at 31 August. He did not instantly disagree with the results, as he considered his eye injury would lead to his ability to correct assignments to decrease and to diminish his teaching quality which he expected. He agreed that his participation in the social movement would increase awareness by the media. For the time being, he would write books which is related to his personal accounts of the protest. He has taught at the school for 4 years. = 20 June = A poll organized by thirty labour unions including those representing public sector staff, aiming to call for a citywide work strike to halt the national security law legislation, failed as only 8,943 ballots were cast while 60,000 would have been needed. A class boycott for students would also not go ahead, due to failing to collect enough physical votes. Previously on 7 June, a government spokesperson had indirectly referred to the referendum as \\"meaningless activities\\" and that related efforts had, in part, been \\"intentionally misleading or inciting students\\". = 21 June = According to a statement of Tam Yiu-chung to media, legal consequences relating to the National Security Law would be approximately 3 years for minor incidents, 5 to 10 years for others, which was similar to Hong Kong's criminal law. He further said that it was unlikely that the new law would be applied retroactively.  International response: Japan  According to the Financial Times, Tokyo seeks to lure professional talent and business opportunities to boost Tokyo's competitiveness in East Asia. Japan could use this opportunity to make Tokyo a valid rival to Hong Kong as Hong Kong had been involved in protest incidents throughout the year. Japan is considering visa waivers, tax advice and free office space for asset managers, traders and bankers from Hong Kong in a campaign to cast Tokyo as the best exit strategy should a crisis force them out of the semi-autonomous territory. = 22 June = European Union response  In the EU-China Summit, European Union warned China that it considered the proposed security law to be a breach of Beijing's international commitments. European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen and European Council chief Charles Michel told Paramount leader Xi Jinping and Premier Li Keqiang of their \\"grave concern\\" over the new law.  Vertical protest banner unfurled on Lion Rock  A 30 meter black- with-white-font vertical protest banner found unfurled on Lion Rock called for Hong Kong citizens to \\"Fight Against Diabolical Law: Head To the Street On July 1\\" („Äå‰∏É‰∏Ä‰∏äË°óÊäóÊÉ°Ê≥ï„Äç). = 23 June = European Union response  European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen and European Council chief Charles Michel expressed their \\"grave concern\\" over China's new national security law that will soon enacted in Hong Kong, which critics say will hurt Hong Kong's autonomy and freedoms.  Progress of court cases  Lau Ka- tung, a social worker who had blocked police from advancing in protests in Yuen Long that occurred on 27 July 2019, had been sentenced to prison for one year for obstructing police while performing their duties. Numerous pro- democracy organisations protested outside the Lai Chi Kok Reception Centre. One hundred citizens participated. Participants criticized the judiciary on the sentencing, stating that Lau was merely providing humanitarian assistance. After one week of jail time, he objected successfully and the High Court eventually reverted the lower court decision and set bail to $10,000 HKD pending appeal. Seven people were charged with rioting by the police for their involvement in the 2019 Prince Edwards station attack on 31 August 2019.  Other developments  It has been reported that the Chief Executive (CE) Carrie Lam is to hand-pick suitable judges for conducting national security law cases and violations. In response, former Chief Justice of Hong Kong Andrew Li warned of such actions 'undermining' the judicial independence of Hong Kong in a South China Morning Post opinion piece. He stressed that the CE of Hong Kong had no professional expertise, ability or experience to pick judges, and that the draft of the law still has not been released to the public is \\"unfortunate\\". To further express concerns of the power granted to the CE by the national security law, Hong Kong Bar Association published a statement stating that Article 88 of the Basic Law does not allow the executive arm of the Government to \\"on its own assign or designate any particular type of cases to be adjudicated or tried by specific judge\\", stressing that such move would \\"undermine judicial independence\\". Several days later in a radio talk show, Holden Chow, a pro-Beijing lawyer, criticized the Bar Association statement, and commented that they were causing a 'false' image towards citizens. = 24 June = The United States issued a report on anti-terrorism on 24 June. The report stated that there were no terrorist activities in Hong Kong, and condemned the Hong Kong government of labelling some pro-democracy protests as terrorism. Following the criticism of the national security law, a third group of lawyers and judges voiced their concerns. The usually conservative Law Society of Hong Kong condemned the national security law and issued a statement, stressing that the judicial process relating to the national security law would undermine judicial independence in Hong Kong. Members of the society criticized that it would lead to major suspicions on whether basic human rights such as right to a fair trial can be sustained. The society hoped that the government could assert the queries as soon as possible. In addition, they also remarked that if stakeholders from all sectors of society could be consulted in the drafting process, it would enhance confidence among the public, and it would not violate the Basic Law as well as the one country, two systems principle. Beijing officials met with 120 pro-establishment politicians to collect views and suggestions on the national security law, being the first time that Hong Kong politicians were consulted in Hong Kong by the CPC. The forum was hosted by Zhang Xiaoming, deputy director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, and Zhang Yong, vice chairman of the Basic Law Committee. Pro-Beijing scholar Albert Chen and chairman of the Independent Police Complaints Council Anthony Neoh were also present. = 25 June = International response: USA  The United States Senate unanimously passed a bill sanctioning China over its political interference of Hong Kong democracy and freedom. The bipartisan bill, called \\"Hong Kong Autonomy Act\\",will \\"impose mandatory sanctions on entities that violate China's obligations to Hong Kong under the Joint Declaration and the Basic Law. The legislation would also impose mandatory secondary sanctions on banks that do business with the entities in violation of the Basic Law.\\"  Progress of court cases  A stage technician, Yiu Siu-Hong, was sentenced to four years of prison by District Judge Amanda Woodcock, for attempting to throw a Molotov cocktail in Tseung Kwan O in October 2019. Woodcock ruled that Yiu, who had a second bottle with flammable liquid, as well as items commonly used by the protesters in his rucksack when he was arrested, had to be regarded as a common criminal rather than protester. Yiu had earlier pleaded guilty to two charges, which was a reason for the judge to order the sentences to be served concurrently, and to further reduce the resulting sentence. The court earlier heard that Yiu's mother had succumbed to lung cancer in late May.  Other developments  Pro-China politician Elsie Leung stated that Beijing decided not to disclose the full text of the national security law as it aimed to prevent further 'unrest' and delays to the legislation. She said in a RTHK program on June 25 that making the bill public \\"may cause demonstrations and strong opposition against the law.\\" She further stressed that Beijing does not want to see social unrest or vandalism in Hong Kong. She also dismissed fears law drafters might not have taken public opinion into consideration. Leung said that it was highly likely that it could be implemented by the end of June, and it would come in effect on 1 July. In the program LegCo Review, Leung emphasized that by calling out words and slogans such as 'Liberate' would violate the national security law as it was an 'act to separate the idea of one country, two systems.' She also defended plans for Carrie Lam to hand-pick judges to handle the national security law cases. According to a report by Apple Daily, it was revealed in a court hearing on the practices of members of the Hong Kong Police Force in the protests that the police force had changed some of its rules and regulations on 27 November 2019, without making any announcement to the public. They included: riot police and undercover police officers did not have to show their police identification materials instantly under specific circumstances; in a group of police, only the most senior officer showing police identification materials would be adequate and other police officers did not have to necessarily do so; and that riot police officers did not have to show their identification materials and code on their riot police uniforms. Netizens called for an assembly in IFC, in memory of those protesters and those who have been sentenced to jail. Around 20 citizens chanted slogans and sang \\"Glory to Hong Kong\\" in the assembly. They also wrote letters and words towards those in prison, encouraging them to pursue their dreams and ambitions. Some people also waved the British colonial Flag of Hong Kong (1959‚Äì1997). = 26 June = Call by former United Nations envoys, statement by UN OHCHR  Zeid Raad Al Hussein, the former United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, and eight former United Nations (UN) special envoys expressed deep concern about what they called a potential \\"humanitarian tragedy\\" caused by China pushing forward its National Security Law, and called on the UN to appoint a special envoy to monitor the situation in Hong Kong. As of 16 September, UN Secretary General Ant√≥nio Guterres had not responded to the letter. The UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights published a statement by 51 UN independent human rights experts which called on China to withdraw the draft national security law for Hong Kong. China objected and condemned the speculations as interference with internal affairs.  Yoho Mall conflict  At Yoho Mall in Yuen Long, at around 1:30 pm, dozens stood on different floors and chanted pro-democracy slogans after a man in the atrium displayed pro-democracy banners. Riot police entered the mall and set up cordons, but were unable to clear the mall from protesters, who continued to chant slogans. A Stand News reporter was pushed over by plainclothes officers. Police arrested 14 people for unlawful assembly, among them 9 men and 5 women, with their ages ranging from 14 to 55 years. A 12-year-old student reporter was taken away. Police used pepper spray during the last part of its operations, which hit Yuen Long District Councillor Lam Chun and Kalvin Ho, Vice-Chairman of the Hong Kong Association for Democracy and People's Livelihood. = 27 June = For the first time since its inception in 2003, the annual 1 July march was banned. In its official Letter of Objection to the Civil Human Rights Front (CHRF), police cited pandemic health concerns as well as risks due to \\"persisting social unrest\\". An appeal by the CHRF against the ban was rejected by Chief Secretary Matthew Cheung, as was a request for permission to hold a demonstration that was lodged by District Councillor Chui Chi-kin. = 28 June = Silent march against national security law  Dozens of citizens heeded online calls for an \\"Anti-National Security Law Silent March\\", in response to Sunday's National People's Congress Standing Committee's fast-tracking of the National Security Law that is expected to be passed in the next few days. The crowd gathered at Jordan MTR station. At about 3:00 pm, small groups started moving towards Mong Kok via Nathan Road, chanting pro-democracy slogans which included urging each other to come out again in protest on 1 July, the anniversary of the 1997 handover of Hong Kong to China. Early on, police issued warnings for unlawful assembly, but was unable to stop protesters from heading to Mong Kok as they slipped from Nathan Road into side streets. In Mong Kok, police checked the identities and searched the belongings of at least two groups of protesters numbering about 20 people in total. In the course of a dispersal operation in Mong Kok, a police officer briefly fired pepper spray at journalists. The shopping centre at Langham Place closed early for the day. After a lengthy confrontation in which police used tear gas, a total of 53 people, including 41 men and 12 women, were arrested in the Mong Kok area for \\"unlawful assembly\\". On their respective Facebook pages, district councillors Ben Lam Siu-pan of Yau Tsim Mong District, and Chui Chi-kin of Eastern District, stated that they were among the arrested. The protests began to die down at around 7:00 pm. A planned protest in Victoria Park which was to start at 3:00 p.m. failed to go ahead, with police patrolling the area around the park.  International response: Japan  The Yomiuri Shimbun (Japan News) reported that Japanese government was set to issue a statement expressing \\"regret\\" over China's national security law over Hong Kong when the law is enacted, increasing the severity from \\"grave concern\\" issued on 17 June and from \\"strong concern\\" on 25 May. With approximately 1400 companies operating in Hong Kong, Japan was concerned with the undermining of \\"Hong Kong‚Äôs high degree of autonomy based on ‚Äòone country, two systems‚Äô.\\"  Other developments  Pro Hong Kong Independence activist Wayne Ka-kui Chan confirmed over his Facebook page that he was no longer in Hong Kong, citing the looming National Security Law retribution. It had been speculated since early June that he had gone into exile in the Netherlands. = 29 June = International response: USA  The US State Department issued a statement that the US will end controlled defense exports to Hong Kong as a direct response to \\"Chinese Communist Party‚Äôs decision to eviscerate Hong Kong‚Äôs freedoms\\". The Commerce Department concurrently produced a statement declaring that the risk that sensitive U.S. technology would be diverted to the People‚Äôs Liberation Army or Ministry of State Security had increased, hence the \\"Commerce Department regulations allowing preferential treatment to Hong Kong over China, including the availability of export license exceptions, are [now] suspended\\".  One-year memorial vigil for Zhita Wu and Hiu-Yan Lo  A group of mourners gathered in Fanling to remember the death of Zhita Wu, an EduHK alumnus, and 21-year-old female EduHK student Hiu-Yan Lo. Both Wu and Lo left a dying wish supporting the pro-democracy protest before falling to their death. Lo's signed message, which was found on a wall at her death, had even listed out the five demands of the protesters. The vigil was organized by EduHK's Students' Union. Representatives from several universities, friends, and a EduHK's teaching staff presented flowers and paper cranes.  Other developments  The Hong Kong government awarded, after a month of searching, the \\"Relaunch Hong Kong\\" campaign to Consulum FZ LLC. The one-year, 6.2-million-USD campaign is aimed at presenting Hong Kong as an attractive location to \\"invest, do business, work, and live\\", and to \\"reconnect the city with global audiences\\" after the negative impacts that had been wreaked by the COVID-19 crisis. According to ProvokeMedia, Consulum's Hong Kong office was established on 15 May 2020, the deadline date required by the submission criteria to have a Hong Kong office. It was reported that several PR firms had ultimately declined the opportunity out of \\"geopolitical concerns\\", which appeared to be a veiled reference to the past year of protests in Hong Kong and in particular the impending national security legislation. = 30 June = Promulgation of National Security Law  At about 09:30, the Chinese National People's Congress unanimously passed the national security law for Hong Kong, bypassing Hong Kong legislative processes. Details of the law had never been published for Hong Kong public comments before the passage and while Beijing had been discussing the details of the law, only a few selected Hong Kong top officials had some knowledge of it. Hours later, Lam attended a virtual UN Human Rights meeting claiming that the national security law would not undermine Hong Kong autonomy. Approximately 14 hours after Beijing's passing of the national security law, Hong Kong government posted the entire law, for the first time, on its official website, at 23:00 on June 30. The law is said to be effectively immediately. Within 25 minutes, Hong Kong Police issued a statement (at 23:25 June 30) that it will sternly uphold the law and restore peace in Hong Kong (English version at 23:29).  International response: International Lifeboat Campaign  Various countries and joint nations have begun formulating their visa requirements for Hong Kong protesters and journalists seeking refuge and asylum. The participating countries include USA, Canada, EU, UK, Australia, New Zealand, and ASEAN countries. A call for such efforts was made on the same day by Hong Kong Watch through the launch of its International Lifeboat Campaign.  International response: UK  In an opinion piece title \\"China breached the Hong Kong Handover deal ‚Äì it‚Äôs time the UK acted like it\\", UK Parliament Member Jim Shannon of Northern Ireland wrote that \\"China has taken every opportunity to dismiss and disregard this vital Declaration\\" and that it is time for Britain to declare a breach of the Joint Declaration so further actions such as imposing Magnitsky-style sanctions on Hong Kong senior officials can have a more impactful outcome. Former Hong Kong governor Chris Patten led the condemnation of Beijing's national security law passage, along with 902 international signatories, citing that the law directly \\"breach of China‚Äôs commitments under the Sino- British Joint Declaration and the Hong Kong Government‚Äôs obligations as a signatory of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.\\"  International response: 27 Country Joint Statement  Speaking on behalf of 27 countries, UK's Ambassador to the WTO and UN Julian Braithwaite delivered a cross-regional joint statement in response to China's passing of the Hong Kong national security law. In the speech Braithwaite stressed that passing a law \\"without the direct participation of Hong Kong‚Äôs people, legislature or judiciary of Hong Kong undermines ‚ÄòOne Country, Two Systems‚Äô.\\" The list of countries supporting his statement are Australia, Austria, Belgium, Belize, Canada, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Iceland, Ireland, Germany, Japan, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Kingdom of the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Palau, Slovakia, Slovenia, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.  International response: Japan  On Tuesday Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga stated that China's enactment of national security law in Hong Kong was \\"regrettable\\" and that Hong Kong must maintain \\"its free and open system so that it can prosper in a democratic and stable way.\\"  International response: Taiwan  Taiwan government condemned the passage of the national security law. Taiwan Cabinet Spokesperson Evian Ting Yi-ming issued a press release stating that the law \\"severely impacts freedom, human rights, and the stable development of Hong Kong society.\\" He further warned Taiwanese citizens living in Hong Kong to beware of \\"possible risks\\".  International response: USA  US House of Representatives Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi issued a statement urging the US Government to \\"hold Chinese officials accountable for their abuses including in Hong Kong by deploying sanctions under the 2016 Magnitsky Act and by taking steps under the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, proudly passed by Congress. We must consider all tools available, including visa limitations and economic penalties.\\" Concurrently, USA's Federal Communication Commission (FCC) designated Chinese technology companies Huawei and ZTE as a \\"national security threat\\" and prohibited \\"money from the FCC‚Äôs $8.3 billion a year Universal Service Fund may no longer be used to purchase, obtain, maintain, improve, modify, or otherwise support any equipment or services produced or provided by these suppliers.\\"  Other developments  Within hours of the national security law passage in Beijing, Demosisto founders Joshua Wong, Nathan Law, Agnes Chow, and standing committee member Jeffrey Ngo withdrew from the organization. In a Twitter post, Wong cited concerns about the possibility of long imprisonment as one reason for his resignation, and vowed to continue the fight for pro-democracy ideals. In a Facebook post soon after, Demosisto declared that it had disbanded, advising its members to \\"use more flexible means to join in protests\\". Another pro-democracy organization that is being disbanded in Hong Kong within hours of the law passage is Hong Kong National Front. Their pro-Hong Kong independence fight against China will continue from their Taipei and England branch, according to the group's Facebook page.The Hong Kong Higher Institutes International Affairs Delegation (HKHIIAD) vice president Joey Siu announced her withdrawal from the organization and with continue \\"the journey of fighting for Hong Kong in personal capacity\\". Throughout the day various grassroots pro-freedom/pro-democracy events continue to take place all over Hong Kong: countless citizens lay flowers at MTR's Prince Edward Station for the 10-month memorial of the Prince Edward Station Attack Incident on August 31, 2019, a one minute of silence observed at 20:31 at all MTR stations, a \\"one year memorial\\" of Lo Hiu-Yan and Zhita Wu at Central's IFC, where Wu committed suicide, a \\"Lunch With You\\" in Central Landmark, a \\"Sing With You\\" took place in Kwun Tong APM mall.

It features vignettes of life in Rue Daguerre - a street in Paris, where the filmmaker lived. Varda was caring for her two-year-old son at the time of filming and could not spend long periods away from her home. Because of this, the entire film is confined within a radius of Varda's home - the length of the electric cables for her equipment. Most of those profiled come from places outside Paris, or even France. Over the course of the film, every subject is asked the same three questions: \\"Where did you come from?\\", \\"When did you get here?\\", \\"Why did you come?\\". The film's name is a complex pun: The street, Rue Daguerre, is named after Louis Daguerre, inventor of the Daguerreotypes method of photographic printing. During a voiceover in the film, Varda explains that the business owners and occupants of Rue Daguerre are her 'types', in reference to typologies both as the photographic style and practices of social classification that Varda was critical of.

A work of the sculptor Arturo Dazzi, it is dedicated to the physicist, inventor and senator Guglielmo Marconi.  History  The work was commissioned in 1939 by the Ministry of Popular Culture to the sculptor Arturo Dazzi from Carrara to decorate Piazza Imperiale ‚Äì which, according to the project of the 1942 World's fair of Rome, should have been located in the center of the newborn quarter ‚Äì and to commemorate the physicist and inventor Guglielmo Marconi (who had died 2 years earlier). With the entry of Italy into the World War II in 1940, the works were suddenly interrupted, even if Dazzi had already completed the first two registers, carved in high relief on Carrara marble. In 1951 work resumed, despite the intention of the Ministry of Public Works, chaired by Salvatore Aldisio, to demolish the structure. In 1953, on the occasion of an Agricultural Exhibition held in EUR, the sculptor refused to cover the reinforced concrete structure with temporary panels of gesso and, after having requested some funding in view of the 1960 Summer Olympics, the monument was concluded and inaugurated on 12 December 1959.  Description  The structure of the obelisk has the shape of a truncated pyramid and is made up of reinforced concrete covered with 92 slabs of Carrara marble, on which the high reliefs, arranged in 4 rows, are engraved.

It is a structure made in the tree canopy by the ants that is filled with debris and other organic matter in which epiphytes grow. The ants benefit from this arrangement by having a stable framework on which to build their nest while the plants benefit by obtaining nutrients from the soil and from the moisture retained there. Description Epiphytes are common in tropical rain forest and in cloud forest. An epiphyte normally derives its moisture and nutrients from the air, rain, mist and dew. Nitrogenous matter is in short supply and the epiphytes benefit significantly from the nutrients in the ant garden. The ant garden is made from \\"carton\\", a mixture of vegetable fibres, leaf debris, refuse, glandular secretions and ant faeces. The ants use this material to build their nests among the branches of the trees, to shelter the hemipteran insects that they tend in order to feed on their honeydew, and to make the pockets of material in which the epiphytes grow. The ants harvest seeds from the epiphytic plants and deposit them in the carton material. The plants have evolved various traits to encourage ants to disperse their seeds by producing chemical attractants. Eleven unrelated epiphytes that grow in ant gardens have been found to contain methyl salicylate (oil of wintergreen) and it seems likely that this compound is an ant attractant. Examples Species of ant that make gardens include Crematogaster carinata, Camponotus femoratus and Solenopsis parabioticus, all of which are parabiotic species which routinely share their nests with unrelated species of ant. Epiphytic plants that they grow include various members of the Araceae, Bromeliaceae, Cactaceae, Gesneriaceae, Moraceae, Piperaceae and Solanaceae. Epiphytic plants in the genus Codonanthe grow almost exclusively in ant gardens. The ant Camponotus irritabilis not only plants the seeds of Hoya elliptica in planned locations on its carton nest but also prunes the roots to accommodate its nest chambers and fertilises the areas where it wants extra plant growth to occur.

History In 1973, Saint Michael's College signed on WWPV-FM 88.7, originally a 10-watt outlet broadcasting from the Sloan Fine Arts Center on campus. WWPV-FM was the successor to WSSE, a carrier current outlet that had been established in the 1950s. It operated from the North Campus until moving to St. Edmund's Hall in 1988. Vermont Public Radio, the state's public broadcaster, had expressed interest as early as 2007 in acquiring WWPV-FM to obtain a second FM frequency for classical music. When word of a potential buyout circulated, it prompted students and the community to rally, and the college ruled out a sale. On February 12, 2014, Saint Michael's College was granted a construction permit for a low- power FM station on 92.5 FM in Colchester. Under Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulations, the college was required to divest its existing 88.7 FM facility upon constructing the new station; on April 8, 2015, it agreed to donate the WWPV-FM license to Vermont Public Radio.

As a place of pilgrimage, it belongs to the Blieskastel Monastery, built in 1929, and is visited by around 80,000 pilgrims annually. The chapel was built as a place of veneration for a relic of the True Cross, but today it is closely related to the 14th century Piet√† \\"Our Lady with the Arrows\\". In the list of monuments of the Saarland, the chapel is listed as an individual monument within the ensemble of the monastery complex \\"Auf dem Han\\".  History  The present chapel, which replaced a smaller previous building, was probably built between 1682 and 1683 according to plans by Thomas Gampfer or \\"Camper\\".Erbauung der Kreuzkapelle www.wallfahrtskloster-blieskastel.de.Das Wallfahrtskloster und die Heilig- Kreuz-Kapelle www.blieskastel.de.Informationen zur Kapelle Heilig Kreuz www.kunstlexikonsaar.de. Local official Johann Simon Rosinus was responsible for the construction supervision. The patrons for the chapel's construction were the barons Carl Caspar and Damian Adolph von der Leyen, who had moved their residence from Blieskastel to Koblenz a few years earlier. According to the dedication inscription, the church was to serve \\"(f)or the increased sewing of Christian-Catholic thought amongst the subjects.\\" The chapel had a relic of the True Cross that generated many pilgrimages and which also became the namesake of the chapel. Long before the arrival of the ‚ÄúArrow Madonna‚Äù from the Gr√§finthal monastery, the Holy Cross Chapel was a regionally important pilgrimage site. The priest and royal visitator Carl Desiderius de Royer, reorganizer of Catholic life in the Duchy of Palatinate-Zweibrucken, published a booklet on this pilgrimage in 1692.Quelle zur urspr√ºnglichen Kreuz Wallfahrt und zum Wallfahrtsb√ºchlein von Desiderius de Royer In the course of the French Revolution, the church was desecrated in 1793 and pilgrimages came to a standstill. The new revolutionary owners temporarily used it as a guard room and powder magazine. Ultimately, the chapel was reconsecrated in 1804, and regular services resumed. A quarter century later in 1829, the famous votive picture \\"Our Lady with the Arrows\\" arrived at the chapel from the Gr√§finthal monastery. Pilgrimage to the chapel was revived in 1913 - this time with a focus on the votive image of the Madonna. Since that time, the little church has been one of the most famous pilgrimage sites in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Speyer. Votive Madonna Image: \\"Our Lady with the Arrows\\" The first restoration of the chapel was carried out in 1958, which led to the discovery of a ribbed vault that was fully uncovered and painted in its original colors from 1965‚Äì66. The chapel roof was restored in 2008‚Äì09, however, further building work was urgently required.Informationsprospekt des Katholischen Kreuzkapellenvereins Blieskastel (PDF) www.wallfahrtskloster-blieskastel.de. Meanwhile, the Capuchins, who worked here until 2005, have been replaced by Franciscans who are tenants in the monastery complex after founding a monastery foundation. The Catholic Cross Chapel Association, a recognized non- profit founded in December 2007, is responsible for maintaining the building's condition. The interior renovation of the chapel began on May 16, 2013.Innenrenovierung der Kreuzkapelle hat begonnen www.wallfahrtskloster- blieskastel.de.

It was unanimously adopted by EU member states in June 2014. The EUMSS provides a framework for the EU‚Äôs actions within maritime security in order to promote broader and more coherent approaches to identified maritime security challenges. Maritime security strategies have been adopted by a number of countries like France, India, United Kingdom and United States of America, and such strategies are used to organise a country or region‚Äôs actions within maritime security by identifying maritime security challenges and relevant actors. The EUMSS defines how the EU understands maritime security, it states the maritime security interests, risks and threats identified by the EU, and it suggests five areas for EU responses. The EUMSS was followed by an action plan adopted by the General Affairs Council in December 2014. The action plan was later replaced by a revised version in June 2018.  Structure  The EUMSS is a 16 pages long strategy paper. It consists of the following sections: * Context * Purpose and scope * Principles and objectives * Maritime security interests * Maritime security risks and threats * Strengthening the EU response * Follow-up = Objectives, risks and threats = The EUMSS states that it wants to ‚Äúpromote rules-based good governance at sea‚Äù and ‚Äúenhance the role of the EU as a global actor and security provider‚Äù among others. The strategy also states its aim to improve cooperation between different sectors in the EU and advance information sharing between European actors in the maritime domain. Maritime security is a concept that does not have just one meaning, and different actors will attribute different issues to the concept. The EU embraces a comprehensive understanding of the term and issues under both national/regional security, human safety, economic development and marine environment are mentioned in the EUMSS. The EUMSS clearly states which issues the European Union considers to fall under the maritime security term in its list of maritime security risks and threats. These include inter-state maritime disputes; human security; piracy and organised crime; migrant smuggling; trafficking of humans, arms and narcotics; terrorism and cyber- attacks against maritime critical infrastructure; chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear threats; freedom of navigation; illegal fishing; marine pollution and sea dumps; climate change and natural disasters; and illegal archaeological research.  Development and adoption  > \\"The EU did not create new institutions but primarily sketched out how > existing bodies can work more efficiently together.\\" Before the EUMSS was adopted in June 2014, the European Parliament initiated a study to identify the geostrategic maritime challenges for the EU. The study was conducted by researchers from the Finnish Institute of International Affairs (FIIA) and the Swedish Institute of International Affairs (SIIA) and published in 2013. The study argued that the future for the EU‚Äôs presence in the maritime domain would be widely affected by a number of implications, such as bigger global interdependence of seas and sea routes, rising powers within maritime security such as Turkey and BRICS countries, crowded maritime traffic and overuse of resources in the maritime domain, security threats such as terrorism, sea-based crimes against critical infrastructure, and piracy. The study concluded: ‚ÄúThe EU requires a comprehensive maritime security strategy that creates synergies between the EU‚Äôs Integrated Maritime Policy and the maritime dimension of CSDP and that focuses more comprehensively on the security and management of global maritime flows and sea-based activities in the global maritime commons.‚Äù The work towards a maritime security strategy for the European Union had been on the table for a few years before the study was published. The idea had already arisen in 2010, when Spain, who held the Presidency of the Council of the European Union at the time, suggested it at a defence meeting. Two years before that, the EU had launched its first naval operation, Atalanta, and that was, according to several scholars, key to understand why the idea of a maritime security strategy came up at that time. Some EU member states including United Kingdom and Germany still opposed any integration in the defence area in 2010 and would initially not accept a text that referred to a possible maritime security strategy for the EU. However, in the end, the member states agreed on a text mentioning ‚Äúthe possible elaboration of a Security Strategy for the global maritime domain‚Äù. The next few years the European Commission and the European Union External Action (EEAS) were the main drivers in pushing a possible maritime security strategy forward, while the member states were not involved in the process. A Joint Communication was published in March 2014, and at this time Greece held the EU Presidency and pushed the idea of a maritime security strategy further forward. The EUMSS was discussed at several meetings and the text was revised several times. It seemed that the member states formed two groups with one pushing for more NATO references and less supranational regulations in the final text and the other wanting more integration in maritime security and EU security in general. The first group consisted among others of United Kingdom, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Malta, Netherlands, Bulgaria, Romania, Sweden and Denmark, and the other group consisted of France, Spain, Italy, Portugal, Ireland, Finland, Belgium and Luxembourg among others. In the final strategy, references to NATO were kept and four supranational regulations were removed.  Action plan  The EUMSS was followed by a detailed action plan adopted by the Council of the European Union in December 2014. It was built on four principles: cross-sectoral approach, functional integrity, respect for rules and principles, and maritime multilateralism. The action plan‚Äôs goal was to deliver ‚Äúcross-sectoral actions in a comprehensive and coordinated manner, mainstreaming maritime security into EU policies, strategies and instruments.‚Äù It contained 130 actions across the five areas external action; maritime awareness; capability development; risk management, protection of critical maritime infrastructure, and crisis response; and maritime security research and innovation, education, and training. For each action the action plan stated which actors were responsible for implementing the specific action. An implementation report on the implementation of the EUMSS action plan by the European Commission concluded in 2016 that while a large number of issues identified in the EUMSS were followed, many actions from the action plan presented challenges. Another implementation report from 2017 concluded that the implementation of the actions in the EUMSS action plan was progressing well but a full picture of the advancements were needed. = Revised action plan = The Council adopted a revised action plan in June 2018 ‚Äúto ensure that the policy response remains fit for current and future challenges, in line with political priorities in a rapidly changing security environment‚Äù. The revised action plan contains 90 actions compared to the 130 actions of its predecessor and is divided into two parts: The first part focuses on ‚Äúhorizontal issues‚Äù that are identified in the EUMSS, while a new, second part focuses on regional responses to global challenges in the maritime domain. The revised action plan states that it is a ‚Äúliving document‚Äù that ‚Äúoperationalises the EUMSS‚Äù while also taking other EU policies into account.  Operations and actions linked to the EUMSS  Operation Atalanta = Operation Atalanta or EUNAVFOR Somalia was the European Union‚Äôs first naval operation launched in 2008 to counter piracy off the coast of Somalia and Horn of Africa. The operation has been extended several times and is still active. Scholars have argued that Operation Atalanta was the beginning of the security dimension to EU‚Äôs maritime policies and that it paved the way for the EU Maritime Security Strategy to be formed and adopted; ‚Äúsince Atalanta, the development of EU maritime foreign and security policy issue has been substantial.‚Äù Operation Atalanta made the security aspect of the maritime dimension more tangible, and before Operation Atalanta was launched, EU member states generally looked to NATO for maritime security issues and naval operations. However, some member states were realising the need to act through the EU rather than NATO, and it was a mix of different factors that made sure Operation Atalanta was launched, e.g. ‚Äúthe recognition of the importance of the EU‚Äôs maritime frontiers, the unprecedented rise of piracy off Somalia, and a mixture of EU member states‚Äô domestic and foreign interests‚Äù. = Operation Sophia = Operation Sophia or EUNAVFOR Med was the second naval operation of the European Union. It was launched in 2015 in response to the refugee crisis with the aim to neutralise established smuggling routes for migrants in the Mediterranean Sea. The operation ended on March 31, 2020 but was succeeded the same day by Operation Irini, which is another military operation under the EU‚Äôs Common Security and Defence Policy that operates in the same waters as Operation Sophia but has a different goal related to an arms embargo against Libya rather than migrant smuggling in the Mediterranean Sea. Operation Atalanta and Operation Sophia seemed to both be launched initially because of humanitarian issues - Operation Atalanta‚Äôs goal was to protect humanitarian aid on its way to Somalia, and Operation Sophia was launched after a boat carrying migrants from Libya to Italy sank off the Italian island of Lampedusa in 2013, when more than 360 persons died. = EU Global Strategy = The European Union Global Strategy (EUGS) is a policy from June 2016 that replaces the European Security Strategy from 2003. The EUGS puts emphasis on maritime security and refers to the EU as a ‚Äúglobal maritime security provider‚Äù. The EUGS underlines the global role the European Union wants to take in the global maritime domain, and maritime security is a theme throughout the EUGS.  The future for the EUMSS  > ‚ÄúThe existence of the MSS reflects the EU‚Äôs geopolitical interest in > controlling the sea in its jurisdiction, as well as its intention to become > a global maritime actor.‚Äù One scholar mentioned in 2016 that it is still unknown whether the two maritime milestones Operation Atalanta and the EUMSS are just the beginning for the EU as a global power in the maritime domain or whether they ‚Äúonly represent the ‚Äòhigh water mark‚Äô‚Äù of the EU as a global power in the maritime domain. But after the adoption of the European Union Maritime Security Strategy, an action plan has been made and revised, a second and third naval operation have been launched, a Global Strategy for the European Union‚Äôs Foreign And Security Policy has been adopted, and with 90 actions listed in the revised and still rolling action plan it is possible that the field of maritime security in the EU will continue to grow. Scholarly discussions have circled whether the EU is becoming a global humanitarian actor or a traditional realist great power.  Other maritime policies of the EU  Several EU policies already had a maritime dimension before the adoption of the EUMSS, but they were spread across different policy areas. The first big step on the way to a more coherent EU policy in the maritime field was when the European Commission proposed the Integrated Maritime Policy (IMP) in 2007, but it was not until Operation Atalanta in 2008 and the EUMSS in 2014 that the security and defence aspect became clear. The European Union also has policies on maritime safety, marine pollution, energy security, fisheries control, illegal trafficking, immigration, maritime surveillance (Common Information Sharing Environment (CISE)) and more. Security-related maritime policies and operations fall under the agreed foreign policy of the European Union, the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP).

Most of the impressions from the outside world are obtained through the senses of sight. The retina, which is the receiving part of the sense pathway of vision, as well as the optic nerve during development, arise from parts of the central nervous system. The sense of sight is well developed in terrestrial vertebrates with binocular vision. Primates are already developing the ability of three-dimensional vision, and humans have seen the most perfect vision, which is especially related to the high degree of development of the cerebral cortex, especially the associative optical cortex. The optical pathway is a system of interconnected neurons, which connect the retina to the subcortical and cortical visual centers. This time, the neurons accept and transmit the image of the observed object, enabling its understanding and spatial vision. Reflex neurons this time start from the reflex optical center (stratum griseum profundum colliculi superioris) and connect it with the motor nuclei of the spinal nerves (tractus tectospinalis), the motor nuclei of the cerebral nerves (tractus tectobulbaris), the reticular nuclei of the cerebral tract in the cerebral tract (tectocerebellar tract). These numerous connections enable many defensive reflex actions in response to stimuli caused by visual impressions (reflexive movement of the head and neck, reflexive rotation of the eyes, blinking, dilation or narrowing of the pupil, accommodation, convergence of the eyes). The optic pathway has four neurons, three of which lie in the retina, and the fourth is located in the central nervous system. The processing of visual impulses (information) begins in the retina.

It was published in Rome by Ludovico Grignani and dedicated to Pope Innocent X in his jubilee year. The subject of the work was Kircher's attempt to translate the hieroglyphs on the sides of an obelisk erected in the Piazza Navona. The obelisk of Domitian The obelisk was originally commissioned from Egypt by the emperor Domitian, probably for the Temple of Isis and Serapis. The emperor Maxentius later had the obelisk moved outside the city walls to the Circus of Romulus on the Via Appia. There it fell into ruin, until Innocent X decided to have its broken parts brought to the Piazza Navona in front of his family's house, the Palazzo Pamphilj. He commissioned Kircher to lead the relocation and interpretation of the monument, and Gian Lorenzo Bernini to design a fountain above which the obelisk was to be placed, known today as the Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi. At the time, nobody was aware of the connection between Domitian and the obelisk, and it was known as the 'Pamphilj obelisk' after the Pope's family name. It was only in 1827 that Champollion succeeded in translating the hieroglyphs, revealing that they included the names of Domitian, his father Vespasian and his brother Titus. Significance of the obelisk For Kircher, obelisks and their hieroglyphic inscriptions were the source of hermetic wisdom that was older than, but continuous with Christian revelation. He believed that the Egyptians were the first to understand the underlying cosmic harmony of the universe, and that this was the basis of their religion and their philosophy. In making this argument Kircher drew on a long-established tradition of ancient texts from Herodotus, Plato, Diodorus, Plutarch and other authorities. Kircher was convinced that the lost truths contained within the hieroglyphs represented what was described in the words of St Paul in the First Epistle to the Corinthians - 'But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom, which God ordained before the world unto our glory' (Corinthians 1, 2:7). Kircher believed that by translating the obelisk he would be unlocking the hidden wisdom imparted from God to the patriarchs long ago. Translation At the start of the project the obelisk was not intact; as well as the five major pieces there were numerous smaller pieces that were not immediately found. As part of his reconstruction, Kircher filled the missing gaps with the hieroglyphs he believed would best fit the text according to his understanding of their meaning. Later, the missing parts were found by archaeologist and brought together with the main body of the obelisk, and to everyone's amazement, the hieroglyphs on those parts were, according to Kircher himself, exactly as he had predicted. Cardinal Capponi, who was supervising the project, was so enthralled that he asked for it to be written up, and this was the origin of the work. In fact Kircher's study had revealed that the same inscriptions were repeated on the different sides of the obelisk, so he was able to predict what would be found on parts he had not yet seen. Kircher's approach to translation was to assume (incorrectly) that hieroglyphs were ideographs rather than representations of sound, and that they communicated ideas without grammar or syntax. Kircher's self-described method of translation was first to make an accurate copy of each individual hieroglyphs, then think about suitable actions for each figure, and finally conclude the mystical meaning contained in each one of them. We now know that images on the upper part of each side of the obelisk are iconic and do not have any textual meaning; the lower part contains a brief text about Domitian and Horus. On the south face of the obelisk the text reads 'Horus, strong bull, beloved of Maat.' This Kircher translated as: > 'To the triform Divinity Hemptha - first Mind, motor of all things, second > Mind, craftsman, pantamorphic Spirit - Triune Divinity, eternal, having no > beginning or end, Origin of the secondary Gods, which, diffused out of the > Monad as from a certain apex into the breadth of the mundane pyramid, > confers its goodness first to the intellectual world of the Genies, who, > under the Guardian Ruler of the Southern Choir and through swift, effective > and resolute followers Genies who partake in no simple or material > substance, communicate their participated virtue and power to the lower > World... Kircher's erroneous translations were carved in granite and fixed to the sides of the obelisk's pedestal, above Bernini's fountain, where they still stand today. Patronage Kircher had dedicated Prodromus Coptus to his sponsor, Cardinal Francesco Barberini and he had been very close to the Barberini Pope Urban VIII. The election of the Pamphilj Pope Innocent X represented a major shift in power and patronage systems. Cardinal Barberini had to flee into exile in France and Kircher needed to establish himself under the new regime. One of Kircher's aims in publishing Obeliscus Pamphylius was to raise interest in his planned major work, Oedipus Aegyptiacus, and find sponsors for it. As he intended to be a large and lavishly illustrate work it would be expensive to produce. He secured funding from the Pope, the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick III and Ferdinando II de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany to produce Obeliscus Pamphylius and hoped that they would be interested in the larger project as well. It is also likely that Kircher was targeting his old friend Fabio Chigi, later Pope Alexander VII. This purpose of stimulating interest in the obelisk and securing funding explains the fact that the translation occupies only the last fifth of the work - the rest is taken up with dedications and with a history of the obelisk relayed by Kircher which we now know bears no relationship with reality. According to Kircher the monument had been commissioned by Pharaoh Sothis, son of Amenophis, who had restored Egypt to its original strength after the departure of Moses and the Israelites. It has been erected with three other obelisks near Thebes in around 1336 BC. In the second century AD Emperor Caracalla had brought it to Rome. Most of the rest of the work is an explanation of the significance of ancient Egyptian culture to the ancient Greek, Roman, and Hebrew civilisations, its influence on Islamic and rabbinical tradition. Censorship All books intended for publication by Jesuit authors had to be approved by the order's own censors. In 1652 Nicolaus Wysing, who was one of the five Revisors General for Kircher's later work Oedipus Aegyptiacus, complained that Kircher had not complied with the requirements of the censors in respect of Obeliscus Pamphilius. Kircher had apparently added new material after the censors had completed their review, and reorganised the material they had already reviewed so as to make it difficult to see whether he had obeyed their instructions or not. Illustrations In addition to a number of woodcut illustrations, Obeliscus Pamphylius had six full-page plates. The frontispiece, designed by Giovanni Angelo Canini and executed by Cornelis Bloemaert, depicts Father Time with a scythe poised on the base of a toppled obelisk. The figure of Fame stands chained next to it, despondent, leaning on her arm, with her trumpet down. These figures represent the state of the obelisk before its discovery and interpretation by Kircher. In the centre of the image the god Hermes flies, in his role both as messenger of the classical gods, and the father of hermeneutics. He is explaining the meaning of the hieroglyphs on a scroll to a muse-like figure, who writes in a book bearing Kircher's name. She rests her elbow on a pile of volumes labelled Egyptian wisdom, Pythagorean mathematics and Chaldean astrology, implying that Kircher's work ranks with these and builds upon them. Beneath her foot is a cubic block carrying a symbol that combines a mason's square crossed with a curved trumpet and a staff with the head of a hoopoe. The square and trumpet were a misreading of the Egyptian crook and flail symbols. In front of her is a cherub representing Harpocrates, god of silence, who sits in the shade and holds the edge of the manuscript; the full meaning of the hieroglyphs is not to be revealed in Obeliscus Pamphylius, but in Kircher's long anticipated major work Oedipus Aegiptiacus. Harpocrates sits on a tiered pedestal inscribed in Hebrew, Samaritan, Coptic, Arabic and Ethiopian. At the bottom of the image, Harpocrates' foot tramples on the head of a crocodile representing Typhon. Pierre Miotte created the illustrations of the obelisk, of the transport of obelisks by the ancients, and of 'the ancient gods interpreted.'

It is one of the smallest works signed and dated by the artist, in this case on the abandoned scroll in the foreground Galleria degli Uffizi, cit., p. 177-179.. The work's chiaroscuro, high light-source, realism and freeze-frame composition proved an important precedent for Caravaggio, Vel√°zquez and Francisco de Zurbar√°n. History It was originally commissioned by prior Leonardo Buonafede for the forestry refectory or the dispensary at the Certosa del Galluzzo near Florence, both places intended for welcoming and feeding guests, hence its subject. Two years earlier the artist had taken refuge from the plague there. Several preparatory drawings survive in the Uffizi's Gabinetto dei Disegni e delle Stampe (n. 6656F r e v), the British Museum (1936-10-10-10) and the Staatliche Graphische Sammlung M√ºnchen (nn. 14043 r e v, 14042 r e v). Vasari's Lives of the Artists stated his admiration both for the paintings and for the \\"German manner\\" of the frescoes in the Certosa's cloisters (slightly earlier than Pontormo's painting). Analysis Leonardo Buonafede The composition is based on a print from Albrecht D√ºrer 1511 Small Passion series, particularly in Christ's pose and the large tricorn hat worn by Cleophas, the right-hand disciple. Both works represent Christ blessing the bread, his last act before disappearing from the disciples according to the Gospel of Luke. At the top is an eye in a triangle, alluding to the Holy Trinity and the risen Christ's divine nature. It also appears in a copy of Pontormo's work by Empoli still at the Certosa and so it is thought to have been added to the original work by Empoli to mask its three-faced symbol of the Trinity, a symbol banned by the Counter Reformation. In the background are portraits of five of the Certosa's monks at the time the work was produced, including (far left) Buonafede himself, with his left hand raised in a gesture echoing Christ's. He is also shown in Rosso Fiorentino's Spedalingo Altarpiece, now in the same room at the UffiziFossi, cit., p. 438.. Its realism in showing everyday details such as the dog and two cats at bottom left, the shining metal plate, the linen tablecloth and the transparent glass bottle owes much to Northern European art of the same eraMarchetti Letta, cit., p. 40.. The high light- source also refers to paintings of the Ascension and the lamp of truth, whilst the tonality and treatment of colour is typical of Pontormo.

In 1917 he was promoted to colonel, and by the end of the war to brigadier general. =Hotin uprising= In October 1918, Prime Minister Alexandru Marghiloman ordered the Romanian Army to take control of Bukovina and Hotin, in the far-northern tip of Bessarabia. The 1st Cavalry Division soon moved into the region; it was spearheaded by the 3rd Redcoats Regiment and the 40th Infantry Regiment, both of which were placed under the command of General Davidoglu. Hotin was ceded by the Austrians on November 10, but on January 7, 1919, the Hotin Uprising, a Ukrainian-led insurrection, began. On January 19 Podolian irregulars crossed into Hotin County at Atachi, disarming Romanian border guards and moving in on Soroca; on January 23, after reaching Secureni, rebellion erupted in Hotin itself, chasing out the Romanian garrison. Soon after, Davidoglu's troops were joined by various units, including the 37th Infantry Regiment from BacƒÉu and the machine-gunners of BƒÉl»õi. On January 28‚Äì30, the regrouped units forced the rebels out the area, pushing them back over the Dniester by February 1. =The Hungarian‚ÄìRomanian War= In March 1919 he was stationed in Satu Mare, where he helped Doctor establish the surgery section of the city's hospital. In April 2019, during the Hungarian‚ÄìRomanian War, he led the 2nd Ro»ôiori Brigade in the battles around Satu Mare and M√°t√©szalka. For the bravery he displayed in those engagements, Davidoglu was awarded on June 6 the Order of Michael the Brave, 3rd class. =The Gendarmerie= Promoted to major general, he served as commander of the Gendarmerie from 1927 to 1928. In July 1927, Iuliu Maniu and Virgil Madgearu, representing the National Peasants' Party, wrote an open letter to Prime Minister Ion I. C. BrƒÉtianu, the leader of the National Liberal Party, protesting Davidoglu's alleged interference in the 1927 Romanian general election. Davidoglu subsequently served as Chief Gendarmerie Inspector of Mehedin»õi County. He died in Bucharest in 1947. In 2012 the office of Gendarmerie Inspector of Mehedin»õi County was named in his honor.

He is mostly known for his Brutalist architecture and for his prefabricated modules using concrete in fluid and organic shapes.  Life and career  Education = It was during the Second World War that he started his education at La Cambre in Brussels, obtaining a degree in 1948. Brodzki confesses that he didn't learn a lot of practical information during his education there and often clashed with his tutor Charles Van Nueten.  Internship  After graduating at La Cambre, Brodzki started his internship working on the Headquarters of the United Nations in the United States. He became part of a team of 500 specialists, working on a design by Oscar Niemeyer, which gave him access to many different stages of the design and construction. According to Brodzki this was a very important aspect going forward in his career as an architect. \\"It was heaven\\", he says in an interview with Wallpaper: \\"Working on what, at the time, was the most modern building in the world\\". As an intern he received mostly smaller tasks, but he learned a lot by observing and questioning the other architects, model builders, designers and engineers, soaking up as much information as he could for six months. It was the pragmatic way of working which he discerned during his internship in the United States that turned out to be vital for his later success in Belgium. \\"The most important thing I learned in the US is that when they start to work on something, they begin with the idea that they don‚Äôt know everything, but want to find out,\\" Brodzki smiles. \\"In Belgium, they start work assuming they know it all.\\" By working out each stage of the construction beforehand, using models and drawings, many problems are avoided during the construction itself. You can see this influence on his later realisations, such as the CBR Building. = Career = After his six-month internship in the Unites States, Brodzki returned to Belgium eager to put his newly gained experience into practice, but was quickly disappointed. \\"The tragedy was that when I came back, I was 15 years ahead of Belgium in terms of design and methodology,\\" he says. \\"So for ten years, I had to bide my time.\\" In 1958 he was selected to construct the pavilion for the Congolese fauna for the Expo 58 in Brussels. He saw this as an opportunity to showcase his thoughts on fluid and organic shapes within architecture. \\"You will find no straight lines in nature, so why should I design a straight pavilion for the expo?\\", he says in an interview with De Tijd. One of his first clients was Bandin who brought him in contact with Ren√© C√©lis, the right hand of Vanhoof, who was the former great director of CBR. Coincidentally Brodzki and C√©lis shared many values within the realm architecture and construction and became friends quickly. This shared vision created a meaningful collaboration between the CBR and Brodzki, who were looking for an architect to build their new headquarters. Both parties were still relatively unknown during this time. This collaboration lead towards Brodzki's most published realisation, which put him on the map as an architect: the CBR Building. It was this building where Brodzki finally had the resources and opportunity to practice the methodology he was taught in the US and integrate it with his thoughts on organic shapes within architecture. It resulted into the first construction ever to consist out of prefabricated concrete modules with fluid shapes. According to Brodzki this building would have never happened if it wasn't for the mutual trust between client and architect, allowing Brodzki the access to a factory fully dedicated towards the construction of these modules and two temporary test buildings on an industrial park. By the end of the '70s the influence Brodzki had generated throughout Brussels was visible. An increased number of buildings using concrete elements with organic shapes were erected, some examples are the ROB supermarket and the town hall of Oudergem. Apart from these larger constructions Brodzki also realised a dozen private residences during his career and some renovations.  A new style  Constantin Brodzki never understood the modernist tendency to solely use concrete as a construction material or cast it into straight lines and shapes. He acknowledged that concrete is a liquid in its original state and therefore had a lot untapped potential in its formal freedom. This reasoning was visible in some of his realisations such as the Expo 58 pavilion and the CBR building, which he saw as a rational architectural experiment on working with fluid shapes. He created a new style in Belgium which is now called the \\"CBR-style\\", referring to facades made out of prefabricated concrete modules in organic shapes.  Publications  In 1980 the CBR Building was the only Belgian project selected for the 1979 MoMA exhibition - 'Transformation in Modern Architecture between 1960 and 1980'. The catalogue mentioned the building as an \\"important step in the development of modernism in the world\\" and celebrated it for setting a precedent in expressive facades using prefabricated concrete modules.

She had four sisters and seven brothers including Lucas, James, and Cecily Dillon. She entered the English Poor Clares at Gravelines in Flanders with her sister and was professed, alongside her sister, on 8 September 1622 as Sister Eleanor Mary of St Joseph. Dillon led a group of five young Irish nuns from Gravelines for Dunkirk in 1625, to found the first convent for Irish women since the suppression of the monasteries. Due to high rents, the group only remained in Dunkirk for a short time, leaving for Nieuport in Flanders in 1626 and founding a convent there in early 1627. At this point Dillon's brothers, Louis and George who were both priests, suggested that both Dillon sisters return to Ireland to found a convent there. At this time, Catholics were being treated less harshly by the English authorities, which saw a number of religious establishments. The Dillon sisters arrived in Ireland around 13 June 1629, and established the first Poor Clares convent in Ireland at Merchants' Quay in Dublin with Dillon as the abbess. The exact date of Dillon's death is unknown, but she died in 1629 as the convent was established, leading to her sister taking her place as abbess.

It became a No. 7 hit for Guy Lombardo later that year but it was not until the early 1940s that the tune re-emerged, entering the repertoire of the orchestras of Benny Goodman and Count Basie. \\"My Old Flame\\" has since become a jazz standard, and sung by the likes of Billie Holiday, Peggy Lee, Dinah Washington and Helen Humes, with instrumental interpretations by Charlie Parker for the Dial label in 1947, Gerry Mulligan with Chet Baker in 1953, trombonist J.J. Johnson on his 1957 album Trombone Master, Sonny Rollins on his 1993 album Old Flames and many others. The tune was also recorded by the Stan Kenton orchestra, and Zoot Sims in a \\"sensitive rendition\\" according to Jazz Improv magazine. Lyrics and structure The music has an AABA structure. It is written in the key of G major, and features a change to B in the 'B' section. As a vehicle for West, while the lyric contains \\"characteristically flippant lines ‚Äì 'My old flame/ I can't even remember his name' ‚Äì it suggests that her brazen sexuality is the carapace for a lost youthful love\\": 'But their attempts at love/ Were only imitations of/ My old flame'.

McCartney is a vocal advocate for evidence-based medicine. McCartney was a regular columnist at the British Medical Journal. She regularly writes articles for The Guardian and currently contributes to the BBC Radio 4 program, Inside Health. She has written three popular science books, The Patient Paradox, The State of Medicine and Living with Dying. During the COVID-19 pandemic, McCartney contributed content to academic journals and broadcasting platforms, personal blog, and social media to inform the public and dispel myths about coronavirus disease.  Early life and education  McCartney was born in Scotland. McCartney has said that her earliest ambition was \\"to be an engineer\\". She studied medicine at the University of Aberdeen. In 1994, McCartney earned her medical degree from the University of Aberdeen School of Medicine and Dentistry. In 1995, she completed her General Medical Council registration.  Career  McCartney is a general practitioner based in Glasgow, Scotland, contracted to NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde. McCartney started popular science writing after reading a misleading newspaper article claiming health benefits associated with CT scanning. From 2013 to 2018, McCartney wrote regular columns for the British Medical Journal (BMJ), through which she debunked medical claims that were not rooted in evidence. McCartney is a regular contributor to the BBC Radio 4 show Inside Health and has contributed to other science related programming. McCartney uses her time on air to share evidence about topics related to public health, for example the lack of evidence surrounding the sugary drink tax or recommendation to drink eight glasses a day of water. She has written and hosted her own radio shows, including Farewell Doctor Finlay andTell Me Where It Hurts, which looked at historical and contemporary GP practise in the National Health Service. Alongside her writing and broadcasting, McCartney has campaigned for doctors to be required to provide conflict of interest statements to their patients. At the time, access to this type of information was becoming increasingly important ‚Äì the commercialisation of healthcare was resulting in confusing guidelines that did not protect patients. \\"Conflict of Interest\\" could include disclosing whether they are a paid consultant for or have been trained by a drug company when prescribing drugs. She argued that as doctors have to disclose this information to their employers each year, the General Medical Council should be able provide this detail to members of the public. Her proposal was backed by Ben Goldacre, Trish Groves and Iain Chalmers. As part of this campaign, McCartney and colleagues set up the website whopaysthisdoctor.org, which collected and shared details on the commercial interests of physicians. McCartney established the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) working group on overdiagnosis, which she defined as \\"the application of diagnoses and treatments for patients that are of little or no value\\". As part of her campaigning work, she led calls for general practitioners and pharmacists to not recommend or prescribe homeopathic medicine or products. This was approved by the RCGP in 2015, who made a statement outlining their commitment to evidence-based medicine. She has provided evidence before government on the need for healthcare providers in both the public and private sector to be more transparent about the risks and benefits of health screening. She pointed out that private screening companies could make claims such as, ‚Äúwe‚Äôve saved thousands of lives‚Äù, in advertising materials, irrespective of whether these claims were grounded in evidence. McCartney has shown hat the outcomes of these evidence-free, private screenings, which were not sanctioned by the UK National Screening Committee, , often resulted in an additional burden for the National Health Service. McCartney has argued that 'sexed up' medicine; in which people make medical decisions based on overselling, incomplete information and unfair claims, is bad of people's health. As part of her campaigning efforts, she contacted the Advertising Standards Authority, who upheld her complaints on the use of misleading information and non-evidence based inspections. In 2016 McCartney joined Phil Hammond for a month long show at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, where the pair urged the audience to protect the National Health Service from \\"market mayhem\\". Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic McCartney was a regular guest on Inside Health, discussing the drug trial, health inequality, the impact of smoking on coronavirus disease prognosis and importance of personal protective equipment. In March 2020 she called for more COVID-19 testing of frontline workers, pointing out that over the course of two days, their workload had increased by 40%. Writing in The Lancet, McCartney described the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the medical community, ‚ÄúThe NHS has told people for years that it 'puts patients at the hearts of all we do'. I suspect most doctors, frustrated at bureaucracy and barriers, would disagree. That it has taken a global crisis, which is killing patients and health-care staff, and which will have profound psychological sequelae, to make this happen, is catastrophic, and an unpayable price‚Äù. She is a patron of HealthWatch UK, a charity which challenges poor evidence in health reporting, as well as an honorary fellow of the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine. Personal life McCartney lives in Glasgow. She has three children.

Finished in 1505, it is located in the Church of the Saints Cosma and Damiano in Brescia, in the chapel dedicated to these saints. History San Tiziano, bishop of Brescia between 526‚Äì540, was initially buried in the old church of the Saints Cosma and Damiano, which stood until the end of the thirteenth century in front of the Brolleto. In 1298, at the behest of Berardo Maggi and as part of the expansion of the public palazzo, the church and the attached nunnery were demolished to create an urban space west of the Broletto, which currently constitutes the northern end of the Piazza del Duomo. The church and the nunnery were built at the western edge of the inhabited centre of the city, but within the city walls built by Alberico da Gambara between 1237-1239. At this time, the bishop's relics were either lost or forgotten, and thus not transferred to the new building. In 1490, during the episcopate of Paolo Zane, the abbess of the nunnery had a revelation of the burial place of the relics. According to legend, the subsequent excavation proved her dream to be precise. The saint's sarcophagus was probably not the original, but likely dated to the 12th century. The idea of a new monumental ark for the relics then came about, and within fifteen years, the funerary monument was installed in the chapel on the left of the presbytery of the Cosma and Damiano church. An inscription MDV (1505) appears on the base, indicating the date of installation. The translation of the body of the saint is also recorded in the Brescian state archives. The tomb was ostensibly subject to some further work, as MDXXIX (1529) appears on the back of the moulding. The extent of the works, however, is questioned. The new sepulchral ark survives intact to the present day. The twelfth century sarcophagus, though, was preserved in its original form only till 1885, when Antonio Tagliaferri, an architect, reused it along with other stone materiel from the same monastery to create an ornamental fountain, located in the eastern part of piazzetta Tito Speri, and known as the Fountain of San Tiziano. Description In the lower part of the sepulchre, four pilasters, richly carved with tendrils, flowers and birds, delimit three niches with a shell cover, within which, from right to left, Saint Damiano, a Madonna and Child with Saint Cosma are depicted. Above it develops the elaborate cover, with a series of mouldings tapered up to the cymatium, which acts as a pedestal for the representation of San Tiziano. The back does not have figured sculptures, but a panel division with mirrors, where the same ornaments of the front are taken up. A refined and precise gilding covers many parts of the ark, in particular the four sculptures with an effective and elegant rendering of the fabrics of the clothes. Stylistic assessment and attribution Historically the ark was attributed to more or less anonymous Brescian or Lombard sculptors between the end of the 15th century and the beginning of the following one. In 2007, Vito Zani proposed the attribution of the ark to the Sanmicheli workshop, as part of a series of sculptural works that the family of artists would have made between the 1480s and the early 16th century. These included important works such as the facade of the Church of Santa Maria dei Miracoli, many stone works for the Palazzo della Loggia, most of the sculptures in the Church of San Pietro in Oliveto and other minor but significant artefacts including the architectural members outside the Caprioli Chapel in the Church of San Giorgio. The ark of San Tiziano stands out for the refined ornamental imprint that characterizes the treatment of the surfaces, exalted above all by the gilding. In particular, however, it is among the very rare Brescian marble works with figurative components that can be placed completely outside the circle of Gasparo Cairano, the main exponent of Brescian Renaissance sculpture between 1490 and 1515. At this point, other than the Sanmicheli workshop, it is difficult to find in Brescia another studio capable of producing works of similar quality. The mirrors on the back of the sepulcher constitute a simplified reproduction of the pronaos of the sanctuary of the Miracles, which has been traced back to the Sanmicheli. According to the documentary evidence, the only member of the Sanmicheli family to practise figurative work was Matteo Sanmicheli, and to him is attributed the statues on the ark. An affinity between these figures and those of the faces of some of the Apostles along the nave of the church of San Pietro in Oliveto has also been noted. The cycle of twelve statues, likely completed by 1507, is attributed to Gasparo Cairano and company, implying the existence of a subcontract to the Sanmicheli. Matteo Sanmicheli's Piedmontese career began with a statuette in the lost tomb of Maria di Serbia in Casale Monferrato, dated to 1510; this has clear references to figures in the candelabrum of the pilasters in the Cavalli chapel of the San Pietro church, Oliveto, completed in 1508. That chapel, in turn, is informed by the technical and compositional detail of the Sanctuary of the Miracles, detail that continued to be reiterated in Sanmicheli's Piedmontese oeuvre. The Ark of San Tiziano can also be seen as another example in the competition between Gasparo Cairano's classical style, which had increasingly become popular among Brescian public and private clients, and the Sanmicheli, whose decorative style was out of vogue. Indeed, this ark can be seen as an attempt by Bartolomeo Sanmicheli at the beginning of a new century, to return to artistic prominence. While several commissions, notably the Caprioli chapel and the ornamentation of San Pietro in Oliveto, seem to have been shared by the competitors, Cairano's riposte came in 1508, with the Ark of Sant'Apollonio. His artistic superiority in the eyes of the Brescian state was firmly established, and this probably caused the Sanmicheli to abandon Brescia. They moved to Casale Monferrato, where Bartolomeo died two years later, and Matteo began a new career. In 2010, Giuseppe Sava reconstructed the figure of Antonio Medaglia, the little-known architect of the church of San Pietro in Oliveto, proposing a catalog of works. In addition to this, Sava detected the hand of yet another artist in a small group of works among the statuettes of the ark of San Tiziano, in two figured rounds in the interiors of Santa Maria dei Miracoli and in the small busts of bishops and the Magdalene on the prospect of the chapel dedicated to San Tiziano in San Pietro in Oliveto. Sava then assigns all these works to a sculptor influenced by Stefano Lamberti, albeit erring in reading the date on the coping of the ark as 1519 instead of 1529. The question of assignment of the work therefore remains open: if it can be postdated to the 1520s, it might be attributable to Lamberti's disciple, in which case at least the statues of the ark would be taken away from Matteo Sanmicheli's oeuvre. The dating of the other works, namely the two roundels and the figures of the chapel of the Magdalene, however remains controversial.

Biography  Born in Lisbon, Archer lived most of her life outside of Portugal. As a result of her parents' frequent journeys with their children, she did not finish elementary school until she was much older than normal students making her essentially a self-taught writer. Reportedly, she started creating verse as a young child although no evidence of those poems remain. In 1910, her parents moved the family to Mozambique, Africa. She was the first-born of six children. The family returned to Portugal in 1914, but two years later they were back in Africa, this time in Guinea-Bissau. In 1921, while her father was on a trip to Portugal, Maria Archer married a Portuguese man, Alberto Teixeira Passos and the young couple took up residence on the island of Ibo in Mozambique. Five years later, after the fall of the democratic regime there and the subsequent crisis, her husband lost his job at a bank and the two moved to Faro, Portugal. In 1931, the marriage ended and they divorced. = Writings = As a single woman, she returned to Africa to live with her parents in Luanda, Angola, where she began her literary career in earnest. She started attending writing conferences and her first published work appeared in magazines. She called her first book, Tr√™s Mulheres (Three Women), a soap opera, which was published in the same volume that contained a police adventure story by Ant√≥nio Pinto Quartin, A Lenda e o A√ß√£o do Estranho Caso de Pauling. She returned to Lisbon, where she began a period of intense writing activity, producing works describing her experience in Africa. In 1945, she also became an activist, joining the group called Movement of Democratic Unity (MUD), consisting of those opposed to the repressive regime of President Salazar in Portugal.Buck, Claire (1992). Bloomsbury guide to women's literature. London: Bloomsbury. . OCLC 185786618. After she gained recognition as an activist, she began having problems with the political police. Her works were censored and her novel Casa Sem P√£o (1947) was seized. According to the writer Dina Botelho, > \\"She closely followed the trial of the challenger of the Salazar > dictatorship, Captain Henrique Carlos Galv√£o at the Military Court of Santa > Clara. Having proposed to write a book about it, she saw her home invaded by > the International Police and State Defense (PIDE) shortly after the end of > the trial in 1953. She did eventually publish it in 1959, in Brazil, under > the title The Last Days of Portuguese Fascism\\". Unable to make money from her writings in Portugal, she left for Brazil, on 5 July 1955 and arrived ten days later. = Exiled = While in Brazil, she \\"lived poor and sick,\\" but she still wrote for some newspapers there, collaborating with O Estado de S. Paulo, Semana Portuguesa and Portugal Democr√°tico and Revista Municipal de Lisboa (1939‚Äì1973). Her themes included both African-subjects as well as works opposing the Portuguese dictatorship. She also collaborated with Brazilian magazines such as, Portugal Colonial (full title: Colonial Portugal: Review on Colonial Expansion and Propaganda) (1931‚Äì1937) as well as the Portuguese-Brazilian magazine Atl√¢ntico: revista luso-brasileira. During her years in self-imposed exile, she is said to have completed five books and published them in Brazil, but records of only four exist. = Later years = By the end of her writing career, Archer had produced more than 30 works ranging over many different genres including a children's adventure novel, novels for adults and plays. Some of her work was republished in multiple editions. Finally, in 1979, she returned to Lisbon for the last time, moving into a long-term residential care facility called Manor of Santa Maria de Marvila on 26 April.

The Globe and Mail, September 10, 1986. Set in the 1940s, the film stars Neil Munro as Hugh Jameson, a journalist who sets out to research an unsolved murder from several decades earlier, but goes missing himself, necessitating the hiring of private detective Charles Ripley (August Schellenberg) to attempt to find him.Joel Rubinoff, \\"Suspense murdered in Canadian thrillers\\". Toronto Star, April 1, 1997. The film's cast also includes Chapelle Jaffe, Tom Butler and Linda Goranson. The film premiered at the 1986 Festival of Festivals. Critical response Writing for The Globe and Mail, Jay Scott panned the film as a pale imitation of Chinatown, writing that \\"Despite an able performance from August Schellenberg (as a private detective) and a spectacular one from Chapelle Jaffe (as a vampirish sicko), Pittman's movie, also at the festival, is a movie about movies that lacks the high style of the genre - hardboiled detective film noir - whose pleasures it strives to revive.\\" Joel Rubinoff of the Toronto Star also reviewed the film negatively, writing that \\"ostensibly designed to mirror the dark, moody detective thrillers of the 1940s, Confidential ambles along like a toddler out of the playpen for the first time, staggering here and there, and eventually falling flat on its face. With competent performances from usually stalwart Canadians August Schellenberg, Chapelle Jaffe and Neil Munro, it's not the acting that's at fault. And with the focus on sleazy strip joints, cars with fins and private detectives with crooked grins, it does succeed in evoking the clich√©d atmosphere of a '40s detective flick. There is a far more serious problem: writer/director Bruce Pittman's equal dramatic treatment of rambling discussions about bed linen and boarding fees and the unrelated incestual bloodbath. There's mystery here all right, but no logic.\\" ReferencesExternal links * Category:1986 films Category:Canadian films Category:Canadian crime thriller films ","title":"Confidential (1986 film)"},{"id":"64057106","text":"List of Ambassadors *Ronen Gil-Or 2018 - *Daniel Zohar-Zonshine 2014 - 2018 *Hagay-Moshe Behar 2012 - 2014 *Yaron Mayer 2008 - 2012 *Ruth Schatz 2004 - 2008 *Yaacov Avrahamy 2002 - 2004 *Baruch Ram 2000 - 2001 *Gad Nathan 1996 - 2000 *Mordechai Carni 1993 - 1996 *Ori Noy 1990 - 1993 *Kalman Anner 1979 - 1983 *Shmuel Ovnat 1977 - 1979 *David Marmor 1973 - 1977 *Arieh Eilan 1970 - 1973 *Zvi Brosh 1968 - 1970 *Mesholam Veron 1964 - 1968 *Eliashiv Ben-Horin 1960 - 1963 *Ambassador Daniel Lewin (diplomat) 1957 - 1960 *Minister Yaacov Shimoni 1955 - 1957 *Minister David Hacohen 1953 - 1955  References  * Myanmar Israel ","title":"List of ambassadors of Israel to Myanmar"},{"id":"64057126","text":"The Armenak Khanperyants Military Aviation University () is a higher educational institution of the Armenian Air Force functioning under the Ministry of Defense of Armenia.
