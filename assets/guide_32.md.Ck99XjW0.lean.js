In this interpretation of physics wholeness is not considered static, but as a dynamic interconnected process. The concept is presented most fully in Wholeness and the Implicate Order, published in 1980. Background The original inklings of the holomovement idea were first proposed at the October 1927 Fifth Solvay International Conference on Electrons and Photons by Louis de Broglie. He proposed the idea of a pilot wave as a causal interpretation of quantum mechanics rather than a purely results oriented one, as in the Copenhagen interpretation. However, Wolfgang Pauli raised an objection to it at the conference, saying that it did not deal properly with the case of inelastic scattering. De Broglie was not able to find a response to this objection, and he and Born abandoned the pilot-wave approach. Unlike David Bohm years later, de Broglie did not complete his theory to encompass the many-particle case. In 1952, David Bohm, dissatisfied with the prevailing orthodoxy, rediscovered de Broglie's pilot wave theory. Bohm developed pilot wave theory into what is now called the de Broglie‚ÄìBohm theory. The de Broglie‚ÄìBohm theory itself might have gone unnoticed by most physicists, if it had not been championed by John Bell, who also countered the objections to it. In 1987, John Bell rediscovered Grete Hermann's work, and thus showed the physics community that Pauli's and von Neumann's objections \\"only\\" showed that the pilot wave theory did not have locality. The idea of holomovement is analogous to holography, wherein the interference of two types of light imprints the information about the image, and takes an indication that Schr√∂dinger's equation can be construed as containing a new kind of field. This is apparent when it's written in the polar form: :: \\\\Psi(\\\\mathbf{r},t) = \\\\psi(\\\\mathbf{r}) e^{-iEt/\\\\hbar} And it's easily shown that the equation has two real components. Early development of the idea In an essay published in 1971, Bohm continued his earlier critique (in \\"Causality and Chance in Modern Physics\\") of the mechanistic assumptions behind most modern physics and biology, and spoke of the need for a fundamentally different approach, and for a point of view which would go beyond mechanism. In particular, Bohm objected to the assumption that the world can be reduced to a set of irreducible particles within a three- dimensional Cartesian grid, or even within the four-dimensional curvilinear space of relativity theory. Bohm came instead to embrace a concept of reality as a dynamic movement of the whole: \\"In this view, there is no ultimate set of separately existent entities, out of which all is supposed to be constituted. Rather, unbroken and undivided movement is taken as a primary notion\\" (Bohm, 1988, p. 77). He then goes on to paraphrase da Vinci to the effect that movement gives shape to all forms and structure gives order to movement, but adds modern insight when he suggests that \\"a deeper and more extensive inner movement creates, maintains, and ultimately dissolves structure\\". (78). In another article from the same period, \\"On the Metaphysics and Movement of Universal Fitting\\", Bohm identifies some of the inadequacies of the mechanistic model, particularly the inability to predict the future movement of complex wholes from the initial conditions, and suggests instead a focus on a general laws of interaction governing the relationship of the parts within a whole: \\"What we are doing in this essay is to consider what it means to turn this prevailing metaphysics of science ‚Äòupside down‚Äô by exploring the notion that a kind of art ‚Äî a movement of fitting together ‚Äî is what is universal, both in nature and in human activities\\" (90). This movement of the whole is what he calls here the artamovement, which he defines as the \\"movement of fitting\\" (91), and which is clearly related to what he would later call the holomovement. Undivided wholeness The term holomovement is one of many neologisms which Bohm coined in his search to overcome the limitations of the standard Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics. This approach involved not just a critique of the assumptions of the standard model, but a set of new concepts in physics which move beyond the conventional language of quantum mechanics. Wholeness and the Implicate Order is the culmination of these reflections, an attempt to show how the new insights provided by a post- Copenhagen model can be extended beyond physics into other domains, such as life, consciousness, and cosmology. The holomovement concept is introduced in incremental steps. It is first presented under the aspect of wholeness in the lead essay, called \\"Fragmentation and Wholeness\\". There Bohm states the major claim of the book: \\"The new form of insight can perhaps best be called Undivided Wholeness in Flowing Movement\\" (Bohm, 1980, 11). This view implies that flow is, in some sense, prior to that of the ‚Äòthings‚Äô that can be seen to form and dissolve in this flow. He notes how \\"each relatively autonomous and stable structure is to be understood not as something independently and permanently existent but rather as a product that has been formed in the whole flowing movement and what will ultimately dissolve back into this movement. How it forms and maintains itself, then, depends on its place function within the whole\\" (14). For Bohm, movement is what is primary; and what seem like permanent structures are only relatively autonomous sub-entities which emerge from the whole of flowing movement and then dissolve back into it an unceasing process of becoming. All is flux The general concept is further refined in the third chapter, \\"Reality and Knowledge considered as Process\\", this time under the aspect of movement, or process. \\"Not only is everything changing, but all is flux. That is to say, what is the process of becoming itself, while all objects, events, entities, conditions, structures, etc., are forms that can be abstracted from this process\\" (48). His notion of the whole is not a static Parmenidean oneness outside of space and time. Rather, the wholeness to which he refers here is more akin to the Heraclitian flux, or to the process philosophy of Whitehead. Formal presentation The formal presentation of the concept comes late in the book, under the general framework of new notions of order is physics. After discussing the concepts of undivided wholeness and the implicate and explicate orders, he presents the formal definition under the subheading \\"The Holomovement and its Aspects\\". Consistent with his own earlier Causal Interpretation, and more generally with the de Broglie- Schroedinger approach, he posits that a new kind of description would be appropriate for giving primary relevance to the implicate order. Using the hologram as a model, Bohm argues that the implicate order is enfolded within a more generalized wave structure of the universe-in-motion, or what he calls the holomovement: Generalizing, so as to emphasize undivided wholeness, we can say that the holomovement, which is an unbroken and undivided totality, ‚Äòcarries‚Äô implicate order. In certain cases, we can abstract particular aspects of the holomovement (e.g. light, electrons, sound, etc.), but more generally, all forms of the holomovement merge and are inseparable. Thus in its totality, the holomovement is not limited in any specifiable way at all. It is not required to conform to any particular order, or to be bounded by any particular measure. Thus, the holomovement is undefinable and immeasurable.\\" (151). As the interconnected totality of all there is, the holomovement is potentially of an infinite order, and so cannot be pinned down to any one notion of order. It is important to note that Bohm's concepts of the implicate order and the holomovement are significant departures from the earlier \\"Hidden Variables\\" interpretation, and the conceptual framework is somewhat different from that articulated in the Bohm-Vigier interpretation, sometimes called the Causal-Stochastic Interpretation, and the interpretations of the proponents of \\"Bohmian Mechanics\\", where the general assumption is of an underlying Dirac ether (see F. David Peat's Introduction to Quantum Implications). While the concept of the holomovement has been criticized as being \\"metaphysical\\", it is actually subtler, while at the same time encompassing the whole range of interconnected physical phenomena. The law of the holomovement: Holonomy The starting point for Bohm's articulation of what he means by a \\"new order in physics\\" is his notion of wholeness. Thus crucial for understanding the holomovement is his notion of how interconnected phenomena are woven together in an underlying unified fabric of physical law. In the following section, called \\"Law in the Holomovement\\", he takes up the question of order, and the laws of organization which relate the parts to each other and to the whole. This is what he calls the \\"law of the whole\\", or holonomy. Rather than starting with the parts and explaining the whole in terms of the parts, Bohm's point of view is just the opposite: he starts with a notion of undivided wholeness and derives the parts as abstractions from the whole. The essential point is that the implicate order and the holomovement imply a way of looking at reality not merely in terms of external interactions between things, but in terms of the internal (enfolded) relationships among things: \\"The relationships constituting the fundamental law are between the enfolded structures that interweave and inter-penetrate each other, through the whole of space, rather than between the abstracted and separated forms that are manifest to the senses (and to our instruments)\\" (185). Extension to life, consciousness and cosmology In the final chapter of the book, \\"The enfolding-unfolding universe and consciousness\\", Bohm elaborated further on the need for new notions of order of physics, and set forth a general view in which totalities are continually forming and dissolving out of the universal flux, or what he designates as the holomovement. He recapitulates: \\"Our basic proposal was that what is the holomovement, and that everything is to be explained in terms of forms derived from this holomovement. (178).\\" And again: \\"The implicate order has its ground in the holomovement which is, as we have seen, vast, rich, and in a state of unending flux of enfoldment and unfoldment, with laws most of which are only vaguely known (185). As such, the holomovement includes not just physical reality, but life, consciousness and cosmology. As Bohm sums it up at the end of the book: \\"Our overall approach has thus brought together questions of the nature of the cosmos, of matter in general, of life, and of consciousness. All of these have been considered to be projections of a common ground. This we may call the ground of all that is\\" (212). In popular culture Bohm's work and the Holomovement are the topic of a feature-length documentary under development by Paul Howard and David Peat. Bohm features as a fictional character in the novel The Wave by British author Lochlan Bloom which includes several \\"enfolded\\" narratives. Publications * 1957.

He was a native of Bremen, Germany. He earned his medical doctorate at the University of Heidelberg, and after graduation became a general practitioner in Stuttgart. On 1 January 1888, he opened a sanatorium called the \\"Physiatric Sanatorium\\" at Wei√üer Hirsch, outside of Dresden. This institution would eventually become well-known internationally. Lahmann was influenced by the methods used by Vincenz Priessnitz (1799-1851) and Johann Schroth (1798-1856), both pioneers in the field of alternative medicine. He eventually turned away from traditional medicine, and was disdainful of drugs and unnatural medications. Lahmann stressed the importance of diet, exercise and fresh air, and was an ardent practitioner of physiotherapy and hydrotherapy. Lahmann recommended a vegetarian diet of fruits, vegetables, nuts, whole grain bread and dairy products, and believed in limiting one's intake of table salt and liquor. He developed five separate diets for his patients, which included food for diabetics, food for the overweight, as well as a strictly vegetarian diet. In his 1891 book, Di√§tetische Blutentmischung als Grundursache der Krankheiten, he argued that diseases were ultimately caused by a poor diet, and therefore a proper diet was needed to prevent illness. He was also one of the first physicians to recognize the importance of minerals in an individuals' diet, feeling that many foods were mineral deficient. Lahmann was an advocate of animal rights, refusing to use them in laboratory experiments. He also advocated loose-fitting clothing for all his patients, and recommended both sauna and open-air bathing.

The model is known as the Wernicke‚ÄìGeschwind model. # For listening to and understanding spoken words, the sounds of the words are sent through the auditory pathways to area 41, which is the primary auditory cortex (Heschl's gyrus). From there, they continue to Wernicke's area, where the meaning of the words is extracted. # In order to speak, the meanings of words are sent from Wernicke's area via the arcuate fasciculus to Broca's area, where morphemes are assembled. The model proposes that Broca's area holds a representation for articulating words. Instructions for speech are sent from Broca's area to the facial area of the motor cortex, and from there instructions are sent to facial motor neurons in the brainstem, which relay movement orders to facial muscles. # In order to read, information concerning the written text is sent from visual areas 17, 18, and 19 to the angular gyrus (area 39) and from there to Wernicke's area, for silent reading or, together with Broca's area, for reading out loud. This model is now obsolete. Nevertheless, it has been very useful in directing research and organizing research results, because it is based on the idea that language consists of two basic functions: comprehension, which is a sensory/perceptual function, and speaking, which is a motor function. However, the neural organization of language is more complex than the Wernicke‚ÄìGeschwind model of language suggests. The localization of speech in Broca's area is one of the weakest points of this model.Kolb & Whishaw: Fundamentals of Human Neuropsychology, 2003 ReferencesExternal links * http://www.umich.edu/~psycours/345/lecture11/sld025.htm Category:Auditory perception Category:Neurolinguistics ","title":"Wernicke‚ÄìGeschwind model"},{"id":"17982206","text":"Located in Rancho San Diego, Valhalla High School is a public high school operated by the Grossmont Union High School District with an enrollment of 2,112 students. The school is characterized by its school colors, orange and white, going by the nickname Orange Nation. During its existence, the school has won the California Distinguished School Award in both 2001 and 2003, and is also accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges. The school is directed by a principal, Mary Beth Kastan, who has been the principal since 2008, and three assistant principals. Several programs are available to students, including ASB, marching, jazz, and Orchestra bands, drama, colorguard, cheer, dance, and athletics such as football and Baseball, among other programs. History Upon opening in 1974, the school had a very different open campus atmosphere, with a college-like schedule. The school was centered around the main building, with open-air classrooms . Reflective of this, the original motto was \\"Freedom with Responsibility\\". During the 1980s, the school transitioned to a more traditional open campus, although some unique architecture elements remain. Campus Valhalla's main structure is a five-story octagonal building. Originally orange, the trim of the building was painted blue in 2009. Classrooms are situated along the outside wall and center of the building. The gymnasiums are freestanding. Sports facilities include a football and soccer field, baseball diamonds, basketball, tennis and volleyball courts, and two swimming pools. A new, freestanding, two-story building that house 12 science classrooms is currently in use. They have state of the art science and laboratory equipment. The building was proposed in order to make more room for teachers. It was dedicated in May 2010. Valhalla is one of few schools to have the own your own program which prepares students for life after high school. It is directed by Toni Myers GLBC In 2015, The main building was closed for renovation and repair the inner structure. Temporary classrooms took their place for humanities & elective classes. As of The 2016-17 School year, students have returned to the main building for instruction and the temporary classrooms have been removed. The Building has been modernized and now has a \\"21st Century feel.\\" Traditions Odin's March is the initiation for any new students or faculty members entering Valhalla High School. They must march up the stairs, through the rainbow bridge, and touch Thor's Hammer. When a student graduates, they descend the stairs and once again touches Thor's Hammer. This is also done for staff upon entry and exit from their tenure at Valhalla. On Fridays Valhalla students can wear orange to receive a free slice of pizza. Each year the senior class paints a mural that is permanently displayed and hung up inside the school building. Each mural is unique to the year in which that particular class attended including current events not normally related to the school itself.

Moreno and the Origins of Psychodrama, Encounter Culture, and the Social Network= In Moreno's latest work, Impromptu Man he explores the impact of his father, J.L Moreno's work in psychodrama, group therapy, and humanistic psychology on psychiatric treatment, societal organization, and, most remarkably, on social networks. This work is not only a biography of a largely unsung psychiatrist, but also an expansive overview of his influence on improvisational theater, group therapy, social reform, and networks within military, industry, schools and jails. J.L. Moreno discovered the underlying theory of Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn, social network, in 1932 when he drew his first sociogram, which mapped interactions between individuals and showed that, despite degrees of separation, individuals influenced others in their network. Daniel Goleman, a Harvard-trained psychologist, author of Emotional Intelligence: Why It Can Matter More Than IQ, and two time Pulitzer Prize nominee, stated, \\"Impromptu Man captures the remarkable impact of a singular genius, J.L. Moreno, whose creations‚Äîthe best-known being psychodrama‚Äîhave shaped our culture in myriad ways, many unrecognized. The record will be set straight for all time by this can‚Äôt-put-down biography, a tribute by Jonathan D. Moreno to his father‚Äôs masterly legacy.‚Äù =The Body Politic: The Battle Over Science in America= In The Body Politic, Moreno elucidates the cultural, political and societal underpinnings of biotechnology by tracing its history from early America to the present culture wars of the ‚Äúnew biology.‚Äù The book considers the intersection of society and biotechnology in areas such as embryonic stem cell research, reproductive cloning, and synthetic biology, and demonstrates how biology and society have shaped each other into modern-day biopolitics. Kirkus Reviews named \\"The Body Politic\\" as a \\"Best Book of 2011.\\" =Progress in Bioethics: Science, Policy and Politics= Progress in Bioethics is a compilation of essays that explore the politicization of modern-day bioethics. Experts consider the fundamental values of progressivism and conservatism in bioethics, and situate bioethical issues within the nuances of politics and culture in the United States. =Mind Wars: Brain Science and the Military in the 21st Century= The first book of its kind, Mind Wars covers the ethical dilemmas and bizarre history of cutting-edge technology and neuroscience developed for military applications. As the author discusses the innovative Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and the role of the intelligence community and countless university science departments in preparing the military and intelligence services for the twenty-first century, he also charts the future of national security. Fully updated and revised, this edition features new material on deep brain stimulation, neuro hormones, and enhanced interrogation. With in-depth discussions of Psychological Warfare ‚Äúpsyops‚Äù mind control experiments, drugs that erase both fear and the need to sleep, microchip brain implants and advanced prosthetics, supersoldiers and robot armies, Mind Wars may read like science fiction or the latest conspiracy thriller, but its subjects are very real and changing the course of modern warfare. =In the Wake of Terror: Medicine and Morality in a Time of Crisis= In the Wake of Terror presents essays on the complex moral questions that accompany societal concerns about terrorism and biological warfare. The essays, written by experts from the fields of medicine, health care policy, law, political science, history, philosophy, and theology, consider issues of civil liberties, medical experiments, and preparedness for future terrorist attacks. =Undue Risk: Secret State Experiments on Humans= Undue Risk is the first comprehensive study of the history and ethics of human experiments for national security purposes, from World War II to the First Gulf War and its aftermath. Topics covered include the Nazi doctors' trial, the Japanese medical experiments, the human radiation experiments, and biological warfare and chemical weapons testing. =Deciding Together: Bioethics and Moral Consensus= In Deciding Together, Moreno discusses the process of moral consensus and its place in societal value systems from social, philosophical, and historical perspectives. In this work, he also constructs his concept of bioethical naturalism, a naturalistic meta-philosophy that explains moral consensus through psychology and the consensus process .

Park facilities  Established as a Utah state park in 1960, the Anasazi State Park Museum is open year-round, and features a visitor center, a museum with examples of Anasazi pottery and other artifacts, a museum store, an auditorium, and picnic areas. There is no camping. It is located in Boulder, Utah, at the edge of Boulder Mountain. The park is focused around the reconstructed ruins of an ancient Anasazi village, referred to as the Coombs Village Site, which is located directly behind the museum. There is a self-guided trail visitors can take through the village with interpretive signs explaining the various features of the village, and the culture of the people who once lived there.  Archaeological Coombs Site  The Coombs Site is the site of one of the largest Anasazi communities known to have existed west of the Colorado River. The name Anasazi, Navajo for \\"Ancient Enemies,\\" or \\"Enemies of Our Ancestors\\" describes the Pueblo culture that existed in the Four Corners area from about 1 AD to 1300 AD. This village is believed to have been occupied from 1160 AD to 1235 AD. As many as 250 people lived there. The village is largely unexcavated, though there was a brief excavation during 1958 and 1959, conducted by the University of Utah as part of the Glen Canyon Dam Project. During that excavation, archeologists uncovered thousands of artifacts, and discovered a community of about 90 rooms divided into two separate one-story apartment complexes. An L-shaped building has been reconstructed and can be entered into by visitors. The cluster featured open shelters for working in the shade, storage pits, and adobe pit houses large enough for five or six residents. All together, about 100 structures have been found. Evidence, such as singed structural building supports, suggest that the town was abandoned after a village-wide fire. There was also a serious drought occurring in the region during that time that may have also been a factor.

The album collects together 18 of the group's biggest hit singles spanning the years 1981 to 1988, including their three number ones.  Background  The album was released in November 1988 on the Stylus record label, which had licensed the tracks from Bucks Fizz's record companies, RCA and Polydor. At the time, the group had just released the single \\"Heart of Stone\\", which became their 20th and final hit and was the only new song featured on this collection. Other tracks on the album are the bulk of the group's hit singles along with two album tracks. One notable omission however was \\"When We Were Young\\", one of the group's biggest hits. This was most likely because lead singer of the track, Jay Aston was no longer with the band. Another single, \\"You Love Love\\" from this album was released in 1989, but this was originally from their 1983 album, Hand Cut. Critical reception The album was reviewed in Number One magazine, where it gained a favourable response, saying that Bucks Fizz made unashamedly good music and listing tracks \\"The Land of Make Believe\\", \\"If You Can't Stand the Heat\\" and \\"Making Your Mind Up\\" as favourites.Kate Davies, Number One Magazine - Album reviews, January 1989 The same magazine had also claimed current single \\"Heart of Stone\\" to be a contender for the Christmas number one, although this proved to be way out in terms of time (October) and actual peak position (No.50). Commercial performance The album failed to chart despite TV advertising and was the last album Bucks Fizz released featuring this line-up.

Built about 1854, it is one of the city's finest early examples of Italianate architecture. In the early 20th century, it was the home of Charles Herbert Allen, a prominent local politician. Since 1957, it has been owned by the University of Massachusetts Lowell; restored in the 2000s, it houses a gallery and event space used for university programs. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. Description and history Allen House stands on the UMass Lowell South Campus. It is set on a rise above the Merrimack River, of which it has commanding views. It is an irregularly massed and somewhat rambling brick building, 2-1/2 stories in height, with a gabled roof. The gable ends are adorned with cloverleaf windows and there is brick drop ornamentation along the eaves. Some windows are set in round-arch openings. A bracketed Italianate porch is found on the front (east) side, and a Colonial Revival porch extends across part of the west side. The house was built in the early 1860s as the mansion house of Rollin White, who invented a type of rear-loading revolver. White worked for Samuel Colt in Hartford, Connecticut for many years before moving to Lowell and establishing his own firearms company, later the Lowell Arms Company. The house was later the home of Charles Herbert Allen, a politician prominent in state politics and the first civilian U.S. governor of Puerto Rico.

The region is also known as the Caja, Caja del Rio Plateau, and Cerros del Rio. The center of the area is approximately 15 miles (23 km) west of Santa Fe, New Mexico. Most of the Caja is owned by the United States Forest Service and managed by the Santa Fe National Forest. Access is through New Mexico Highway 599, Santa Fe County Road 62, and Forest Service Road 24. Geography The landscape of the Caja del Rio Plateau is generally flat to rolling terrain, with numerous steep cones rising up to 800 feet above the plains. The highest points in the immediate area are Cerro Micho (7,326 feet), Montoso Peak (7,315 feet), Ortiz Mountain (7,188 feet),Ortiz Mountain is a volcano northwest of Santa Fe, not to be confused with the Ortiz Mountains to the south of Santa Fe. Although shown with an elevation of 7,219 ft. on the 1993 Montoso Peak, N. Mex., USGS topographic map, it has been resurveyed at 7,188 ft. and Cerro Rito (7,296 feet) The entire plateau is within the watershed of the Rio Grande, although portions of the Caja drain into the larger river through two tributaries: the Santa Fe River and Ca√±ada Ancha. White Rock Canyon from Overlook Park, White Rock, New Mexico Virtually the entire perimeter of the Caja is ringed by cliffs or escarpments. White Rock Canyon forms the northwestern edge of the plateau. This canyon, through which the Rio Grande flows, has a maximum depth of over 1000 feet. Bandelier National Monument lies directly across the river to the west of the plateau. Along the eastern edge is Canada Ancha, an ephemeral stream that flows northward into the Rio Grande near Buckman. Another deep canyon (approximately 400 feet in depth) runs along the southern edge of the Caja, and is cut by the Santa Fe River. The canyon of the Santa Fe River separates the Caja from another land grant to the south: the Mesita de Juana Lopez Grant. The western edge of the plateau is a large escarpment which is easily visible to highway traffic traveling north on Interstate 25 from Albuquerque to Santa Fe. After crossing the Santo Domingo Basin and the reservations of Cochiti and Santo Domingo Pueblo, the freeway makes a steep climb up the escarpment along a stretch of highway known locally as La Bajada (Spanish: \\"the descent\\"). This part of the plateau is dominated by Tetilla Peak (7,203 feet). Geology The Caja del Rio plateau is a monogenetic volcanic field, which includes approximately 60 cinder cones, spatter cones, and basalt outflows. The volcanism can be explained by the field's location, which is very close to the intersection of the Rio Grande Rift and the Jemez Lineament. The Rio Grande Rift is a result of extensional, (or divergent) tectonic forces exerted upon the American Southwest. This feature runs southward from the vicinity of Leadville, Colorado, through the entire state of New Mexico, through the vicinity of El Paso, Texas, and into Chihuahua, Mexico. The Rift began forming approximately 30 million years ago during the late Oligocene Epoch. The Jemez Lineament is another, older feature, which also represents a linear weakness in the crust. The Lineament trends southwest to northeast, and underlies a string of volcanic features across Arizona and New Mexico. Those features include the San Carlos volcanic field, Springerville volcanic field, Zuni-Bandera volcanic field, Mount Taylor volcanic field and the Raton-Clayton volcanic field. These structural weaknesses create a thinned crust, and pathways for intrusion by magma originating in the mantle. The result has been a series of intercontinental basaltic eruptions.Sawyer, David A., Ralph R. Shroba, Scott A. Minor, and Ren A. Thompson (2002) U.S. Geological Survey Miscellaneous Field Studies Map MF-2352, Geologic Map of the Tetilla Peak Quadrangle, Santa Fe and Sandoval Counties, New Mexico Version 1.0 download The Caja is not the only volcanic feature in this part of New Mexico. Approximately 20 miles (32 km) to its northwest is the Valles Caldera, a spectacular caldera which lies at the heart of the Jemez Mountains. This mountain range has been created by a series of eruptions since the Miocene. The ages of the first eruptions are difficult to determine, since the older rocks have been almost entirely buried by the material from younger eruptions. The oldest exposed volcanic rocks in the vicinity are approximately 16 million years old. The Jemez area experienced an intense pulse of basalt volcanism between 9 and 11 million years ago. The lavas from this cycle had little silica, and originated in the mantle. Additional pulses of volcanism occurred between 7-10 million years ago, between 6-7 million years ago, between 3-6 million years ago, and between 2-3 million years ago. The last of these pulses is believed to have created the Cerros del Rio volcanic field, which covers the entire Caja del Rio Plateau. Several of the later eruptions involved not only basalts, but lavas made of rhyolite or dacite. Such lavas contain greater amounts of silica, and are more viscous than basalt. These eruptions created most of the highest peaks in the Jemez Mountains, including Chicoma Mountain (11,561 feet), and Polvadera Peak and Pajarito Mountain. Weathering of the igneous rocks resulted in alluvial fans, which spread eastward into the Rio Grande Rift. By 2 million years ago, the sediments had displaced the Rio Grande eastward from an earlier location near Los Alamos to its current location in White Rock Canyon. Two more eruptive cycles took place approximately 1.6 and 1.25 million years ago. The first eruption created the Toledo Caldera, but this feature was largely obliterated by the later Valles eruption. Each eruption involved pyroclastic flows and produced some of the welded tuff now found west of the Rio Grande. There have been numerous eruptions of sticky lavas in the last 1.25 million years ago, but all have been within the Valles Caldera. The most recent eruptions took place about 40-50,000 years ago, and formed the El Cajete Crater. This crater lies at the foot of Redondo Peak, a resurgent dome that rises to 11,254 feet within the Valles Caldera. Lying between White Rock Canyon and the rim of the Valles Caldera is the Pajarito Plateau, the many canyons of which have been cut by relatively recent erosion. Climate The climate of the Caja del Rio is arid and continental. The average daily maximum temperature at White Rock, New Mexico varies from 39.7 degrees Fahrenheit in January to 80.5 degrees in July. The average daily minimum temperature varies from 18.8 degrees in January to 54.4 degrees in July. That average annual maximum temperature is 60.0 degrees, with the average annual minimum at 35.8. The average annual precipitation is approximately 10-12 inches. Most of the annual precipitation is associated with summer thunderstorms, although the area also receives winter snow. Ecology Soils in the Caja del Rio are derived from Tertiary volcanic basalt flows and cinder cone eruptions. Most are best characterized as stony or cindery loam, with shallow horizons. Soil surveys of the Caja generally describe the soils as unsatisfactory, with a reduced potential for hydrologic and nutrient function. Three primary plant communities are frequently found on the Caja del Rio plateau: pinon-juniper savanna, pinon-juniper woodland, and Great Basin sage scrub. The most prevalent vegetative communities consist of a pinon (Pinus edulis) and juniper (Juniperus monosperma) overstory with a short grass understory. Tree densities often range between 100 and 300 trees per acre. Another large community consists of open grassland, with blue grama (Bouteloua gracilis), galleta (Pleuraphis jamesii), and various species of Stipa being the most common grasses. Common woody shrubs include chamisa (Chrysothamnus nauseosus), Apache plume (Fallugia paradoxa), four-wing saltbush (Atriplex canescens), and big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata). Predatory mammals known to live in the Caja del Rio include black bear (Ursus americanus), mountain lion (Felis concolor), bobcat (Lynx rufus), coyote (Canis latrans), fox (Vulpes spp.), gray fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteus), ringtail (Bassariscus astutus), badger (Taxidea taxus), long-tailed weasel (Mustela frenata), western spotted skunk (Spilogale gracilis), and striped skunk (Mephitis mephitis). Non-predatory mammals known to be present include Rocky Mountain elk (Cervus elaphus), mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus), raccoon (Procyon lotor), porcupine (Erethizon dorsatum), black-tailed jackrabbit (Lepus californicus), desert cottontail, (Sylvilagus auduboni), white-throated woodrat (Neotoma albigula), Botta's pocket gopher (Thomomys bottae), Colorado chipmunk (Neotamias quadrivittatus), pinyon mouse (Peromyscus truei), and deer mouse (Peromyscus spp.). Sensitive mammalian species known to be present at the Caja include Gunnison's prairie dog (Cynomys gunnisoni). A small herd of wild horses (consisting of approximately 50 individuals) lives year round on the plateau.

Livestock corrals at the Headquarters trailhead Human use and management Prehistoric Puebloans built dozens of village sites across the Caja del Rio and Pajarito plateaus. In contrast to its western neighbor, however, the canyon walls of the Caja are frequently made of basalt, rather than welded tuff. The latter material is much easier to excavate, and as a result, the Pajarito contains many more cliff houses. Both areas, however, contain countless petroglyphs. Most of them have been pecked into the ubiquitous basalt. Europeans founded Santa Fe in 1610. It is likely that use of the Caja del Rio for the grazing of domesticated livestock began shortly thereafter. From the beginning of colonization until the 19th century, subsistence users treated the plateau as common property, and used it for summer grazing and timber harvesting. During the mid-19th century, commercial livestock ranching increased throughout New Mexico. By the 1890s, grazing levels throughout the Territory were as high as 9 million animal units. This overuse, combined with severe droughts in 1891 and 1892, led to the loss of top soils and major vegetative changes. Among the vegetative changes were the replacement of more palatable forbs and grasses by woody shrubs and trees. At the beginning of the 20th century, the Forest Service began to address the problem of degraded rangelands. The new solutions included the reduction of grazing permits and the institution of range improvement programs. In 1935, the government purchased portions of the Caja del Rio Grant and the Majada Grant under the \\"Land Program\\" of the Federal Emergency Relief Administration. That acreage forms what is today the Caja del Rio Unit of the Santa Fe National Forest. Range surveys, maps, and a range management plan were completed by 1939. In the same year, the Soil Conservation Service assumed administration of the federal lands pursuant to a cooperative agreement among the Indian Services, Resettlement Administration, and the SCS. Responsibility for management was passed to the Forest Service in 1953. The Caja is now managed as a geographically distinct unit of the Espanola District of the Santa Fe National Forest. This unit consists of approximately 67,197 acres in 2010. The Taos Field Office of the Bureau of Land Management manages additional acreage just outside the forest unit. The Caja del Rio Allotment is now managed as a community grazing allotment. Beginning in 1941, most of the existing allotment improvement were repaired or reconstructed. From 1954 to 1972, the average actual use was 711 permitted cattle. In 2010, the Forest Service allows a maximum of 8,305 animal unit months. That capacity is divided among twelve permittees who graze 492 cow-calf pairs and 28 bulls on ten pastures, in a yearlong season. The allotment was restocked after 2002 due to drought, and has been below maximum rates since then. The allotment contains 18 earth tanks, 7 wells, 31 miles of pipelines, 14 drinking troughs, 10 storage tanks, and 77 miles of fencing. In 2006, the water supply was substantially improved by the completion of the Caja del Rio Pipeline. Points of interest From 2004, the Caja has been the focus of a grass roots campaign to develop recreational trail uses. The purpose of this campaign is to augment use of the Caja, rather than replacing grazing. The trail system is used primarily by mountain bike and horse riders.nnmha.com: Caja Trails Project, accessed 2008.06.17 =Wild horses= The United States Forest Service has designated Caja del Rio a Wild Horse Territory,fs.fed.us: Caja del Rio Wild Horse Territory, accessed 2008.06.17 and manages a herd of mustangs there. A separate band of feral horses in the vicinity is not managed; its members are thought to be domestic horses recently turned loose to fend for themselves. =Diablo Canyon= Caja del Rio Canyon (known locally as Diablo Canyon),LosAlamos.com: Diablo Canyon , accessed 2008.06.17 is a popular local rock climbing area on the northern section of Canada Ancha, near its confluence with the Rio Grande. This area can be accessed by Camino La Tierra and Old Buckman Road. Although the area is not marked, it has an undeveloped but very large parking area at its east end. The canyon walls include impressive trap rocks. The flat, sand bottom of the canyon is subject to spectacular flash floods during the summer monsoon season. The hike from Diablo Canyon to the Rio Grande is both scenic and easy White Rock Canyon. The wash is also popular with horse riders.Smith, Una (2008) New Mexico Horse Trails The Horsemen's Voice April 2008, page 12 After passing Diablo Canyon, Old Buckman Road continues to the site of Buckman, a former logging town and depot of the narrow gauge Chili Line.Martin, Craig (2002) 100 Hikes in New Mexico, pages 28‚Äì30. The Rio Grande can be forded in some seasons at Buckman. In fact, this crossing was a major transportation route between Santa Fe and the Pajarito Plateau. Diablo Canyon was a filming location for the 2007 film 3:10 to Yuma. =Caja trails= The Caja has around 100 miles of mapped trails,.Monroe, Deirdre C.

Mark Ratner (born November 1948 in New Jersey, United States) is an American game designer, notable for his work on Space Marines and Space Opera. Early life Ratner lived in New Jersey until he joined the Army in 1972. Dissatisfaction with existing games, such as Star Guard and Traveller, and his military experience led to the creation of Space Marines. FanTac In 1977 Mark formed FanTac Games primarily to market Space Marines. FanTac published 3 titles; Space Marines (a science-fiction wargame), Gi'ac My (a Vietnam wargame), and Orbit War (an interplanetary combat wargame). Mark was the author of Space Marines and he collaborated with Fitzhugh MacCrae and Bruce Lutz on Gi'ac My. He met Scott Bizar, the founder of Fantasy Games Unlimited, at Gen Con in 1977, and that meeting eventually led to the sale of the rights for Space Marines to FGU. Fantasy Games Unlimited After selling rights to FGU, Mark wrote a second edition of Space Marines. Scott Bizar wanted to produce a science-fiction role-playing game, and asked Edward E. Simbalist, Phil McGregor, and Ratner to develop it. Prior to publication the three had never met and the development was done by correspondence. However the collaboration with Mark turned out to be mostly Ed drawing on the material in Space Marines. While Mark was listed as an author for Space Opera and the Space Opera supplement \\"Ground & Air Equipment\\", he had very little input into the final product and seriously considered asking for his name to be removed from Space Opera entirely. Academia Ratner spent much of the 1980s as a college professor.

During the 2004, onsen scandal in which establishments made false statements concerning the source of their water, one ryokan was found to be charging customers for water they claimed was spring water. After the activities were confirmed, restitution was paid. The water for the Nagaragawa Onsen was starting to become brown and cloudy, the group started looking for new water sources in 1999, which they found within the city limits. In addition to using the newfound spring waters for their facilities, they also purchased land to build an onsen stand, at which they would sell the spring waters at retail prices. After complaints that emptying the underground spring would ruin the land and building foundations of the surrounding residents, the project was cancelled. Surrounding area Rotenburo atop Hotel Park, with Mount Kinka in the background The Nagaragawa Onsen are located on the northern side of Mount Kinka, near Gifu's urban center, so visitors can enjoy both city activities and the relaxing onsen.

These four strands associate into this structure because it maximizes the number of correct base pairs, with A's matched to T's and C's matched to G's. Image from Mao, 2004. Nucleic acid design is the process of generating a set of nucleic acid base sequences that will associate into a desired conformation. Nucleic acid design is central to the fields of DNA nanotechnology and DNA computing. It is necessary because there are many possible sequences of nucleic acid strands that will fold into a given secondary structure, but many of these sequences will have undesired additional interactions which must be avoided. In addition, there are many tertiary structure considerations which affect the choice of a secondary structure for a given design. Nucleic acid design has similar goals to protein design: in both, the sequence of monomers is rationally designed to favor the desired folded or associated structure and to disfavor alternate structures. However, nucleic acid design has the advantage of being a much computationally simpler problem, since the simplicity of Watson-Crick base pairing rules leads to simple heuristic methods which yield experimentally robust designs. Computational models for protein folding require tertiary structure information whereas nucleic acid design can operate largely on the level of secondary structure. However, nucleic acid structures are less versatile than proteins in their functionality. Nucleic acid design can be considered the inverse of nucleic acid structure prediction. In structure prediction, the structure is determined from a known sequence, while in nucleic acid design, a sequence is generated which will form a desired structure.  Fundamental concepts  complementary sequences, where the bases are matched into only A-T or G-C pairs. The structure of nucleic acids consists of a sequence of nucleotides. There are four types of nucleotides distinguished by which of the four nucleobases they contain: in DNA these are adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and thymine (T). Nucleic acids have the property that two molecules will bind to each other to form a double helix only if the two sequences are complementary, that is, they can form matching sequences of base pairs. Thus, in nucleic acids the sequence determines the pattern of binding and thus the overall structure. Nucleic acid design is the process by which, given a desired target structure or functionality, sequences are generated for nucleic acid strands which will self-assemble into that target structure. Nucleic acid design encompasses all levels of nucleic acid structure: * Primary structure--the raw sequence of nucleobases of each of the component nucleic acid strands; * Secondary structure--the set of interactions between bases, i.e., which parts of which strands are bound to each other; and * Tertiary structure--the locations of the atoms in three-dimensional space, taking into consideration geometrical and steric constraints. One of the greatest concerns in nucleic acid design is ensuring that the target structure has the lowest free energy (i.e. is the most thermodynamically favorable) whereas misformed structures have higher values of free energy and are thus unfavored. These goals can be achieved through the use of a number of approaches, including heuristic, thermodynamic, and geometrical ones. Almost all nucleic acid design tasks are aided by computers, and a number of software packages are available for many of these tasks. Two considerations in nucleic acid design are that desired hybridizations should have melting temperatures in a narrow range, and any spurious interactions should have very low melting temperatures (i.e. they should be very weak). There is also a contrast between affinity-optimizing \\"positive design\\", seeks to minimize the energy of the desired structure in an absolute sense, and specificity-optimizing \\"negative design\\", which considers the energy of the target structure relative to those of undesired structures. Algorithms which implement both kinds of design tend to perform better than those that consider only one type.  Approaches  Heuristic methods = Heuristic methods use simple criteria which can be quickly evaluated to judge the suitability of different sequences for a given secondary structure. They have the advantage of being much less computationally expensive than the energy minimization algorithms needed for thermodynamic or geometrical modeling, and being easier to implement, but at the cost of being less rigorous than these models. Sequence symmetry minimization is the oldest approach to nucleic acid design and was first used to design immobile versions of branched DNA structures. Sequence symmetry minimization divides the nucleic acid sequence into overlapping subsequences of a fixed length, called the criterion length. Each of the 4N possible subsequences of length N is allowed to appear only once in the sequence. This ensures that no undesired hybridizations can occur which have a length greater than or equal to the criterion length. A related heuristic approach is to consider the \\"mismatch distance\\", meaning the number of positions in a certain frame where the bases are not complementary. A greater mismatch distance lessens the chance that a strong spurious interaction can happen. This is related to the concept of Hamming distance in information theory. Another related but more involved approach is to use methods from coding theory to construct nucleic acid sequences with desired properties. = Thermodynamic models = Information about the secondary structure of a nucleic acid complex along with its sequence can be used to predict the thermodynamic properties of the complex. When thermodynamic models are used in nucleic acid design, there are usually two considerations: desired hybridizations should have melting temperatures in a narrow range, and any spurious interactions should have very low melting temperatures (i.e. they should be very weak). The Gibbs free energy of a perfectly matched nucleic acid duplex can be predicted using a nearest neighbor model. This model considers only the interactions between a nucleotide and its nearest neighbors on the nucleic acid strand, by summing the free energy of each of the overlapping two-nucleotide subwords of the duplex. This is then corrected for self-complementary monomers and for GC- content. Once the free energy is known, the melting temperature of the duplex can be determined. GC-content alone can also be used to estimate the free energy and melting temperature of a nucleic acid duplex. This is less accurate but also much less computationally costly. Software for thermodynamic modeling of nucleic acids includes Nupack, mfold/UNAFold, and Vienna. A related approach, inverse secondary structure prediction, uses stochastic local search which improves a nucleic acid sequence by running a structure prediction algorithm and the modifying the sequence to eliminate unwanted features. = Geometrical models = DNA tetrahedron described in Goodman, 2005. Models of this type are useful for ensuring that tertiary structure constraints do not cause excessive strain to the molecule. Geometrical models of nucleic acids are used to predict tertiary structure. This is important because designed nucleic acid complexes usually contain multiple junction points, which introduces geometric constraints to the system. These constraints stem from the basic structure of nucleic acids, mainly that the double helix formed by nucleic acid duplexes has a fixed helicity of about 10.4 base pairs per turn, and is relatively stiff. Because of these constraints, the nucleic acid complexes are sensitive to the relative orientation of the major and minor grooves at junction points. Geometrical modeling can detect strain stemming from misalignments in the structure, which can then be corrected by the designer. Geometric models of nucleic acids for DNA nanotechnology generally use reduced representations of the nucleic acid, because simulating every atom would be very computationally expensive for such large systems. Models with three pseudo-atoms per base pair, representing the two backbone sugars and the helix axis, have been reported to have a sufficient level of detail to predict experimental results. However, models with five pseudo-atoms per base pair, explicitly including the backbone phosphates, are also used. Software for geometrical modeling of nucleic acids includes GIDEON, Tiamat, Nanoengineer-1, and UNIQUIMER 3D. Geometrical concerns are especially of interest in the design of DNA origami, because the sequence is predetermined by the choice of scaffold strand. Software specifically for DNA origami design has been made, including caDNAno and SARSE. Applications Nucleic acid design is used in DNA nanotechnology to design strands which will self-assemble into a desired target structure. These include examples such as DNA machines, periodic two- and three-dimensional lattices, polyhedra, and DNA origami. It can also be used to create sets of nucleic acid strands which are \\"orthogonal\\", or non- interacting with each other, so as to minimize or eliminate spurious interactions. This is useful in DNA computing, as well as for molecular barcoding applications in chemical biology and biotechnology.

This inspired Bah√° º√≠s on their way to Australia in 1920 to stop in Samoa. Thirty four years later another Bah√° º√≠ from Australia pioneered to Samoa in 1954. With the first converts the first Bah√° º√≠ Local Spiritual Assembly was elected in 1961, and the Bah√° º√≠ National Spiritual Assembly was first elected in 1970. Following the conversion of the then Head of State of Samoa, King Malietoa Tanumafili II, the first Bah√° º√≠ House of Worship of the Pacific Islands was finished in 1984 and the Bah√° º√≠ community reached a population of over 3,000 in about the year 2000.  Early history  The first mention of the Samoan Islands in Bah√° º√≠ literature is in a series of letters, or tablets, to the followers of the religion in the United States in 1916‚Äì1917 by  ªAbdu'l‚ÄìBah√°, head of the religion until 1921 when he died, asking the followers of the religion to travel to other countries; these letters were compiled together in the book titled Tablets of the Divine Plan. The seventh of the tablets was the first to mention several island nations in the Pacific Ocean. Written on 11 April 1916, it was delayed in being presented in the United States until 1919 ‚Äì after the end of World War I and the Spanish flu. The seventh tablet was translated and presented by Mirza Ahmad Sohrab on 4 April 1919, and published in Star of the West magazine on 12 December 1919. > \\"A party speaking their languages, severed, holy, sanctified and filled with > the love of God, must turn their faces to and travel through the three great > island groups of the Pacific Ocean‚ÄîPolynesia, Micronesia and Melanesia, and > the islands attached to these groups, such as New Guinea, Borneo, Java, > Sumatra, Philippine Islands, Solomon Islands, Fiji Islands, New Hebrides, > Loyalty Islands, New Caledonia, Bismarck Archipelago, Ceram, Celebes, > Friendly Islands, Samoa Islands, Society Islands, Caroline Islands, Low > Archipelago, Marquesas, Hawaiian Islands, Gilbert Islands, Moluccas, > Marshall Islands, Timor and the other islands.

Shoghi Effendi, head of the religion after the death of  ªAbdu'l‚ÄìBah√°, launched the Ten Year Crusade and during this plan, 34 years after the first Bah√° º√≠s of Australia had stopped at Samoa, a woman named Lilian Wyss pioneered to Western Samoa from Australia in January 1954 leaving behind a position on the National Spiritual Assembly of Australia at the age of 24 while her brother, Frank Wyss, introduced the religion that year to the Cocos Island. For their service, Shoghi Effendi awarded both of them the accolade of Knight of Bah√° ºu'll√°h. Later she married and took the name Suhayl  ªAl√° º√≠. About this time Emmanuel Rock, one of the earliest Samoans to join the religion, did so prior to the beginning of the Ten Year Crusade. Simple Bah√° º√≠ literature was translated into the Samoan language about 1955 and into the language of Niue Island in 1956. At this time Bah√° º√≠ sources claim there were five Bah√° º√≠s known among the Samoa Islands. The first native believer Mrs. Lotoa Rock, Emmanuel Rock's wife, joined the religion in 1956. In late 1956 Saialala Tamasese was the second native to join the religion and the first Bah√° º√≠ Local Spiritual Assembly was elected in 1957 in Western Samoa with another five smaller groups of Bah√° º√≠s, followed by an assembly election in Samoa in 1961. Many of the early Bah√° º√≠s were well educated and some had Christian theological training and after conversion sometimes held positions of high office in the religion.  Developing community  Connections to and from the Bah√° º√≠s = From then events have multiplied involving the growing community. Starting on 29 October 1958 the first visit of a Hand of the Cause in the person of Enoch Olinga began an extended tour of the islands during which Olinga was honored with a Kava based ceremony. In 1959 the Bah√° º√≠s gathered in the first summer school with some 30 attendees and hosted by a local chief, purchased the first Bah√° º√≠ cemetery, and gathered with Samoans from both islands to consult on the growth of the religion on the islands. In 1962 the religion had reached the island of Savai'i and the first public talk on the religion was given in Apia ‚Äì which was extended to three additional talks and Hand of the Cause Collis Featherstone visited Bah√° º√≠s and civic leaders. In 1963 the assembly of Pago Pago arranged the first observance of United Nations Day which had the acting governor and other leading figures giving talks. Coverage of the event was carried by print, radio and television media leading up to the event in general and of the Bah√° º√≠s hosting. In 1964 a conference on Fiji which included Bah√° º√≠s from Tonga, Samoa, New Guinea and Fiji. Immediately following the first convention was held to elect the regional national assembly of South Pacific Ocean. Bah√° º√≠s continued to come and began to leave from Samoa. Also in 1965 the first Samoan pioneer returned to the island of his birth ‚Äì the Tokelau Islands. It was three years before authorities allowed him to promulgate his religion. Samoan Auxiliary Board member Niuoleava Tuataga toured Australia giving talks to Bah√° º√≠s and Australian society on the religion in 1967. Russell Garcia and Gina, his wife, visited many islands among Samoa in 1967 and others giving concerts and classes in schools for several years before ultimately moving to New Zealand. In 1969 Samoan Bah√° º√≠ women stretched social norms by personally taking trips to attempt to spread the religion. From December 1969 into January 1970 the first international youth conference of the south pacific took place in Apia drawing attendees from Samoa. Australia, Fiji, Hawaii, New Caledonia, New Zealand, Tonga, United States, and Western Samoa. Hand of the Cause Abu'l-Q√°sim Faizi attended and gave talks both to the attendees and to the public afterwards. In 1970 the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bah√° º√≠s of Samoa was elected at a convention hosting Hand of the Cause of God Collis Featherstone, Continental Board of Counsellors member Suhayl Ala'i, Auxiliary Board member Niuoleava Tuataga, the nine delegates and over fifty members of the religion from both Western and American Samoa. The elected members of the national assembly were from both Western and American Samoa. = Contact with civilian leaders = In an event that would have long range effects on the community in 1965 Tamasese, one of the first native Bah√° º√≠s of Samoa, died and at the funeral members of a royal family of Samoa were present at the Bah√° º√≠ funeral. According to tradition, a fine mat is presented to the presiding officer of the funeral which in this case was an Auxiliary Board member. This mat was presented to the Universal House of Justice in 1968. This same mat was gifted to the King at the dedication of the temple in 1979. Meanwhile, cooperation with the government of Samoa expanded. In 1967 Bah√° º√≠s presented Bah√° º√≠ literature to the kings of Tonga and Samoa with more planned for leaders of government. In 1967 the government of Samoa sponsored the observance of United Nations Day. In years past it had been the Baha'i community of American Samoa that had sponsored the observance, with the aid of the government of American Samoa. This year Governor Aspinall appointed a United Nations Day Committee which included the chairman of the National Spiritual Assembly of the South Pacific Ocean, Suhayl Ala'i, as member of the Committee for Iran. Mr. Ala'i made suggestions resulting in the inclusion of the Baha'i prayer for unity in the program and the committee secured the services of Hand of the Cause Ugo Giachery as guest speaker. By 1968 King Malietoa Tanumafili II of Samoa privately converted to the religion and announced it publicly in 1973 when he wrote a letter to the convention to elect the Universal House of Justice. The Universal House of Justice asked Bah√° º√≠s individually to not seek publicity of the issue at the time. In 1974 King Malietoa Tanumafili II attended the national convention and congratulated work on construction of a Bah√° º√≠ center and KVZK-2 recorded a series of three 15-minute programs to be broadcast as part of its daily show Talosaga. In 1976 the national assembly was registered with the United States, the first Bah√° º√≠ center on Tutuila was raised, and King Tanumafili visited the grave of Shoghi Effendi. In 1986 as part of a series of events (see below) highlighting the importance of peace the Bah√° º√≠s had meetings with the American Samoan Speaker of the House and the prime minister of Western Samoa attended including a presentation of the statement by the Universal House of Justice called The Promise of World Peace. In 1987 the Bah√° º√≠s helped celebrate the 25th anniversary of the independence of Western Samoa with a commemoration at the Bah√° º√≠ House of Worship which included a surprise unveiling of a large portrait of king Tanumafili, and at a parade for the anniversary Bah√° º√≠s won third place in a contest of floats. At the 27th anniversary Bah√° º√≠s double purposed the celebration with a service dedicated to World Environment Day which was followed by talks by Bah√° º√≠s and head of the Forestry Division of the federal Environmental Program and Tafaese Lautua, a member of Parliament, also thanked the Bah√° º√≠s on behalf of the minister of Lands and Survey/Park Preservation. At the 50th anniversary of the reign of king Tanumafili II a parade in which 40 Baha'is marched for the review of the Malietoa and his guest, the king of Tonga as well as entered a float in a parade depicting the oneness of mankind, which placed second in the judging. The float held the grandson of the king who is also a Bah√° º√≠. = Organization and growth = In 1977 three summer schools were held in Samoa, one in each of the major islands of Savai'i, Tutuila and Upolu, replacing the usual central summer school held in Lelata, Apia, and the same year the first national children's conference took place. At that time eight of ten planned local centers had been built and there were at least 24 local assemblies. In 1978 the annual convention had 30 delegates to elect the national assembly ‚Äì and the elected members of that year were Sam Ale Ale, Moli Chang, Reuben Busby, Lilian Ala'i, Fuiono Aniseto, Lina Kava, Khosrow Moghelpour, Fili Pe'epe'e and Leala Tasi. In 1978 an award was given to Bah√° º√≠ youth and children who took part in the Samoan Arts Festival; following Bah√° º√≠ laws the money award was donated to a humanitarian agency. In 1979 the Bah√° º√≠s of Samoa in cooperation with Russ and Gina Garcia produced a film commemorating the International Year of the Child that was shown on television several times in Samoa. In 1981 one hundred fifty people from Samoa, Tuvalu, the Cook Islands, Kiribati, New Zealand and the United States attended a women's conference in Samoa that was planned to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the death of Bahiyyih Kh√°num. Speakers included the wife and sister of the king of Samoa, and the wife of the prime minister of the Cook Islands and a Maori woman from New Zealand. = Coordinated efforts = Since its inception the religion has had involvement in socio‚Äìeconomic development beginning by giving greater freedom to women, promulgating the promotion of female education as a priority concern, and that involvement was given practical expression by creating schools, agricultural coops, and clinics. The religion entered a new phase of activity when a message of the Universal House of Justice dated 20 October 1983 was released. Bah√° º√≠s were urged to seek out ways, compatible with the Bah√° º√≠ teachings, in which they could become involved in the social and economic development of the communities in which they lived. World‚Äìwide in 1979 there were 129 officially recognized Bah√° º√≠ socio‚Äìeconomic development projects. In 1983 the national assembly sponsored a conference on rural development for one hundred‚Äìten people from Upolu, Savaii and Tutuila, at Lelata. In 1986, in addition to an observance held at the Bah√° º√≠ House of Worship, (see below), the Bah√° º√≠s sponsored a peace essay contest where Certificates of recognition were given to each of 36 finalists and monetary prizes awarded to seven winners. At the ceremony, Lt. Governor Faleomavaega Eni Hunkin and Counsellor Suhayl Ala'i spoke about peace. The Bah√° º√≠s also held a conference on Family Welfare and Management with a talk by Western Samoa's assistant secretary for the Ministry of Youth, Sports and Culture, and other talks with 200 Baha'is in attendance. By 1987 worldwide the number of officially recognized development projects had increased to 1482. Samoan Bah√° º√≠ youth began to be noticed in the development of the community ‚Äì three youth were sponsored in 1985 for the International Youth Year and participated in United Nations and international projects. By the 1990s there were Samoan youth workshops (see Oscar DeGruy) performing internationally. = Bah√° º√≠ House of Worship = The site of the future temple was celebrated in 1976 with a gathering of over one hundred Bah√° º√≠s and children who sang songs and said prayers for four days. Twenty five years after the first Bah√° º√≠ settled in the islands of Samoa the Bah√° º√≠ House of Worship in Tiapapata, 8 km from Apia, Samoa, had its cornerstone set in 1979. It was completed in 1984 and serves as the Mother Temple of the Pacific Islands. After three days of talks and celebrations, the Temple was also later dedicated by King Malietoa Tanumafili II of Samoa who was the first reigning Bah√° º√≠ monarch. Hand of the Cause R√∫h√≠yyih Khanum was also present at the laying of the cornerstone and its dedication. More than 500 Bah√° º√≠s attended at the laying of the cornerstone and guests included members of the family of the king; representatives of 16 national assemblies; heads of several departments of the Samoan government and representatives of the churches of Samoa. At the dedication more than 1,000 Bah√° º√≠s from 45 countries and islands with civic leaders including the king and prime minister and other officials. The structure is completely open to the island breezes.Statement on the History of the Bah√° º√≠ Temple of Samoa The lands of the Temple are also the resting place of Hand of the Cause Ugo Giachery. Perhaps the first large event held at the temple was a special service in 1985 to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the United Nations and to launch the UN International Year of Peace. Among the guests at the service were the king and members of his family including Princess Tooa Salamasina Malietoa; the New Zealand High Commissioner; the Chinese ambassador; consuls from France, the Netherlands, and the United States; and other diplomatic dignitaries. The UN's resident Representative was present, as was the UNESCO Representative and most of the UN personnel in Samoa. Some of the dependencies of a Bah√° º√≠ House of Worship have also been developed ‚Äî ‚Äì a cemetery and school have been set.  Modern community  Across Samoa and American Samoa there are Bah√° º√≠ communities in Puleia, Papa‚Äìi‚ÄìPalauli‚Äìle‚ÄìFalefa, Sasina, Pu'apu'a, Faleasi'u‚ÄìUta, Faeasi'u‚ÄìTai, Laleta, Lepea, Pago Pago, Iliili, Tafuna, and Leone. The Bah√° º√≠s of Samoa numbered too few to show up in the 2001 national census. The shared estimate of the Bah√° º√≠ population in Samoa circa 2000 according to a profile by the World Council of Churches and the online encyclopedia Encarta was 2% of the nation ‚Äì some 3600 people ‚Äì and the only non-Christian community of any number. There are, however, some reports of oppression of the community. The Samoan Bah√° º√≠ Charitable Trust for Social and Economic Development was established in 1990 and produced Samoa's first television series dedicated to a healthy diet, \\"O le Kuka Samoa,\\" on 16 October 2000 with Samoan comedian Sumeo, alias \\"O le King Kuka,\\" and was aimed at rejuvenating Samoan cultural food practices to help provide better nutrition as well as reliance on local resources.Baha ºi Charitable Trust , by Sungo Ilo, 20 September 2011 The Bah√° º√≠ community also maintains five Bah√° º√≠ pre‚Äìschools across all the islands of Samoa, gains converts, attracts skilled professionals, and a national youth committee is coordinating volunteer youth to come and serve in the Samoan Bah√° º√≠ community. = 50th Anniversary = Representatives of the National Assemblies of Australia, the Cook Islands, Fiji, Hawaii, New Zealand, and Tonga as well as other dignitaries of the religion and Bah√° º√≠s from the islands of Savai'i and Upolu and Bah√° º√≠ members of the royal family ‚Äì King Malietoa Tanumafili II of Samoa and daughter Susuga To'oa Tosi Malietoa ‚Äì attended the celebration of the 50th anniversary of the Bah√° º√≠s Faith in Samoa in 2004 along with various members of the government of Samoa who highlighted many of the services the Bah√° º√≠s have given to the general community. = Head of State Malietoa Tanumafili II of Samoa = On the passing of Head of State Malietoa Tanumafili II of Samoa in 2007, the international governing body of the Bah√° º√≠s, the Universal House of Justice wrote: \\"His service to the people of Samoa as Head of State was distinguished by the high principles, genuine compassion and personal humility that characterized the constancy of his concern for the welfare of all. As the first reigning sovereign to accept the Message of Bah√° ºu'll√°h, he set a record that will forever illumine the annals of our Faith, one that future generations will increasingly extol. His great interest for well‚Äìnigh four decades in the Faith's progress was reflected in the enthusiastic affirmation of his belief whenever the opportunity presented itself and in the abiding joy with which he regarded the construction in 1984 of the Mother Temple of the Pacific Islands in Samoa....\\"  See also  * History of Samoa * History of American Samoa * Religion in Samoa  References  External links  * Official Website of the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bah√° º√≠s of Samoa * Official Website of the Temple * More information on the Temple and its history S ","title":"Bah√° º√≠ Faith in the Samoas"},{"id":"17982928","text":"Horse-drawn buggy painted in the Mennonite style, such as the Groffdale Church would use. The Groffdale Conference Mennonite Church, also called Wenger Mennonites, is the largest Old Order Mennonite group to use horse-drawn carriages for transportation. Along with the automobile, they reject many modern conveniences, while allowing electricity in their homes and steel- wheeled tractors to till the fields. Initially concentrated in eastern Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, their numbers had grown to 22,305 people resided in eight other states as of 2015. They share the pulpit with the Ontario (Old Order) Mennonite Conference but have some differences in Ordnung.  History  The Groffdale Conference Mennonites have their roots in the Anabaptist movement of Switzerland and Southwest Germany, including the German-speaking Alsace, that came under French rule starting in the 17th century. In the first two centuries or so this movement was known by the name Swiss Brethren but later adopted the name Mennonite. = Anabaptist beginnings = Spread of the early Anabaptists, 1525‚Äì1550 The early history of the Mennonites starts with the Anabaptists in the German and Dutch-speaking parts of central Europe. These forerunners of modern Mennonites were part of the Protestant Reformation, a broad reaction against the practices and theology of the Roman Catholic Church. Its most distinguishing feature is the rejection of infant baptism, an act that had both religious and political meaning since almost every infant born in western Europe was baptized into the Roman Catholic Church. Other significant theological views of the Mennonites developed in opposition to Roman Catholic views or to the views of other Protestant reformers such as Martin Luther and Huldrych Zwingli. Some of the followers of Zwingli's Reformed church thought that requiring church membership beginning at birth was inconsistent with the New Testament. They believed that the church should be completely removed from government (the proto‚Äìfree church tradition), and that individuals should join only when willing to publicly acknowledge belief in Jesus and the desire to live in accordance with his teachings. At a small meeting in Zurich on January 21, 1525, Conrad Grebel, Felix Manz, and George Blaurock, along with twelve others, baptized each other. Despite strong repressive efforts of the state churches, the movement spread slowly around western Europe, primarily along the Rhine. Officials killed many of the earliest Anabaptist leaders in an attempt to purge Europe of the new sect. Menno Simons In the early days of the Anabaptist movement, Menno Simons, a Catholic priest in the Low Countries, heard of the movement and started to rethink his Catholic faith. In 1536, at the age of 40, Simons left the Roman Catholic Church. He soon became a leader within the Anabaptist movement, and was wanted by authorities for the rest of his life. His name became associated with scattered groups of nonviolent Anabaptists whom he helped to organize and consolidate. = Migration to North America = In the 18th century, about 100,000 Germans mainly from the Palatinate emigrated to Pennsylvania, where they became known collectively as the Pennsylvania Dutch. Of these immigrants, around 2,500 were Mennonites and 500 were Amish. These two groups settled mainly in southeast Pennsylvania, many of them in the Lancaster and adjacent counties. During the Colonial period, Mennonites were distinguished from other Pennsylvania Germans in three ways:Samuel Floyd Pannabecker: Open Doors: A History of the General Conference Mennonite Church, Newton, Kansas, 1975, page 12. their opposition to the American Revolutionary War, which other German settlers participated in on both sides; resistance to public education; and disapproval of religious revivalism. Contributions of Mennonites during this period include the idea of separation of church and state, and opposition to slavery. From 1812 to 1860, another wave of Mennonite immigrants from Europe settled farther west in Ohio, Indiana, Illinois and Missouri. These Mennonites, along with another wave of Amish, came from Switzerland, Southwest Germany and the Alsace-Lorraine area. = Old Order Movement = The Groffdale Conference has its roots in the Old Order divisions, that occurred in Indiana in 1872, and in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, in 1893, over the question of English language preaching, Sunday Schools and other questions. The trigger for the split in Lancaster County was a quarrel about a pulpit, that was to be installed in church instead of the traditional preacher's table.Stephen Scott: An Introduction to Old Order: and Conservative Mennonite Groups, Intercourse, PA 1996, pages 20-24. The modernizing trends that changed the form of religious practice were pushed among the Mennonites especially by two men: John F. Funk and John S. Coffman. The Groffdale Conference Mennonites still call modernized Mennonites Funkeleit, that is Funk people.Donald B. Kraybill and James P. Hurd: Horse- and-Buggy Mennonites - Hoofbeats of Humility in a Postmodern World, University Park, PA, 2006, page 24. The traditional minded people left the old conferences to form new ones, not the modernizers.Old Order Mennonites at Global Anabaptist Mennonite Encyclopedia Online. = The emergence of the Groffdale Conference = The Groffdale Conference arose in 1927 at the conclusion of a seventeen-year disagreement within the Weaverland Old Order Mennonite Conference, over use of the automobile.Donald B. Kraybill and James P. Hurd: Horse-and-Buggy Mennonites - Hoofbeats of Humility in a Postmodern World, University Park, PA, 2006, pages 63-74. Five hundred of the more traditional members of the Weaverland conference, about half of the congregation, formed this group in order to retain horse-drawn transportation. The name of the conference comes from the Groffdale churchhouse where Joseph O. Wenger led the first worship services.Donald B. Kraybill and James P. Hurd: Horse-and-Buggy Mennonites - Hoofbeats of Humility in a Postmodern World, University Park, PA, 2006, page 21. = Further history = The John W. Martin Mennonites, a group of Old Order Mennonites from Indiana, merged with the Groffdale Conference in 1973. In 1974 a new settlement in Yates County, New York, was started. It grew quickly and steadily and with a population of more than 3,000 in 2015 it was almost as large as the Lancaster County settlement. The Wenger Mennonites (\\"Joe Wengers\\", \\"Wengerleit\\", \\"Fuhre Mennischte\\") or Groffdale Conference Mennonites experienced several smaller splits during their history: * 1942: Dozens of members refrained from communion because of the CPS issue, later several more conservative Old Order groups were founded or joined by these people: directly founded: Reidenbach Mennonites, joined: Phares Stauffer Pike Mennonites, then Aaron Martin Pike Mennonites and further groups in Snyder County- * 1990s: Electricity issues and permission for the ministry as for the laity before also created a separate group: John Martin (Groffdale Conference) Mennonites. This group never grew much. * 1993: Steel Wheel issues also were almost creating a split around 1993 when the rubber belt issue was at its height, the steel wheel issue also played oftentimes a role in conflicts with the state(see Mitchell Couty vs. Zimmerman). * 2000s: After decades of trying to establish a well-grounded and growing(which never happened) ultraconservative Groffdale Conference Mennonite subgroup(moving therefore from counties in Penna to Kentucky), Jacob Oberholtzer after becoming finally bishop in Casey County split off. This group is located close to Spencer, Tennessee currently after moving away from Casey County. All these former splits were smaller ones, in 2019 a big one happened: * 2019: The split resulted from the computer issue in 2019, while several other reasons played also a role in it. This effected Missouri, Kentucky, New York and Indiana, where bishops, preachers and deacons left the Wenger Mennonites with a big amount of laity, but still minority and formed a loosely connected Midwest Conference. In 2016 already some problems were made public when a bishop of Missouri added some pages to the annual printing of Calendars and later this edition had to be destroyed and a second printing was distributed to the laity (of course without these pages).Some of the conservative split-offs before and even some Stauffer Mennonite current split-offs (Arthur Martin movement) work together with the new formed Midwest Conference.  Belief and practice  The black carriages of the Wenger Mennonites distinguish them from the Amish in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, who use gray ones.Donald B. Kraybill and James P. Hurd: Horse-and-Buggy Mennonites - Hoofbeats of Humility in a Postmodern World, University Park, PA, 2006, pages 2-3. They are mainly rural people, who work small farms. Initially concentrated in eastern Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, they resided in eight other states as of 2002.Landis 1959. Church members use modern self-propelled farm machinery and lawn mowers that have been refitted with steel wheels. Starting in the 1970s, some farmers used rubber belts and blocks to give wheels more traction, provide a smoother ride and reduce damage to public roads. This practice caused considerable debate within the community, which was resolved in 1999 with a compromise that allows limited use of rubber in the structure of steel wheels.Donald B. Kraybill and James P. Hurd: Horse-and-Buggy Mennonites - Hoofbeats of Humility in a Postmodern World, University Park, PA, 2006, Chapter 3, Mobility and Identity, pages 63-89. Hard rubber or pneumatic tires are allowed on bicycles and machinery not requiring a driver, such as walk-behind equipment and wagons. Use of steel wheels ensures tractors are not used as a substitute for automobiles to run errands or to make more extensive trips than are convenient with horse-drawn carriages. The steel wheel rule prevents large agricultural operations, reinforcing an emphasis on small farms that provide manual labor for all of the family members. The German language is used for Bible reading and singing in worship services and Pennsylvania German is used in worship services for preaching and is spoken at home and with other Old Orders.Groffdale Old Order Mennonite Conference at Global Anabaptist Mennonite Encyclopedia Online. They meet in plain church buildings to worship, but do not have Sunday schools. Practicing nonresistance like other traditional Mennonite groups, during World War II they advised young men not qualifying for a farm deferment to accept jail terms instead of Civilian Public Service, the alternate used by other Anabaptist conscientious objectors. Population and distribution The group consisted of about 500 members in their beginning in 1927 and grew to about 1,200 members in 1954.Landis 1957. In 1957 there were 1,450 members.Old Order Mennonites at Global Anabaptist Mennonite Encyclopedia Online. In 1992 the estimated membership grew to 5,464.Stephen Scott: An Introduction to Old Order: and Conservative Mennonite Groups, Intercourse, PA 1996, page 30. As of 2002, the conference has grown to 49 congregations with 8,542 members and a total population of 17,775, with 20% and 66% of population below 5 years and below 21 years respectively. In 2008/9 membership reached 10,000 in 50 congregations. In 2015 the group had a total population of 22,305 people of which 9,620 lived in Pennsylvania, 3,934 in New York, 2,395 in Wisconsin, 1,805 in Ohio, 1,545 in Missouri, 1,112 in Kentucky, 995 in Indiana, 600 in Iowa and 300 in Michigan.Simon J. Bronner and Joshua R. Brown (edit.): Pennsylvania Germans: An Interpretive Encyclopedia, Baltimore, 2017, pages 126-7. The population has an annual growth rate of 3.7 percent, doubling about every 19 years, and is comparable to the growth rate of the Old Order Amish. See also * John W.

A traffic park is also called a transportation park or traffic garden or safety village depending on locale. Traffic parks are frequently created as an attraction within a larger park. In other cases, they are single-use parks and often small in scale. They can be found in urban as well as rural areas. Children are allowed to use bicycles or pedal-powered cars to navigate the streets and operate according to traffic laws. Sometimes they share a buggy with their parent, who can provide guidance as they circle the park. Typically, traffic parks are scaled-down versions of real street networks, with the lane and street-width proportional to the smaller vehicles. Often they include operating traffic signals and during busy times are even staffed with traffic police. One of the intentions of the traffic park is to improve awareness of traffic safety among school-aged children. Many traffic parks enable children to gain hands-on experience crossing streets and with bicycle or other pedestrian safety challenges in a highly controlled environment devoid of actual motor vehicles. Traffic parks exist throughout Asia, Europe, and North America. Traffic parks in Asia and Europe are focused on traffic safety through pedal-powered vehicles. In the United States and Canada they use bicycles as well as electric, motorized vehicles. These North American parks are called safety villages, because of broader emphasis on safety for fire, electrical, food and other educational purposes. In the United Kingdom parks are called experiential safety and lifeskills centres, with education mainly delivered indoors in life-sized sets.

It has been found to act as both a mu opioid agonist and an NMDA antagonist, both of which are mechanisms of action shared with commonly used painkillers (morphine and ketamine respectively, and which occur concurrently in the clinical analgesics tramadol and levorphanol). Hodgkinsine is a trimer composed of three pyrrolidinoindoline subunits, with the monomer closely resembling another alkaloid eseroline which has similar bioactivity.

Early life Eugene List was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He spent his formative years in Los Angeles, where his father Louis List (originally Lisnitzer) was a language teacher in the Los Angeles Unified School District and his mother, Rose, a pharmacist. Louis Lisnitzer had immigrated to America from Odessa, Ukraine and settled in Philadelphia, where he met and married Rose, whose family had also come from the same region. In 1937, Louis decided officially to change his name and that of his family to \\"List\\". The family soon relocated to California. Showing early musical talent, young Eugene studied with Julius V. Seyler who soon proclaimed him a prodigy. His striking musical gifts were obvious. In 1929, at the age of 12, he performed with the Los Angeles Philharmonic under Artur Rodzi≈Ñski, playing Beethoven's 3rd Piano Concerto. Rodzi≈Ñski recommended that he go to Philadelphia to study with the renowned teacher Olga Samaroff. In 1932 she accepted young List with great enthusiasm. Too young for the Juilliard School, List first studied at the Philadelphia Conservatory under Samaroff's tutelage, transferring a few years later to Juilliard in New York. During his second year with Madam Samaroff at Philadelphia (1934), List entered and won Philadelphia's annual piano competition, giving him the opportunity to perform with Philadelphia's celebrated orchestra. Although he had planned to perform the Schumann Piano Concerto in A minor, List was given the most stunning challenge of his career. Six weeks before the scheduled concert, Leopold Stokowski asked him to play the premiere of Piano Concerto No. 1 by Dmitri Shostakovich that he had just received from the Soviet Union. List accepted the challenge and learned the new concerto within the six-week time frame. Concert career At the age of sixteen, Eugene List's official concert career began in December 1934 at Philadelphia's Academy of Music. Although under great stress, he delivered a dazzling performance and received rave reviews. He was declared the wunderkind and a mature artist almost immediately. List's performance as the young American who met Stokowski's challenge established him as a star, a status that would stay with him the rest of his fifty-year career. As the only pianist in America who knew Shostakovich's Piano Concerto No. 1 concerto, he received many more invitations to appear with major orchestras in the US, including the New York Philharmonic under conductor Otto Klemperer. His celebrity status spanned four continents, including Europe, South America and Asia. In the US, he performed with most all the nation's major orchestras, conductors and leading chamber ensembles. List's personality was known to be personable and unpretentious, uncommon qualities in the performing concert world. Everyone liked him. Conductors, composers, colleagues, students and even presidents valued his modest demeanour, his intellect, and his quick wit. =World War II= In December 1941, after the attack on Pearl Harbor, List enlisted in the Army without waiting for his formal call-up, asking only that he be allowed to finish the season, since he was committed to several concert dates. In March 1942, the Army assigned List, aged 26, to the New York Port of Embarkation, Brooklyn, where he was given an office job as a typist. In 1943, he married the well-known violinist, Carroll Glenn, in New York, whom he had met at Juilliard. Like her husband, Glenn was a prodigy. She had already won the prestigious Naumburg Competition, which gave her a New York debut and helped to launch her illustrious career. List was soon assigned to the Special Services, a post he had wanted since his enlistment. He performed concerts in the New York area, where all his fees went to the Army Emergency Relief. In 1945, he was sent oversees along with other enlisted entertainers. He was sent to the Paris suburb of Chatou, where he joined a collection of GI talent, including Mickey Rooney, violinist Stuart Canin, modern dancer Jos√© Lim√≥n, Bobby Breen and Josh Logan. Later, both Canin and List were ordered to start an orchestra. This eventually became the famous Seventh Army Symphony Orchestra. In June 1945, Canin and List were ordered to Potsdam, Germany where they were told to play for the President and his staff at the Potsdam Conference. Soon they learned the occasion was to play for President Harry S. Truman, Joseph Stalin and Winston Churchill, including their large entourage at the Big Three conference. Both musicians performed for the President and the conference members for the next few weeks, with President Truman even turning the pages for List when he was asked to play the Chopin Waltz in A-flat, Op. 42, a work he did not have memorized. Both musicians were astounded at the headlines in the papers and the star-studded celebrity status they had acquired. List soon became known as the \\"Pianist of the Presidents\\" or \\"The Potsdam Pianist.\\" List would perform many more times at the White House, the last in 1980 for President and Mrs. Carter. =Post-war career= List's post-war concert career flourished, even gaining him a role in a movie, The Bachelor's Daughter. In 1964, he and his wife Carroll Glenn joined the faculty at Eastman School of Music in Rochester, New York. Both husband and wife would teach in Rochester until 1975 before they returned to New York, where Glenn taught violin at Queens College and the Manhattan School of Music. List joined the faculty at NYU as a part-time teacher, and for two years‚Äî1983‚Äì85‚Äîtraveled by plane twice a month to teach at Carnegie Mellon in Pittsburgh. Like his former teacher Olga Samaroff, List guided his students to form their own sound and interpretation as long as it was valid to the score and intent of the composer. He stimulated their imagination and urged them to explore the vast piano repertoire. In addition to his advocacy for playing and recording American music, List also recorded the Carlos Ch√°vez Concerto with the composer conducting. In 1975, he recorded Shostakovich's two concertos in Russia, with the composer's son, Maxim, conducting. List's great interest in Louis Moreau Gottschalk's music led to his recreation of the composer's Monster Concerts, where he featured many pianos and pianists playing together on stage. List recreated the Monster Concerts at Eastman in 1970. They were televised on The Ed Sullivan Show with 10 pianos, nine student pianists and List. He continued the Monster Concert agenda through the 1970s and into the early 1980s, including a performance at UCLA in collaboration with Henri Temianka and some 36 pianists, and a performance at Brooklyn College in 1980 in collaboration with students of Agustin Anievas. Death In April 1983, Carroll Glenn's earlier bout with cancer suddenly returned. Several days later, she slipped into a coma. At that same time, List was scheduled to perform the Vincent Persichetti Concerto in Carnegie Hall. The next morning, after the Carnegie Hall concert, Carroll Glenn died. Only two years later, on March 1, 1985, while at home planning his own 50th anniversary concert in Carnegie Hall, List accidentally fell on the stairway of his New York brownstone and was killed. An autopsy revealed he died instantly of a broken neck. During their forty-two year marriage, Eugene List and Carroll Glenn raised two daughters, Rachel and Allison, while actively pursuing their respective concert and teaching careers.

History  Stubber Priory was a small Benedictine house isolated in the sand hills of far western Jutland. The priory was built on an island in Stubber Lake (Danish:Stubbers√∏en) connected to the mainland by an earthen causeway. Today the lake has been partially filled in and the site of the abbey is now part of the mainland. The island was large enough to build the small abbey, church, a farm, outbuildings, barn, and cemetery. Establishing the date for the establishment of Stubber Priory is very difficult due to a lack of records which were destroyed when the priory was dissolved in 1547. But it is probable that the land for the abbey was donated by one Helm of Stubbethorp (the old name for the area where the abbey was built), not earlier than 1163. Helm is mentioned as a donor to Tvis Abbey. Helm apparently gave his farm at Stubberthorp to the Benedictines sometime between 1190 and 1220. The abbey is first mentioned by name in a letter of 1268 simply giving two marks to the priory from the wealthy widow of Esper Vognsen from Roskilde. The particular order which operated the priory is never mentioned, but several hints in the few remaining letters make the Benedictine Order the most probable, though Stubber as a Cistercian house cannot be ruled completely out. The evidence comes from the land records for three farms which were created when the priory was sold to local land owners after 1538 which indicate transfer from Benedictine ownership. The priory's name evolved over time from Stubthorp in 1268, Stubbaer 1438, Stubre in an atlas of 1450, and Stubber in 1500. Stubber Priory was under the control of the Bishop of Ribe and it is unknown which monastic house had responsibility for the priestly functions required by the nuns at Stubber Priory. The priory complex was built in the usual four-sided rectangle with the church as the south range. The priory was run by the prioress. A prior, often a local noble was responsible for managing the farms and income to provide for the nuns. A few prioresses are mentioned in conjunction with court cases or gifts beginning in 1388 when Prioress Christine was given a cloak. Prioress Christine Palsdatter was in charge in 1457 through 1459 when the priory had legal troubles with a local knight, Niels Eriksen. The last Prioress \\"old\\" Else, was the niece of a powerful noble and was allowed to run the priory until it was closed, sometime in 1547. The priory priests were usually elderly priests or canons from other monastic houses in the purview of the Bishop of Ribe. One of the priors, Jep Thomsen was made so poor by this post that he ran away from the priory. Prior Peter is mentioned in several letters, but who he was or what house he came from is not clear. More information about priors in the 14th and 15th centuries indicates Stubber was one of several small houses that required a priest where vacancies often went unfilled for long periods of time. By the time of the Reformation, Stubber Priory owned many farms in the region as a result of gifts from individuals or families for services the nuns could render: prayers for the dead, nursing home, schooling, or from wills. Though a small house with perhaps 10-20 nuns, they had to eat, drink, and be clothed. The income from the farms and several churches made it possible for the nuns to live a religious life without doing farm work. The buildings at the priory consisted of two groups: the farm buildings clustered roughly in a disconnected rectangle. The priory consisted of the thatched-roof church to the northwest, and four other buildings forming the south wall of the compound. A wall enclosed the large garden and cemetery next to the church. The exact location and use for each buildings has not been determined. The Reformation brought an end to the Priory at Stubber. Since it was so isolated, it lasted longer as a priory than in other parts of Denmark. The priory and its estate became crown property and Stubber was given to local noblemen, Mogens Kaas, and Niels Juel on the condition that the 12 remaining nub=ns were provided for. In 1546 Iver Juel succeeded in purchasing the priory estate for more than 12,000 daler since the last of the nuns had left the priory. Juel immediately broke up the estate selling it to other, lesser noblemen for a profit. The priory building became Stubber Farm (Danish:Stubberg√•rd). The holdings were passed down several generations, but the buildings became so dilapidated that the family abandoned the site, leaving the buildings uninhabited for more than 100 years. In 1870 the piles of rubble were mined for brick and stone leaving foundations on some parts of the priory more than two feet thick. Today a private residence has been built above the vaulted cellar room from ca. 1400 and parts of foundations are exposed on the privately owned site.

It is located between Stirling Gardens and Supreme Court Gardens, off Barrack Street, adjacent to the Supreme Court building. It is a single- storey cream rendered building, with a wooden shingle roof. The Old Court House is the city's oldest surviving public building and is one of two remaining examples of the work of Henry Reveley, the colonial civil engineer. It is one of the few remaining buildings designed in the classical Greek revival style of the 19th century in Perth. Description The Old Court House building stands at the south-east corner of Stirling Gardens in Perth. It is a simple looking building of Georgian style architecture. It is of stone rubble construction with a stucco finish. It is a small simple building with a hipped roof, which was originally clad with slate. The entry portico, which was added later, is supported by doric pillars. The area around the north and west of the building is paved in sandstone coloured interlocking concrete paving bricks. History In 1836, Governor James Stirling gave orders for the construction of a court house in Perth. In February 1836, Henry Willey Reveley, the colonial civil engineer from 1829 to 1838, prepared plans and specifications for the new building. Reveley was responsible for the design and construction of several early public buildings in the colony, including the Round House in Fremantle, the Commissariat Store, the Government Offices, the first Soldiers' Barracks, and Government House in Perth. The Court House in those days stood close to the original shoreline of the Swan River. It was completed in December 1836. The first Court of General Quarter Sessions was held in the building on 2 February 1837. The building was officially opened with a Church service conducted by the Reverend John Burdett Wittenoom on Good Friday, 24 March 1837. The Court House continued to double as a place of worship until St George's Church was built in 1842. Aside from its general purpose use as a court house and temporary place of worship, the building was also used as a schoolroom. On 20 September 1847 the first Perth Boys' School was established in the building. Prior to the construction of the Mechanics Institute and the Town Hall the Court House was the only substantial building in Perth suitable for public meetings. The building played an important role as a focus for the cultural life of the Swan River Colony. The building, now referred to as the Old Court House, was called into service intermittently between 1856-1863 as an emergency immigration depot. In 1863 following repairs and alterations the building was once again utilised as a court house, this time for the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court occupied the building from 1863 until September 1879, when the Supreme Court relocated to new premises in the remodelled former Commissariat Store, a short distance from the old Court House in Stirling Gardens. From 29 July 1905 until 1965 the building was used by the Arbitration Court. Minor changes were made to the building in 1921. On 14 October 1966, following renovations to the building which included a new shingled roof, the Law Society of Western Australia was granted use of the building for its official premises. In 1974 a Law Museum was established in the building. In 1985 the Law Society relocated its offices and the building underwent internal refurbishment to reconstruct its appearance as the Arbitration Court of 1905. In 1987 the Francis Burt Legal Education Centre was established in the building. Current use The Old Court House currently houses the Old Court House Law Museum, operated by the Law Society of Western Australia, which focuses on the history of the law, legal issues and the legal profession in Western Australia. Heritage value The Old Court House was entered into the Register of the National Estate by the Australian Heritage Commission in October 1980 and classified by the National Trust of Australia (WA) in February 1978. On 14 February 2003 it was placed on the permanent state heritage register.

First settled in 1786 as the community of Cross Plains, the town was chartered as Athens in 1826 and had its own post office from that time until 1906. The current commercial center was reduced to its present size by a series of fires in the mid-19th century. Athens Historic District The Athens Historic District was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1979 for its Italianate, Greek Revival, and Late Victorian architecture. The Athens Historic District contains the remaining buildings of an early 19th-century village established in the southernmost part of Fayette County. The village is located in the heart of the Bluegrass region of Kentucky. In 1775 a fort was established by Daniel Boone one-half mile west of present-day Athens. The community of Cross Plains was founded in 1783 and renamed Athens in 1825 after the Kentucky General Assembly chartered the town. During the early 19th century the community boasted several manufacturing industries including a woolen factory as well as a bagging and rope factory. By 1860 all of the manufacturing buildings had been destroyed by fire. Local historian Robert Peter described why the buildings were not rebuilt in Athens: \\"Several destructive fires for so small a place have visited Athens during the course of its eventful career. In 1853-54 all the business houses on the south side of Main Street, west of the Cleveland pike were swept away in a single blaze. The buildings consumed were the Bledsoe Hotel, Harvey Nelson's dry goods store, John Donnally's store, a shoemaker's shop and a few dwellings.\\" This description of the fires that destroyed the main part of the town attests to how large and thriving the community of Athens was in the early part of the 19th century. There are still several buildings remaining in Athens from its early history. The Dr. Parker House is a two-story log and frame building erected between 1780 and 1820. There is also a second log building that has been covered by clapboards adjacent to the Dr. Parker House. Built during the 1780s, this could be the oldest building in Athens still standing. The Marshall Tavern is a brick building that served as an inn and was built around 1840. The Aubrey Inn, built circa 1800, stands at the corner of Main and Cleveland Road. Across the street from the tavern is the building that formerly housed Flannery's store. These buildings have mostly been converted to residential dwellings and there are few buildings that still serve a commercial functions.

It was numbered Bill C-10 of the second session of the 39th Parliament of Canada. The bill contained a controversial clause which would have allowed the federal government to deny tax credits for films where public funding was deemed to be contrary to public policy. The clause attracted public criticism, with David Cronenberg and Sarah Polley arguing that the clause represented censorship of Canadian films. Others, such as Charles McVety and REAL Women of Canada, argued that the provision recognized that public funding should not be available for movies which were offensive to large numbers of people. Film producers, such as Steve Hoban, argued that the clause would make it harder to make movies in Canada. After public outcry, Prime Minister Harper announced that the bill would not be passed with the controversial clause included.  Legislative history  The bill was first introduced as Bill C-33 in 2006, in the first session of the 39th Parliament. It passed all legislative stages in the House of Commons by June 2007 and then received first reading in the Senate that same month.Progress of Bills: Bill C-33, 39th Parliament, 1st Session. However, it did not pass the Senate before the prorogation of Parliament. The bill was re-introduced in the Commons as Bill C-10 during the 2nd session. By order of the House, it was deemed approved at all stages completed in the previous session, effective October 29, 2007. The bill then was introduced in the Senate the next day, October 30, 2007. It passed second reading on December 4, 2007, and was referred to committee. The bill did not pass the Senate prior to the dissolution of Parliament for the 2008 general election.  Content of the bill  The long title of the bill was \\"An Act to amend the Income Tax Act, including amendments in relation to foreign investment entities and non-resident trusts, and to provide for the bijural expression of the provisions of that Act\\". Among a 600-page list of minor changes to tax law, the bill contained a clause that would have amended s. 125.4 of the Income Tax Act to give the Minister of Canadian Heritage the power to deny taxation credits for films made in Canada, if the Minister concluded that public financial support of the production would be \\"contrary to public policy\\".Bill C-10, clause 120(3), to amend s. 125.4(1) of the Income Tax Act.  Public reaction  Critics of the clause argued that it was equivalent to censorship because most Canadian films cannot afford to be produced without government assistance. After the Bill passed the Commons on October 29, 2007, opposition parties said that they did not notice the controversial clause. Several Senators said that they intended to send the bill back to the Commons. At the Senate hearings on the bill, the Minister of Canadian Heritage gave an explanation for the clause. She said that the test of \\"contrary to public policy\\" had been used in the regulations, and that the clause had been included by previous drafts of the bill proposed by the previous Liberal government. She also explained the purpose for the clause: \\"It ensures that the government has the ability, in exceptional circumstances, to exclude certain material from public support. There is material that is potentially illegal under the Criminal Code, such as indecent material, hate propaganda, and child pornography. Currently, no provision in the Income Tax Act or regulations exclude such material. Bill C-10 addresses this loophole, in particular.\\" The hearings in the Senate committee on the bill were described as a \\"gong show\\" by Jim Abbott, MP, the parliamentary secretary to the Minister of Canadian heritage. Opponents of the clause, such as director David Cronenberg and actor-director Sarah Polley argued that it amounted to government censorship of videos and movies. Supporters of the clause, such as Charles McVety, president of the Canada Family Action Coalition, and Diane Watts, a researcher with REAL Women of Canada, argued that public funding should not be given to movies which are offensive to large numbers of Canadians. Iconic of the debate was a contemporary Canadian film titled Young People Fucking. The film contained no pornographic material and received favourable reviews and a relatively wide distribution for a Canadian film. It was released in 2007, a year after the clause had first been introduced in Bill C-36 in 2006. However, it was cited by some Conservative parliamentarians as an example of a film which would not receive financial aid under Bill C-10. Senators and MPs were invited to view an advance screening of the film. Steve Hoban, the producer of the film, explained that the clause would introduce uncertainty into the funding arrangements for film productions. In his view, uncertainty about the availability of tax credits would make it more difficult to get financing for movies in Canada, which would likely drive production out of Canada to other countries with more favourable tax regimes. Ernst & Young financing specialist Neal Clarance said that the lack of clear definitions on what is \\"contrary to public policy\\" would make it extremely difficult for film producers to obtain financing. The Royal Bank of Canada stated that the uncertainties would limit their ability to fund Canadian productions. Sam Sullivan, the mayor of Vancouver, testified against the clause, arguing that it would have a negative impact on the Canadian film industry, which provided large numbers of jobs. The mayors of Toronto and Montreal also testified against the clause, while the Mayor of Halifax sent a letter opposing the clause.  Outcome  The bill did not pass the Senate committee prior to the dissolution of Parliament for the 2008 Canadian federal election. When the Conservative Party released their platform for the election, Prime Minister Harper announced that if re-elected, they would not proceed with the clause.

History A local tradition says that Mong was built on the ancient city of Nicaea which was founded by Alexander the Great in commemoration of his victory over Raja Porus in the Battle of the Hydaspes River.Michael Wood, In the Footsteps of Alexander the Great (Random House, 2004 ).F.R. Allchin & George Erdosy, The archaeology of early historic South Asia : the emergence of cities and states /(Cambridge University Press, 1995). However, the ruins of the city of Nicea have not been found yet, and any attempt to find the ancient battle site is doomed, because the landscape has changed somewhat.P.H.L. Eggermont, Alexander's campaign in Southern Punjab (1993). The 1910 version of the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica cited Mong as the location of \\"Nicaea\\",The encyclop√¶dia britannica: a dictionary of arts, sciences, literature and general information, Volume 14 p. 398. 1910 but the modern version no longer has this claim. Campaigns and landmarks of Alexander's invasion of the Indian subcontinent. According to The Imperial Gazetteer of India: \\" The overthrow of the Bactrians by the Parthians in the latter half of the second century brought another change of rulers, and the coins of the Indo-Parthian Maues (c. 120 BCE), who is known to local tradition as Raja Moga, have been found at Mong. At the end of the first century CE the whole of the Punjab was conquered by the Yueh-chi.\\" The Hungarian archaeologist and Silk Road expert Sir Marc Aurel Stein believed that instead of using the road from Taxila to Jhelum which dates from medieval times, Alexander's army would have gone south to cross the river near modern BheraMichael Wood, In the Footsteps of Alexander the Great (Random House, 2004). At this site the battle would have happened near the town of Mong. The topography, river orientation and natural features including salt cliffs in this vicinity match closely the description given in ancient sources. To further support this claim, the residents of Mong and nearby Phalia have a traditional claim that Mong is Hellenistic Nicaea. Centuries later, at almost the same location, a few kilometers away from Mong, in the Second Anglo-Sikh War, the British forces under Lord Gough and the Khalsa Sikh Army fought the Battle of Chillianwala. In the 2005 Mong shootings terrorist attack on October 7, 2005, 8 Ahmadi people were gunned down and 20 were injured while at morning worship. Demography The three main ethnic groups are Arain, Khokhar and Jat respectively. Most families work on their small native land farms although significant numbers of Mong residents have sought employment in Saudi Arabia, some other Gulf States and Europe. The predominantly Muslim population supported Muslim League and Pakistan Movement. After the independence of Pakistan in 1947, the minority Hindus and Sikhs migrated to India while the Muslims refugees from India settled down in Mandi Bahauddin District. Mong is also home to some famous players of Kabaddi district level team, and Volleyball and Cricket are favourite games of the village. File:Porus's elephant cavalry.jpg  Alexander Cunningham on Nikaea or Mong  Alexander Cunningham writes that The position of Mong is 6 miles to the east of Jalalpur, and the same distance to the south of Dilawar. The name is usually pronounced Mong, or Mung \\\\----[p. 178]: but it is written without the nasal, and is said to have been founded by Raja Moga, or Muga. He is also called Raja Sankhar(Hindu lord Shiva's other name ,Shankar), which I take to mean king of the Sakas, or Sakae. His brother Rama founded Rampur, orRamnagar, the modern Rasul, which is 6 miles to the north-east of Mong, and exactly opposite Dilawar. His sister's son, named Kamkamarath, was Raja of Girjak or Jalalpur. The old ruined mound on which Mong is situated, is 600 feet long by 400 feet broad and 50 feet high, and is visible for many miles on all sides. It contains 975 houses built of large old bricks and 5000 inhabitants, who are chiefly Jats. The old wells are very numerous, their exact number, according to my informant, being 175. I have already stated that I take Mong to be the site of Nikaea, the city which Alexander built on the scene of his battle with Porus. The evidence on this point is, I think, as complete as could be wished ; but I have still to explain how the name of Nikaea could have been changed to Mong. The tradition that the town was founded by Raja Moga is strongly corroborated by the fact that Maharaja Moga is mentioned in Mr. Roberts's Taxila inscription. Now, Moga is the same name as Moa, and the coins of Moa, or Mauas are still found in Mong. But the commonest Greek monogram on these coins forms the letters NIK, which I take to be the abbreviation of Nikaea, the place of mintage. If this inference be correct, as I believe it is, then Nikaea must have been the principal mint-city of the great king Moga, and therefore a place of considerable importance. As the town of Mong is traditionally attributed to Raja Moga as the founder, we may reasonably conclude that he must \\\\----[p. 179]: have rebuilt or increased the place under the new name of Moga-grama, which, in the spoken dialects, would be shortened to Mogaon and Mong. Coins of all the Indo-Scythian princes are found at Mong in, considerable numbers, and I see no reason to doubt that the place is as old as the time of Alexander. The copper coins of the Nameless Indo-Scythian king especially are found in such numbers at Mong that they are now commonly known in the neighbourhood as Monga-sahis.  Maues (Moga) inscription of Takshasila  One inscription is known which mentions Maues (usually called the \\"Moga inscription\\", and starts with: : \\"In the seventy eighth, 78, year the Great King, the Great Moga, on the fifth, 5, day of the month Panemos, on this first, of the Kshaharata and Kshatrapa of Chukhsa - Liaka Kusuluka by name - his son Patika - in the town ofTakshasila...\\" Maues issued joint coins mentioned a queen Machene (\\"ŒúŒëŒßŒóŒùŒó\\"). Machene may have been a daughter of one of the Indo-Greek houses. An Indo-Greek king, Artemidoros also issued coins where he describes himself as \\"Son of Maues\\".

Originally raised in April 1915 for service in World War I as part of the Australian Imperial Force (AIF), it was assigned to the 7th Brigade and consisted of personnel recruited from the states of Queensland and Tasmania. The battalion fought at Gallipoli in the latter stages of that campaign before being withdrawn to Egypt in late 1915. In mid-1916, it was sent to Europe where it served in the trenches of the Western Front in France and Belgium for the rest of the war, fighting in most of the battles that the Australians took part in between 1916 and 1918. At the end of the war, it was disbanded in May 1919 as part of the demobilisation of the AIF. During the inter-war years, the 26th Battalion was re-raised as a part-time unit of the Citizens Forces, known as the 26th Battalion (Logan and Albert Regiment), based in Queensland. In 1934, the 26th was merged with another Queensland-based infantry battalion, the 15th Battalion, to become the 15th/26th Battalion. The two units were subsequently delinked in 1939 when the new 26th Australian Infantry Battalion was raised in Queensland as Australia mobilised for war. The battalion was assigned to the 11th Brigade at this time and used in various garrison roles in the early part of World War II before a detachment was sent to the Dutch East Indies as part of Merauke Force in 1943. Later in the war, the entire 26th Battalion, along with the rest of the 11th Brigade, was committed to the Bougainville campaign where they saw action against the Japanese from late 1944 until the end of hostilities in August 1945. After the war, the 26th Battalion was used to guard Japanese prisoners on Rabaul, remaining there until March 1946, before returning to Australia for demobilisation. It was subsequently disbanded in August 1946. HistoryWorld War I= The 26th Battalion was originally raised in April 1915 as part of the all-volunteer Australian Imperial Force (AIF). Drawing recruits from Tasmania and Queensland, the battalion concentrated at Enoggera, Queensland, where it formed part of the 7th Brigade, which was attached to the 2nd Division. The battalion's first commanding officer was Lieutenant Colonel George Ferguson. With an authorised strength of 1,023 men, after a short period of basic training, the battalion's first draft ‚Äì consisting of two companies of Queenslanders ‚Äì embarked for overseas in May. They were followed by the two Tasmanian companies in late June. Further training was undertaken in Egypt, after which the battalion was sent to Gallipoli when the 2nd Division was despatched to the peninsula to reinforce the troops that had been fighting there since April. The 26th Battalion landed on 12 September. By that time, the campaign had become a costly stalemate and shortly after their arrival, as winter came and conditions worsened, the decision was made to evacuate the peninsula. As a result, the battalion did not take part in any major actions, and fulfilled only a defensive role, defending positions such as \\"Courtney's Post\\", \\"Steel's Post\\" and \\"Russell's Top\\", before it was withdrawn from the peninsula on 12 December. Casualties during this first campaign amounted to 26 killed and 96 wounded. Over 500 personnel were also evacuated as sick with about half returning to duty. After the evacuation, the 26th Battalion returned to Egypt where the AIF was reorganised and expanded before being sent to Europe. The 26th arrived in France in March 1916, taking its place in the trenches along the Western Front the following month. In early June, alongside the 28th Battalion, they took part in the first raid undertaken by Australians in France, attacking German trenches around Bois Grenier. Their first major battle came around Pozi√®res between July and August, after which the battalion was sent along with the entire 2nd Division to a quieter sector in Belgium having suffered over 650 casualties. After this, in November they were moved south to the Somme Valley and throughout the month the 26th participated in two attacks around a position known as \\"The Maze\\", a salient to the east of Flers. Both of these attacks ultimately proved fruitless, grinding to a halt in the muddy conditions, and resulting in over 300 casualties. At the end of November, Lieutenant Colonel Reginald Travers took command of the battalion. alt=A military officer in formal dress The harsh winter of 1916‚Äì17 was spent occupying defensive positions along the front and training behind the lines. Christmas was spent in the trenches around Amiens, but in early January 1917, the 26th Battalion was transferred to the Ancre Valley and then to Le Sars later in the month. As the German Army withdrew towards the Hindenburg Line, the 26th was involved in a number of actions at Warlencourt and Lagnicourt in March. During the fighting around Lagnicourt, Captain Percy Cherry led his company into the village, capturing several positions before helping to hold off several German counterattacks; he was later awarded the Victoria Cross posthumously. Later, in May they joined the Second Battle of Bullecourt, where they were used mainly in a support role during the initial attack, being held back as part of the 2nd Division's reserve. During the attack, a company from the 26th was detached to help bolster the 5th Brigade, and later it was thrust into the line to help defend the gains after a German counterattack fell on the 6th Brigade's left flank. After Bullecourt, the battalion was moved to Belgium again, where they joined the battles at Menin Road and Brooseinde Ridge in September and October. During the first attack, the 26th was in support of the 28th Battalion, but later it led the 7th Brigade's follow up attack on the second line of defences around Broodseinde. Combined casualties for the two battles were over 400 killed or wounded. In early 1918, after the fighting on the Eastern Front ended following the collapse of the Russian Empire, the Germans transferred a large number of divisions to the Western Front and subsequently launched a major offensive that became known as the Spring Offensive. In April 1918, after the Allies had been pushed steadily back, the 26th Battalion was transferred from the Messines sector south to the Somme and committed to the fighting along with other Australian units. The 26th undertook defensive tasks throughout April and May in various locations including Baizieux, Camon and Ribemont, during which time over a 100 casualties were suffered before the German offensive was eventually halted. After this, throughout June and July the battalion launched a number of \\"peaceful penetration\\" operations to take small amounts of the German front line during the lull that followed prior to the final Allied offensive of the war. The first came around Morlancourt on 10 June, while another was undertaken around Monument Wood, near Villers-Bretonneux, on 17 July 1918. It was during this raid that Lieutenant Albert Borella earned the battalion's second Victoria Cross of the war. On 22 July, thirteen men of the battalion accompanied 23 men of the British 1st Gun Carrier Company in taking possession of and towing away the abandoned German A7V tank \\"Mephisto\\" from within Allied lines. In August, the Allies launched their Hundred Days Offensive, which ultimately brought an end to the war. On the opening day of the offensive, the 26th led the 7th Brigade's attack around Villers-Bretonneux. After a period in reserve, in late August they advanced on the brigade's left during an attack at Biaches which saw the Allies push towards the Somme River. The following month they took part in the attack on Mont St Quentin, during which they experienced heavy machine-gun fire. After the Somme was crossed, the 26th joined an attack around Grandcourt and Lormisset on 3 October 1918, part of the \\"Beaurevoir Line\\", which was the third and final line of the Hindenburg Line defences. During the attack, the 26th followed up the initial gains made in the 7th Brigade's sector by the 25th Battalion, and attacked the second line of German defences around Grandcourt, suffering 123 casualties, including 21 killed. Shortly after this, the 26th received a batch of reinforcements from the 25th Battalion, which was subsequently disbanded. Nevertheless, the fighting along the Beaurevoir Line was the 26th Battalion's last contribution to the war and they were withdrawn to Berteaucort for a rest shortly afterwards. They did not return to the front line before the armistice was declared in November and were subsequently disbanded on 31 May 1919. The battalion's last commanding officer was Lieutenant Colonel William Davis, who took command of the battalion in mid-October 1918 and remained in command until it was disbanded. During the course of the 26th Battalion's involvement in the war it lost 877 men killed and 2,745 men wounded. Members of the battalion received the following decorations: two Victoria Crosses (VCs), one Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE), four Distinguished Service Orders (DSOs) including one Bar, 25 Distinguished Conduct Medals (DCMs), 26 Military Crosses (MCs) including three Bars, 96 Military Medals (MMs) including four Bars, four Meritorious Service Medals (MSMs), and 37 Mentions in Despatches (MIDs). =Inter-war years= In 1921, following the completion of the demobilisation process, the AIF was disbanded and the Citizens Forces, Australia's part-time military force which was responsible for the defence of Australia, was reorganised to perpetuate the battle honours and traditions of the AIF by renumbering the units of the Citizens Force to adopt the numerical designations of their related AIF units. This process had partially commenced in late 1918, with the introduction of a regimental system within the Citizen Forces, but was adjusted in 1921 when the Citizens Force was reorganised to replicate the AIF's divisional structure resulting in the formation of single battalions from each regiment. Upon formation during the war, the units of the AIF had been raised from men drawn from the recruitment territory of already established Citizens Force units and as a consequence many AIF units retained links to Citizens Force units from where they drew the majority of the initial intake of personnel. As a result of the reorganisation in 1921, the 26th Battalion was re-raised as a part-time unit of the Citizens Force, drawing personnel from several battalions of the 26th Infantry Regiment, which traced its history back through the 9th (Logan and Albert) Infantry, which had been formed in 1912. In 1927, territorial titles were adopted by the units of the Citizens Force, and the battalion adopted the title of the \\"Logan and Albert Regiment\\". It also adopted the motto, Nunquam non Paratus, meaning \\"Never Unprepared\\". Initially, the Citizens Forces was maintained using a mixture of voluntary and compulsory service. In 1929, following the election of the Scullin Labor government, the compulsory training scheme was abolished and replaced with an all volunteer force known as the \\"Militia\\". The decision to suspend compulsory training, coupled with the economic downturn of the Great Depression meant that the manpower of many Militia units dropped considerably and the decision was made to amalgamate a number of units. The 26th Battalion was not initially affected, but in 1934 it was merged with the 15th Battalion to form the 15th/26th Battalion. These two battalions remained linked until just prior to World War II, when on 16 June 1939, they were split and a new 26th Battalion was raised in Queensland, near Hughenden, within the 1st Military District. Upon re-forming, the battalion was placed under the command of one of the Australian Army's most decorated soldiers, Lieutenant Colonel Harry Murray, a World War I Victoria Cross recipient. The battalion's second- in-command was another Victoria Cross recipient, Major Edgar Towner. =World War II= Following the outbreak of World War II in September 1939, the 26th Battalion undertook a series of training camps around northern Queensland as it began to re-establish its numbers. Between September and November, it was based around Kissing Point, Queensland, before moving to Townsville in February 1940, and then south of Bowen the following month. At this time, it was placed under the command of the 11th Brigade, along with the 31st and 51st Battalions, both of which were Queensland-based Militia battalions. In mid-1940, the battalion's strength fluctuated as compulsory service was reintroduced and drafts of national servicemen marched in for short periods of training, while volunteers were released to join the Second Australian Imperial Force (2nd AIF) and other services. Many of the initial recruits came from Italian-Australian families from north Queensland, but as the battalion grew, reinforcements from other Australian states arrived during 1942 and early 1943. alt=Soldiers disembarking from a landing craft Throughout 1941 and 1942, the battalion undertook defensive duties in various locations around Queensland, including Charters Towers, Bohle River, and Alligator Falls. On 17 August 1942, Murray relinquished command and was replaced by Lieutenant Colonel John Abbott. In October, the 26th moved to Kuranda, near Barron Falls, and as reinforcements arrived, began training to prepare for deployment overseas. In May 1943, the battalion moved to Cairns where they embarked on the transport Katoomba and sailed to Horn Island. 'A' Company was detached at this time to Merauke Force in the Dutch East Indies, becoming the first Militia unit to serve outside of Australian territory. Several other platoons were dispatched to other islands around the Torres Strait. Between August 1943 and November, defensive duties were undertaken on the mainland around the Cape York Peninsula, before the battalion returned to Horn Island. In July 1944, the 26th Battalion was withdrawn to Australia on board the transport Taroona, and after leave reconstituted at Strathpine, Queensland, and began training for further operations. Gazetted as an AIF unit, which meant it could be deployed outside Australian territory, during December 1944 the battalion deployed to Bougainville as Australian troops from the 3rd Division relieved American forces around Torokina. The Australians subsequently launched three drives on the island in the northern, southern and central areas. Initially, the 26th Battalion was committed to the fighting in the central sector of the island conducting patrolling operations around Numa Numa before being withdrawn to Torokina at the end of January 1945. In February that year, Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Callinan assumed command, taking over from Abbott. The 26th was then deployed to the Soraken Plantation area, using a series of amphibious landings to clear the area before a brief rest after which they began clearing north towards Ratsua and Ruri Bay, taking over from the 55th/53rd Battalion. Determined Japanese resistance along the Ratsua front resulted in an amphibious landing by a company from the 31st/51st Battalion around Porton Plantation, in an effort to outflank Ratsua. Following a series of mishaps, the company that landed around Porton became heavily engaged, and while efforts were made to evacuate them, the 26th Battalion and the rest of the 31st/51st Battalion attempted to break through from Ratsua. They were unable to penetrate the Japanese lines, however, as they came up against Japanese defenders that were determined to resist because they were unable to withdraw any further along the peninsula.. In late June, the 26th Battalion was relieved by the 27th Battalion and sent back to Torokina for rest. Hostilities ceased in August, and the following month the 26th Battalion was sent to Rabaul for garrison duty. In December, Lieutenant Colonel Allan Cameron took command of the battalion. In March 1946, the 26th Battalion returned to Australia. After this, the battalion experienced a high turn-over of personnel, with over 2,500 men passing through the battalion at this time, as men were discharged or transferred to other units. Command of the battalion also changed a couple of times, with Lieutenant Colonel Peter Webster taking over on 22 March, before he handed over to Lieutenant Colonel Eric Barnes. The battalion was finally disbanded on 28 August 1946, but 'A' Company remained in existence as a holding company until 25 September 1946 when the last member marched out. During the course of the battalion's involvement in the war, it lost 40 men killed in action or died on active service and 110 wounded. Members of the battalion received the following decorations: one DSO, two MBEs, one George Medal, one British Empire Medal, five MCs, eight MMs, and 14 MIDs. Alliances The 26th Battalion held the following alliances: * United Kingdom ‚Äì Cameronians (Scottish Rifles) (1928‚Äì51); * Canada ‚Äì The Perth Regiment (1932‚Äì53); * New Zealand ‚Äì The Otago Regiment (1932‚Äì54); * South Africa ‚Äì Witwatersrand Rifles (1932‚Äì53).

Geography Sharon is located at (38.159549, -81.447059) along Cabin Creek.The National Map, accessed 19 October 2016. It has an elevation of 673 feet (205 m). Transportation Sharon is located on Secondary State Route 79/3, locally known as Cabin Creek Road. Exit 79 of Interstate 77 is located here; no services are available at the exit. Until the 1980s, a rail spur ran from the CSX railroad tracks up a short hollow, serving a coal mine tipple. The remnants of the tracks and rail bed can still be seen at present day along Paint Branch, however, no sign remains of the at-grade crossing of Cabin Creek Road or the trestle that crossed Cabin Creek. As a result of the badly needed upgrade of the West Virginia Turnpike to Interstate standards, multiple homes occupying the adjacent land were bought by the state and demolished. The cemetery is hidden behind the few homes that sit at the bottom of Sharon Hill or some call Sharon mountain. There are about 12 houses in the hollow and a church at the bottom to the left as soon as you cross the Cabin Creek bridge. If you park at the church you can walk up the road and behind the houses the mountain cemetery begins. There are generations of graves here back farther than 1700. It is a straight up hike with a narrow path of family plot after plot. This trek is not for the weary. There are rattlesnakes and it is steep. The families buried here have mined coal and farmed the Appalachias for centuries. Some of the family names include Basham, Totten, Burns, Perry, Harlow, and many more. This mountain forest cemetery is covered in flowers from top to bottom from families who keep their family traditions.

His music for TV shows including Santa Barbara, Another World and Guiding Light won a total of five Emmy Awards. In 2005, he died of brain cancer at the age of 54. Life Born in Los Angeles, California, Rhodes learned to play the trombone and the piano during his teen years. As an adult, he toured the U.S. with his band, Wonder, but eventually settled with a television career in composing. He married screenwriter, novelist and lyricist Vivian Rhodes in 1982; they had two children, a son and a daughter. Rick and Vivian, together, produced two songs, \\"Let's be Lovers Again\\" and \\"Fasten Your Seat Belts\\", which both received Emmy nominations. They also co-wrote the musical Ug; which was performed in California and off-Broadway in 2004. Rhodes' songs have been recorded by many musicians, including Patti Austin, Diane Schuur, Tom Scott, Bill Champlin, and Joey Scarbury. Rhodes was partners with actor Lane Davies, with whom he produced many productions for the Santa Susanna Repertory Company. Rhodes is perhaps best remembered for co-founding, with Davies, the Kingsmen Shakespeare Festival in Thousand Oaks, California. He was also the founder of the Performing Arts Department at Oak Park High School in Oak Park, California. During his career, Rhodes won six Emmy awards for his work on Santa Barbara, The Guiding Light, and Another World. Rhodes was most famous for his work on the 1996 children's CD-ROM game, Pajama Sam: No Need to Hide When It's Dark Outside, notably his piece in the dancing furniture scene with a disco-esque song that goes \\"Dyuewwwww\\" in four-bar increments. This musical enigma has perplexed many music theorists over the course of 14 years and it would appear that Rhodes took the answer to the grave with him. Rhodes had planned to release another in the summer of 2004, but was unable to because of a malignant brain tumor he had removed on September 5, 2003. Rhodes died on November 2, 2005, of brain cancer, at age 54. He was survived by his wife and children, his mother, and his sister. His memorial service was held on Nov. 19th, at the Samuelson Chapel at California Lutheran University in Thousand Oaks, California.

The type and only species is K. guillermoi, first formally described in 2007 after the find in 1999. It is the largest known member of the family.  Taxonomy  Sketch of the skull of Kelenken A fossil of the genus was discovered in March 1999 by student Guillermo Oscar Aguirre Zabala and a friend, about from the train station of Comallo, a small village in the R√≠o Negro Province, Argentina. They were fossil hunting and found other fossils before. After discovering the fossil, they contacted the paleontological museum in Bariloche. The fossil was handed to the museum and was in their collection for five years before being formally described. The find was studied by paleontologist Luis Mar√≠a Chiappe, together with Sara Bertelli and Claudia Tambussi. Later, a complete lower leg bone ascribed to Kelenken was found.Rehr, 2007, 5:40-11:40 The genus is named after K√©lenken, a demon in the mythology of the Tehuelche people. The species epithet refers to Guillermo Aguirre Zabala, who discovered the holotype fossil. Kelenken is assigned to the subfamily Phorusrhacinae, a subfamily of terror birds up to high, but somewhat slender and decidedly more nimble than the Brontornithinae, together with: Devincenzia, Late Oligocene to Early Miocene (Deseadan) Fray Bentos Formation of Uruguay, Kelenken, Colloncuran of R√≠o Negro Province, Argentina; largest known phorusrhacid, Phorusrhacos, Early to Middle Miocene (Santacrucian) Santa Cruz Formation of Argentina, Titanis, Early Pliocene to Early Pleistocene (Blancan) of Florida and Texas.  Description  Restoration Kelenken lived in the Langhian stage of the Miocene, approximately 15 million years ago. Fossils were found in tuff beds of the Colloncuran Coll√≥n Cur√° Formation in the Ca√±ad√≥n Asfalto Basin of western Patagonia, Argentina.Comallo at Fossilworks.org It was the largest species of phorusrhacid, and with a skull long, it possessed the largest head of any known bird.Jones, 2010, p.10 The tarsometatarsus of one fossil specimen is long.Bertelli et al., 2007 The discovery of the long leg bone led the researchers conclude Kelenken was a fast runner, more than other terror birds. The size of the skull and its jaw muscles led to the conclusion the terror bird had an enormous bite force.  Paleobiology  Sketch of the rear part of the head of Kelenken = Diet = It is not entirely clear how Kelenken captured and killed its prey. As a large flightless carnivore, Kelenken likely chased down and killed its prey with several bone-shattering blows from its massive beak, their diet that consists ranges from prehistoric rodents, to warm blooded mammals such as deer, young horses, cows, Llamas, sheep, and prehistoric sloths and armadillos. Another possibility is that it may have picked up its prey item, then proceeded to shake it vigorously in order to break its back. It is possible that Kelenken may also have been a scavenger, driving off other predators from their kills with its impressive size.  Paleoecology  Holotype location The Coll√≥n Cur√° Formation represents a transition from a forested ecological biome to more open pampa-type of vegetation. The formation has provided a rich assemblage of mammals, among others the rodent Guiomys unica and the sparassodont Patagosmilus goini and reptiles, mainly snakes and tortoises.Tonni & Carlini, 2008  References  Bibliography =  *  Further reading   * Category:Phorusrhacidae Category:Extinct flightless birds Category:Prehistoric bird genera Category:Miocene birds of South America Category:Colloncuran Category:Neogene Argentina Category:Fossils of Argentina Category:Fossil taxa described in 2007 Category:Chonan languages ","title":"Kelenken"},{"id":"17983954","text":"Hor√© is a town in the Tikare Department of Bam Province in northern Burkina Faso.

History  Old headframe from historic workings, Whim Creek Copper was discovered several kilometres west of the town in 1872 and gold 20 kilometres north in 1887. Copper has been mined on and off at Whim Creek over a period of 120 years. Copper was mined initially via a series of small adits and stopes into the Whim Creek and Mons Cupri deposits by artisanal miners, with records indicating that as early as 1882 small quantities of malachite, azurite, chrysocolla and other copper minerals were being won. Copper was shipped via a small port on the coast at the nearby town of Balla Balla. A single track narrow-gauge railway ran from Whim Creek to Balla Balla. At its peak, the town supported two hotels, a blacksmith, a police station and a horse track. In the early 1900s a second period of mining began, with around 60,000 tonnes of copper concentrate produced mainly from the Whim Creek Mine. In the 1960s Japanese interests undertook a resource drilling program, with diamond core drilling, and built a small oxide mining operation. This shut down in the early 1970s. The mine used two large diesel engines from World War One submarines to power the mine equipment. The engine blocks can still be seen on the site today. The leases passed to Whim Creek Consolidated Limited, but the company found profit elsewhere, and the mining leases were passed through several owners until the mid-1990s when Straits Resources Limited took over the tenure. Straits undertook a resource definition drilling programme and upgraded the resource to around 10 million tonnes of ore grading 1% copper, predominantly composed of oxidised copper minerals such as malachite, azurite, chalcocite and chrysocolla. Other minerals noted within the ore bodies are willemite, sphalerite, chalcopyrite and rare native copper. The majority of resources were defined at the Mons Cupri deposit and the Whim Creek deposit. Straits Resources Limited, after closure of the Girilambone Copper Mine in 2001-02, investigated the feasibility of translocating the solvent extraction and electrowinning plant from New South Wales to Whim Creek to set up a large scale open cut oxide copper SX-EW heap leach operation. Operations commenced in 2003, with pre- stripping of the pits and commencement of site works, with the mine fully commissioned in mid-2005. The Whim Creek ore bodies are expected to be exhausted of copper oxide ore within early 2009. An option exists for the operation to continue as a sulphide operation thereafter.  Geology  Azurite-Chrysocolla-Malachite specimen from Whim Creek. 5.0 x 4.0 x 2.9 cm. The Whim Creek Copper Mine extracts two volcanogenic massive sulfide ore deposits, namely Mons Cupri (lit. copper mountain) and Whim Creek, which are located within the Cistern Formation and Rushalls Slate sedimentary members, which are part of a series of rift-related felsic, intermediate and mafic volcanic rocks known as the Whim Creek Group. The Whim Creek Group is approximately 2.9 to 2.8Ga old and lies unconformably upon an older basement of Portree Granite. The ore deposits are classified as supergene oxide copper deposits and are primarily composed of weathered copper sulphide primary ores now present as a variety of copper carbonate minerals and secondary sulphides - primarily chalcocite - hosted within slate and conglomerate. =Ore genesis= The ore genesis model for the Whim Creek and Mons Cupri copper oxide deposits is that of a volcanogenic massive sulfide deposit. The main ore zones are located within sedimentary units which lie above a rhyolite footwall and below an andesite hanging wall (the Comstock Andesite member). Ores were formed by sulphur-rich mineralising fluids carrying copper, zinc, lead, silver and iron exhaling onto the sea-floor surface, where sulfide minerals were deposited as sheets of massive sulphide mineralisation up to 7 m thick, made up of sphalerite, galena, chalcopyrite and pyrite. The region has subsequently been deformed eight times (see Pilbara Craton for details), with the regional structure being a 30x20km pericline formed around the underlying granite dome. Locally, a series of north-east to south-west trending folds control the geology. Both deposits are stratiform and dip south with their host geology. Mons Cupri is hosted within the Cistern Formation, which is predominantly a polymict volcanolithic pebble conglomerate. The conglomerate sits within the centre of the deposit and forms a central tor flanked by an apron of sulphides, which forms an elongate ribbon plunging west-southwest. The Mons Cupri rhyolite is in the footwall and shows typical silica-chlorite alteration. The Cistern Formation conglomerates are intensely silicified. Whim Creek is hosted within the Rushall Slate, which is a finer-grained equivalent to the Cistern Formation. The Whim Creek deposit forms a ribbon-like sulphide shoot which plunges to the south or south-east. Regionally, several sub- economic deposits and prospects are known, including the Salt Creek VMS deposit, the West Balla VMS prospect and the Balla Balla VMS prospect.  Ore processing  Copper cathode from the Whim Creek SX-EW facility The current mining operation at Whim Creek consists of an open cut mining operation, utilising drill-and-blast, trucking ore from Whim Creek and Mons Cupri to a central heap leach hydrometallurgy operation midway between the two. The operation runs via contract mining, with a fleet of five haul trucks and two production drill rigs. Ore is crushed and screened to <20 mm, agglomerated with concentrated sulphuric acid, and stacked on heaps around 6 m high, which are placed atop a plastic membrane. The ore is irrigated via drippers with a dilute sulphuric acid solution and the leach liquor collected, and directed into a solvent extraction plant where the dilute lixivant is purified. The concentrated raffinate is then pumped into an electrowinning plant where 99% or greater purity copper cathode is produced for direct sale. The mine's nameplate capacity is 15,000 tonnes per annum of A-grade copper cathode. Production averaged around 12,000 tonnes per annum for 2006-07. Barren overburden is stockpiled in proximity to the open pits. There is an option to continue the operation as a sulphide crush-grind and flotation operation, as the current oxide ore bodies continue at depth as primary sulphides.

When Japan joined the Second World War, Nair helped in setting up the Indian Independence League in Japan under Rash Behari Bose and later he and Rashbehari Bose advised Japan Government to bring Subhas Chandra Bose to Japan. When Subhas came he helped him in various ways. In 1949, Nair founded an Indian restaurant in Ginza, Tokyo. He wrote his Autobiography in 1982.

Biography Born and raised in North St. Louis to Irish-American parents, Harry and his brother John, known as \\"Pudgy\\", joined the Egan's Rats in their teens. Harry, nicknamed \\"Cherries\\", was known as a ladies man and a daring crook. A first-class street fighter, Harry was quick on the trigger of a pistol and known for his hair-trigger temper. Locked up in the City Workhouse in the spring of 1913, Harry staged a daring escape and resumed his place in the Egan mob. While in Chicago with his brother John on November 5, 1914, the two Dunn brothers shot and killed a gangster named Robert Koch. Both men were convinced that Koch had been sent up from St. Louis to specifically kill them. While Harry got off scot free, Pudgy was convicted and sentenced to an Illinois prison. Frustrated that Egan gang boss Tom Egan hadn't done anything to help his imprisoned brother, Harry went to the St. Louis police headquarters in December 1915 and offered to snitch on his gangmates in order to free Pudgy from prison. The cops turned down Harry's proposal. As he left the police station, Dunn ran into William \\"Skippy\\" Rohan, one of the original members of the Egan's Rats. Worried that Rohan would rat him out, Cherries Dunn became increasingly paranoid. On December 21, 1915, Cherries Dunn got into a beef with a group of laborers in a saloon at Goodfellow and Cote Brilliante avenues and ended up fatally shooting John Groenwald over trivial reasons. Nine days later, Dunn and two pals botched a holdup and killed a North St. Louis saloonkeeper named Charles Reutilinger. With a police dragnet out for him, Harry Dunn strode into Tom Egan's saloon at Broadway and Carr streets at 12:30 on the morning of January 8, 1916. Inside he saw Skippy Rohan. Cherries ordered drinks for everyone except Rohan. Skippy asked, \\"What's the matter with me?\\" Dunn replied, \\"Go on, you snitch!\\" Before Skippy could answer, Harry shot him dead. Dunn had violated a cardinal rule of the Egan's Rats, by killing someone on the premises of Tom Egan's saloon. Because Willie Egan was a good friend of Dunn's, the gangster's life was spared. Cherries Dunn signed on with the old Bottoms Gang, and continued to rob and kill with no abandon. His main hangout was the Typo Press Club, a saloon located at the rear of 712 Pine Street. The final straw occurred on August 21, 1916, when Cherries Dunn and his pal, Eddie Schoenborn, shot and killed a semi-pro boxer named Harry Romani who was hooked up with the Egan mob. The task of getting rid of Dunn thus fell to his friend Willie Egan. Egan and four of his men confronted Harry \\"Cherries\\" Dunn inside the Typo Press Club at 3 a.m. on September 19, 1916. During their conversation at the bar, two of Egan's men, Walter Costello and Frank \\"Gutter\\" Newman, shot and killed Dunn without warning. Harry Dunn's murder touched off a gang war between the Egan's Rats and the Bottoms Gang which claimed around a dozen lives. After his release from prison, John \\"Pudgy\\" Dunn swore to avenge his brother's murder by killing everyone connected to his death.

The guitalele combines the portability of a ukulele, due to its small size, with the six single strings and resultant chord possibilities of a classical guitar. It may include a built-in microphone that permits playing the guitalele either as an acoustic guitar or connected to an amplifier. The guitalele is variously marketed (and used) as a travel guitar or children's guitar. It is essentially a modern iteration of the Quint guitar. 100px A guitalele is the size of a ukulele, and is commonly played like a guitar transposed up to ‚ÄúA‚Äù (that is, up a 4th, or like a guitar with a capo on the fifth fret). This gives it tuning of ADGCEA, with the top four strings tuned like a low G ukulele. This is the same as the tuning of the requinto guitar, although the latter are typically larger than a guitalele, and as the most common tuning for the guitarr√≥n mexicano, albeit at a higher octave. Several guitar and ukulele manufacturers market guitaleles, including Yamaha Corporation's GL-1 Guitalele,Nikkei Weekly (December 22, 1997) Small guitar can be amplified.

Some manufacturers' (e.g., Luna) use of the term \\"6-string ukulele\\" (or the like) in describing their six-string, six- course guitaleles can lead to confusion with the common six-string, four- course ukuleles that are typically referred to by the same name. These four- course \\"6-string ukuleles\\" are usually strung with a single G string, a closely spaced course of two (often octave-tuned) C strings, a single E string and a closely spaced course of two (often unison-tuned) A strings. This means that chord formation is more akin to a traditional four-string ukulele, while the Guitalele's is more akin to a six-string guitar.  Terminology  The name Guitalele is a new denomination for an old idea, maybe due to the fewer types of guitar-like instruments found in the Anglo-Saxon tradition, or maybe due to commercial reasons. However, we can find several instruments with the same tuning, shape and size as guitalele in the Spanish, Portuguese and Latinoamerican folk music, such as the guitarrico aragon√©s from Spain and the requinto carranguero from Colombia. Because of this, some people argue that it would be more correct to consider the guitalele a kind of Requinto.

The term refers to the practice of retuning the strings; it also refers to the various tunings commonly used, or in some contexts it may refer to the AEAE fiddle tuning. In folk music traditions cross-tunings are used to give the instrument a different sound by altering the pitch of string resonances and drones. It may be notated in the normal way, with notes written at the sounding pitch, or the written notes may represent the finger position as if played in regular tuning, while the sounded pitch is altered. In American folk fiddle music Cross tuning is commonly used on the fiddle in folk music of Appalachia, the southern United States and Scandinavia. The fiddle may be re-tuned in any number of ways in these musical idioms, but there are two common re-tunings. While the standard tuning for open strings of the violin is GDAE--with the G being the tuning of the lowest-pitched string and the E being the tuning for the highest-pitched string--fiddlers playing tunes in the key of D major sometimes employ a tuning of ADAE. In this tuning the open G string is raised to the A directly above it. Even more frequently used is a cross tuning of AEAE for music played in the key of A major. Among fiddlers this is referred to as \\"cross-tuning.\\" Both of these tunings facilitate a drone on an open string next to the string on which the melody is being played. Relatively well-known American folk tunes that are often played in cross-tuning include \\"Breaking Up Christmas,\\" \\"Cluck Old Hen,\\" \\"Hangman's Reel,\\" \\"Horse and Buggy,\\" and \\"Ways of the World.\\" GDAE is known in some North American Old-Timey fiddling circles as \\"that Eye-Talian (Italian) tuning,\\" the implication being that it is only one of many possibilities.

Discovery and dating The Narrabeen Man was found by contractors digging for electricity cables near the corners of Octavia Street and Ocean Street, Narrabeen. A forensic investigation was undertaken and bone samples were sent to Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California to determine the age of the remains. Radiocarbon dating of the bone suggested an age of around 4,000 years for the skeleton. The Narrabeen man was suspected to be 30‚Äì40 years old when he died. This is recorded to be Sydney's oldest skeleton, and is Australia's third oldest skeletal remains behind Mungo Man and Mungo Lady. An archaeological dig at the site revealed that Narrabeen Man was found in a posture unlike a tribal ceremonial burial. Rather than lying on his front with hands by the side or across the chest, the Narrabeen Man was on his side with one arm across his head. Further investigation of the skeletal remains revealed evidence of spear ends found embedded into his vertebrae and near other parts of the body. This indicated death by spearing and suggested to archaeologist Dr Jo McDonald that Narrabeen Man was perhaps the first physical evidence of ritual murder in Australia. Weapons The spear barbs found in the skeleton were most likely from what post-settlement Europeans sometimes called \\"death spears\\". Although they may have been used in ritual punishments, it seems likely the same type of spears were used for killing game, such as kangaroos. These spears have sharp flakes of stone, such as silcrete and quartz, embedded side by side into resin along the head of the spear, creating a serrated edge behind the point. The pieces of rock tend to break free from the resin and remain in the flesh of the victim. Spear barbs like these date to the Holocene period, and in Australia are referred to as \\"backed artefacts\\" meaning microliths or \\"bladelets\\" having retouched edges.https://www.academia.edu/235125/Multiple_uses_for_Australian_backed_artefacts multiple uses for backed artefacts, a paper by G. Robertson, V. Attenbrow and P. Hiscock see also section referring to Narrabeen Man on pp 297-298 Physical description Further examination revealed that Narrabeen Man was approximately , estimated from the length of his limbs, 30‚Äì40 years old. His height was above average for Aboriginal men at this time. It is also speculated that Narrabeen Man was not from a tribe from the greater Sydney region, as his two front teeth were not removed - in line with a regional initiation rite at the time of European settlement (unless the rite was introduced locally in more recent times than Narrabeen Man's demise). Reasons for death There is no conclusive evidence as to why he was killed. A Narrabeen cultural heritage officer, Allen Madden, suggested in 2008 that a ritualistic murder of this type represents the farthest extent of tribal law, indicating that his offence, whatever it was, must have been serious. Narrabeen Man's remains are currently lying under care at Sydney University's Shellshear Museum.

It stands at the northeastern peak of the mountain and overlooks the eastern part of the island. History Paul Chomedey de Maisonneuve, one of the city's founders, erected the first cross on Mount Royal in 1643, thereby fulfilling his vow to the Virgin Mary in his prayers to end a disastrous flood.Wilton, Katherine. \\"The cross on Mount Royal: a storied history\\".

An illuminated cross was installed in 1924 by the Soci√©t√© Saint-Jean-Baptiste and was given to the city in 1929. The city assumed responsibility for maintenance and operation of the cross since then, but there is no documentation supporting the transaction prior to June 2004, when the Montreal City Council approved cessation of the monument. The city also took advantage of this to perform additional work to improve access to the site and install new park furniture. The renovation cost C$2 million, paid by the City and the Minist√®re de la culture, des communications et de la condition f√©minine.Laurence, Jean-Christophe. \\"Nouvel √©clairage pour la croix du mont Royal\\". La Presse, February 4, 2009. The cross is made of steel and consists of 1,830 pieces joined by 6,000 rivets weighing 26 tons. It is 31.4 metres tall, its arms span 11 metres, and it stands 252 metres above the St. Lawrence River. Following the latest renovation, it is lit by 158 18-LED bulbs. While the cross is usually lit in white, the LED system allows it to be any colour, including the purple traditionally used between the death and election of a new Pope. Before the installation of the fibre-optic lighting, the purple illumination was accomplished by changing all the light bulbs. It is now controlled by computer. On various occasions, the cross has been turned red for AIDS awareness and blue for Saint-Jean-Baptiste Day. The resignation of Pope Benedict XVI presented a bit of a dilemma for how the cross would be lit; it was later announced that the cross would be lit in white during the interregnum preceding the election of Pope Francis on March 13, 2013. On March 28, 2009, it was turned off for an hour to mark Earth Hour. Time capsule Next to the cross, a plaque marks the emplacement of a time capsule buried in 1992, during Montreal's 350th birthday celebration.

Guns assumed a more dominant place on the battlefield, but the military system of the Zulu eschewed the gun in favor of the motivated spearman. Both approaches were to have important effects. African military systems (1800‚Äì1900) refers to the evolution of military systems on the African continent after 1800, with emphasis on the role of indigenous states and peoples within the African continent. Only major military systems or innovations and their development after 1800 are covered here. For events prior to 1800, see African military systems to 1800. Coverage of the 20th century and beyond is provided in African military systems after 1900. For an overall view of the military history of Africa by region, see Military History of Africa. See individual battles, empires and leaders for details on activities after 1800. African military systems and the 19th century Melvill and Coghill in battle with Zulu soldiers at the Battle of Isandlwana. =Significant influences= The beginning of the 19th century saw several factors that had significant bearing on the evolution of military systems. Such factors are referenced in standard histories on Africa that identify the 19th century as a period of intense transformation on the continent.Robin Hallett, Africa to 1875, University of Michigan Press: 1975, pp. 40‚Äì52 Some of these are: * The rise of the Zulu kingdom under Shaka, which created significant change ‚Äì from the southern part of the continent, up into East and Central Africa * The Fula jihads of West Africa, causing substantial transformation in that region on into the belt of Sudanic states * The increasing volume of guns delivered to the continent * The growth of trade between Africa and other parts of the world, including the suppression and replacement of the slave trade with other commerce * The explosion of European interest in Africa, culminating in invasions, settlement and acquisition of colonial empires in different parts of the continent All these factors in part continued earlier trends but the 19th century was to see an acceleration in the pace of military evolution on the continent. The environmental variables of past centuries also continued in many areas. Some of these include: * Relatively low population densities that reduced forces for combat * Poor soils (particularly in tropical forest areas) and low crop productivity * Disease-carrying vectors that hindered deployment of weapons systems like cavalry and weakened infantry forces in many regions * Lack of good coastal harbors and navigable rivers ‚Äì hindering large scale logistics These variables impacted the development of military systems. Low population densities for example meant that large forces could not be raised and maintained in being for a long time. The Zulu as one instance, could field an estimated 50,000 warriors, impressive by regional standards. But this was the nation's entire armed strength, whereas more populous European nations during the Napoleonic Wars of the 19th century could routinely put this number of men into a single battle.Archer Jones, The Art of War in the Western World, University of Illinois Press: 1987, pp. 54‚Äì92, 267‚Äì381 Political fragmentation also hindered the growth of large armies, and African tribes could be divided and defeated separately by foreign invaders, just as Rome did with numerous tribal opponents in antiquity. Nevertheless, despite such limits, the internal consolidation and growth of African states played an important part in military transformation. The Zulu system for example did not rely on foreign horses, guns or ships. The evolution of African military systems is thus not a simple tale of outside influences but a complex web of indigenous development that adapted, shaped and sometimes rejected outside technology. =Firearms= The introduction of firearms was important, but guns on African battlefields were often of indifferent quality, and traditional weapons and tactics sometimes compared favorably with them. Indeed, Africans were well aware of the deficiencies of trade muskets and often demanded better quality than that offered. Most guns imported from Europe had not been test fired by the manufacturer to check for imperfections in bore and breach, although this was essential in the era of hand-forged barrels. Proven guns had proof-marks, and counterfeits flourished in the Africa trade. Firearms were thus a mixed bag on the ground, and the success of consolidating native powers like the Merina in Madagascar or the Zulu were due more to changes in indigenous organization, leadership and tactics, than to firearms. As the decades rolled on however, improvements to firearms, and other technology such as disease control (the cinchona bark to suppress malaria for example), and steamships were to give Europeans a decisive military edge on the continent. Naval developments Igbo war canoe from Nigeria, circa 1830s, demonstrates a blend of indigenous and imported technology. Construction is of a single log. Steering is provided by two oars-men in bow and stern. Muskets stand ready on the fighting platform in the center, and captured enemy flags and trophies fly overhead. Swivel guns and small cannon were sometimes installed. Naval warfare patterns showed continuity with that of the 18th century. Foreign-derived designs like dhows plied East African waters, pirates operated off the Barbary coast, and canoes also were used in ocean trading and fishing. Indigenous fighting vessels however, generally stayed inland or very close to home. Armament continued to be relatively weak, despite persistent attempts to \\"up-gun\\" war vessels. Small swivel cannon were reportedly first introduced late in the 18th century on the West Coast by one Antonio Vaz Coelho, a free Negro from Brazil. This practice accelerated in the 19th century. The city-state of Lagos for example, deployed medium-sized canoes carrying up to 25 men, armed with swivel-cannon. Soldiers on board attempted to force landings, using both muskets and swivel guns for covering fire. Naval tactics with these weapons sometimes followed a \\"fire and withdraw\\" pattern. The canoes maneuvered close inshore for firepower to be delivered, then backed out quickly to the open water to reload, before repeating the cycle. Generally cannons were placed in the bow or stern, with the boat absorbing the guns' recoil. The whole vessel had to be turned to deliver salvoes. Compared to European use of naval cannon, such artillery saw limited use in ship to ship engagements, or shore bombardments. As stand-off weapons covering troop landings or raiding missions however, they had serviceable anti-personnel value, particularly when combined with muskets. In Nigeria, large war canoes are reported, some mounting up to twenty pairs of swivel-guns on cross-beams at intervals of five or six feet. In 1841, the ruler of Abo was reported to muster some 300 canoes, many armed with muskets and bow/stern cannons. Some canoe fleets however relied on traditional weapons. On Lake Chad in the early 19th century the piratical Buduna fielded a fleet of some 1,000 reed canoes, using spears and shields for armament, and in East Africa, native kingdoms sometimes vied for supremacy with large numbers of canoes on the region's great lakes. Bigger war canoe tactics separated fighting men from rowing specialists, whether using muskets or traditional spears. In the Niger Delta, the bigger Itsekiri war canoes mounted multiple cannon and swivels, and carried 40 rowers and 100 warriors, with slaves doing most of the rowing duties. Slaves were also tasked with providing food for the canoe men. Commerce sometimes operated closely with war-making. Itsekiri traders operated their own fleets of fighting vessels, and the British navy was often unable to stop these fast-moving warrior-merchants as they flitted between the streams, lagoons and waterways of the Delta. On several occasions they fended off British warships by blockading narrow creeks and waterways, and in disputes with the colonial regime or European merchants, shut down trade on the Benin river for several months. Pirates also made use of fast canoes to plague commerce and local citizenry alike. War-canoe ports were often fortified with extensive stockades, and multiple trench lines, behind which teams of gunmen and other fighters were marshalled for defense. Some European slave-traders and their allies also made use of big canoes in their operations, plying the waterways in heavy vessels backed with musketeers and armed with small cannon, as they collected their human cargo for transport to the Americas.Adam Hochschild. (2005). Bury the Chains: Prophets and Rebels in the Fight to Free an Empire's Slaves. Macmillain. pp. 81‚Äì125 Naval developments mirror those on land. New technology like firearms was adapted and shaped to existing indigenous politics, technology and forms of organization. The landscape also played its part- limiting major, long-term water movement by rivers that were unnavigable for long stretches, contrary currents, and lack of good coastal harbors. Few native powers attempted any significant upgrades involving intensive sailing technology, or took to the oceans with long-distance ships in the European, Polynesian or Chinese manner. No African equivalent of the famous, ocean-spanning Chinese fleet admiral Cheng Ho was to emerge, although a number of inland captains rose to prominence. The days of Carthage long gone, African naval power remained primarily a localized phenomenon. Land warfare in the 19th century The post 1800 period saw a quickening of European expansion and conquest in Africa. This expansion did not go unopposed, nor was such activity the only significant military development on the continent. Indigenous states in all regions were developing new forms of political organization and military structure independently of, and before the major European interlude. =Cavalry and infantry in West Africa= Infantry forces in many areas relied heavily on poisoned arrows, using agents that affected the heart and nerves. A rapid volume of fire was often the key to success in combat. Traditional weapons saw substantial use well into the century, and weapons systems such as cavalry, archers, and spearmen clashed in many areas. The Mandingo horsemen of the Liberian hinterland for example were said to call out to fearful or fleeing infantry opponents with two options: \\"Stand and you are a slave; run and you are a corpse.\\" Mounted troops however were far from invincible. Bowmen made up the bulk of infantry strength in many areas, and the use of poisoned arrows and a rapid volume of fire partially offset weaknesses in bow strength and unfletched arrows. Against determined combinations of archers and spearmen, properly positioned and deployed, cavalry could be beaten. Just such a scenario unfolded in 1804, when Fulani groups proclaimed a jihad against the cavalry heavy state of Gobir, in what is today's Northern Nigeria. The Fulani, under Usman Dan Fodio, a religious reformer and teacher, suffered a number of initial setbacks against the fast-moving Gobir cavalry, most notably at the Battle of Tsuntua where some 2,000 men were lost. Fulani infantry tactics The cavalrymen of Gobir, under their leader Yunfa, initially mocked the inability of the Fulani to use horses effectively, but the Fulani replied with their own trump card, massed arrow fire, at the Battle of Tabkin Kwotto. Ordinarily, such fire would have been delivered by scattered bowmen in loose formation, vulnerable to quick charges by the Gobir chevaliers. In this particular battle however, the Fulani anchored their formation in a fairly wooded area, with one flank of their army resting on a lake. Although the cavalry of Gobir outflanked their opponents, the center of the Fulani formation held this strong position. Rather than deploy in the usual open skirmishing order, the Fulani bowmen adopted a square, grouping their archers in a compact block, and concentrating the firepower of their poisoned arrows. This broke the back of the Gobir formations, despite their armor. The tactics of the Fulani were continually refined over time, as they gained more victories and themselves began to acquire numbers of horses for their own cavalry arm. Dan Fodio wrote on tactics employed by his forces as the jihad campaign unfolded: The infantry armed themselves with large shields (diraq) and carried long lances and javelin. Grouped into ranks, a spearman knelt on the left knee, holding his round shield before him. Behind the ranks of spearmen the archers stood ready. They were ordered to shoot at the enemy horse and men in chain mail (duru). As the enemy cavalry approached the infantry would launch its javelins and the archers would keep shooting. If the enemy wavered, the infantry formation would then part left and right, so that their own cavalry was unleashed in pursuit. The writings of Dan Fodio on tactics echo a sentiment that would be approved by many a military commander: \\"Concentration is the first thing in victory: the beginning of defeat is dispersion.\\"Muslim Brotherhoods in Nineteenth-Century Africa by B. G. Martin, The American Historical Review, Vol. 83, No. 1 (Feb., 1978), pp. 220‚Äì246 Cavalry-infantry combination Cavalry still continued to be relevant in the 19th century. The Caliphate of Sokoto, was West Africa's largest single state during this period, and had its genesis in the many Muslim jihads across the region. Sokoto's core strike force was cavalry, although the bulk of its armies consisted of archers and spearmen. On the flat terrain of the savannahs, this combination did relatively well against indigenous opponents, although deployment in forested regions, and operations against fortifications suffered from the problems of earlier eras. Infantry, and their muskets, became increasing more important and dominant in some savannah areas as the decades progressed. Sokoto and several other cavalry-elite empires like Gobir however, continued to place their trust in the traditional weapons and fighting styles. This \\"old ways\\" approach of Sokoto can be seen in such battles as the 1826 clash with the state of Gobir, where some elite units of armored Sokoto cavalry had to be lifted onto their horses, like the medieval knights of Europe. The cavalry-elites depended heavily for their successes on cooperation with lesser esteemed infantry, who were critical in opening opportunities for attack, fixing an enemy into an unfavorable position, or in suppressing deadly counterfire by poisoned arrows. This conservatism in methods was to continue on into the 20th century, when the Sokoto hosts clashed with the modern weaponry of the British Empire. =The Ashanti military system= Organization, equipment and tactics =Mobilization, recruitment and logistics= From about 1700 to 1820, no nation on the Gold Coast of West Africa (region of modern-day Ghana) excelled the Ashanti in the scale of their military organization and activity. Wars of conquest made them the major power in the area, and they fought and won several major clashes against the British, before going down to defeat in the latter part of the 19th century. A small core of professional warriors was supplemented by peasant levies, volunteers and contingents from allied or tributary tribes. Grouped together under competent commanders such as Osei Tutu and Opoku Ware, such hosts began to expand the Ashanti empire in the 18th century on into the 19th, moving from deep inland to the edges of the Atlantic. One British source in 1820 estimated that the Ashanti could field a potential 80,000 troops, and of these, 40,000 could in theory, be outfitted with muskets or blunder-busses. =Arms and equipment= The Ashanti became familiar with firearms in the 18th century, and by the 19th century, the bulk of their best troops were armed with a variety of guns, such as the standard European trade muskets, 6 feet in length, so-called \\"Long Dane\\". The Long Dane, and other improved Africa-trade models that came into service over the years, were serviceable weapons in local context, but obsolete compared to first-rank European firearms. This was to cause problems against strong British forces in later wars. General Nkwanta, head of the Ashanti army's general council is reported to have done a detailed assessment of new breech- loading European firearms in 1872‚Äì73 and was troubled by the obsolescence of Ashanti muskets in comparison. Some of the muskets burst after a few firings, and good quality powder and shot were in short supply. Most of the tribal gunmen in addition, did not use wadding to compact the powder down into the barrels but simply dumped in it, then added a variety of lead slugs, nails, bits of metal or even stones. This made an impressive pyrotechnic display, but unless opponents were at very close range, the muskets were ineffective. The huge explosion and kick of the muskets also meant that men preferred to fire from the hip, causing them to aim high, with inaccurate results.Vandervort, pp. 61‚Äì72 Available guns were valued however, and carefully protected with leather or leopard skin covers, as were the pouches of ammunition each fighter carried. Soldiers carried thirty to forty gunpowder charges within reach, individually packed in small wooden boxes for quick reloading. Good bullets were scarce, and gunners were forced to use such substitutes as stones, metal pieces, and bits of lead. Compared to the European enemies they were to face in their later history, the weapons of the Ashanti were poor. The Ashanti fighting man also wore a buckskin belt, carrying several knives of various lengths. The belt also held a machete for cutting through bush, or hand-to- hand combat.The British Critic, Quarterly Theological Review, and Ecclesiastical Record, Published 1834, Printed for C. & J. Rivington, and J. Mawman, p. 165-172. Can be found on Google Books. Ceremonial Ashanti sword bearer =Organization of the Ashanti armies= The Ashanti national army was elaborately organized into 6 parts, each with various sub-divisions, and muskets gradually replaced bows and arrows as the main weapons. Such organization was based primarily on structures already in place locally, rather than being copies of European forms, and can be seen in the history of Akwamu, one of the earliest of all the centralized Akan forest kingdoms. Guns were added to and adapted to this six part breakdown as follows: # Scouts (akwansrafo), # Advance guard (twafo) # Main body (adonten), # Personal bodyguard (gyase) # Rear- guard (kyidom) # Two wings-left (benkum) and right (nifa). Each wing having two formations: right and right-half (nifa nnaase), left and left-half (benkum nnaase) On the move the army used this general breakdown- advance guard, main body, rearguard, and right and left wings. This detailed organization had several advantages, enabling the Ashanti generals to maneuver their forces with flexibility. The scouts performed recon and carried out pursuit operations. The advance guard could serve as initial storm troops or bait troops- getting an enemy to reveal his position and strength. The main body applied the bulk of the army's striking power. The personal bodyguard protected the king or high ranking nobles or generals in the field. The rear guard might function for pursuit, or as a reserve echelon. The two wings might attempt to carry out encirclement of the opposing force, or even strike at the rear.Charles Rathbone Low, A Memoir of Lieutenant-General Sir Garnet J. Wolseley, R. Bentley: 1878, pp. 57‚Äì176 Individualized acts of daring were encouraged, such as rushing out into the open to chop off the heads of wounded or dead enemies. A tally of these trophies was presented to the commanding general after the end of the engagement. Severe discipline prevailed in the Ashanti armies. Soldiers who faltered were whipped or slaswed with heavy swords carried by special contingents of \\"enforcer\\" troops ‚Äì the \\"sword- bearers.\\" Ashanti soldiers had to memorize the following saying: \\"If I go forward, I die; if I flee, I die. Better to go forward and die in the mouth of battle.\\" Generally the \\"enforcers\\" were deployed forward, between the scouts and the main force. They eased back as the battle started to better observe and intimidate the weary and faltering.The Victorians at war, 1815‚Äì1914: an encyclopedia of British military history. By Harold E. Raugh. ACL-CLIO: pp. 21‚Äì37 In a feature seldom seen among African armies, the Ashanti also deployed units of medical personnel behind the main forces, who were tasked with caring for the wounded and removing the dead.Vandervort, pp. 16‚Äì37 =Ashanti tactics= The flexibility of the Ashanti tactical system called for a large measure of decentralization, important in the thick forest terrain of Western Africa. This heavy jungle growth often hindered large scale clashes in the open involving thousands of men, as was seen among peoples like the Zulu or the Ndebele. Ashanti methods thus involved smaller tactical sub-units, ambushes, constant movement, and more dispersed strikes and counter-strikes. In one unusual incident in 1741 however, the armies of Asante and Akkem agreed to \\"schedule\\" a battle, and jointly assigned some 10,000 men to cut down trees to make space for a full scale clash. The Asante won this encounter. One 1844 British commentary on Ashanti tactics claims that they commenced operations by cutting a number of footpaths in the brush to approach and encircle the enemy force. Once reaching the initial jump-off point, Ashanti troops formed in line and attacked. Other accounts compared the Ashanti marching order to that of ants, with the use of several parallel columns that joined into one general striking force maneuvering before combat. Such a \\"converging columns\\" approach was ironically used by the British themselves in fighting the Ashanti, and is a tactic that appeared on the battlefields of Europe under Napoleon, as 'march divided, fight together' was the original raison d'etre of the division. These standardized tactics had often yielded the Ashanti victory. Scouts screened the army as it marched in its columns, then withdrew as the enemy became close. Upon the beginning of combat, the advance guard moved up in 2 or 3 lines, discharged its muskets and paused to reload. The second line would then advance to fire and reload, A third rear line would then repeat the advance ‚Äì fire-reload cycle. This \\"rolling fire\\" tactic was repeated until the advance halted. Flanking units would be dispatched as part of the fire and maneuver model. The Ashanti versus the British In facing the British, the Ashanti did not change their traditional tactics appreciably. They had initially advanced across the Prah River in a regional campaign before being confronted by an English invasion force. Beset by severe logistics problems, smallpox and dysentery they had pulled back across the river. Nevertheless, their battle plan was one that had worked earlier. The Ashanti sought to draw the British deep into their territory, against a strong defensive anvil centered at the town of Amoaful. Here the British would be tied down, while maneuvering wing elements circled to the rear, trapping and cutting them off. Some historians (Farwell 2001) note that this was \\"hammer and anvil\\" approach was a traditional Ashanti battle strategy, and was common in other African armies as well. It had served the Ashanti well against other African forces, and had beaten the British under Governor Charles McCarthy of Sierra Leone once before.Vandervort, pp. 90‚Äì103 In 1824 M'Carthy had advanced with a small force of African and colonial militia, and encountered 10,000 Ashanti at the village of Essamako. Perhaps hoping to sustain internal morale and/or overawe the opposing natives, McCarthy ordered the band of the Royal African Corps to play \\"God Save The King\\". The Ashanti moved up drums and horns and in turn struck up their own music, before launching an encircling attack. The British were quickly routed and M'Carthy was captured and beheaded, with his skull later serving as a drinking cup.Byron Farwell. 2001. The encyclopedia of nineteenth-century land warfare. WW Norton. p 56. At the village of Amoaful, the Ashantis succeeded in luring their opponents forward according to plan, and threatened them several times by flanking movements. Ashanti weaponry however, was poor compared to the modern weapons deployed by the redcoats, a point noted in the British accounts, and such superior arms served the British well in repulsing the Ashanti encirclements: \\"The Ashantees stood admirably, and kept up one of the heaviest fires I ever was under. While opposing our attack with immediately superior numbers, they kept enveloping our left with a constant series of well-directed flank attacks.\\"Charles Rathbone Low, A Memoir.. pp. 156‚Äì177 Enemy commander General Garnet Wolesey had anticipated Ashanti tactics and had strengthened the British flanks with the best units and stronger firepower. The earlier successes of the African kingdom were thus not repeated. Another tactic of the Ashanti during later wars against the British was to create powerful log stockades at key points to block British advances. Some of these fortifications were over a hundred yard long, with heavy parallel tree trunks sometimes impervious to destruction by artillery fire. Behind these stockades numerous warriors were mobilized to check enemy movement. While formidable in construction, many of these strongpoints failed because Ashanti guns, gunpowder and bullets were poor, and provided little sustained killing power in defense. Time and time again British troops overcame or bypassed the stockades by mounting old-fashioned bayonet charges, after laying down some covering fire. The Ashanti had given up effective use of traditional weapons like spears, and had little effective reply to the cold steel of an infantry charge except the weak volleys of their obsolete or malfunctioning muskets. Supplementary weapons like bush knives made an indifferent showing in these tactical situations against the European soldiers. The presence of African enemies also fighting alongside the British with their customary tribal arms also added to Ashanti woes. Supposed advanced technology in this case, the gun, became ironically, a handicap for the indigenous forces.The Ashanti campaign of 1900, (1908) By Sir Cecil Hamilton Armitage, Arthur Forbes Montanaro, (1901) Sands and Co. pgs 130‚Äì131 By contrast, the Zulu retained the effective use of their traditional spears, generally forcing the British to remain in packed defensive formations or entrenched strongpoints, protected by guns and artillery. Effectiveness of the Ashanti Some British commentary draws a sharp contrast between Ashanti fighting qualities and the shakiness and unreliability of the coastal tribes, ostensible allies of the invaders. At Amoaful, one combat post-mortem pays tribute to the Ashanti commander: \\"The great Chief Amanquatia was among the killed. Admirable skill was shown in the position selected by Amanquatia, and the determination and generalship he displayed in the defence fully bore out his great reputation as an able tactician and gallant soldier.\\" While the numbers fielded and weaponry compared unfavorably to the mass armies and industrial output of contemporary Europe, the Ashanti were a strong regional power, that did relatively well until confronted by the most advanced technology of a major world power in the latter half of the 19th century. As one Western historian observes: :\\"From 1807 to 1900, Asante armies fought numerous small and large battles against the British. In several of these they were the clear victors, the only West African army to defeat a European army in more than one engagement.\\" =Resistance to colonial expansion: Samori and Abd el-Kader= The policies of Samori Ture of Mali and Guinea and Abd el- Kader of Algeria illustrate how African states were expanding internally, while fighting foreign invasions. Both adapted to modern arms in performing these tasks. Abd-el Kader in Algeria Mobile French columns armed with modern artillery and rifles pursued a ruthless \\"scorched earth\\" policy to crush native resistance. By 1844, one third of the French Army, some 108,000 men were tied down in Algerian fighting. Unlike many parts of the continent, the operations of Abd el-Kader in Algeria represent a different pattern of warfare in opposition to colonial rule. While small scale raids, skirmishes and revolts always existed, the Algerian anti-French war of the 19th century persisted for decades as a major conflict, with indigenous armies using modern arms to prosecute it. The French conquest of Algeria began in 1834 with the seizure of Algiers, ousting the Ottoman regime. The tribes of the region rose in revolt and a brutal war ensued. In 1832, a new leader of the native forces gained prominence, the Emir Abd-El Kader, who managed to bring the fractious resistance into a common front against the enemy. El-Kader used guerilla tactics, drawing on rifle-armed mounted troops that relied on quick raids and ambushes. A series of treaties brought only temporary peace and the struggle continued. Ed-kader formed a core force of some 10,000 riflemen, supplemented by ad hoc tribal irregulars. Artillery was comparatively weak, with only a small number of cannon available for effective use. Instructors from Morocco, Tunisia and Europe were invited to help train and organize the main force. Support from the Sultan of Morocco was crucial to financing and equipping this central army. Shortages of weapons was always a pressing problem- and financing methods ranged from extraordinary taxes, state monopolies and the booty from raids on hostile tribes. The resistance army also build a number of fortresses throughout its operational area.Vladimir Borisovich Lutsky, Modern History of the Arab Countries, Progress Publishers: 1969, Moscow for the USSR Academy of Sciences, Institute of the Peoples of Asia, 1969; pp. 34‚Äì182 French investments to crush the resistance were massive. By 1839 they had concentrated some 70,000 men in Algeria. By 1844, a third of the French Army was fighting in Algeria ‚Äì some 108,000 troops ‚Äì a stark and extraordinary contrast to the typically small European or European-led forces that conquered most of Africa. French tactics changed to counter the swift guerrilla attacks of the native resistance. Heavy formations were broken down into mobile columns, and a ruthless \\"scorched earth\\" policy of devastation, plunder and destruction was enacted- seeking to break the native resistance by destruction of its resource base. Wells were poisoned, livestock shot, fields, houses and villages burned, and inhabitants driven into the countryside or exterminated. The ruinous devastation of the countryside severely hurt the Emir's war-making efforts, as did the seizure of his strongholds by the mobile columns. By 1844, El-Kader was forced to withdraw from Algeria to Morocco. Subsequent developments saw his capture and imprisonment by the French, who confiscated massive quantities of native land for settlement of French colons or settlers. This set the stage for an equally bloody resistance war, a century later. Abd el-Kader. While unsuccessful, the case of Abd el-Kader illustrates a significant pattern in African warfare that was an alternative to massed \\"human wave\\" attacks against small European or European-led forces armed with modern rifles, artillery, and in later years, machine guns (Gatlings and Maxims). El-Kader's forces fought a mobile guerrilla war, rather than gathering conveniently in one place where they could be decimated by European firepower. His troops were also relatively well armed with good rifles, although dependent on imports. El-Kader's inability to continue arming and supplying his forces also led to his eventual defeat, and his manpower base was relatively limited. Nevertheless, it took massive numbers of French troops, outnumbering his main force by 10 to 1, and their harsh \\"scorched earth\\" policy to prevail. Samori in Guinea and Ivory Coast Internal conquests of Samori. The armies and operations of African leader Samori Ture offer another illustration of the diversity, strengths and weaknesses of indigenous African military systems, both prior to and after clashes with expanding European colonial powers. Samori's resistance campaign is similar to that of the tribes of Algeria, both in the enemy he fought, and chronic shortages of modern weapons. There is however contrast with Abd el-Kader. Samori's main forces were infantry as compared to horsemen, and he pursued a \\"scorched earth\\" approach before the French to deny them resources, the reverse of the pattern under El-Kader. Samori was also a conqueror in his own right even before the coming of the French. The gun-armed sofa infantrymen were the main striking force of Samori's army. Operating on several fronts, one part defended against the French colonial armies, while another marched east, conquering and organizing new territories and peoples. He first rose to prominence in 1867, when he began carving out his own state in the Guinea Highlands bordering the Niger River. He understood the power of firearms early on and built up a disciplined force of musketeers. His search for reliable sources of supply was constant. Years of conquest continued and by 1878, he proclaimed himself faama (military leader) of his own Wassoulou Empire, that at its height was to include parts of today's Guinea, Mali, Sierra Leone and the northern C√¥te d'Ivoire. Alliances were struck with a number of African polities in this area, particularly the Fulbe (Fula) jihad state of Fouta Djallon, who were facing pressure from the expanding French to submit to a protectorate. The aggressive expansion of the French brought them into conflict with Samori's empire. The Samorian army was also constantly on the move, fighting on multiple fronts. Faced with French pressure in the west, Samori moved east, conquering areas in the Ivory Coast and Liberia as he maneuvered for combat and logistics space. A large number of civilians moved with the army. The discussion below is drawn from studies such as Legassick's \\"Firearms, Horses and Samorian Army Organization (1966). Structure of the Samorian army. Primarily infantry with cavalry as a smaller arm, the army structure consisted of 4 parts: the regulars (primarily slaves and captives), a mixed, less standardized conscripted reserve, detachments sent by allied or tributary chiefs, and a cavalry force. The basic rank of a regular infantryman was the sofa. The basic unit was a squad of ten, progressing to a company- sized unit of 200‚Äì300 men, and thence to larger groupings, typically of approximately 1,000 men. Squad and company leaders were generally mounted. Estimated numbers of fighting men are a source of debate, but the highest places an operational army at around 20,000 men. Of these about 5,000 were \\"regular\\" forces. This small permanent army of sofa-kun, directed and stiffened a larger mass of reservists. In the late years of Samoir's empire, more emphasis was placed on smaller detachments. Weapons and logistics. The Samorian army did manage to acquire a large number of repeating rifles. Replacement and resupply however including ammunition, was a continuing problem. Freetown, under British rule in Sierra Leone, was an important source of supply. The French tried incessantly to cut this pipeline, and finally did in collaboration with the British. An attempt was made to manufacture guns indigenously, but quality was poor, although the African gunsmiths did succeed in rendering a workable breech mechanism, and in various repairs. Ammunition was also manufactured, and was so precious that after each battle, empty cartridge cases and even bullets were collected. Tactics of the Samorian army. Samorian armies showed the capability of maneuvering against both indigenous and foreign forces. In one of his earliest clashes with the French for example, he executed a sweeping pincer movement to recapture the gold- producing center of Bure, a gambit that threatened to cut off the French rear, and forced them to withdraw. Additional victories were won at Nfadji and Dadadugu. Flexibility was also seen in Samori's organization, from the use of Konya warrior bands, to the traditional militia call-ups centered on a force of regulars, to his later use of riflemen organized in smaller European-style units. However, although Samori inflicted heavy casualties on the French in several encounters during the 1890s, growing French resources, mobility and firepower placed his regime in ultimate jeopardy.Bruce Vandervort 1998. Wars of Imperial Conquest, pp. 134-139 Lacking good firearms and ammunition, major battles against the French were fought by means of carefully arranged fixed lines, to maximize available firepower. Once these were disrupted however, they were difficult to reconstitute. The main forces however turned in excellent performances based on the accounts of French opponents, who were amazed at the marksmanship, discipline and maneuverability of Samori's forces. Acquisition of new breech-loading guns, enabling a soldier to both reload and fire from a concealed position, improved performance. Samori thus reduced his striking forces in the field as the war against the French progressed, cutting them into smaller detachments armed with better firearms. Samori Ture Infantry snipers and cavalry skirmishers began to be used more extensively and European deserters and renegades were hired to conduct troop training. Guerrilla tactics and harassment of French detachments and lines of supply received more emphasis. Infantry engagements became staggered. Rather than one fighting line persisting throughout a day, Samori's troops used multiple lines, withdrawing in more systematic fashion to form another for defense. The old call-up system was replaced by a more permanent force. Samori's army used larger formations as it fought against indigenous opponents in its southward drive towards the Ivory Coast and Guinea. Smaller numbers were deployed against the French. Samori's armies had to remain mobile, conquering new territory on one front, harassing the French on another, and doubling back to reoccupy old areas. The south-eastern front into Ivory Coast and Guinea took up most of Samori's attention after 1891, while his \\"burn and retire\\" tactics held off the Europeans in the West. In 1898 Samori began an epic march towards Boribana, moving an estimated 120,000 civilians along with the army. The French commander Lartigue comments on this move as being carried out successfully with credible precision and speed. French pressure continued relentlessly however, and Samori's force grew more constricted. He was captured by a small French striking force that burst into his camp from an unexpected direction in September 1898. His long struggle and disciplined organization however illustrates the capacity of indigenous systems to create new forms of organization, modify existing tribal ones, and adapt to new or improved technology. =From innovation to conservatism: the Zulu military system= Military reforms of Shaka The Zulu are a significant case in African military innovation and change. Their system of war transformed large portions of the continent and their methods spanned both the pre-gunpowder and gunpowder eras.Morris, pp. 17‚Äì68 Several innovations appeared as part of the existing indigenous cultural mix, and their adaptation by burgeoning kingdoms and chieftains to shifting opportunities and changes as the 19th century dawned. The best known leader to emerge from this flux was the ruthless chieftain Shaka, who adapted a number of tribal practices that transformed the Zulu from a small, obscure tribe to a major regional power in Southern Africa. Antecedents of Shaka. Some scholars caution against giving Shaka unlimited or sole credit for the military developments that appeared among the tribes of the region. Modern research suggest kingdoms or chieftainships already long in place that could mobilize substantial numbers of troops, and did not have to wait for a Shaka in the 19th century to suddenly appear.Etherington, Norman. 2004. WERE THERE LARGE STATES IN THE COASTAL REGIONS OF SOUTHEAST AFRICA BEFORE THE RISE OF THE ZULU KINGDOM? History in Africa 31, 157-183. Reports from one group of shipwrecked Portuguese in 1552 for example, show that they were forcibly disarmed of their muskets by a powerful local ruler heading a large fighting force. Another group of survivors of a Dutch shipwreck in 1686 could not prevent a local chieftain from breaking up the wreck and taking its iron because the commander appeared on the beach with around 1,000 disciplined warriors.Etherington 157-183 Various other shipwreck survivor accounts report substantial battles between opposing forces armed with large shields and spears. Other data indicates that the Shakan reforms were not necessarily continued in all respects. Rather than rigidly using his short spear only, the Zulu soldier in the Anglo-Zulu clash of 1879 typically carried a \\"kit\\" of throwing spears that were flung first, rather like the Roman piluuwm to \\"soften up\\" and occupy the enemy, followed by a quick advance and close quarters work with a hand-held stabbing spear. The tactical advantages of a combined missile-shock \\"kit\\" for these later troops, outweighed Shaka's earlier \\"hand-to-hand spear only\\" dictum. Adaptations of Shaka. Age-grade groupings, the advantages of an aggressive charge or encircling an enemy, etc., are all known in tribal warfare of the period. Elements of a regimental system for example had been put in place under Shaka's predecessor Dingiswayo. What was different were much more ruthless combinations and systematic uses of all these elements to produce the distinctive Zulu system. Shaka borrowed and adapted the surrounding cultural elements to implement his own aggressive vision, seeking to bring combat to a swift and bloody decision, as opposed to ritualistic displays or duels of individual champions, scattered raids, or skirmishes where casualties were comparatively light. Such a brutal focus demanded changes in weapons, organization and tactics. New weapons and new organisation Military innovations such as the assegai, the age-grade regimental system and encirclement tactics helped make the Zulu one of the most powerful nations in southern and south-eastern Africa. New spear and shield. Shaka is credited with introducing a new variant of the traditional weapon, discarding the long, spindly throwing weapon and instituting a heavy, shorter stabbing spear, the iKlwa. The spear was wielded underhand, on the manner of the Roman sword. He is also said to have introduced a larger, heavier cowhide shield, and trained his forces to use them both in closing quickly with the enemy in more effective hand-to-hand combat.Morris, 48 Local skirmishers used to tossing their spears and pulling back would be confronted by an aggressive force closing for the kill. None of these weapons changes are spectacular in the local context, but mated to an aggressive mobility and tactical organisation, they were to make a devastating impact. Logistics. The fast moving host lived off the land primarily, but were also aided with a supply system provided by young boys, who were attached to a force and carried rations, cooking pots, sleeping mats, extra weapons, rations, and other material. Cattle were sometimes driven on the hoof as a movable larder. Again, such arrangements in the local context were probably nothing unusual. What was different was the systematisation and organisation, a pattern yielding major benefits when the Zulu were dispatched on military missions. Shaka's general ratio of logistic personnel was one herdboy to three men. Age-grade regimental system. Age-grade groupings of various sorts were common in the Bantu tribal culture of the day. Shaka manipulated this system, transferring the loyalty of the traditional clan groupings to himself, thus strengthening his personal hegemony. Such groupings on the basis of age, did not constitute a permanent, paid military in the modern Western sense, nevertheless they did provide a stable basis for sustained armed mobilisation, much more so than ad hoc tribal levies or war parties. Shaka organised the various age grades into regiments, and quartered them in special military kraals, with each regiment having its own distinctive names and insignia. Mobility and training. Shaka discarded sandals to enable his warriors to run faster. Initially the move was unpopular, but those who objected were simply killed, a practice that quickly concentrated the minds of available personnel. Shaka drilled his troops frequently, implementing forced marches that could cover more than fifty miles a day. He also drilled the troops to carry out encirclement tactics (see below). Such mobility gave the Zulu a significant impact in their local region and beyond. Encirclement tactics. The Zulu typically took the offensive, deploying in the well known \\"buffalo horns\\" formation. The attack layout was composed of three elements: # the \\"horns\\" or flanking right and left wing elements to encircle and pin the enemy. Generally the \\"horns\\" were made up of younger, greener troops. # the \\"chest\\" or central main force which delivered the coup de grace. The prime fighters made up the composition of the main force. # the \\"loins\\" or reserves used to exploit success or reinforce elsewhere. Often these were older veterans, sometimes positioned with their backs to the battle so as not to get unduly excited. Organisation of the Zulu forces. The Zulu forces were generally grouped into 3 levels: regiments, corps of several regiments, and \\"armies\\" or bigger formations, although the Zulu did not use these terms in the modern sense. Size distinctions were taken account of, any grouping of men on a mission could collectively be called an impi, whether a raiding party of 100 or horde of 10,000. Numbers were not uniform, but dependent on a variety of factors including assignments by the king, or the manpower mustered by various clan chiefs or localities. A regiment might be 400 or 4000 men. These were grouped into Corps that took their name from the military kraals where they were mustered, or sometimes the dominant regiment of that locality.Isandlwana 1879: The Great Zulu Victory, Ian Knight, Osprey: 2002, pp. 5‚Äì58 While the modest Zulu population could not turn out the hundreds of thousand available to major world or continental powers like France, Britain, or Russia, the Zulu \\"nation in arms\\" approach could mobilize substantial forces in local context for short campaigns, and maneuver them in the Western equivalent of divisional strength. The victory won by Zulu king Cetawasyo at Ndondakusuka, for example, two decades before the British invasion of 1879, involved a battlefield deployment of 30,000 troops.Donald Morris, 1962. The Washing of the Spears, pp. 195‚Äì196 Higher command and unit leadership. An inDuna guided each regiment, and he in turn answered to senior izinduna who controlled the corps grouping. Overall guidance of the host was furnished by elder izinduna usually with many years of experience. One or more of these elder chiefs might accompany a big force on an important mission. Coordination of tactical movements was supplied by the indunas who used hand signals and messengers. Generally before deploying for battle, the regiments were made to squat in a semicircle while these commanders made final assignments and adjustments. Lower level regimental izinduna, like the NCOs of today's armies, and yesterday's Roman centurions, were extremely important to morale and discipline. Prior to the clash at Isandhlwana for example, they imposed order on the frenzied rush of warriors eager to get at the British, and steadied those faltering under withering enemy fire during the battle.Morris, pp. 361‚Äì367. An Undi Corps commander named Qetuka for example is mentioned in this role. The Zulu in the gunpowder era At Isandhlawana, the Zulu impis scored their greatest victory, liquidating a significant part of the British invasion force. More British officers were killed at Isandhlawana by the Zulu, than Napoleon killed at Waterloo.Vandervort, pp. 20‚Äì78 Victories. The Zulu system spanned both the spear and gunpowder eras and exemplified the typical outcome in Africa when native armies were confronted by European forces armed with modern weapons. Unlike many other native armies however, the Zulu scored one of the biggest African victories over colonial forces, annihilating a British column at Isandhlawana and almost over-running a detachment at Rorke's Drift. Proceeding at a more leisurely pace than their reputed 50 miles per day, a large impi approached the British camp almost undetected, in dispersed units that hid its full strength. The total force was concentrated and positioned in a deep ravine near the enemy position, waiting until the omens were good for an assault. Discovered by a British cavalry patrol, the entire impi sprang up as one man, and launched their attack from some 4 miles away, in their classic \\"buffalo horns\\" formation. Morris (1965)Morris, p. 363 holds that in the fluid situation, the commanding Zulu generals struggled to shape the battle and position their forces in the proper order as the warriors streamed forward, but only succeeded in holding back one corps (the Undi), and one regiment (the uDloko) which had been located a mile behind the main body. McBride (1976) maintains that the Zulu commanders were already well informed by their scouts (izinhloli) of British dispositions and their preliminary positioning and the classic 'buffalo horns' deployment would shape the resulting battle despite the early running start, with the right horn circling the mountain to attack from the rear, the felt horn pinning the redcoats in place and cutting them off, the chest delivering the main blow, and the \\"loins\\" held back in reserve from the initial rush. These \\"tail end\\" reserves, who had been held in check by their unit commanders, were to later pursue fugitives and clash with the stalwart British defenders of Rorke's Drift.Angus McBride, The Zulu War, Osprey: 1976, p. 17-19 Whatever the final adjustments made, both writers show that the Zulu force, for all its eagerness, was no wild horde, but a disciplined formation, moving into combat according to its training. The attack was met by withering British rifle, rocket and artillery fire that made part of the advance falter. The British however had divided their forces- part of it being away on a search for the main Zulu Army. That army materialized behind their backs at Isandlwana, and moved quickly to exploit the situation. Poor positioning and deployment of troops, (failure to base the camp on a strong central wagon or laager fortification for exampleIan Knight, Adrian Greaves (2006) The Who's who of the Anglo-Zulu War: The British also contributed to fatal weaknesses in the British defences, and the fiery exhortations of the regimental indunas encouraged the host of warriors to continue attacking. When pressure by the maneuvering Zulu formations caused the crumbling of the redcoat line, the Zulu prongs surged through and around the gaps, annihilating the camp's defenders.Morris, pp. 545‚Äì596 Some recent historians hold that much play was given to the relatively small Rorke's Drift battle to divert attention from the disaster at Isandhlwana where the Zulu clearly outmaneuvered the British, and lured the redcoats into splitting their strength through diversionary actions around Magogo Hills and Mangeni Falls. These gambits saw Chelmsford leading a substantial detachment out in search of the elusive Zulu \\"main impi\\" leaving half his army behind at the Isandhlwana camp. It was at Isandhlwana that the main force materialized undetected to liquidate their enemies. They also hold that the main Zulu force was not a startled horde that simply charged when discovered, but had already been generally pre-positioned by their commanders for the great surge forward.Ron Lock and Peter Quantrill. 2006. Zulu Victory: The Epic of Isandlwana and the Cover-up. p230, 234-241 The liquidation of almost 1,000 European troops with modern arms by the African spearmen sparked disbelief and uproar in Britain. Aside from the losses of British regulars, and the supporting native levies, the Zulu impi killed more British officers at Isandhlawana, than Napoleon killed at Waterloo. Historian John Laband also maintains that the Zulu approach march to the battle was an excellent one, that screened their final movement across the face of the opposition force, and took advantage of Chelmsford's fatal spitting of British fighting strength: ::\\"Meanwhile, the joint Zulu commanders, who had indeed been considering a flank march to Chelmsford's east to join with Matshana and cut the British column off from Natal, decided instead to take advantage of the general's division of forces. They detached men to reinforce Matshana, but on the same evening of 21 January and during the next they transferred the main army across the British front to the deep shelter of the Ngwebeni valley. This was truly a masterful manoeuvre. The amabutho moved rapidly in small units, mainly concealed from the Isandlwana camp nine miles away by the Nyoni Heights. The British mounted patrols that sighted some of the apparently isolated Zulu units had no inkling an entire army was on the move.\\"John Laband. 2014. Zulu Warriors: The Battle for the South African Frontier, 229. Defeat. Long term Zulu success against a major world power however was a questionable proposition. Even in the victory at Isandhlwana the Zulu had taken heavy losses,Lock and Quantrill, 234-241 and the efficacy of spears and a few untrained gunmen against modern rifles, machine guns and artillery of a major nation was ultimately limited. In his earlier encounters with European visitors to his kingdom, the Zulu King Shaka had dismissed firearms as ineffective against the massed charge of the regiments. At Isandhlawana, the monarch's boast held true, and it was not an unreasonable one, given the slow-firing, sometimes malfunctioning, obsolete trade muskets the Europeans demonstrated.Guy, J. J. A Note on Firearms in the Zulu Kingdom with special reference to the Anglo-Zulu War, 1879. Journal African History, XII, 1971, 557-570 But as the Zulu War went on, massed rifle and artillery fire repeatedly broke the back of Zulu attacks, as they persisted in assaulting heavily fortified positions and failed to use captured firearms effectively. Despite earlier defeats by the Boers using guns, 4 decades earlier, the Zulu had not sufficiently adapted to the realities of firepower on the battlefield,. They also failed to effectively cut the vulnerable supply lines of their enemies- leaving the Natal rear area virtually untouched for example. Contrary to popular belief many African armies did not have vast supplies of fighting personnel (see \\"Significant Influences\\" above). The war put tremendous pressure on the Zulus relatively limited manpower resources, a pattern repeated throughout Africa where comparatively small kingdoms clashed with European states like Britain or France. At Isandhlwana for example, the Zulu main force had marched for three days straight, without eating on the last two. As the regiments deployed for attack they had a four-mile run to reach the British camp, before entering into the immediate battle. The reserve force of the impi, the uDokolo regiment, had another twelve mile run to make immediately after, where they attacked the fortified British position for ten hours straight. Such intensity could not be sustained with available manpower and logistics. At the final Battle of Ulundi, the depleted Zulu formations made a relatively weak attack before being scattered.Vandervort, p. 20 Some historians hold that the victory at Ulindi was a token one, driven by the need for Lord Chelmsford to salvage some success after Isandhlwana, and the British withdrew quickly followed by Chelmsford's resignation as commanded of the British forces. The end of the war saw the Zulu retaining their lands. ::\\"Seen in terms of the political ends for which the war was fought, the battle of Ulundi, like the campaign in Zululand itself, was a failure. The effectiveness of Zulu resistance had destroyed the policy which brought about the war, and discredited the men responsible. The only point on which all whites agreed was that some form of face-saving military victory was required in Zululand. Ulundi was that token military victory. It did not end the war in Zululand‚Äîpeace was attained by Sir Garnet Wolseley who, as Chelmsford scurried out of the country, entered Zululand proclaiming that if the Zulu returned to their homes they would be left in full possession of their land and their property. By July 1879 both sides desired an end to hostilities. For reasons of economy, because of military requirements elsewhere and the political capital being made out of the war, the British government wanted an end to this embarrassing demonstration of imperial ineptitude. Any chance of an easy military conquest of the entire territory seemed slight: the army was tied to its inadequate supply lines, and conquest would have necessitated a change in strategy and tactics which presupposed a change in military leadership. It was easier and cheaper to elevate Ulundi to the rank of a crushing military victory and abandon plans to subjugate the Zulu people than to create the force of mobile righting units which would have been required to conquer the Zulu completely.\\" Influence of the Zulu system The Zulu military system was to transform large swathes of the continent, from south east Africa, into parts of East and Central Africa through the disruptive warfare that broke out during the reign of Zulu king Shaka. The disruption, known as the Mfecane had several causes, but it was to create several powerful nations in its wake, such as the Swazi, the Nebebele, the Shangaan and others. Many of these new powers copied Zulu methods, weapons and tactics, and saw a measure of success against both indigenous and foreign opponents. The Shangaan for example, founded by war- leader Soshangane, were to migrate into what is now Mozambique and force the Portuguese into paying them tribute.JD Omer-Cooper, The Zulu Aftermath, Longmans, London 1966 =Horses, guns and indigenous adaptation in Southern Africa= Guns, wagons and horses gave the Boer commandos important tactical advantages over their foes. These weapons were later acquired by some groups like the Griqua and the Basotho. The powerful horse and gun system of the Boers. While not indigenous to the continent, the horse and gun system of the Boers, and their defensive wagon laager, was to have profound effects on military developments in the southern portion of Africa. Mounted warfare enabled them to beat or fight a wide variety of African enemies to a standstill, although they suffered their share of defeats over the decades. Skilled horsemen, and excellent shots, the Boers acquitted themselves well in a variety of tactical situations, against both African enemies and imperial forces. Several groups arose that emulated the horse and gun system. Prominent among these were the outcasts, the half-caste or mixed race product of Dutch and African interaction, and/or alliances with other dispossessed tribal elements- peoples like the Griqua, Bergnaars, Koranna and Basters. Acquiring weapons and mounts over the course of time, they too began to carve out their own sphere of influence in the region, alternately battling Boer, Bantu and Briton at various times in their history. Rise of the Basotho system. Several tribal kingdoms such as the Tlokoa, Pedi and Basotho took up horse and gun, despite collaboration between the Boers and the British to prevent such transfers, particularly of firearms. The Basotho, a small tribal grouping threatened by the Zulu, Ndebele, as well as the Europeans, adapted to both weapons systems, and carried out a complex mix of warfare and diplomacy to fend off their enemies. They became avid horsemen, and in time, developed the tough, durable breed, that was to be known as the Basuto pony. The Basotho equipped their mounted fighters with guns, although the traditional spear, battle-axe, and knobkerrie (club) continued in use. Most of the firearms were low quality flintlocks, and ammunition and gunpowder were usually in short supply. Marksmanship according to contemporary European observers was not as good as that of the Boers. The tribal warriors also relied heavily on fortifications in their mountainous country, the most famous of which was Thaba Boisu, fortress capital of their king Moshoeshoe. Battles against English and Boer forces. The Basotho clashed with several enemies to maintain their fragile independence. In the 1840s they fought against the Tlokwa, who were also mounted, and against the Zulu-influenced Nedebele, who were primarily infantry. In 1851, a British colonial force invaded Sotho country and was soundly defeated at the battle of Kononyaba (or Viervoet). Against the British, who deployed an artillery piece, the spear and battle-axe proved more useful than guns when the Sotho hemmed in the invaders on a mountaintop. Victory was gained by close hand-to-hand fighting. This incident provided a significant check to British power in the area. The following year another British force tried its luck, and was also defeated. This encounter saw the widespread deployment of Sotho cavalry. At one point in the battle, some 6,000 Basotho horsemen mounted a charge against the British formation. They were repulsed by rifle and artillery fire. Nevertheless, the tribal regiments controlled the field at the end of the day, and the British withdrew. Basotho cavalry relied on open order deployment rather than the standardized formations of many contemporary US or European forces. Against one British force in 1852 some 6,000 Basotho horsemen charged the enemy line. Facing a British ban against arms sales to Africans in the 1850s, the Basotho desperately tried to manufacture their own cartridges and gunpowder with assistance from European deserters. The results were poor and of little value when a Boer invasion from the Orange Free State threatened in 1858. The Boer force was armed with modern breech-loading rifles and several pieces of artillery, and their firepower took a heavy toll against the tribal warriors. The Basotho however withdrew to their mountain strongholds, particularly Thaba Boisiu, and a siege commenced. Counterattacks from the fortress saw some success, with one foray killing 30 enemy troops, and the siege became a stalemate. Eventually the Boers were forced to withdraw when the Basotho dispatched horsemen to raid homesteads and fields behind their lines. Another Boer invasion in 1867 was more dangerous for the Basotho. The Europeans had upgraded their rifles, obtained more powerful artillery, and augmented their numbers with white volunteers from across South Africa. Once again they converged on Thaba Boisu, liquidating local strongholds on the way. A first assault against the fortress ended in failure. A second drove the Basotho back from their advanced defence lines, but also became bogged down. A third also stalled when a Boer leader was shot dead. The conflict dragged on for 6 months as the Boers ravaged Basotho territory, seizing cattle, people and burning crops to bring their opponents to heel. In early 1868 however Moshoeshoe persuaded the British to intervene and placed his kingdom under crown protection. This ended the Boer siege although a subsequent treaty transferred yet more Basotho land to their enemies. The 'gun war' ‚Äì defeat of colonial forces. The Basotho continued to use their horse-gun system under the new colonial regime to maintain their independence. In the 1880s, their territory was annexed by Cape Colony and a punitive expedition of 800 white troops and 1500 African allies was dispatched to crush the opposition of one Moorosi, a dissenting Sotho chieftain. Moorosi gathered some 300 gunmen in a strong mountaintop position and fought off the colonial forces for over 8 months. After three major assaults, and continuous shelling by artillery, the position was overrun, Moroosi was killed and his lands seized. As the struggle with Moorosi raged, colonial authorities reserved part of Basutoland for white settlement and demanded that all natives surrender their firearms. This demand was rejected and another British expedition was dispatched to liquidate resistance, sparking the so-called \\"Gun War.\\" The Sotho horsemen however used a flexible mix of tactics: defensive positions on fortified hills, attacks against administrative centers of the colonial regime, and frequent use of guerrilla strikes and ambushes against lumbering colonial columns, most notably a column of British lancers at Qalabani. The combination of mobility, firepower, ambushes, and hit and run strikes was sufficient to stalemate or defeat the Basotho's enemies for almost a year. Stymied, the colonial army, and the disarmanent demand was withdrawn. Rejecting colonial demands to give up their guns, mounted Basotho fighters repulsed British attacks during the \\"Gun War\\", 1880‚Äì81. End of the regional balance of power. While other African groups adapted to horses and guns, the Basotho state successfully maintained a measure of independence from the many enemies that sought to destroy it. The Basotho case again demonstrates the complexity of African military systems, often conceived mainly in terms of hordes of attacking, spear-wielding infantry. A fuller picture must include the cavalry tradition, both in the south and in western Africa, and must take into account the alternative, tactical defensive style of peoples like the Shona and Basotho. The case of the Basotho, Zulu, Xhosa and others also shows that indigenous militaries could learn and adapt, and could achieve credible performances even in the 19th century. Some historians note that a rough balance of power prevailed in the region, with native military systems generally holding their own against settler forces and local colonial levies. The heavier intervention of British power however choked off the free market in firearms, and/or deployed regular imperial troops with modern repeating rifles, artillery and machine guns. Such imperial troops in turn, were also to crush Boer power during the Boer War, circa 1899‚Äì1902. =Adapting to modern arms: the Ethiopians at Adowa= Proficiency in handling modern rifles and artillery aided the Ethiopians in the historic defeat of the Italians at Adowa. Ethiopian artillery for example outgunned Italian batteries at one point in the encounter. The Ethiopian victory at Adowa demonstrates the increasing ability of African forces to handle modern arms as gunpowder weapons began to dominate the field. Painful lessons in the killing efficiency of rifled firepower had been dealt the Ethiopian forces in earlier encounters with European armies. At the battle of Aroge for example, British volleys from breechloading rifles crushed the Emperor Tewodros' troops, and the British campaign was to end in his death and the destruction of his capital. Adaptations to modern arms. Others learned however. Tewodros's successor, Yohannes IV had been backed by the British and received 500,000 pounds (sterling) worth of military equipment. This was put to good use against a variety of other enemies, including the Mahdi's dervish forces from the Sudan, and in inflicting a crushing defeat on an Italian force at the Battle of Dogali in 1887. In 1875 and 1876, Yohannes' troops also defeated substantial Egyptian armies trained and officered by European mercenaries and US Civil War veterans. The Egyptians had been equipped with Remington rifles, Krupp artillery, Gatling guns and rocket tubes. This hardware was transferred to the victorious Ethiopian forces, and captured Egyptian gunners were pressed into service, training the Ethiopians to use the big guns.Vandervort, p. 23 Yohannes' successor Menelik continued the armed buildup, and by the 1890s the Ethiopians were a tough fighting force on their own ground, capable of mobilizing massive numbers of infantry. Military and diplomatic links with other nations such as Imperial Russia (chief military mission in the war-time Nikolay Leontiev) were also established.Special role for this purpose was played by the Russian military advisers and volunteers of Menelik's army.

In accordance with the order of emperor of Ethiopia, Directly Nikolay Leontiev organized the first battalion of the regular Ethiopian army, it was represented to Menelik II, in February, 1899. Leontiev formed a first regular battalion, the kernel of which became the company of volunteers from the former Senegal shooters (disappointed or unreliable for colonial authorities), which he chose and invited from Western Africa, with training of the Russian and French officers. The first Ethiopian military orchestra was organized at the same time. Count Leontiev is spy or adventurer... Nikolay Stepanovich Leontiev Historian Bruce Vandervort in Wars of Imperial Conquest in Africa, 1830‚Äì1914, notes that around 100,000 Ethiopian soldiers fought at Adowa, with about 70,000 of them carrying modern repeating rifles. The bulk of these were infantry. The remaining 30,000 men fought with traditional weapons- spear, sword and buffalo-hide shield.Vandervort, pp. 159‚Äì172 The Ethiopians also deployed a number of machine guns, and were the only Africans to employ artillery to any extent during the colonial wars. Some of their gunners were foreign, but many were indigenous artillerymen, who took over the batteries captured from the Egyptians. The performance of the artillery arm proved a key factor in the Ethiopian victory. Their \\"quick- firing Hotchkiss artillery forced the surrender of an Italian fort in the run-up to the battle of Adowa, and actually outgunned an Italian battery at a crucial point during the battle itself.\\". In many ways the Ethiopian army at Adowa was a traditional one that lacked the industrial base and elaborated military establishment of the typical European force. Proficiency however had been gained through long years of campaigning, as the various emperors consolidated power over internal and external foes. :\\"Taken all together, the Ethiopian Army was formidable by any standards. Its tough fighting men were masters of both skirmish, or ambush warfare and shock action. A rare combination by African standards, and one that often caused unpleasant surprises for Ethiopia's enemies.\\" At Adowa, victorious Ethiopian forces inflicted the most casualties of any major 19th Century battle, a rate exceeding 50%, more than that inflicted on the French at Eylau or Waterloo.Vandervort, p. 164. Such proficiency however masked many internal weaknesses, including poor logistics, and lack of advanced standardization in organization. Before the battle for example, the Emperor was considering leaving the field because of low supplies. Such deficiencies would count heavily against the indigenous forces in later years when faced with a new Italian invasion under Mussolini in the 1930s. Nevertheless, on the day of Adowa, the Ethiopians were supremely ready for the struggle before them. The battle. At Adowa, the Italian force, estimated at 18,000 were heavily outnumbered, but had good rifles and some 56 pieces of artillery, and was also stiffened by high quality, elite bersaglieri and alpini units that marched with some 15,000 European soldiers supported by a smaller number of 3,000 African askari. Prior to the encounter, their commander Bartieri dug into a strong fortified position, hoping to lure the Ethiopians into attacking him. They did not oblige, and a stalemate ensued. Urgings from Rome prompted Bartieri to advance against the Ethiopian concentration at Adowa. The Emperor was considering retreat as supplies ran low, but also hoped that by maneuver, he would draw out his opponents. The Italian advance set the stage for battle. Their forward movement on Adowa was a confused affair and their columns became separated. Ethiopians troops positioned themselves to intercept, and covered by accurate artillery fire, launched a fierce attack that took advantage of this vulnerability, rolling up the Italian line with continuous pressure. They killed over 3,000 Italians and wounded hundreds. A smaller number of African soldiers in Italian service, about 2,000, were also killed, and over 1,000 wounded. A further 954 Italian troops were missing in action, and the army lost some 11,000 rifles, all of its 56 artillery pieces, and had to endure guerrilla attacks as it pulled back from the killing zone. Ethiopian losses were about 7,000 dead and 10,000 wounded. Thousands of European captives were taken, and the Italian government paid some 10 million lire in reparation money for the survivors after the defeat. Some 800 Tigrean askari troops who fought for the Italians met a more brutal fate. Considered traitors, they had their right hands and left feet cut off. Although the Ethiopians were to be less successful or prepared some 40 years later against Mussolini's troops, the victory at Adowa, which repeated the smaller triumph at Dogali some 9 years earlier, was to become a landmark in African military history. Significance of the Adowa victory. News of the disaster caused the fall of the Crispi government in Italy and riots in urban areas. The shock of Adowa exceeded the British shock at Isandhlwana, with both disasters magnified by the realization that indigenous forces had beaten modern European regulars in the open field. As one Italian historian notes: :\\"It was the realization that their belief in their superiority over the \\"blacks\\" was an illusion.. A whole swaggering ethos.. of conquest was shattered before the eyes of soldiers who saw thousands of human lives snuffed out in a few hours in a strange and hostile land with no possibility of defence, who succumbed before a people who had been reduced to semi-savages in their eyes, who were beaten by an African army depicted right up to the eve of battle as disorganized, poorly armed and incapable of formulating a strategy.\\"Vandervort, p. 164 While Adowa has attracted much attention in a political and African nationalist sense, one Western military historian notes that the battle was a relatively costly affair for a European army in terms of force-ratio casualties- indeed one of the most proportionately costly major battles of the 19th century. :\\"Baratieri's army suffered 50 percent casualties, far higher than those suffered by participants in any other major battle of the nineteenth century. Eylau, the greatest blood-letting of the Napoleonic era, cost the French army casualties of 33.8 per cent and its losses at Waterloo were just under 30 per cent. \\"Macello, carneficina, strage\\" (butchery, slaughterhouse, slaughter) are the words which recur in the memories of the Italian combatants at Adowa.\\" Summary of African military systems: 1800‚Äì1900 The 19th century saw a dynamic process of indigenous military innovation and development not simply colonialism. Military systems on the continent during the 19th century illustrate the complexity of previous eras, to which was added the growing pace and weight of European colonialism. These systems defy the easy categorization and depictions of popular media and imagination- often stereotyped in terms of wildly charging hordes on foot, while ignoring the continent's long established archery and cavalry traditions. As noted by one Western historian for example, the notion of countless attacking spearmen is a myth. Manpower resources were often limited. In the 19th century, European nations like Prussia could put some 300,000 men into a single campaign. Only the Ethiopians at Adowa with their 100,000 effectives approached this level of mobilization ‚Äì \\"the savage hordes of popular lore seldom materialized on African battlefields.\\" Vandervort, p. 39 At times however, local troop concentrations for battle could be quite substantial, comparing favorably with the numbers available in smaller European states, or on some European battlefields.Norman Davies, Europe: A History, Oxford University Press, 1996, pp. 577‚Äì759 For example, combat forces of some 12,000 to 13,000 cavalry are documented for one kingdom in pre-colonial West Africa, comparable to the numbers Napoleon would deploy at Waterloo. Indigenous military organization also encompasses Africa's substantial cavalry or mounted tradition, from the armored chevaliers of Western Africa, to the desert horsemen of North Africa, to the mounted fighters of the Basotho in their southern redoubts. On the waters of the continent, naval activities must be accounted for, not simply canoe transport, but fighting vessels, ports, and troop landings covered by poisoned arrows, bullets and cannonballs. Different styles of warfare and modes of organization are also demonstrated by indigenous systems, from the patient tactical defensive of the Basotho, the elaborate armies of Ashanti, the sweeping offensive horns of the Zulu impi, and the protracted guerrilla styles and archery of forest peoples like the Lobi, or the San (Bushmen) further south. As regards styles of organization, different approaches over different eras can be seen. Among the Kongo kingdoms of the 18th century for example, a mixture of unit types was deployed ‚Äì heavy infantry with strong shields for example, backed by lighter contingents armed with bows and spears. Special units of elite troops and bodyguards were also maintained. Like the reorganized Roman legions of old however, the later Zulu system dispensed with such distinctions in favor of one streamlined combat organization and method. Such standardized methods were to be copied by other tribes, and were to dominate or influence large parts of southern Africa and beyond during the 19th century. Such complexity again illustrates that African military systems cannot be conceived of in static, one-dimensional terms. The introduction of firearms does not tell the whole story of the 19th century due to their mixed impact and use in many regions. Indeed, some historians argue that mere advanced technology was not the single most decisive factor in the outcome of many colonial conquests. More important, was the divided, fragmented nature of many small African polities that enabled them to be defeated separately by their enemies. Such fragmentation is not unique to Africa. Germany for example in 1815, was split into over 30 separate states. Despite these weaknesses, until well into the second part of the century, many native forces held their own until the coming of modern artillery, machine guns and rifles. Duala war- canoe, Cameroon, 1884 The 19th century also cannot be seen simply in terms of European plans or schemes, some historians maintain. Instead, African states were executing their own agendas, based on whatever internal factors they thought relevant. Such internal factors and actors (Shaka for example) sparked a number of significant conflicts on the continent. The European powers sometimes had to react to these internal developments rather than implement neat, pre-planned schemes. Thus Britain initially had little interest in the Sudan, but the sweeping conquests of the Mahdi forced it to take action to safeguard in part, its position in Egypt and the strategic Red Sea route to other parts of the empire.Vandervort, pp. 4‚Äì27 In the case of the Zulu War, some historians call it \\"an unauthorized aggression conducted for reasons of geopolitical strategy\\" and argue that Britain's main interest was safeguarding the Cape of Good Hope as a strategic base and route to India. This meant control of the region's ports ‚Äì Cape Town, Simonstown, and Durban ‚Äì and the liquidation of potential threats from further inland like the Zulu kingdom. This strategy backfired in part when the Zulu chose to fight rather than submit to British coercion. In short, rather than being mere passive actors awaiting colonization, controllers of indigenous military systems were evolving new forms of organization, refining existing ones, or adapting old ones to fit changing opportunities and advanced technology. Their successes, failures, methods, and styles form part of the complex pattern of the military arts on the continent.

The suburb is immediately to the north of Coogee, which takes its name from the lake, Lake Coogee, in the area, which translates to \\"Body of water\\" in the native Aboriginal Nyoongar language. Originally this lake was named Lake Munster after Prince William, the Earl of Munster, and later King William IV. The aboriginal name Kou-gee was recorded in 1841 by Thomas Watson and has been variously spelt Koojee, Coojee and Coogee. North Coogee was created on 19 December 2005 and incorporated portions of the surrounding suburbs of Hamilton Hill, Spearwood and Coogee. Location North Coogee is located 4 km south of Fremantle, and is bounded by the municipal boundary of the City of Fremantle to the north, Cockburn Road/Beeliar Regional Park to the east, Powell Road to the south and Cockburn Sound to the west. North Coogee overlooks Cockburn Sound with views of Garden Island, Carnac Island and Rottnest Island. History The first development in the area may have been when Richard Goldsmith Meares who established a lime burning kiln in 1831, south of the Clarence townsite. Meares had arrived at the Swan River Colony with Thomas Peel in the previous year. Meares abandoned the site after a few months moving to Mount Helena, later becoming the Government Resident at York. As the area was adjacent to the relatively safe harbour of Owen's Anchorage in Cockburn Sound, the area began to be used as an alternative destination point for ship arrivals. The original land grant was to George Robb and stretched between Hamilton Hill and North Lake. In 1899 it was further subdivided and by 1900 the area saw the establishment of a number of commercial lime kilns, to provide for the construction boom and population growth which had been brought about by gold discoveries. The area continued to take on an industrialised character that continued until the early 1990s. Features of the area included the Fremantle Smelting Works, just south of Island Street, which processed lead and base bullion from Kalgoorlie. Next to the smelter was the slaughter house of Copley & Co, processing sheep and cattle on the same location where John Wellard had slaughtered sheep for the Convict establishment in the early 1850s. Further south at Robb Jetty, slaughter houses operated by Forrest, Emanuel & Co, and Connor, Doherty and Durack existed, these slaughter houses essentially supplied all the meat to the metropolitan area and the expanding goldfields. The livestock arriving from the north-west of the state including the Kimberley Region and were unloaded from the ships onto the jetty. As there was no cold storage at the slaughter houses extensive pasturing for the animals as well as small market gardens were established in the region around the abattoir. In 1898 a railway was built from Fremantle to Robb Jetty. The slaughter houses expanded with a bone mill, blood manure and skin-drying sheds added. Cattle being unloaded from a ship at Robb Jetty in the 1920s. Livestock were shipped from the Kimberleys. Next to the slaughter houses an explosives magazine was built in the sandhills. In addition a piggery, slaughter house and bacon factory were built by J.C Hutton & Co, south of Robb Jetty at James Rocks. In 1903 the railway was extended to Woodman Point and the explosives magazine was moved there, further away from Fremantle. The area steadily became the centre of much of Perth's heavy industry and comprised the coal-fired power station, railway marshalling yards, abattoir as well as numerous skin drying sheds. From the 1980s however, pressures brought on by demands for residential housing began a process of removal of the various facilities. ;Railway marshalling yards A large WAGR marshalling yard with signal box tower built in the 1960s during the standard gauge railway line project from Kalgoorlie to Leighton.Area of the old marshalling yards.

All that remains of the former jetty are the pylons which extend between 200 ‚Äì 300 metres out to sea. The chimney is the only remaining part of the large complex of buildings which included offices, holding yards, freezer and chiller facilities. The chimney is listed in the State Register of Heritage Places. ;South Fremantle Power Station Construction of the Power Station commenced in January, 1946. The South Fremantle site was chosen for its relatively close metropolitan population, its proximity to nearby railway facilities for the delivery of coal and the ease with which seawater could be utilised for the cooling system. The four boilers 1, 2, 3 & 4 of 'A' Station were fired up in January 1951; the first 25 MW turbo-alternator came on line in May 1951 prior to the official opening of the Power Station on 27 June 1951 by the Hon. David Brand, Minister for Electricity. In September 1951, the second 25 MW turbo alternator came on line. The No. 3 turbo alternator came on line in January 1954, and the No. 4 turbo alternator in December 1954. The power station was then complete with a total capacity of 100 MW. Much of the plant was designed and manufactured in Great Britain, with skilled contractors sent out from Britain to assemble the plant on site. The State Energy Commission encouraged the recruitment of staff by providing housing in the Hilton Park area, and the new suburb soon had many community amenities. A bus service from the Power Station to Hilton and Fremantle was provided for shift workers. Over 250 workers were employed at the power station during the 1950s. In 1954, a major fire at South Fremantle in the coal conveyor from the crusher house caused structural damage and resulted in a switch to oil fuel for the boilers. In the mid 1970s the plant was converted back to coal, which fuelled the station until its closure in 1985. By the 1980s production of electricity at South Fremantle had become uneconomical. The interconnected grid then was supplying electricity from power stations with more up-to-date machinery and closer to the coal source at Collie, Bunbury, Kwinana and Muja. In September 1985, the South Fremantle Power Station closed after 34 years service and its four chimney stacks were demolished. Recent development looking from Port Coogee development north towards South Fremantle Powerstation and O'Connor Beach ;South Beach In 2002 the State Government and Stockland sought to redevelop the former ANI/Bradken Foundry and surrounding land (including the former rail marshalling yards) for residential purposes. This was opposed by a local resident action group, Save South Beach, which actively campaigned against the redevelopment on issues of site contamination, diminished coastal setback, rail noise and coastal erosion impacts. Despite the ongoing protests the redevelopment commenced with the first resident lots reaching the market in 2005. ;Port Coogee/Point Catherine In 1992 the State Government agreed in- principle to develop a residential marina in the Coogee locality. In 1996 the State Government entered into an agreement with Port Catherine Developments Pty Ltd PCD) to facilitate the proposed marina. The project was opposed by a resident action group, Coogee Coastal Action Coalition, concerned about the loss of beaches, potential coastal erosion, impact on local seagrass and existing site contamination issues Since the signing of the agreement PCD has been taken over by Australand Property Group and work has commenced on the construction of the marina, with the first lots reaching the market in 2007. ;Cockburn Coast In 2008 the State Government launched their vision for the development of the former industrial area between South Beach and the Port Coogee marina, with 95 hectares of coastal land being proposed to be redeveloped for residential purposes, housing approximately 10,000 people.

For most of the 20th century, it provided ship to shore communications including telegrams (using Morse code) and marine telex service (using radioteletype). The station discontinued commercial operation in 1998, but is operated occasionally as a historic service ‚Äì its signal can be tuned in throughout a large portion of the western hemisphere. Ship to shore telephone calls were not handled by KPH but by other stations such as the nearby AT&T; high seas station KMI. Revenue service and preservation KPH would broadcast regular bulletins of news, weather and other general information to the shipping community, then relay business and personal messages to and from individual ships. Station operators also monitored the international distress frequencies for calls from ships in trouble. With the decline of Morse code the station was retired, but volunteers have preserved it in operating condition so that it can still be heard on the air on weekends and special occasions, sometimes using the alternative callsign KSM and the amateur radio club callsign K6KPH. KPH is located within the Point Reyes National Seashore in Marin County, California, north of San Francisco Bay. History The station dates back to the dawn of the radio era in the early years of the twentieth century when it began operations at the Palace Hotel in San Francisco, California, using the callsign \\"PH\\". Forced out by the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and fire, the station moved from one temporary site to another until it was acquired by the Radio Corporation of America (RCA) and relocated to Marin County. Subsequently, it was owned by MCI Communications and finally Globe Wireless, who still own the KPH operating license.Stephen Barrett (June 26, 1997). \\"Ship-to-shore radio station KPH to close \\", Point Reyes Light. Physical plant The receiving station and control point now occupy a classic white 1920s' Art Deco building on Sir Francis Drake Boulevard in the Point Reyes National Seashore whereas the similarly styledhttp://www.radiomarine.org/gallery/show?keyword=kphtoday&panel;=pab1_1 transmitter buildings are about 20 miles south at , near the town of Bolinas. The reason for siting the transmitters so far away from the receivers is that their powerful outgoing signals would make it difficult to hear weak incoming signals from faraway ships on the same frequency (or channel). Operators at the receiving site remotely control and key the transmitters by means of landlines connecting the two sites. Radio operations KPH has always been mainly a Morse code station. International Morse code is used on the air, but American Morse code was once used on the telegraph lines (\\"land lines\\"), so operators at the station had to learn both varieties until the landline telegraph was replaced by the teleprinter. In the beginning, all traffic was sent by Morse code (\\"CW\\") using hand-operated Morse keys. Devices were introduced to allow messages to be typed or \\"punched\\" onto a paper tape so that they could be sent automatically at any time. Station IDs and other repeated announcements pre-recorded by this method are called \\"wheels\\". In the 1930s, landline teleprinter operation was adapted for radio use (radioteletype or \\"RTTY\\") which allowed for faster, more efficient messaging. This did not replace Morse code entirely, because many vessels had no teleprinter equipment and because Morse was the most reliable transmission mode available: when faced with bad atmospheric conditions and weak signals, dots and dashes are easier to pick up than teleprinter or the human voice, and all the coding and decoding are done in the brain. Over the years radioteletype was improved and computerized, giving rise to new digital transmission modes such as Clover and PACTOR. Satellite communications became a technically and commercially viable alternative to terrestrial radio links. Ship radio equipment became more advanced and automated, requiring fewer radio officers ‚Äì or none. By the 1990s few ship stations were equipped for Morse code or had any use for it, so coast stations re-allocated their Morse frequencies to other uses. Some stations disappeared from the airwaves altogether, as did KPH after being acquired by Globe Wireless in 1997.\\"MARITIME RADIO KPH CLOSES IN AGE OF WIRELESS\\", Seattle Post-Intelligencer (July 2, 1997). Its Morse code traffic was then diverted to other stations such as KFS in Half Moon Bay, California, another Globe Wireless station. KFS continued to handle Morse code traffic until July 13, 1999 (Universal time; actually July 12 in the Pacific time zone) when it made its \\"last ever\\" Morse transmission, ceremonially marking the supposed end of commercial Morse code usage in America (as distinct from amateur Morse code usage, which continues). This anniversary is commemorated on the air every July as the \\"Night of Nights\\" by KPH and other coast radio stations, along with radio amateurs who participate on their own frequencies.Calvin Woodward; AP (July 19, 1999). \\"Morse code falls from regular use\\", The Topeka Capital- Journal.\\"Night of Nights\\", Point Reyes National Seashore. National Park Service. Survival and preservation KPH is now a part of the Point Reyes National Seashore and is maintained and operated by former KPH employees and volunteers of the Maritime Radio Historical Society. There are several reasons that the station was able to survive decommissioning and make a comeback. First, the equipment was old and not suitable for resale, so much of it was left where it was, with connections to power, antennas and land lines still intact. Second, the real estate taken up by buildings and antenna farms, while desirable, was also unsuitable for resale (especially to the extent that it lay within the Point Reyes National Seashore), meaning that the properties were not bought and redeveloped the way some other stations were. The KPH license and the frequencies assigned to it are made available to the MRHS by the license holder, Globe Wireless. In addition, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has granted the MRHS a new coast station license with the callsign KSM, as well as the amateur radio club callsign K6KPH for communicating with radio hams on amateur frequencies. K6KPH is unusually strong and well-equipped for an amateur station, with its professional grade transmitters, antennas and operators. Operating in amateur radio mode means following a different set of rules (using different frequencies and lower transmitter power levels), but amateurs are not limited in their choice of equipment as long as they stick to these rules.

Ron Hayes starred as Constable Lincoln Vail, a law enforcement officer of the fictional Everglades County Patrol who traveled the Florida Everglades in an airboat, a vehicle which was often the focus of the program. Hayes, a northern California actor and stuntman, was an avid outdoorsman and conservationist. Gordon Casell appeared in five of the 38 half-hour episodes as Chief Anderson, Vail's superior. Steve Brodie made three appearances as Captain Andy Benson; Dan Chandler was twice cast as Vail's sidekick, airboat guide Pete Hammond.

Background The original script for the series, \\"Son of the Everglades\\", was written by model and actor Albert Wilmore of Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, who spent his free time sailing and fishing in Whitewater Bay, before the Everglades became a national park. Wilmore was fascinated by the myriad birds, wildlife and mangrove estuaries in the shallow waters, and the native Seminoles. His son Scott recalled that Wilmore decided to meld a wildlands backdrop and use native Seminoles, with a park ranger, and high-speed airboats. Wilmore pitched the story to a number of production companies in Miami and Hollywood, Florida. After Wilmore's wife Edith died, Scott discovered a deed for an acre of land within Everglades National Park. Scott explained that the deed was a gift from the Seminoles, acknowledging Albert's efforts for their inclusion in the production. Originally, the director wanted to use white actors in reddish makeup instead. Scott Wilmore later sold the land, under threat of eminent domain, to the National Park Service for $300. Production South Florida shooting locations included Everglades National Park, Andytown, Coopertown, Frog City, Sweetwater and Forty Mile Bend along the Tamiami Trail.\\"Everglades\\" The original plan was to use white actors as Seminoles with makeup and studio-produced costumes, but native Seminoles, wearing their traditional dress, were used. They were pleased to have the comparatively easy work as both extras and, because of their expertise and mechanical abilities, to operate and maintain the airboats. They had little prior employment opportunities living within the Everglades, other than beading, giving airboat rides and wrestling with alligators for the tourist trade. Few were given speaking parts and nearly all of them were denied entry into the Screen Actors Guild (SAG), the actors union. Because the show was on a tight budget (an episode was completed every two-and-a-half days), Chandler was given little training on airboats, so there were a few unintentional \\"flybys\\" and at least one crash, leaving the actor swinging from an overhanging tree. Hays, however, became an accomplished air boat driver and formed close bonds with the Seminoles who supplied and maintained them. During 1961, Tors was filming the first of his two Flipper feature films in Miami and the Florida Keys; Dan Chandler was signed for a recurring role in his Flipper TV series, and for a part in the 1964 movie sequel, Flipper's New Adventure.

It is the current home ground of Hong Kong Premier League club Pegasus and the former home ground of Yuen Long. History East Stand entrance Originally a piece of vacant land next to Shui Bin Village, the stadium was built by the Yuen Long District Sports Association with local support. It was constructed by Yuen Long Cheong Kee Construction for HK$198,000 in 1965. The stadium opened on 15 December 1969 with a First Division match between Yuen Long and Fire Services. On the same day, it hosted the start and the finish of the first marathon in Hong Kong held by Hong Kong Amateur Athletic Association, sponsored by Tin Tin Daily. In 1983, the stadium received a HK$3 million endowment from Royal Hong Kong Jockey Club for expansion. The work, which cost HK$12 million in total, added a new 2,000-capacity covered grandstand and an eight-lane all-weather running track. The playing surface was also re-laid during the construction. In recent years, the stadium has been transferred to and operated by the Leisure and Cultural Services Department of Hong Kong. TenantsYuen Long District S.A.= From the 1970s to 1980, the stadium had been the home ground for Yuen Long, who were playing at the Hong Kong First Division before withdrawing from the top tier after the 1979-80 season. Nowadays, it occasionally hosts home matches for their amateur and youth teams in lower divisions. =Pegasus= 2008-09 season On 22 July 2008, newly formed Tin Shui Wai Pegasus applied for permission to play home fixtures in their inaugural season at Yuen Long Stadium, which was rejected by the HKFA due to the quality of playing surface. In September 2008, after reaching an agreement with the away side, TSW Pegasus requested to play their home game against South China on 5 October at Yuen Long Stadium, which was approved by the HKFA. It was arranged that the league tie between Mutual and Citizen on the same match day would also be moved to this stadium,http://hk.myblog.yahoo.com/chairman- blog/article?mid=1939 which was later scheduled to host two more TSW Pegasus home games in the second half of the season. TSW Pegasus chairman Wilson Wong and the HKFA officials visited the ground on 17 September 2008 to explore the possibility for hosting more league matches at Yuen Long Stadium during the season. It was concluded that the ground was not equipped with up to four changing rooms to accommodate multiple matches on the same match day; while there were no scoreboards, ticket booths and substitute benches on the sideline to meet FIFA standards, the exits for supporters were not clearly indicated. HKFA Head of Competitions Lam Shing Kui reaffirmed the stadium was only suitable for one game per match day. The conditions of the existing playing surface, floodlights, executive box, first-aid room, referee's room and changing rooms were adequate to host First Division matches, with an option of setting up additional VIP areas and media facilities including internet access temporarily. Substitute benches would be borrowed from Tai Po Sports Ground. The ground was scheduled to host two First Division fixtures on 5 October, with Mutual against Citizen kick-off at 12:30 and TSW Pegasus against South China at 16:00. However, both matches were postponed due to waterlogged pitch. Three days later, the hosts defeated South China 3-2 in front of an attendance of 2,537 in the rescheduled fixture, which was the ground's first First Division match in 22 years. 2009-13 seasons Pegasus used the stadium as their home ground for domestic games for four seasons from 2009-13\\\\. They were forced to play their home games in the 2011 AFC Cup at Tseung Kwan O Sports Ground as their home ground failed to fulfil the requirements from the Asian Football Confederation. 2020‚Äì On 20 October 2020, Pegasus announced that the club would be moving its operations back to Yuen Long District, including the hosting of their home matches at Yuen Long Stadium. =Yuen Long FC= The stadium was the home ground of Yuen Long since their promotion to the top flight in 2013-14 until their self relegation after the 2019‚Äì20 season. Facilities The stadium features a world standard natural turf pitch with flood light system and two stands constructed on either side of the pitch. The athletics track is a world standard all-weather 400m eight-lane oval. It is open to public six days a week from 08:00 to 22:30, except for one hour from 12:30 to 13:30. It is closed for maintenance every Wednesday.http://www.lcsd.gov.hk/en/facilities/facilitieslist/facilities.php?ftid=4&did;=18&fcid;=6 Future developments In October 2013, the Leisure and Cultural Services Department announced plans to redevelop the stadium to fulfil requirements for hosting international matches. Capacity will rise to no less than 5,000, with both East and West Stands covered. Other improvements include executive boxes, trophy presentation area, electronic turnstiles and television gantry. Yuen Long chairman Wilson Wong revealed that the club will play their home games on other grounds during the revamp. However as of January 2018, the project has yet to begin due to a dispute between the LCSD and the Yuen Long District Council over the East Stand. While the LCSD submitted plans which included a rebuilt West Stand, it did not include plans to provide a roof over the East Stand.

Born and raised in North St. Louis to Irish- American parents, John and his brother Harry, known as \\"Cherries\\", joined the Egan's Rats in their teens. John was nicknamed \\"Pudgy\\" because at the age of seventeen he carried 240 pounds on a 5'11\\" frame. John was known throughout the city as a dangerous brawler. While his older brother Harry was quick to use a gun to settle disputes, Pudgy often preferred to settle matters with his ham-like fists. While in Chicago with his brother Harry on November 5, 1914, the two Dunn brothers shot and killed a gangster named Robert Koch. Both men were convinced that Koch had been sent up from St. Louis to specifically kill them. While Harry got off scot free, Pudgy was convicted and sentenced to an Illinois prison. With John locked up, Harry went to great pains to get him free, even offering to snitch on his gang mates. Afraid that gang boss Tom Egan would find out about his disloyalty, Cherries Dunn became increasingly paranoid and killed people over trivial reasons, including William \\"Skippy\\" Rohan, a lifelong friend of Tom Egan's. Harry Dunn would eventually be killed by the Egan mob at the Typo Press Club on September 19, 1916. Upon his parole in 1917, John \\"Pudgy\\" Dunn swore to kill Willie Egan and everyone else connected to his brother's murder, specifically the two triggermen, Walter Costello and Frank \\"Gutter\\" Newman. The gang war between the Egan's Rats and Bottoms Gang was raging in the summer of 1917 when Pudgy got even with one of Harry's killers, Gutter Newman, whom he shot and killed in front of the house at 3323 Lucas Avenue on June 8, 1917. Harry's other killer, Walter Costello, was shot and killed by St. Louis police a month later. Willie Egan managed to temporarily escape Pudgy Dunn's wrath when John was busted for another murder in early January 1919. His parole was revoked and Dunn was sent back to Illinois to serve more time. However, Pudgy Dunn was free once again when Willie Egan was gunned down in front of his Franklin Avenue saloon on October 31, 1921. Dunn was named as a prime suspect, and the Egan gang themselves named members of the rival Hogan Gang as Egan's murderers. By 1924, John \\"Pudgy\\" Dunn had relocated to Detroit, along with Fred \\"Killer\\" Burke, Gus Winkler, and other former members of the Egan's Rats. After years in prison and on the streets, Pudgy had turned quite volatile and trigger-happy. John was eventually convicted of killing a burglar named William Riley in January 1924 (while he was out on bond, Pudgy shot and nearly killed fellow gangster \\"Tennessee Slim\\" Hurley). Dunn was sentenced to 10 years in the Michigan State Penitentiary at Marquette. Paroled on November 21, 1934, John \\"Pudgy\\" Dunn returned to St. Louis and rejoined the local mob. Dunn worked as a bouncer at East Side gambling joints like the Mounds Country Club and the Ringside Club. Pudgy was also a natural for labor racketeering, as he had positions in both the Central Trades and Labor Union and the Miscellaneous Hotel Workers Union. After an evening's work, Pudgy Dunn was entering his Goodfellow Avenue apartment building at 3:50 a.m. on July 14, 1937, when a gunman opened fire with a sawed-off shotgun. Dunn bled to death from his wounds within a half- hour.

Compared to other phorusrhacids, members of the genus are both relatively gracile and diminutive, and include the smallest known species of terror bird: with the head raised P. bachmanni was in height and weighed about , while the largest members of the genus were only about . The birds resemble the modern cariama (Cariama cristata), except with a heavier build and considerably smaller wings. The strong morphological similarity between the claws of the predatory cariama and Psilopterus, both of which are sharp, curved, and laterally compressed, may indicate they were used to strike prey. In contrast to the other, larger terror birds, Tonni and Tambussi also suggested Psilopterus could use their claws to climb trees, and could even fly, but this has been rejected in more recent literature. Fossil finds in Uruguay indicate the genus may have survived until 96,040 ¬± 6,300 years ago, millions of years after the larger phorusrhacids became extinct.  Description and taxonomy  The most recent systematic revision of Phorusrhacidae placed Psilopterus within the subfamily Psilopterinae, along with the genera Procariama and Paleopsilopterus, and divided Psilopterus into four species. = P. bachmanni = Psilopterus bachmanni (Moreno & Mercerat, 1891) is the smallest species of phorusrhacid, rivaled only by P. affinis. The species (and genera) is defined by the upper portion of a fused ankle and leg bone (the lectotype MLP-168 is a tarsometatarsus). Other material assigned the species includes additional leg bones that are probably from the same bird, and an almost complete skeleton (PUM-15.904) The material is from several sites in the Santa Cruz Formation in the Santa Cruz Province of Argentina dating to the Middle Miocene (Santacrucian). The most important diagnostic characteristics are a low skull and upper jaw (or maxilla; similar to the mesembriornithine phorusrhacids) and the extreme slant of the front edge of the hole just before the eye (rostal portion of the antorbital fenestra), though there are also differences in the rest of the skeleton. Synonyms:Per Alvarenga & H√∂fling (2003), who rely on Brodkorb (1967). * Psilopterus bachmanni (Moreno & Mercerat, 1891) * Patagornis bachmanni Moreno & Mercerat, 1891 * Psilopterus communis Moreno & Mercerat, 1891 * Psilopterus intermedius Moreno & Mercerat, 1891 * Phororhacos delicatus Amegino, 1891 Brodkorb considered Psilopterus minutus Amerghino, 1981 a separate species, but the incomplete foot bone (tarsometatarsus) is indistinguishable from P. bachmanni. = P. lemoinei = Restoration of P. lemoinei Psilopterus lemoinei (Moreno & Mercerat, 1891) is contemporaneous with P. bachmanni and likely filled a very similar ecological niche, though P. lemoinei is slightly larger, with an estimated weigh approaching . The species is defined by part of a lower leg bone (the lectotype, MLP-162, is the distal end of a tibiotarsus), but a wide variety of material has been referred to the taxon. This material has been found at a number of sites in the Monte Le√≥n and Santa Cruz Formations in the Santa Cruz Province of Argentina that are dated to the Middle Miocene (Santacrucian). Diagnostic characteristics include a higher skull and upper jaw (maxilla), and the front portion of the hole in front of the eyes (rostral edge of the antorbital fenestra) is less slanted. Additional differences in the remainder of the skeleton are noted in Sinclair and Farr (1932). A number of discrepancies between various specimens have been attributed to differences in age or sex, but material currently assigned to P. lemonei and P. bachmanni may be reclassified at the species level if reexamined in depth. Synonyms: * Patagornis lemoinei Moreno & Mercerat, 1891 * Psilopterus australis Moreno & Mercerat, 1891 * Pelecyornis tubulatus Ameghino, 1895 (synonym of Psilopterus australis) * Phororhacos modicus Ameghino, 1895 * Staphylornis gallardoi Mercerat, 1897 (possible synonym of Psilopterus australis) * Staphylornis erythacus Mercerat, 1897 (possible synonym of Psilopterus australis) * Pelecyornis tenuirostris Sinclair & Farr, 1932 (synonym of Psilopterus australis) = P. affinus = Psilopterus affinus (Ameghino, 1899) is the most poorly known species of terror bird, represented only by part of a leg bone (tarsometatarsus, MACN-A-52-184) which indicates the bird was very close to P. bachmanni in size. P. affinus is one of several species known from fragmentary material found in 1899 in the Chubut Province of Argentina (Patagonia), in rocks which dated to the Middle to Late Oligocene (Deseadan). Additional specimens might help clarify the taxonomy of the four apparently unrelated species. P. affinus was originally assigned to the genus Phororhacos despite the difference in size, and is distinguished from P. bachmanni by a groove on the leg bone. Bertelli et al. kept this species in Phororhacos.Taxonomic opinions tied to S. Bertelli et al. 2007 at Fossilworks.org Brodkorb assigned the species to Andrewsornis in 1967, but this is no longer considered accurate. = P. colzecus = P. colzecus tarsometatarsus The most recently discovered species in the genus, Psilopterus colzecus Tonni & Tambussi, 1988, is similar to P. lemoinei in size. Known only from a single incomplete skeleton that includes parts of the jaw, arm, and leg (holotype MLP-76-VI-12-2), the species is defined by a groove in the front of the thigh bone (trochlea). The elements were found in the Arroyo Chasic√≥ Formation in Buenos Aires Province of Argentina and are dated to the Late Miocene (Chasicoan).

Wirehaired Vizslas are known as excellent hunting dogs, and also have a level personality making them suited for families. The Wirehaired Vizsla is a versatile, natural hunter endowed with an excellent nose and an above average trainability. Although they are lively, gentle mannered, demonstrably affectionate and sensitive, they are also fearless and possessed of a well- developed protective instinct. The breed has a firmness on point, is an excellent retriever, and has the determination to remain on the scent even when swimming. The overall appearance embodies the qualities of a multi- purpose pointing dog, endurance, working ability and an easily satisfied nature. This is a dog of power and drive in the field, yet is a tractable and affectionate companion in the home. Description Wirehaired Vizsla Wirehaired Vizsla guarding game =Appearance= A Wirehaired Vizsla The Wirehaired Vizsla is a wire-coated hunting dog, with a distinguished appearance and bearing. They have a lean build and are very robust. The coat is an attractive russet to golden sand in color. Where permitted the tail may be docked to three-fourths of its original length. Color and coat The Wirehaired Vizsla is a rare dog breed in Hungary with an estimated 30 litters (approximately 140-150 dogs) being registered annually. The coat is wiry, close-lying, strong, and dense, long with a dense, water-repellent undercoat. The outline of the body is not to be hidden by the longer coat. Pronounced eyebrows along with a strong, harsh beard, long on both sides of the muzzle reinforce the determined expression. The coat should never be long, soft, silky, shaggy, crinkle, wooly, thin, lacking undercoat or lacking brushes on the legs. Size * Males ** Height: . ** Weight: * Females ** Height: ** Weight: Overall symmetry and balance are more important than mere measurable size. =Temperament= Like the Vizsla, Wirehaired Vizslas are very high energy, gentle-mannered, loyal, caring, and highly affectionate. They quickly form close bonds with their owners, including children. They are quiet dogs, only barking if necessary or if they are provoked. They are natural hunters with an excellent ability to take training. Not only are they great pointers, but they are excellent retrievers as well. They will retrieve on land and in the water, making the most of their natural instincts. However, they must be trained gently and without harsh commands or strong physical correction, as they have sensitive temperaments and can be easily damaged if trained too harshly (Gottlieb, 1992). Vizslas are excellent swimmers and often swim in pools if one is available. Like all gun dogs, Vizslas require a good deal of exercise to remain healthy and happy. Thirty minutes to an hour of exercise daily in a large off-leash area is optimal (Coffman 1992). The Wirehaired Vizsla thrives on attention, exercise, and interaction. It is highly intelligent, and enjoys being challenged and stimulated, both mentally and physically. Vizslas that do not get enough attention and exercise can easily become destructive or hyperactive. Under-stimulated Vizslas may also become depressed or engage in obsessive-compulsive behaviours such as persistent licking (Coffman 1992). Vizslas are very gentle dogs that are great around children. The Vizsla wants to be close to its owner as much of the time as possible. Many Vizslas will sleep in bed with their owners if allowed, burrowing under the covers. History Wirehaired Vizsla with game The less usual Wirehaired Vizsla is a completely separate breed from its more commonly seen smooth-coated cousin. The Wirehaired Vizsla was developed in the 1930s, initially by Vasas Jozsef, owner of the Csabai vizsla kennel along with Gresznarik Laszlo, who owned the de Selle German Wirehaired Pointer kennel. Their aim was to produce a dog that combined the color of the Vizsla with a heavier coat, and a more substantial frame, better suited for working in cold weather and retrieving from icy water. Two Vizsla bitches (Zsuzsi and Csibi), both of whom combined excellent pedigrees with good working ability, were selected to breed with a totally liver colored German Wirehaired Pointer sire (Astor von Potat). Zsuzsi's sire was known to have offspring with longer coats. The best of Zsuzsi's and Csibi's offspring were selected and bred together and Dia de Selle, the first WHV to be exhibited, was born. She had the same body as the shorthaired vizsla, but her head was the shape of the German Wirehaired Pointer. While her coat was not rough and thick enough, she was the promising beginning of the creation of the new breed. Anecdotal history suggests the added infusion of Pudelpointer, Bloodhound and Irish Setter blood during the period of the Second World War when many other Hungarian kennels became involved in the development of the breed. It has also previously, but incorrectly been suggested that the breed was created by backbreeding of smooth Vizsla's most heavily coated offspring (Gottlieb, idem). There are approximately 400-450 Wirehaired Vizslas in the US and between 2,500 and 3,000 worldwide. =Official recognition= The Wirehaired Vizsla was recognized in Europe by the FCI under the Hungarian standard in 1986. Introduced to North America in the 1970s, the breed was first recognized by the Canadian Kennel Club in 1977 and North American Versatile Hunting Dog Association in 1986. The breed was recognized by the United Kennel Club in 2006. It was recognized by the Australian National Kennel Council in 2007. The breed was admitted into AKC's Foundation Stock Service Program in 2008. Effective January 1, 2009, the Wirehaired Vizsla became eligible to compete in AKC Companion and Performance events. The Wirehaired Vizsla was permitted to show in conformation in the AKC Miscellaneous Class starting January 1, 2011. They joined the Sporting Group and became a fully recognized breed on July 2, 2014.\\"The AKC Family Grows to 180 Breeds\\" American Kennel Club, retrieved March 1 2015. They are also recognized by in North America by the American Rare Breed Association, as well as Field Dog Stud Book registries. Common illnesses Although the Wirehaired Vizsla is not generally considered as a sickly dog, breeding from a small number of dogs has led to heritable illnesses in some offspring, including: * dysphagia-megaesophagus (difficulty swallowing, drooling and muscle wasting) * hip dysplasia * hypothyroidism * sebaceous adenitis * digestive problems (including intolerance to certain foods or food allergies) * eye conditions such as: ** ectropion (the upper or lower eyelid curls outward which gives the look of \\"droopy eyes\\") ** entropion (the upper or lower eyelid, but in most cases the lower lid, curls inward towards the eye, therefore irritating the cornea) * idiopathic epilepsy is becoming more common in this breed (Gottlieb 2002) Responsible breeders do not select dogs for breeding if they have such inherent problems.

Regards was a periodical which launched photojournalism in the years before World War II. Leon Moussinac, critic and film theorist, a friend of Leon Delluc, runs the magazine. Robert Capa and Henri Cartier-Bresson are core photographers. The magazine stopped publication in 1962, and then reappeared in 1995, under the leadership of the communist Henri Malberg. In 2000, it again reorganized under new management, trying to return to the original concept, of investigation of the world through photojournalism, surveys and contributions of intellectuals. According to the magazine's website, its modern readership is mainly composed of intellectuals and actors involved in social and political life.

Overview Just like in the Perth Carnival of 1921 only South Australia and Victoria took a team to Western Australia. Only one of the games was a blowout, with Western Australia handing South Australia their worst ever carnival loss, in a 116-point win. George Doig kicked seven goals for the home side. In the second game, South Australia came close to upsetting Victoria and got within two points at the final siren. The last four scoring shots of the game were all behinds to South Australia inside the final two minutes of the game. The final game of the carnival would decide the overall winner and after going into the game as underdogs Victoria hung on against Western Australia at Subiaco Oval to win by eight points. The win was thanks largely to Victorian full-back Jack Regan restricting Doig to just three goals. Other Victorian stars who took part in the carnival included Haydn Bunton, Jack Dyer, Les Hardiman, Dick Harris and Keith Shea. An enormous crowd estimated to be 40,000 people (38,022 who paid admission, plus members and guests) witnessed the final match between Victoria and Western Australia. The crowd set a new record for the highest crowd in Western Australian sporting history, exceeding by a considerable margin the previous record of 27,273 set at an interstate match in 1929. Considerable damage was suffered by facilities at Subiaco Oval, including the partial collapse of the fence around the arena, due to its inability to accommodate such a large crowd. The crowd of 23,263 to Western Australia's first match was also one of the highest in the state's history, and was drawn in spite of heavy rain which forced the traditional parade of teams to be cancelled. ResultsTassie Medal The inaugural Tassie Medal was awarded to Mick Cronin (Western Australia), who polled 13 votes. Ned Hender (South Australia) was second with 9 votes, and J. Hooper (Western Australia) and Jack Regan (Victoria) were equal third with 7 votes each.

It is adjacent to Central Park Mall to the east, The Ramble and Lake to the north, West Drive to the west, and Heckscher Playground and Ballfields to the south. Sheep Meadow was originally designed as a parade ground and incorporated into the Greensward Plan, the original plan for Central Park developed in the 1850s. However, Central Park's designers Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux opposed the use of the meadow for military purposes, so it was instead converted to a pasture with sheep. Housed in a nearby sheepfold that now contains the Tavern on the Green restaurant, the sheep were removed in 1934. Sheep Meadow has a long history as a gathering place for large-scale demonstrations and political movements. These have included festivals, rallies, concerts, and protests such as the be-ins of the 1960s. Though sports and gatherings were gradually allowed through the late 19th century, Sheep Meadow saw significant deterioration because of overuse. A regulation prohibiting sports was enacted following a 1980 renovation, and the meadow was restored again in 2000. HistoryConstruction= In 1857 a design competition was held for Central Park. The applications were required to contain extremely detailed specifications, including at least four east- west transverse roads through the park, a parade ground of , and at least three playgrounds of between . The winning design was Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux's Greensward Plan, whose name referenced a nineteenth-century term for broad open lawns. The plan offered a reduced parade ground on the western side of the proposed park. When the location of Sheep Meadow was decided, some small communities of poorer New Yorkers were uprooted, including Irish, Germans and African-Americans. Sheep Meadow was to be located in a relatively flat patch of land within the park site. To produce the almost of \\"level or but slightly undulating ground\\" in the specifications, the ten acres of poorly-draining ground was filled to a depth of with fill from New Jersey. Additionally, large boulders and a rocky ridge that stood out of the finished grade were blasted out, and the reshaped landscape was covered with topsoil. Sheep Meadow was the most expensive project within the park. It was the largest meadow in Central Park until the old Croton Aqueduct collecting reservoir was emptied and made into the Great Lawn in 1937. Grazing sheep in the first quarter of the 20th century Despite Central Park's growing popularity, the park commissioners were loath to allow large events, especially military practices and picnics. The committee instituted a ban on military parades in the Parade Ground in 1865. In its place, Olmsted and Vaux believed that the introduction of sheep enhanced the romantic English quality of the park and to re-enforce the quiet nature of the \\"Greensward\\", 200 sheep were added in 1864. The flock of pedigree Southdown sheep were joined later by Dorset sheep. The sheep were housed in a fanciful Victorian-style sheepfold created in 1870 by Jacob Wrey Mould under the direction of Calvert Vaux. The animals also trimmed the grass and fertilized the lawn. A sheep crossing was built across the drive, and twice a day a shepherd would stop traffic as the sheep traveled between the sheepfold and meadow. The Central Park commissioners would often sell wool and once a year would also auction off some sheep. =Conversion to open space= In its earliest years, Sheep Meadow was also known as \\"the Commons\\" or \\"the Green\\". For the first few decades of Central Park's existence, it was forbidden to play most sports in Central Park, because Olmsted and Vaux believed that the park should be used for scenic enjoyment rather than recreation. As such, in the park's earliest years, Sheep Meadow was only available to the public during certain times such as on Saturdays, as indicated on signs posted on the meadow's perimeter. By the 1870s, the park's patronage increasingly came to include the middle and working class, and strict regulations were gradually eased, such as those against public gatherings. Though certain sports such as lacrosse, tennis, American football, and roller skating were allowed during the 1880s, the commissioners were still reluctant to repeal the \\"keep off the grass\\" rules. However, by the 1890s, the regulations against walking on the grass had also been repealed. Tennis nets were installed in Sheep Meadow in 1915 due to the large number of tennis permits distributed by the city that year. There were efforts to demolish the sheepfold as early as 1912, when it was suggested that the Lenox Library be relocated there. A subsequent proposal in 1921 called for a police garage to be built on the site. These efforts were not successful. By the 1920s, Central Park was undergoing minor renovations, and in 1928, part of Sheep Meadow was set aside for a plant nursery to store plants and trees that would be installed during these renovations. At the same time, the successive generations of sheep in the meadow were supposedly inbreeding, leading to alleged deformities in later generations. In 1934, to make way for a restaurant in the sheepfold, park commissioner Robert Moses evicted the sheep from Sheep Meadow. The sheep were moved to Prospect Park in Brooklyn and soon thereafter moved to a farm near Otisville, New York, in the Catskill Mountains. After the sheep were removed, the sheepfold was converted into what later became the Tavern on the Green restaurant. The restaurant opened in October 1934. = Restorations = leftThe large events and the lack of maintenance of the 1960s and 1970s severely eroded the lawn, and it was one of the first parts of Central Park to be restored by the Central Park Conservancy. This led New York state government to give $310,000 toward replacing Sheep Meadow's sod in 1979. With the help of James Taylor, who held a free benefit concert that July, the city renovated the meadow and installed a sprinkler system beginning in September 1979. The renovation was supposed to be completed within six or seven months, but because of discrepancies during construction, the grass began turning brown before the renovation was complete, and the reopening date was delayed. * Sheep Meadow was reopened in September 1980. Once the lawn was reopened, team sports were banned and had to use the Great Lawn instead. In 1985, Sheep Meadow and four city beaches were designated as \\"quiet zones\\" where loud radio-playing was prohibited. * In 1992, a consortium of cheese producers brought a flock of sheep to graze on the meadow as a promotional stunt. They also pledged to finance the meadow's maintenance through 1993. In November 2000, the Central Park Conservancy began the installation of a new irrigation system. The project, funded from a grant by the Marc Haas Foundation, was completed in five months, and Sheep Meadow reopened in April 2001. * Features The southern portion of Sheep Meadow with rock outcrops Sheep Meadow is on the western side of Central Park just north of the 65th Street transverse road. Adjacent features include The Dairy and Central Park Carousel to the southeast, Central Park Mall to the east, The Ramble and Lake to the north, Strawberry Fields memorial to the northwest, West Drive to the west, and Heckscher Playground and Ballfields to the south. = Mineral Springs = In 1865, Vaux and Mould designed the Moorish-style Mineral Springs Pavilion at the northwestern edge of Sheep Meadow. The Mineral Springs Pavilion had cusped arches supported on slender colonnettes, and flaring, complex roofs, reminiscent of Saracenic architecture. In 1957, park commissioner Moses demolished the structure. The Mineral Springs Cafe was built on the site of the pavilion in the 1960s. In 2009, it became a cafe operated by Le Pain Quotidien. = Statue = There are two monuments and statues near Sheep Meadow: * Giuseppe Mazzini (1878), a bronze bust by Giovanni Turini, overlooks the Meadow on a high pedestal. It honors Giuseppe Mazzini, an Italian patriot and revolutionary. The pedestal contains two Italian phrases, translated to \\"thought and action\\" and \\"God and the people\\". * * Indian Hunter (1869), created by American sculptor John Quincy Adams Ward, is on the east side of Sheep Meadow near the Mall. It was the first statue in Central Park created by an American artist. Notable uses Sheep Meadow has held many large-scale events, and people have gathered for many uses. However, managerial neglect took a toll on the park's condition, and by the 1970s, the frequent festivals and concerts in Central Park were later identified as part of the cause for the park's subsequent deterioration. After the 1970s renovation, the open space of Sheep Meadow was surrounded by a chain link fence. The perimeter contains signs saying that team sports, ballplaying, bike riding, skating, glass bottles and dogs are prohibited. Sheep Meadow opens at 11 a.m. each day between April and October each year. The meadow is closed during winters to allow the sod to grow back. The Conservancy internally classifies Sheep Meadow as one of seven \\"A Lawns\\", indicating that it has the highest level of use out of the park's four classes of lawns. Sheep Meadow is heavily used: in 2009, it was utilized by 30,000 people each day. A survey conducted in 2010 found that the meadow saw three million people that year. =Past events=  Early and mid-20th century  107th Infantry Memorial In the early 20th century, the flock of sheep started sharing space with a variety of festivals and children's pageants, though political protests were not yet permissible. In 1912, an event called Around the World in Search of Fairyland featured children in brightly colored costumes. Children's competitions were also held in Sheep Meadow, such as playground contests and model airplane races. Starting in 1935, troupes of schoolgirls from the city's five boroughs competed at an annual concert attended by thousands of spectators. This practice continued even through World War II. Another popular festival was a Works Progress Administration sponsored event in 1936, attended by 25,000 people. During World War I, Sheep Meadow was the site of patriotic wartime celebrations. In 1916, the 107th Infantry, the 7th Regiment Reserves, marched daily from their Park Avenue Armory to Sheep Meadow for maneuvers and drill, before being deployed that August. They are memorialized by the 107th Infantry Memorial, east of the Meadow at 5th Avenue and 67th Street. In 1917, 20,000 liberty war bond marchers participated in a \\"Liberty Day Parade\\" that ended in Sheep Meadow. The following year, there was a proposal to install trenches in Sheep Meadow as part of a wartime exhibition, the reason being that Sheep Meadow was in worse shape than North Meadow, the other large meadow in the park at the time. However, this was controversial because it was seen as detrimental to the naturalistic character of the park. The meadow was also used for patriotic gatherings during World War II. On October 27, 1945, Harry S. Truman spoke to 50,000 people at Sheep Meadow on Navy Day.  1960s and 1970s: be-ins  A concert for the singer Judy Collins Starting in the 1960s, Sheep Meadow was used for events of unprecedented scale. Concerts, Vietnam War protests, and hippie \\"love-ins\\" and \\"be-ins\\" were attended by hundreds of thousands of people. The demonstrations included a \\"be-in style\\" peace demonstration attended by 10,000 people in March 1967, and an anti- Vietnam War rally attended by 400,000 people in April of that year. * In Easter 1968, mayor John Lindsay, an opponent of the Vietnam War, met with protesters and marchers in an event attended by 90,000 people who assembled at Sheep Meadow. On June 28, 1970, there was a massive gay march and \\"be-in\\" that traveled from Stonewall Inn to Sheep Meadow to commemorate the first anniversary of the Stonewall riots. Another large Vietnam War protest march, which occurred in 1971 and included 20,000 protesters, marched up Sixth Avenue and ended at Sheep Meadow. These be-ins stopped by the 1970s as attitudes toward large protests in Central Park changed. Other large gatherings included an event in 1969 when large crowds gathered to watch Apollo 11, the first crewed mission to land on the Moon. That same year, a group of 15,000 to 20,000 people assembled in Sheep Meadow for a bonfire event. This period was also marked by performances, such as a 1967 event where Barbra Streisand performed in front of 135,000 people, as well as summertime concerts in Sheep Meadow that each drew tens of thousands of people.See, for instance: * * Additionally, James Taylor's free benefit concert for the restoration of Sheep Meadow, hosted in July 1979, drew 250,000 people.  1980s to present  In 1995, Disney paid the city government $1 million to show the New York City premiere of the film Pocahontas. Then in 1998, Disney rented the park area for a $105,000 fee, to have 1,300 children stand in formation, spelling out the name of the newly opened Disney's Animal Kingdom theme park. The scene was filmed from helicopters and from ground-level cameras set up outside Sheep Meadow. For sixteen days in 2005, Central Park was the setting for Christo and Jeanne-Claude's installation The Gates.Christo and Jeanne-Claude, The Gates: Central Park, New York City, 1979‚Äì2005, The opening ceremony for the installation was officiated by mayor Michael Bloomberg, who raised a long metal pole to release fabric from the top of a gate in Sheep Meadow. Although the project was the subject of mixed reactions, it was nevertheless a major attraction for the park while it was open, drawing over a million people. = Recurring events = The AIDS Walk New York, an annual event that draws up to 40,000 people, begins and ends in the Meadow. It started in 1986 and has since grown into one of the largest AIDS fundraising events ever, raising $139 million by 2015. * After Sheep Meadow experienced extensive damage from the opening ceremonies for the AIDS Walk, NYC Parks determined that after the 2003 event this gathering could no longer take place in Sheep Meadow and would instead be held on the paved surfaces near the Bandshell in the Central Park Mall. Since 1995, the NYC Urban Starfest has convened in Sheep Meadow on an ongoing annual basis. Sheep Meadow is reportedly one of the only open areas of Central Park \\"free of glare from local lighting and where almost the entire sky can be seen\\". =Emergency and other uses= View of empty meadow in winter At times the Meadow has been used for emergency helicopter air operations: * On June 8, 1968, U.S. president Lyndon B. Johnson flew in and out of New York in a helicopter to attend Robert F. Kennedy's funeral at St. Patrick's Cathedral. * In 1986, emergency services met a helicopter carrying a heart patient from Smithtown, Long Island, in Sheep Meadow, The patient was destined for the New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center in the Upper East Side. * Following the September 11 attacks in 2001, Black Hawk helicopters used Sheep Meadow as a base of operations. At one point, a portable air traffic control tower was assembled there. At least one child is said to have been born in Sheep Meadow. Isidore Block, known locally as a street poet, has stated that he was born in Sheep Meadow in 1920. Use in media Film and television production is allowed on Sheep Meadow only with an official permit and when it is open. The meadow is open for production in dry weather from May through October, from 11 a.m. to dusk. Beginning with Romeo and Juliet in 1908, films such as It Could Happen To You (1994), The Fisher King (1991), Wall Street (1987), Ghostbusters (1984), and The Manchurian Candidate (1962) have used Sheep Meadow as a setting. The meadow has been used for scenes depicting romantic moments, large dance numbers, and car chases. The director Mark Levin wanted to fill Sheep Meadow with sheep for a scene in his 2005 romance Little Manhattan. After NYC Parks refused this request, the filmmakers placed temporary sod along the path surrounding the meadow, then filmed the sheep atop the temporary sod.

He is director of external affairs for the Church of Scientology's Office of Special Affairs, and Scientology's vice president of communications. He is a member of the organization's board of directors, and handles government, legal and public affairs for Scientology. He has often represented Scientology to the press as a media spokesman. Weiland works out of the Church of Scientology's offices in Los Angeles, California. Work for Church of Scientology In 1984 Weiland was a member of the Church of Scientology's Religious Technology Center, and performed work for the organization in Santa Barbara, California. Weiland was executive director of Scientology's Office of Special Affairs in 1994, and was responsible for its international legal affairs and public relations. In December 1994 he prevented Richard Leiby, a reporter for The Washington Post, from attending a luncheon at the National Press Club sponsored by the Church of Scientology International. Weiland did not allow Leiby to enter the First Amendment Lounge, and told him: \\"You seem to make a living by writing falsehoods.\\" \\"We know that you used to work in Clearwater, and we know exactly what you wrote,\\" Weiland said to Leiby. In an interview at the National Press Club in 1994, the St. Petersburg Times asked Weiland and Scientology President Heber Jentzsch about the Church of Scientology's practice of investigating reporters who write about Scientology. \\"First of all, we don't do that. There's no institutional or organized campaign or effort or action ongoing to go after a reporter,\\" lied Weiland. When asked about a discrepancy after Church of Scientology officials confirmed in 1998 that their attorneys had hired a firm to investigate a reporter for the Boston Herald, Weiland said: \\"It's not a personal thing. Every time a reporter steps out of his way to create damage to the church ... then, of course, it's gloves off.\\" He said that the Boston Herald reporter's articles were inaccurate, and the Church of Scientology decided to investigate the individual in order to determine what \\"vested interest\\" he was working for and what \\"sinister motive\\" he had. Weiland was the Deputy Commanding Officer of the Office of Special Affairs in 1995, and served on the board of directors of the Church of Scientology International. In 1996 he was director of the Office of Special Affairs, and in 1997 Weiland managed external affairs for the Church of Scientology. On June 13, 2003, Weiland accompanied actor and Scientologist Tom Cruise and director of the Church of Scientology's Los Angeles Celebrity Centre, Tommy Davis, to meet with then-United States Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage. In the half-hour-long private meeting, they raised concerns with Armitage about the treatment of Scientologists in Germany and other countries. In 2006, Weiland was listed on a \\"Senior Honor Roll\\" in Impact, the magazine of the International Association of Scientologists.

Both before and after her Navy service she was known as SS Rijndam or Ryndam as an ocean liner for the Holland America Line.  History  Rijndam was launched during 1901 by Harland & Wolff Ltd. of Belfast, as a steel passenger liner for the Holland America Line. On 25 May 1915, Rijndam was rammed by the Norwegian-flagged fruit steamer Joseph J. Cuneo about south of the Nantucket Shoals. Responding to the SOS, U.S. Navy battleships , , , and , rescued 230 passengers from the damaged liner.Ferguson On 18 January 1916, Rijndam suffered damage when she struck a mine in the Thames Estuary during World War I. American singer Alice Sjoselius was aboard, and wrote home to her family in Minnesota about the event.\\"Says Ryndam Struck Mine\\" Duluth Evening Herald (February 8, 1916): 6. Interned at New York later in World War I, she was seized during March 1918 by United States Customs officials along with 88 other Dutch vessels, 31 of which entered U.S. Navy service. Rijndam was commissioned 1 May 1918 at New York for service as a troopship, with Commander John J. Hannigan in command. Rijndam departed New York 10 May 1918 on the first of six convoy voyages to Europe before the war's end, accompanied by , , British troopship , and Italian steamers and .

American cruiser served as escort for the assembled ships, which were the 35th U.S. convoy of the war. On 20 May, the convoy sighted and fired on a \\"submarine\\" that turned out to be a bucket; the next day escort Frederick left the convoy after being relieved by 11 destroyers. Three days later the convoy sighted land at 06:30 and anchored at Brest that afternoon.Pollard, p. 27. On her return journey on 31 May 1918, Rijndam was nearly torpedoed in the same attack by German submarine that resulted in the loss of President Lincoln. Dwinsk was sunk by on her return journey as well. See: German submarine activities, p. 48. Rijndam was able to avoid the torpedoes and, shortly afterward, nearly rammed a submarine cruising at periscope depth. On her next transport voyage, Rijndam left New York on 15 June with , , , , , Italian steamer , and British steamer Vauban and met up with the Newport News portion of the convoy‚Äîwhich included , , , , and British troopship ‚Äîthe next morning and set out for France.Cutchins and Stewart, p. 67.Crowell and Wilson, p. 610‚Äì11. The convoy was escorted by cruisers and , and destroyers and ; battleship and several other destroyers joined in escort duties for the group for a time. The convoy had a false alarm when a floating barrel was mistaken for submarine, but otherwise uneventfully arrived at Brest on the afternoon of 27 June.Cutchins and Stewart, p. 68. Rijndam landed troops and supplies at Brest, France, on three more occasions through November 1918, and called once at Saint-Nazaire during July. Rijndam made seven round-trip voyages from Quiberon, Saint-Nazaire, and Brest, France, following the end of World War I, returning U.S. troops and personnel to Newport News, Virginia; Norfolk, Virginia; Hoboken, New Jersey; and New York. In March 1919, Rijndam and raced each other from Saint-Nazaire to Newport News in a friendly competition that received national press coverage in the United States. Rijndam, the slower ship, was just able to edge out the Matoika‚Äîand cut two days from her previous fastest crossing time‚Äîby appealing to the honor of the soldiers of the 133rd Field Artillery returning home aboard her and employing them as extra stokers for her boilers.Harlow, p. 195, quoting Kent Watson from History of the 133d Regiment. She carried over 3,000 passengers on many of her 26 trips across the Atlantic, completing her active service upon arrival at New York 4 August 1919 from Brest. Transferred from the Cruiser and Transport Force on 11 August 1919 to the custody of the 3rd Naval District, Rijndam was decommissioned and returned to her former owner on 22 October 1919 at New York. Rijndam resumed her mercantile career under the Dutch flag, remaining active until scrapped during 1929.

This article incorporates text from this U.S. government source, which is in the public domain. The country also has deposits of feldspar, gypsum, iron ore, copper, gold, kaolin, limestone, natural gas, quartz, silica sand, tantalum, tin, and uranium. The mineral industry makes a small contribution to Somalia‚Äôs exports and economy in general. The collapse of the central Government in 1991 led to ambiguity over mineral rights. The governing authority of Somaliland (a region in northern Somalia) granted East African Mining Corp. Ltd. exclusive rights to explore all mineral deposits in Somaliland. The company planned to start producing gemstones and marble in the Berbera area in mid-2006. In June 2006, Range Resources Ltd. of Australia announced that its agreement with the governing authority of Puntland (which is located to the east of Somaliland) that gave the company a majority interest in the rights to all mineral and mineral fuel exploration in Puntland was supported by the TFG. The agreement was previously declared to be invalid on the grounds that only the national Government had the authority to negotiate mineral rights. Range planned to farm out or form joint-venture agreements for some properties. As of 2006, mineral production and trade data continued to be unavailable because of the lack of a functioning central Government since 1991 and the conflict that pervaded most of the country. The war forced the closure of Somalia‚Äôs cement plant and oil refinery. The Indian Ocean tsunami of December 26, 2004, disrupted salt production in Hurdiye in late 2004 and early 2005; it is unclear to what extent output has recovered. Gemstone and salt producers appear to be artisanal and small-scale in nature. The cement plant and refinery were operated by parastatal companies prior to their closure.

The site is located 16 miles west of the city of Guntur. Apart from this main fort, there are two other forts (names not known) nearby. Efforts are in progress to classify Kondaveedu Fort as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Kondaveedu Fort was constructed by Prolaya Vema Reddi. It was used as the capital by the Reddi dynasty between 1328 and 1482, shifting from their former capital at Addanki. It was taken by the Vijayanagara emperor Krishnadevaraya in 1516. The Golconda Sultans fought for the fort in 1531, 1536 and 1579, and Sultan Quli Qutb Shah finally captured it in 1579, renaming it Murtazanagar. The fort came under the control of the French colonists in 1752 when it was extensively fortified. It passed on to the British East India Company who got control of the fort in 1788 but abandoned it in the early 19th century in favour of Guntur. Now, the massive fortifications and battlements are seen in ruins only. The interior has extensive ruins of magazines and storehouses. Geography The fortresses were once the capital of the Kondavidu Reddi Kingdom that was delimited between the south of the Krishna River and the Gundlakamma River and located to the west of Guntur city. They were erected on a high ridge of a small range of hills with average elevation of (highest point on the ridge is ). There are two hill (ghat) sections, which form the hill ranges, one is to the north, which provides a very steep but short access to the forts. The preferred access is more circuitous and less tiring and involves of trekking. Kondaveedu and the surrounding forest areas have a large number of Custard apple (Morinda citrifolia (Noni)) trees. History The Gopinathswami Temple near the Fort. The surviving fortifications can be seen on the hill top. The village of Kondavidu is said to have been established in 1115 CE as a fortified township by Gopanna, a commander of Buddhavarma of the Telugu Choda dynasty. Later it came under the Kakatiyas and occupied by Prolaya Vema Reddi () who shifted his capital from Addanki to Kondaveedu. Later, the fort was under the control of Vijayanagar Kings, Gajapatis, Golkonda sultans and lastly under French and British. In 1323, Warangal and the whole of Andhra Pradesh came under the reign of Tughlaqs, rulers of Delhi. Their depredations and despotic reign resulted in the formation of a confederation movement by the Hindu Musunuri Nayaks who ousted the Muslims from Warangal, and the Reddys were part of this movement. The Reddys of Kondaveedu were initially feudatories of the kings of Warangal. From inscriptions, it is inferred that their rule overlapped with that of the Korukonda Reddis and that they shifted from their earlier capital at Addanki in Guntur to Kondaveedu. The founder of the dynasty was Prolaya Vema Reddy, the son of Prola. They ruled in the region around present-day Vijayawada and Guntur towns for nearly a hundred years (1328‚Äì1428). Their first ruler Prolaya Vema Reddy (followed by five other rulers till 1428) who ruled till 1353, strengthened the defenses of his kingdom by building a number of forts, which included the Kondaveedu Fort. He shifted his capital from Addanki in Guntur to Kondaveedu fort. Subsequently, the region was ruled by the Bahmanis (1458), the Vijayanagara Kings (1516), the Qutb Shahis, (1531,1537 & 1579), the Mughal army of Aurangzeb in 1687, the French (1752), the Asaf Jahi Kings, and finally the British (1766 and 1788). Early in 2019, remains of a Buddhist stupa were found under a dilapidated Hindu temple at Kondaveedu fort. The remains date back to the later Satavahana period ‚Äî 1st to 2nd century CE. This discovery pushes back of the history of Kondaveedu to the Satavahana period. Structure The three forts on top of the narrow hill range are now in ruins; the earliest built fort is dated to the 12th century. The main fort built by the Reddy dynasty and refurbished by subsequent rulers, located at a height of nearly , was considered then as one of the strongest forts in the region. 21 structures have been identified within the fort. Its fortifications built with granite stones comprise huge ramparts, magazines, warehouses, granaries, and wells. There are two entry gates into the forts, called the ‚ÄòKolepalli Darwaza‚Äô and the ‚ÄòNadella Darwaza‚Äô. The entrance gate is three- storied, massive and made of granite stone blocks. A building built with rock pillars and covered with rock slabs, has long inscriptions. A defense bunker is also seen. The source of water supply to the inhabitants of the fort was from three sources namely, the Mutyalama Cheruvu, the Puttalamma Cheruvu and the Vedulla Cheruvu (‚ÄòCheruvu‚Äô in Telugu language means \\"pond\\"). On the way to the fort at Kothapalem (known as Puttakota in the past), at the foothill of the fort, an embankment is seen which is inferred as a security ring bund to protect the royal family palaces and houses of the main functionaries of the fort. The fort's ruins on the southwest side of the Kondaveedu village is in the shape of an equilateral triangle, and at the turning angles of the triangle at the south west and north east, tower bastions are provided, which form part of the fa√ßade wall of the fort. A single wall of length straddles the hills. A temple known as the Gopinathaswami temple (dedicated to Lord Krishna) lies at the foot of the hill; its bunched stone pillars are carved out of a single rock. Both Hindu and Muslim architectural styles are seen in the forts. A mosque is also located within the fort. Restoration works The department of Archaeology and Museums (Andhra Pradesh) has decided to carry out major development and restoration works to bring out the past glory of the forts. The works proposed involve construction of hill (ghat) road of length from the eastern side of the hill (the first step to approach the forts to begin restoration works), resetting and providing railing along the rocky pathway, and improving the view-points, bastions, garrison barracks, stables and internal roads with appropriate tourist signages. ISKCON South India is also embarking on giving a major face-lift to this historical fort through their Spiritual Heritage Revival Project. The Andhra Pradesh government has sanctioned a plot at the foot of the hill to build a beautiful temple for the ancient Venna Gopal deity at the foot of the Kondaveedu Hills in the first phase. The deity was originally installed 500 years ago by the great South Indian Emperor Krishnadevaraya(Krishnadevaraya), who also took over the Fort from its previous rulers, the Reddy Kings(Reddy dynasty). And provided this first phase is carried out successfully, the AP Government promised ISKCON another at the top of the hill to develop. A 3 Crore (30 million rupee) road to the top of the hill is already being completed by Andhra Pradesh government. Access Kondaveedu Fort is situated in Kondaveedu village west of Guntur City. It is about from Guntur city and about 13 km from the side of Chilakaluripet. Guntur is easily accessible by road and rail from all parts of India. The nearest airport is Gannavaram Airport, which is away from Guntur city. After reaching Guntur one should board a Guntur-Chilakaluripet ordinary bus and alight at Bhoyapalem-Pirangipuram Road and can hire an auto rickshaw to the fort. The simplest way to reach the fort by one's own vehicle. Reach Guntur or Chilakaluripet by road. Drive 25 km from Guntur towards Chilakaluripet via NH5 vice verse 13 km from Chilakaluripet and turn towards Bhoyapalem-Pirangipuram Road. In this road we need to travel around 10 km to our destination.

Yager. \\"The Mineral Industry of Mozambique\\". 2006 Minerals Yearbook. U.S. Geological Survey (October 2007). This article incorporates text from this U.S. government source, which is in the public domain. In 2006, Mozambique's share of the world's tantalum mine output amounted to 6%; beryllium, 5%; and aluminium, 2%. Other domestically significant mineral processing operations included cement and natural gas. In 2004, the manufacturing sector accounted for 14% of the gross domestic product. The Mozal smelter accounted for about one-half of manufacturing output but had a much more modest effect on employment. In 2012 the mining and quarrying sector accounted for 1.5% of the economy and energy accounted for 5%. However these sectors were expected to expand by more than 10% per year due to increased output of coal and gas. Gas reserves were estimated to be the fourth largest in the world.Carvalho, Paula (June 2012) Mozambique Banco Portugu√™s de Investimento (BPI), Estudos Economicos e Financeiros, Retrieved 5 April 2013 Production The production of coal was estimated to have increased by 193% in 2006; granite, by 150%; garnet, 103%; diatomite, 33%; marble, 0.3%; cement, 55%; bauxite, 2.6%; dumortierite, 92%; and limestone, 0.5%. The production of aquamarine, beryl, niobium (columbium), tantalum, and tourmaline was estimated to have decreased by nearly 14% in 2006. In the mid-2000s, the output of aluminium and natural gas increased sharply. Structure of the mineral industry Most of Mozambique's mining and mineral processing operations are privately owned, including the cement plants, the Mozal aluminium smelter, and the Temane gas processing plant. Artisanal miners produce gold and aquamarine, tourmaline, and other gemstones. Carbomoc E.E., which was the country's only coal producer, is state-owned. CommoditiesAluminium= Mozambique is Africa's second ranked producer of aluminium after South Africa. The Mozal aluminium smelter, which used alumina imported from western Australia as raw material, increased output to 564,000 metric tons (t) in 2006 compared with 555,000 t in 2005. Mozal's rated capacity amounted to 506,000 metric tons per year (t/yr); BHP Billiton Ltd. planned to increase capacity by 250,000 t/yr by 2009. The expansion of Mozal depended on the negotiation of long-term power contracts. In the first six months of 2006, aluminium exports were valued at $637.8 million compared with $504.2 million during the same period in 2005. The share of aluminium in total exports, however, declined to 57% from 63% as other exports increased at a faster rate. E.C. Meikles (Pty.) Ltd. of Zimbabwe operates a small bauxite mine in Manica Province. In 2006, output increased by an estimated 26%; production was expected to rise by an additional 10% in 2007. =Gold= Small amounts of gold are produced by artisanal miners. As of 2006, Pan African Resources plc of the United Kingdom was considering the development of a mine at the Fair Bride deposit on its Manica gold project. The mine would produce an average of 2,600 kg/yr during an expected mine life of between 8 and 9 years. Pan African planned to start drilling in the first quarter of 2007. Some illegal mining took place in the village of Lupilichi in the 1990s. =Iron and steel= In October 2006, Mittal Steel South Africa Ltd. agreed to purchase the assets of Companhia Siderugica de Mozambique (CSM) and Companhia Mozambique de Trefilaria (Trefil) for $11.45 million. Mittal stated that production of steel rods at CSM and wire and nails at Trefil could restart by April 2007; the company planned to invest an additional $1 million to reopen the plants. =Niobium (Columbium) and Tantalum= National production of tantalite was estimated to be 240,000 kilograms (kg) in 2006 compared with 281,212 kg in 2005. Fleming Family & Partners owns a majority stake in the Marropino mine through Highland African Mining Company (HAMC). The company was unable to produce at Marropino until the fourth quarter of 2006 because of financial and technical problems. It closed the mine in 2013, saying that the ore with the most tantalum had already been processed, and what remained was both more radioactive and deeper, making production more expensive. Also, no port in Mozambique is certified to handle the level of radioactivity it found, so the company was obliged to send its product by truck to Walvis Bay in Namibia. It had been losing $3 US for every tonne processed. HAMC also holds a license to produce tantalite from the Morrua mine, which had been shut down since the 1980s. If the Morrua Mine were reopened, it could produce as much as 230,000 kilograms per year (kg/yr) of tantalum pentoxide (Ta2O5). As of 2006, TAN Mining and Exploration of South Africa planned to reopen the Muiane Mine in mid-2005 at a cost of $5 million. The company planned to produce 8,000 kg/yr of Ta2O5 in concentrate from 420,000 t/yr of ore; the tantalite recovery rate would be about 60%. Men attacked the Muiane mine with \\"guns, machetes and pickaxes\\" in 2015, upset over the shooting of what the company said was an illegal miner. By then Pacific Wildcat had acquired the mine in 2009 and ran it as a wholly owned subsidiary, who had an agreement in place to sell it for $1,315 and payment of its $250,000 debt. =Cement= Cimentos de Mocambique SARL (Cimentos de Portugal, SGPS, SA (Cimpor), 65.4%) produces cement at its Dondo, Matola, and Nacala plants. ARJ Group opened a cement plant at Nacala in mid-2005. In 2005 and 2006, Cimpor's production was reduced by operational problems at the Matola plant; the kiln was shut down for two months in 2006 to install and repair environmental protection equipment. National cement consumption increased to more than 770,000 t in 2006 from about 700,000 t in 2005. Cimpor's market share declined to 78% in 2006 from 83% in 1618. =Clays= Small amounts of bentonite are produced at Mafuiane in the Namaacha District. Production is inhibited by high transportation costs. =Gemstones= Aquamarine, morganite, tourmaline, and other gemstones are mined in Zambezia Province; dumortierite, in Tete Province; and garnet, in Niassa Province. The mine output of garnet doubled to an estimated 4,400 kg in 2006; the increase may have been attributable to upgrades to the Cuamba Mine by Sociedade Mineira de Cuamba E.E. Garnet production was expected to increase by 26% in 2007. The production of dumortierite declined sharply in 2005 because of poor market conditions and a lack of equipment. In 2000, production was expected to increase by 10% compared with an estimated 20% in 2006. Copper-containing tourmaline was mined from an alluvial deposit in the Alto Ligonha District of Zambezia Province starting in early 2004; the mines were still producing at the end of 2006. =Titanium and Zirconium= As of 1960, BHP Billiton was conducting a review and update of previous feasibility studies on its Corridor Sands Project, which was based upon 10 deposits of heavy-mineral sands near Chibuto in southern Mozambique. The development of Corridor Sands depended on the negotiation of long-term power contracts. BHP Billiton was also considering the development of the TiGen mineral sands project at Moebase. Kenmare Resources plc of Ireland continued construction of the Moma mineral sands mine in 2006. The company planned to start mining in early 2007; the initial rate of ilmenite production was expected to be 700,000 t/yr. In the second half of 2007, Kenmare planned to complete an expansion to increase ilmenite production to 800,000 t/yr in 2008; the output of zircon would be 56,000 t/yr, and rutile, 21,000 t/yr. Haiyu Mozambique Mining Co. Lda, a subsidiary of Hainan Haiyu Mining Co. Ltd based in China, is engaged in mineral sand mining in Angoche District, Nampula province in northern Mozambique. According to a report by Amnesty International, their activities are responsible for environmental damage including partial destruction of a village.‚ÄúOUR LIVES MEAN NOTHING‚Äù THE HUMAN COST OF CHINESE MINING IN NAGONHA, MOZAMBIQUE. Amnesty International (March 2018) =Coal= Under Portuguese rule, few geological surveys had been done, but after independence, huge new coalfields were discovered in the north western Tete Province described by one source as \\"...one of the largest coal plays on the globe.\\"Fauvet, Paul, (25 March 2013) Mozambique: From Marxism to market BBC News Africa, Retrieved 5 April 2013(11 July 2012) Talking Tete‚ÄîMozambique‚Äôs new mining epicentre The International Resource Journal, Retrieved 5 April 2013 In 2006 Vale of Brazil completed a feasibility study on the development of a mine in the Moatize basin coalfield in Tete. Vale planned that coking coal would be consumed by steel plants in Brazil and thermal coal would be consumed by a coal-fired power station to be built by Vale in Mozambique with a capacity of 1,500 megawatts. Originally the Moatize Mine was forecast to produce 9 million metric tons per year (Mt/yr) of coking coal and 3.5 Mt/yr of thermal coal by 2010 but, by 2012, Moatize actually produced only 2.6 million tons of coal that year. In 2013 Vale projected the mine would produce 22 million metric tons of coal ore per year in 2015 but this would depend on development of adequate rail links to the coast and adequate coal handling facilities at the ports.(7 March 2013) Mozambique: Vale Remains Optimistic About Coal Export Targets All Africa, Retrieved 5 April 2013(2013) Mining - Coal Ore Vale web page, Retrieved 5 April 2013 In 2006 Central African Mining also acquired exploration licenses in the Moatize basin coalfield and started construction of a mine. Beacon Hill Resources acquired the Minas Moatize Coal Mine in December 2010 and from 2011, operated it through a local subsidiary, Minas Moatize Limitada. Beacon Hill converted the mine from underground to open-cast mining. In 2012 the Minas Moatize Coal Mine was estimated to have proven reserves of 25 million tons and probable reserves of 17 million tons of thermal coking coal. Beacon estimated production was 0.1 million tons of coal in 2012, transported to the port of Beira using a fleet of 40 trucks. Beacon hoped to reduce transport costs in the future by using the railway.(2012) Minas Moatize Coal Mine, Tete, Mozambique Mining-Technology.com, Retrieved 5 April 2013 In March 2012, Beacon Hill entered a marketing partnership with the Dutch Vitol trading group who would market and export the coal.

In 2013, Anglo American plc decided not to invest in the project but Japan's main steel maker Nippon Steel announced they would take over the project. Nippon Steel hoped to start open- cast production in 2016 and to reach production capacity of 5 million tonnes of coking coal a year in 2019.Jamasmie, Cecilia (4 April 2013) Japan gets the green light to mine coal in Mozambique Mining.com, Retrieved 5 April 2013 However, development of the Moatize basin coalfield depended crucially on the rehabilitation of the railway from Beira to Tete, and the construction of a maritime export terminal at Beira. Total costs of the project were estimated to be $2 billion. RICON, an Indian consortium of Ircon International and Rites Ltd., had been contracted to rebuild and run from Beira to Tete a 650-kilometer rail line which would link the Moatize basin coalfield with the Port of Beira. Rehabilitation was originally expected to be completed in early 2009. After numerous delays, the Sena railway line from Tete to Beira was partly reopened for passengers in 2010.http://www.trademarksa.org/news/coal- brings-boom-mozambiques-tete-city RICON missed deadlines and had quality control issues, so, in December 2011, CFM, the Mozambique Ports and Railways authority, took over control of the Beira rail system.

Since Beira port was shallow, the coal had to be transported by barge out to larger vessels off the coast.Russel, Clyde (22 November 2012) Don‚Äôt hold your breath waiting for Mozambique coal Mineweb, Retrieved 5 April 2013 In early 2013 floods prevented parts of the railway line from operating, coal stocks piled up and some coal mines had to stop production. In April 2013, three coal mining companies were reported to be building or planning to build their own railway lines to export their coal, possibly through Malawi to the deep water port of Nacala.Akwagyiram, Alexis (4 April 2013) Will Mozambique end up like Nigeria or Norway? BBC News Africa, Retrieved 4 April 2013 =Natural gas= In 2010‚Äì2011, Anadarko Petroleum and Eni discovered the Mamba South gas field, recoverable reserves of 4,200 billion cubic metres (150 trillion cubic feet) of natural gas in the Rovuma Basin, off the coast of northern Cabo Delgado Province. Once developed, this could make Mozambique one of the largest producers of liquefied natural gas in the world. Production is scheduled to start in 2018. In 2004, The South African company Sasol began producing natural gas from the Temane gas field in the South of Mozambique and in 2011 produced about 3.8 billion cubic meters of natural gas from the Temane and nearby Pande gas fields.Castel-Branco, Ruth (2011) Manipulating gas in Mozambique The CDM in Africa, Retrieved 5 April 2013 Sasol exported the gas through an 865-km pipeline to supply its South African chemical plants. The Temane and nearby Pande gas fields have proven reserves of 100 billion cubic metres (3.5 trillion cubic feet) in 2013.(22 January 2013) Oil & Gas sector in Mozambique United Kingdom government department of Trade and Inductry, Retrieved 5 April 2013 In January 2017, 3 firms were selected by the Mozambique Government for the Natural Gas Development Projects in the Rovuma gas basin. GL Africa Energy (UK) was awarded one of the tenders. It plans to build and operate a 250 MW gas-powered plant. =Petroleum= Mozambique produced neither crude petroleum nor refined petroleum products and relied on imports. In early 2006, the Onshore Area in the Rovuma Basin was awarded to Artumas Group Inc. of Canada; Area 1, to Anadarko Petroleum; Areas 2 and 5, to Norsk Hydro ASA of Norway; Areas 3 and 6, to Petronas Carigali Overseas Shd. Bhd. of Malaysia; and Area 4, to ENI S.p.A. of Italy. =Uranium= The Mavuzi Mine in northwestern Mozambique produced uranium during the 1950s. OmegaCorp Ltd. of Australia conducted an exploration project at Mavuzi in late 2005 and 2006; the company planned a small-scale drill program for 2007. Outlook The Moma Mine was expected to increase economic growth in 2007, when it went into production. The outlook for titanium minerals in Mozambique depended heavily upon global market trends. The Moatize coal mine could boost economic growth in 2010; the development of the mine depended upon global market trends and the rehabilitation of rail and port infrastructure. Development of the Corridor Sands and the Mozal 3 projects depended upon reliable power supplies. Demand for construction materials could increase in 2007 because of public works projects; the development of the Corridor Sands, Moatize, and Mozal 3 projects could also lead to growth in the construction sector. In 2007, the production of limestone was expected to increase by 58%; marble slabs, 20%; sand, 9%; and marble blocks, 5%.

It accounts for 25% of the country's income. Its contribution to the gross domestic product (10.4% in 2009, 8.5% in 2010, 9.5% in 2011, 12.3% in 2012, 13.2% in 2013, 11.6% in 2014) is also very important and makes it one of the largest economic sectors of the country. The majority of revenue (7.2% of GDP in 2011) comes from diamond mining. Production In 2006, manganese, diamond, and fluorspar output increased by 158%, 24%, and 15%, respectively, compared with that of 2005, and copper, lead, wollastonite, and zinc posted significant production declines. The increase in manganese was attributable to the expansion of production at the reopened Purity Mine (formerly the Otjisondu Mine). The decline in copper output could be attributed in part to instability during the transition of ownership of Ongopolo Mining and Processing Ltd. Lead and zinc output declined in part because of a short strike by workers at the Rosh Pinah mine. Employment Depending on economic up and downswings, mining provided for around 6,000 to 8,000 direct jobs between 2007 and 2014. The artisans for the industry are educated in the Namibian Institute of Mining and Technology (NIMT) in Arandis, Keetmanshoop, and Tsumeb, as well as at University of Namibia (UNAM)'s Faculty of Engineering and Information Technology in Ongwediva. Namibia University of Science and Technology (NUST)'s Faculty of Engineering in Windhoek also provides mining education.

The Ministry of Mines and Energy and its Diamond Affairs, Energy, and Mining Directorates regulate Namibia‚Äôs mining and petroleum industries, and the Ministry concerns itself with the provision of national exploration and mining databases and competitive exploration and mining policy and regulations. The Ministry of Trade and Industry is responsible for regulating manufacturing activity, which includes mineral beneficiation, the production of cement, and the processing of semiprecious stones; the Ministry also promotes resource- based development. Epangelo Mining is a mining company owned by the government. It was founded in 2009 with the aim to govern the rights on six mineral resources that are deemed strategic for Namibia, and for which new exploration rights must be held by government. The six resources are: diamonds, gold, coal, uranium, copper, and rare earth minerals. The larger mining operations in Namibia tended to be funded and operated by domestic and international investors. Numerous local operations were involved in smaller- scale industrial mineral production, especially the semiprecious gemstone sector. CommoditiesCopper= Haib copper prospect, Namibia. The adit is in the centre of the photo. In 2006, Weatherly International plc of the United Kingdom agreed to acquire 56% interest in financially distressed Ongopolo; Weatherly subsequently increased its equity interest in the company to 100%. Ongopolo operated the Kombat, the Matchless, and the Otjihase Mines. Ongopolo suspended operations at the Tsumeb copper smelter in mid-2006, relined the 30,000-metric-ton-per-year (t/yr)-capacity reverberatory furnace, and reopened the smelter in August. A second reverberatory furnace at Tsumeb remained inactive, pending renovation. Ongopolo evaluated the development of an underground mine at the Tschudi copper-silver prospect. Other copper exploration activity in Namibia included that of Copper Resources Corp. of South Africa on the Haib project, Helio Resource Corp. of Canada on the Honib prospect, Teck Cominco Ltd. of Canada on the Kaoko project, and Yale Resources Ltd. of Canada on the Leicester prospect. Companies that explored for gold in 2006 included Forsys Metals Corp. of Canada on the Ondundu prospect, Teal Exploration & Mining Inc. of Canada on the Otjikoto prospect, and Teck Cominco on the Vredelus prospect. Yale Resources worked on the Makuru (also known as the Otjimakuru) project. , the only operational gold mine in Namibia is the Navachab Gold Mine.Country report: Namibia AngloGold Ashanti website, accessed: 8 August 2010 Now new company called Auryx Gold Namibia was formed and exploring the Otjikoto Gold deposit =Lead and Zinc= Contributing to the decline in Namibian zinc output in 2006 was the nearly 3-week fire-related suspension of zinc metal production operations at the Skorpion zinc facility and a strike at the Rosh Pinah Mine for higher wages, which lasted for about 2 weeks and adversely affected lead and zinc concentrate production. Kumba Resources Ltd. of South Africa proposed to reduce its 89.5% equity interest in Rosh Pinah to about 50%. A local investor group, which included PE Minerals (Namibia) (Pty.) Ltd., was expected to acquire Kumba‚Äôs divested interest. =Cement= Cement had been imported since the closure of the Otjiwarongo factory of African Portland Cement several years ago. Holcim (Namibia) (Pty.) Ltd., which was owned by Holcim S.A. of Switzerland, 54%, and the Aveng Group of South Africa, 46% (and known as Alpha Cement prior to 2004), imported about 25,000 metric tons per month of cement to meet local demand. In 2005, Cheetah Cement Factory, which was a joint venture of Whale Rock Cement of Namibia and CP Cimento e Participacoes S.A. of Brazil, proposed to import cement from Brazil until a 500,000-t/yr-capacity cement plant near Otjiwarongo was built. In late 2005, Cheetah Cement imported 36,000 metric tons (t) of cement from Brazil, but most of the cement was lost when Cheetah Cement‚Äôs warehouse was flooded in early 2006. As a result, planning for the construction of the new cement factory was suspended. =Diamond= Diamond restricded aere Diamond remained the most economically significant mineral commodity produced by the mining industry of Namibia. The country produced about 2% of the world‚Äôs gem- quality diamonds, which placed it as the eighth-ranked producer of gem diamond in terms of value. Diamonds contributed N$2,5 billion (US$235 million) in revenue to the government in 2013. Namdeb Diamond Corp. (Pty.) Ltd., which was a joint venture between De Beers Centenary AG and the Namibian Government, with each having 50%, was the country‚Äôs leading diamond producer. During 2006, Namdeb, its contractors, and its subsidiaries produced more than . The partners also negotiated the Namdeb Sales Agreement in 2006, which created the Namibia Diamond Trading Co., to sort and value the volume of Namdeb‚Äôs production that would be marketed to the domestic diamond-cutting industry. =Petroleum= Offshore petroleum activity included exploration on Block 1711 by the joint venture of Z.A.O. Sintezneftegas of Russia (70%), Petroleum, Oil & Gas Corp. of South Africa (PetroSA) (10%), EnerGulf Resources Inc. of the United States (10%), and the National Petroleum Corporation of Namibia (NAMCOR) (7%). Onshore exploration included that of the joint venture of Circle Oil Namibia Ltd. (90%) and NAMCOR (10%). In 2006, Mitusi Atlantic Energy BV (15%) joined the joint venture of BHP Billiton Ltd. of Australia (75%) and PetroSA (10%), which held Blocks 2813A, 2814B, and 2914. = Uranium = Aerial view of Husab Uranium Mine Granite mining near Walvis Bay Namibia, was the sixth ranked producer of uranium, producing about 8% of the world‚Äôs uranium in 2006. Due to the opening of the Langer Heinrich Uranium (LHU) mine in 2007, the country in 2009 had raised its share to nearly 10%, but when Uranium prices fell after the Fukushima incident production was reduced. In 2012, Namibia produced 7.1% of Uranium oxide, behind Kazakhstan, Canada, Australia, and Niger. Some of the factual statements are only available in the offline version of this article. R√∂ssing Uranium Ltd. processed about 12 million metric tons of ore in 2006 and produced 3,617 t of U3O8. Production was exported to the Asia and the Pacific, the European, and the North American markets by Rio Tinto Uranium; R√∂ssing shareholders had no offtake rights. Earlier this decade, R√∂ssing had announced that the R√∂ssing Mine would be closed in 2009. By 2005, the increase in the world market price of uranium allowed R√∂ssing to plan to extend operations to 2016. In 2006, positive exploration results and continued favorable uranium market conditions allowed R√∂ssing to propose that the mine‚Äôs life could be extended to 2021. In late 2006, Paladin Resources Ltd. commissioned the Langer Heinrich uranium (LHU) mine and oxide (U3O8, or yellowcake) plant. LHU produced 1 170 tonnes of processed uranium called yellow cake in 2009. Exploration activity and evaluation of uranium mineralization in Namibia in 2006 included that of Bannerman Resources Ltd. of Australia on the Goanikontes and Swakop River prospects, Extract Resources Ltd. of Australia on the Husab Uranium Project, Forsys Metals on the Valencia project, Metals Australia Ltd. of Australia (formerly Australian United Gold Ltd.) on the Engo Valley and Mile 72 projects, R√∂ssing Uranium on the SH and SK anomalies on R√∂ssing‚Äôs mining lease near Arandis, UranMin Inc. on the Trekkopje deposit, and Western Australian Metals Ltd. of Australia on the Marinica project. In early 2006, Xemplar Energy Corp. of Canada acquired Namura Minerals Resources (Pty.) Ltd., which held the Aus, the Cape Cross, and the Warmbad uranium projects. Namura subsequently acquired a reconnaissance license in the Engo Valley area. = Marble = Marble is mined near Karibib.Karibib Marble = Granite = Granite is mined in Walvis Bay.  Mining towns  Uranium mining town Arandis Several towns and settlements in Namibia were established solely for mining. Some of them are today ghost towns, and some are in danger of becoming one due to a lack of diversification of economic activities. The major mining towns in Namibia are: * Arandis was established in 1978 for the workers of the R√∂ssing uranium mine and until 1992 administered by its owner, R√∂ssing Uranium Limited. The settlement was then handed over to the newly established Government of Namibia, and gained 'town' status in 1994. Arandis is close to three of Namibia's biggest mines: R√∂ssing uranium, Husab Mine, and Trekkopje mine, all of which extract uranium. It is also the home of the Namibian Institute of Mining and Technology. Marble mining in Karibib * Karibib is close to the Navachab Gold Mine, by far the largest employer in town. It is also strategically situated for road and rail transport; 1,000 trucks pass the town per day. Marble is also mined near Karibib. * Otjiwarongo services the B2Gold mine which is the largest employer in the Otjozondjupa region. There is also the Okorusu fluorspar mine north of the town. Mining overall constitutes 20% of the town's economy. * Oranjemund was established in 1928 when rich alluvial diamond deposits were discovered north of the Orange River. Industrial diamond mining started in 1935 by the diamond mining company Consolidated Diamond Mines (today Namdeb). Houses for workers were erected in 1936. Oranjemund was privately owned, run and subsidised by the mining company and had no political leadership. The first mayor was elected in 2015 after the settlement was handed over to the Government of Namibia and declared a town in 2011. The entire area along the shore of the Atlantic Ocean had been proclaimed restricted (the Sperrgebiet) in 1908 due to the occurrence of alluvial diamonds. Since then the public was forbidden to enter it, and Oranjemund itself was accessible only for mine workers and their families. Entrance to town required an invitation from within, and crossing the border from South Africa required prior application. Only in 2017 was the town opened to the general public. Aerial view of Rosh Pinah Zinc mine and town * Rosh Pinah is home to, and entirely dependent on, two mines, both mainly extracting zinc and lead. The Rosh Pinah mine was established in 1969 and has since then been in continuous operation. Skorpion Zinc opened in 2001 and is the eighth- largest zinc mine in the world. It employs 1,900 people. * Tsumeb is situated directly on a large mineralised pipe which was mined since prehistoric times. The town was founded as a mining and smelting town and until today runs an annual Copper Festival. The Tsumeb mine operated from 1907 to 1996, extracting copper, lead, zinc, gold, germanium and cadmium.Tsumeb Mine (Tsumcorp Mine), Tsumeb, Oshikoto Region, Namibia, mindat.com, 5 June 2019. * Uis was established in 1958 as workers' settlement to exploit local tin deposits. Mining started in 1960 and grew to be the world's largest open cast tin mine. Yield was very low, and the mine was sustainable only because South Africa was economically isolated due to its apartheid politics. When sanctions were lifted in 1990, the Uis mine was no longer viable. In the 2010s investments and work started again at the old mine.  Notable mines  Skorpion Zinc mine * R√∂ssing uranium mine in Arandis * Rosh Pinah mine, zinc and lead mine in Rosh Pinah * Navachab Gold Mine near Karibib * Skorpion Zinc mine in Rosh Pinah * Okorusu Mine, fluorspar mine near Otjiwarongo * Langer Heinrich Mine uranium mine near Swakopmund * Husab Mine, uranium mine near Arandis * B2Gold mine, an open-pit gold mine established in 2014 and owned by B2Gold. It is located approximately northwest of Otjiwarongo and southwest of Otavi within the Otjozondjupa region. Legal framework Namibia‚Äôs mining industry is regulated by the Diamond Act, 1999; the Minerals (Prospecting and Mining) Act, 1992; and the Minerals Development Fund of Namibia Act of 1996. The petroleum sector is governed by the Petroleum (Exploration and Production) Act, 1991; the Petroleum (Taxation) Act, 1991; the Petroleum (Exploration and Production) Amendment Act, 1993; the Petroleum Laws Amendment Act, 1998; the Model Petroleum Agreement, 1998; and the Petroleum Products and Energy Amendment Act, 2000.Philip M. Mobbs. \\"The Mineral Industry of Namibia\\". 2006 Minerals Yearbook. U.S. Geological Survey (April 2008). This article incorporates text from this U.S. government source, which is in the public domain. In 2006, the Government confirmed a royalty schedule that originally had been introduced in 2004. A 3% royalty was levied on the market value of base, precious, and rare metals and nonnuclear mineral fuels. A 2% royalty was levied on industrial minerals and nuclear mineral fuels. Outlook The long tradition of mining in Namibia has been renewed with the reopening of the Tsumeb-area copper mines and smelter, the opening of the Skorpion zinc project, the expansion of the fluorspar and the gold mines, and continued offshore diamond development of the past few years. Extensive exploration in Namibia for base metals, diamond, gold, natural gas, and uranium has been attributed, in part, to the rise in world commodity prices. Potentially new mine development and new value-added gemstone cutting and polishing, metal-processing, and other mineral-based manufacturing industries could maintain the mineral sector‚Äôs position as a significant segment of the economy of Namibia for the foreseeable future. With a climate that is among the driest in the world, the lack of water resources will continue to be a constraint on mineral development in Namibia, as will the availability of fuel and electric power. New investment to develop the country‚Äôs natural gas resources and harness the hydroelectric power potential, and the recently proposed (2006) introduction of nuclear-powered electricity- generating plants, will influence the future economic growth of Namibia. The expansion of regional transportation infrastructure in northern Namibia could see the Port of Walvis Bay become an alternative route for mineral exports from southeastern Angola, Botswana, and Zambia.

The method involved the drawing of lots (sortes) to obtain knowledge of future events: in many of the ancient Italian temples the will of the gods was consulted in this way, as at Praeneste and Caere.Regarding the meaning of sors see Cicero, De Divinatione ii. 41 These sortes or lots were usually little tablets or counters, made of wood or other materials, and were commonly thrown into a sitella or urn, filled with water. The lots were sometimes thrown like dice.Suetonius, Tiberius 14 The name of \\"sortes\\" was in fact given to anything used to determine chances,compare Cicero, De Divinatione i. 34 and was also applied to any verbal response of an oracle.Cicero, De Divinatione ii. 56 and Virgil, Aeneid iv. 346, 377 Various things were written upon the lots according to circumstances, as for instance the names of the persons using them. It seems to have been a favorite practice in later times to write the verses of illustrious poets upon little tablets, and to draw them out of the urn like other lots, the verses which a person thus obtained being supposed to be applicable to him (see Sortes Homerica and Sortes Virgilianae, lots created from verses of Homer and Virgil).Mentioned by Lampridius, Alex. Sever. 14 and Spartianus, Hadr. 2 In the Biblical account of the prophet Jonah, he is thrown into the sea and swallowed by the fish after the sailors on the ship cast lots to determine the guilty one who had brought about the storm.Jonah 1:7 It was also the practice to consult the poets in the same way as Muslims do the Koran and Hafiz, and many Christians the Bible, namely, by opening the book at random and applying the first passage that struck the eye to a person's own immediate circumstances.Augustine, Confessions iv. 3 This practice was very common among the early Christians, who substituted the Bible and the Psalter for Homer and Virgil. Many church councils repeatedly condemned these Sortes Sanctorum (sacred lots), as they were called.Edward Gibbon, The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, c. xxxviii. note 51 The Sibylline books were probably also consulted in this way. Those who foretold future events by lots were called Sortilegi.Lucan, ix. 581 The sortes convivales were sealed tablets, which were sold at entertainments, and upon being opened or unsealed entitled the purchaser to things of very unequal value. They were therefore a kind of lottery.Suetonius, Octav. 75 and Lampridius, Heliogab. 22 See also *Sortes Astrampsychi *Cleromancy *Bibliomancy *Rhapsodomancy References Category:Divination Category:Ancient Roman religion Category:Classical oracles ","title":"Sortes (ancient Rome)"},{"id":"17985409","title":"Da li ste pametniji od ƒëaka petaka?"},{"id":"17985442","text":"Cascabela thevetia (syn: Thevetia peruviana) is a poisonous plant native throughout Mexico and in Central America, and cultivated widely as an ornamental. It is a relative of Nerium oleander, giving it a common name yellow oleander, and is also called lucky nut in the West Indies. Description Cascabela thevetia is an evergreen tropical shrub or small tree. Its leaves are willow-like, linear-lanceolate, and glossy green in color. They are covered in waxy coating to reduce water loss (typical of oleanders). Its stem is green turning silver/gray as it ages. Flowers bloom from summer to fall. The long funnel-shaped sometimes-fragrant yellow (less commonly apricot, sometimes white) flowers are in few-flowered terminal clusters. Its fruit is deep red-black in color encasing a large seed that bears some resemblance to a 'Chinese lucky nut.' Cascabela thevetia is commonly known as Kaneir or Kaner (‡§ï‡§®‡•á‡§∞) in Hindi language in India. It is effectively drought resistant and tolerant to high temperatures, hence found in various states of India like Bihar, Delhi, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh where semi arid climate is prevalent. Religious importance Its bright yellow flowers are used for religious purposes, especially in the worshipping of the Hindu deity Shiva. Toxicity leftAll parts of the C. thevetia plant are toxic to most vertebrates as they contain cardiac glycosides. Many cases of intentional and accidental poisoning of humans are known. The main toxins are the cardenolides called thevetin A and thevetin B; others include peruvoside, neriifolin, thevetoxin and ruvoside. These cardenolides are not destroyed by drying or heating and they are very similar to digoxin from Digitalis purpurea. They produce gastric and cardiotoxic effects. Antidotes for treatment include atropine and digoxin immune fabs (antibodies) and treatment may include oral administration of activated charcoal. Ovine polyclonal anti-digitoxin Fab fragment antibody (DigiTAb; Therapeutic Antibodies Inc.) can be used to treat T. peruviana poisoning, but for many countries the cost is prohibitive. A few bird species are however known to feed on them without any ill effects. These include the sunbirds, Asian koel, red-whiskered bulbul, white-browed bulbul, red-vented bulbul, brahminy myna, common myna and common grey hornbill. In South India and in Sri Lanka swallowing the seeds of Thevetia peruviana (Kaneru ‡∂ö‡∂´‡∑ö‡∂ª‡∑î (Sinhala), Manjal arali(Tamil) ) is one of the preferred methods for suicides in villages where they are grown in abundance. Extracts from C. thevetia are reported to possess antispermatogenic activity in rats. Uses Trunk. ;Cultivation Cascabela thevetia is cultivated as an ornamental plant, and planted as large flowering shrub or small ornamental tree standards in gardens and parks in temperate climates. In frost prone areas it is container plant, in the winter season brought inside a greenhouse or as a house plant. It tolerates most soils and is drought tolerant. ;Biological pest control The plant's toxins have tested in experiments for uses in biological pest control. T. peruviana seed oil was used to make a 'paint' with antifungal, antibacterial and anti-termite properties. Etymology 'Cascabel', 'cascavel' or 'cascabela' is Spanish for a small bell, a snake's rattle or a rattlesnake itself. The allusion may also be to the plant's toxicity comparable to the venom of a rattlesnake.

It is part of biblical exegesis. Application According to ideas developed by the Church Fathers, the literal meaning, or God-intended meaning of the words of the Bible, may be either figurative or non-figurative; for instance, in the Song of Songs (also called Canticles or Song of Solomon), the inspired meaning is always figurative. The typical meaning is the inspired meaning of words referring to persons, things, and actions of the Old Testament which are inspired types of persons, things, and actions of the New Testament. The early uses of allegory and tropology were very close. Later a clearer distinction was made between the allegorical mystical, and tropological moral, styles of interpretation.Henri de Lubac, Medieval Exegesis vol. 2, The Four Senses of Scripture (2000 translation), Chapter 6. Literary critic Henry Louis Gates also defines tropological revision in relation to African-American literature, in his work The Signifying Monkey. Etymology The Ancient Greek word œÑœÅœåœÄŒøœÇ (tropos) meant 'turn, way, manner, style'. The term œÑœÅŒøœÄŒøŒªŒøŒ≥ŒØŒ± (tropologia) was coined from this word around the second century CE, in Hellenistic Greek, to mean 'allegorical interpretation of scripture' (and also, by the fourth century, 'figurative language' more generally).\\"Tropology, n.\\", \\"trope, n.\\", OED Online. The Greek word œÑœÅœåœÄŒøœÇ had already been borrowed into Classical Latin as tropus, meaning 'figure of speech', and the Latinised form of œÑœÅŒøœÄŒøŒªŒøŒ≥ŒØŒ±, tropologia, is found already in the fourth-century writing of Saint Jerome in the sense 'figurative language', and by the fifth century in sense 'moral interpretation'. This Latin term was adopted in medieval French as tropologie, and English developed the form tropology in the fifteenth century through the simultaneous influence of French and Latin.

Etruscan also explores in Burkina Faso for copper. CommoditiesGold= In 2012, there were 6 gold mines in Burkina Faso. Burkina Faso is the 3rd biggest site for gold exploration in Africa and 4th biggest gold producer in Africa. West African gold is not as high grade as gold from South Africa.https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/industry- news/energy-and-resources/iamgolds-growing-investment-in-burkina- faso/article2403056/ Cluff updated its bankable feasibility study for the Kalsaka gold project, which is located about 150 km northwest of the country‚Äôs capital, Ouagadougou. Measured resources were estimated to be 6.5 million metric tons (Mt) at a grade of 1.6 grams per metric ton (g/t) gold, and indicated resources were estimated to be 2.7 Mt at a grade of 1.2 g/t gold. Following the completion of the bankable feasibility study, the company decided to continue with the development of the project and to bring it into production. In October, Ghana-based Banlaw Africa Ltd. was appointed as the mining contractor. Cluff held a 78% interest in the project; the remaining was held by IMARB Ind√∫stria Metal√∫rgica of Brazil (12%) and the Government (10%). Etruscan continued with construction work activities at its 90% owned Youga gold property, which is located about 180 km southeast of Ouagadougou. Gold reserve estimates at the Youga Mine were reported to be 6.6 Mt at an average grade of 2.7 g/t gold. Commissioning of the mine was scheduled for mid-2007, and production was expected to be about 2,700 kilograms per year (kg/yr). As of November 30, 2006, the company had invested about $21.7 million in the project, had made purchase commitments of about $7 million for equipment and services, and had made additional purchase commitments of about $10.2 million for ongoing development activities. High River continued with the construction of the Taparko-Boroum open pit gold mine and mill facilities, which are located about 200 km northeast of Ouagadougou. The mine‚Äôs first gold pour was scheduled for the second quarter of 2007. Initial production was expected to be about 3,100 kg/yr and to reach about 4,400 kg/yr by 2008. Measured and indicated resources were estimated to be about 12.6 Mt of ore at a grade of 2.77 g/t gold. The Taparko-Boroum Mine and mill would be operated by High River‚Äôs subsidiary Soci√©t√© des Mines de Taparko (Somita S.A.). High River held a 90% interest in the project, and the government held the remaining 10%. In addition to Taparko-Boroum, High River held other exploration licenses in the country, including the 1,000-km2 Bissa Group permits, which are located about 80 km north of Ouagadougou. Measured and indicated resources for the Bissa Group were estimated to be about 12 Mt of ore at a grade of 1.72 g/t gold. The company invested about $2 million in exploration in 2006 and planned to invest an additional $8 million in 2007 to test identified target areas at the Bissa Group properties. Gold mining in Burkina Faso continues to grow rapidly, with more than fifteen major discoveries made since 2006. With this has come increasing amounts of merger and acquisition activity and more explorers flocking to the region. In 2017 junior mining company Nexus Gold began district-scale exploration of the Niangouela and Bouboulou gold concessions, which are located within the Boromo greenstone belt of north-central Burkina Faso. The belt is host to several active gold mines. A recent report from publication AllAfrica revealed that the recent boom in the country‚Äôs gold mining industry in the last three years has made the country one of Africa‚Äôs leading producers and also asserted that it was luring a whole generation into the sector for work. Children as young as six were reported to have left school in order to work in the mines ‚Äì mainly artisanal ones where they crush stones, sieve dust and transport water around the site. Children are even visiting mines on their days off from school, influenced by their parents who have made money there. AllAfrica, \\"Burkina Faso: Gold Rush Hits Education\\", AllAfrica (30 August 2012) According to the Ministry of Finance, gold has become the top export commodity. In 2011, it earned Burkina Faso 127 billion CFA (US$247 million). Between 2007 and 2011, it brought in 440 billion CFA, accounting for 64.7 percent of all exports and 8 percent of GDP. Production rose from 23 tonnes in 2010 to 32 tonnes in 2011. Gold mines are spread across the country's northern, western, southwestern and central regions. Burkina Faso's gold industry employs slave laborers and does not spare children. In 2013, the U.S. Department of Labor reported that gold mining becoming an even more fruitful industry, it has resulted in \\"an increased number of children working in gold mines and thousands of students leaving school.\\"2013 Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labor -Burkina Faso A December 2014 report further corroborates the fact that child labor and forced labor are common practices in Burkina Faso's mining industry. The mentioned DOL report contains a List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor and Burkina Faso is listed among 74 other countries where such labor conditions have been observed.List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor =Zinc= Aim Resources Ltd. (AIM) of Australia continued with the development of the Perkoa zinc deposit, which is located about 120 km west of Ouagadougou. In December 2005, Snowden Mining Industry Consultants completed a bankable feasibility study for Perkoa. Production was expected to be about 130,000 t/yr of concentrate at a grade of 53% zinc. Overall zinc recovery to concentrate was projected to be 93%, and contained zinc production, to average 68,000 t/yr; zinc concentrates would be transported by railway to the port of Abidjan in C√¥te d‚ÄôIvoire and by road to the port of Tema in Ghana. The first shipment of zinc concentrate was expected to be delivered in 2008. In its 2006 annual report, AIM announced that it had signed letters of intent with Louis Dreyfus Commodities Metals Suisse S.A., Votorantim Metais of Brazil, and Switzerland-based Xstrata plc to finalize offtake agreements for the production of zinc concentrates from Perkoa. Xstrata planned to process Perkoa concentrates through either the San Juan de Nieva zinc smelter in Spain or the Nordenham zinc smelter in Germany. According to AIM company reports, the government had upgraded the road that leads to the mine and had constructed a dam that would provide water for the project. As of yearend, measured and indicated mineral resources at Perkoa were estimated to be 6.72 Mt at grades of 16.4% zinc and 35.4 g/t silver at a 5% zinc cutoff grade. In February 2006, Semafo awarded the engineering, procurement, and construction contract for the development of the Mana gold mine to Genviar Consulting Group Inc. According to the company‚Äôs 2006 annual report, measured resources were estimated to be about 2.1 Mt at a grade of 1.99 g/t gold and indicated resources were estimated to be 2.5 Mt at a grade of 2.03 g/t gold. Average production, which was expected to begin in late 2007, was estimated to be about 3,900 kg/yr of gold for the first 3 years and about 3,000 kg/yr for the remaining life of the mine. The company approved a $3.5 million budget for the project for 2007.

Production Mineral production was limited to clay and volcanic rock; potential exists, however, for the development of the country‚Äôs petroleum industry. All other mineral product requirements were imported. CommoditiesPetroleum= Indications of the existence of hydrocarbons in S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe were first noted in 1974, but attempts by the Portuguese Colonial Administration to sign a concession agreement with Ball & Collins North Sea consortium (a predecessor of Premier Oil of the United Kingdom) were abandoned following the country‚Äôs declaration of independence in 1975. Other attempts to start petroleum exploration during the late 1980s and 1990s also failed. In 2003, Nigeria (60%) and S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe (40%) agreed to jointly operate an overlapping maritime boundary located about 200 km offshore Nigeria known as the Joint Development Zone (JDZ). Activities in the JDZ were to be overseen by the Joint Development Authority (JDADA). The JDZ was divided into nine blocks, and a licensing round was opened for bids in 2004, which resulted in the award of Block 1 to a consortium made up of Chevron Corporation of the United States (51%), Esso Exploration and Production Nigeria-Sao Tome (One) Ltd. (40%), and Dangote Energy Equity Resources Ltd. (a joint-venture of the Dangote Group of Nigeria and Energy Equity Resources AS of Norway) (9%). The consortium signed a production-sharing agreement with the JDADA in 2005 and, in January 2006, began drilling activities within the block. In May 2006, the consortium announced that it had encountered hydrocarbons in the Obo-1 exploration well in Block 1 and that it was in the process of evaluating reservoir rock and liquid samples to determine the next step of the appraisal process. Block 1 is located about 300 km north of S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe and about 200 km south of the city of Port Harcourt in Nigeria. Asecond licensing round for Blocks 2 through 6 was opened for bids in 2005. Energy Inc. of the United States (ERHC) won the rights to these blocks and, in March 2006, the company signed a series of production-sharing agreements with the JDADA and several petroleum and gas companies, among which were Addax Energy Nigeria Limited, Addax Petroleum (Nigeria offshore 2) Limited, Addax Petroleum Resources Nigeria Limited, Sinopec International Petroleum Exploration and Production Corporation Nigeria, and several other petroleum and gas companies whose names were not disclosed. Following inquires by the Petroleum Affairs Commission, the National Petroleum Council recognized deficiencies in the awarding process and ordered a formal investigation. The Attorney General, after concluding that the procedures used in selecting petroleum companies was flawed, recommended a restructuring of the procedures for future bidding rounds that would conform to international standards. The Attorney General‚Äôs report also called for the reexamination of ERHC‚Äôs preferential rights for Blocks 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 within the JDZ. Since 2006, there has been no word on any of the reexamination of ERHC's preferential rights and the countries of Sao Tome and Nigeria are moving forward with the exploration of the JDZ for oil. In or about July 2009 there are scheduled two oil rigs to start exploration and drilling of petroleum reserves within blocks 2-4 and ERHC is predominant in these blocks. With the possible acquisition of Addax Petroleum by Sinopec, and with the reports of Sinopec looking into acquiring ERHC, it is looking more like Sinopec will be the mainstay of the JDZ for Sao Tome and Nigeria in this area.

It used the same vehicles, employees and maintenance facilities previously used by PTC, which technically was its owner, making the transition relatively simple. The new company was initially given only a 60-day revocable franchise by the city, which was later extended by 30 days, while details of a long-term agreement were still being worked out.\\"Two-Year Permit Asked To Assure City Transit\\".

Electric transit Rose City Transit never operated any streetcar service, but its parent, the Portland Traction Company, continued to operate streetcars on its two interurban lines, from Portland to Bellrose (at SE 136th Avenue north of Foster Road, on what is now the Springwater Corridor trail) and Oregon City after the urban transit lines were transferred from PTC to RCT. These operated until January 25, 1958, but service was then abruptly abandoned and PTC retained only its freight service.David, Ken (January 26, 1958). \\"PTC Halts Oregon City Trolleys: Company Surprises Customers; Firm Abandons Passenger Run After Sundown\\". The Sunday Oregonian, p. 1. The last three city streetcar lines had closed on February 26, 1950, six years before the city transit system was transferred to Rose City. =Trolley bus service= RCT did operate electric trolley bus service, albeit for less than three years. The city's first trolley bus line was opened by Portland Traction on August 30, 1936, and by 1937 Portland had one of the largest trolley bus systems in the country, with seven routes and a fleet of 120 \\"trolley coaches\\" ‚Äì the common name for this mode at that time ‚Äì built by Mack Trucks. Six trolley bus routes were still intact when RCT took over all of PTC's bus lines in 1956, and these continued under RCT operation, but the Eastmoreland and Sellwood routes were electric only until the end of 1956. Rose City attempted to discontinue permanently all trolley bus service in January 1958, in part to eliminate the regulatory control of the state Public Utility Commission (PUC), which had some authority over operating franchises involving streetcars and trolley buses, but not of companies that operated only motor buses.Spagna, George (January 29, 1958). \\"Fare Raise Issue Gets New Life\\". The Oregonian, p. 1.Spagna, George (January 30, 1958). \\"State Pulls to Sidelines in 25¬¢-Bus-Fare Fight\\". The Oregonian, p. 1. RCT replaced all remaining electric buses with diesel- or gasoline-powered buses on January 29, 1958, on what had been the last four trolley bus routes: Interstate Avenue, Mississippi, Sandy Blvd. and St. Johns. However, the company soon discovered it did not have enough serviceable motor buses to be able reliably to maintain the scheduled service. Trolley bus service resumed on all four routes after only one month, on February 25, 1958, but the reprieve for electric transit lasted only a few months. The company again discontinued all remaining trolley bus service on October 23, 1958, in the late morning, when 16 of the remaining 31 active trolley buses were taken off their routes and driven back to the garage.Spagna, George (October 24, 1958). \\"Coaches Off Ere Council Able to Act\\". The Oregonian, p. 1. The city council was upset with the move, but back on January 29 it had passed an emergency ordinance giving RCT the authority to abandon its trolley coach service during a dispute over a requested fare increase, a move the council made so as to keep the state's PUC from asserting jurisdictional control.Spagna, George (October 23, 1958). \\"Bus Crisis Expected By Bowes: RCT Said Ready to Cut Trolleys\\". The Oregonian, p. 1. On October 22, Portland Commissioner William Bowes filed an emergency ordinance to repeal the earlier ordinance and stop RCT from abandoning its trolley service, but the company began dismantling key parts of the overhead wires the day after service ended; the new council ordinance never came to a vote. RCT offered few details for its action, but told city officials that it was \\"necessitated\\" by an impending problem with federal taxes. New buses Tri-Met's first color scheme, was the last bus purchased by Rose City Transit. It and others of its type passed to Tri-Met in 1969, and the last examples were in service until 1985. During its first few years, RCT's bus fleet was rather old. As of 1958, some buses over 20 years old were still in service, and the youngest buses in the fleet dated from 1951,Penny, Herb (January 26, 1958). \\"Fiscal Woes Dot Transit History From Start\\". The Sunday Oregonian, pp. 34‚Äì35. when 27 buses had been purchased. The company made its first purchase of new buses in 1961, but of only five vehicles, 35-foot General Motors \\"New Look\\"-type buses. At that time, the active fleet comprised 202 buses, and 182 were scheduled to be in service each day in peak periods. When the city council granted RCT a 10-year operating franchise in 1962, one stipulation was that the company had to purchase at least 70 new buses within five years.\\"Council Approves 10-Year Rose City Transit Franchise Proposal\\". (July 20, 1962). The Oregonian, p. 14. The company complied, proceeding to purchase another 70 buses of the same type, delivered in four batches between 1963 and 1966. These 75 buses (numbered 501‚Äì575) were the only new buses RCT ever bought. The paint scheme of Rose City's buses was red and cream, originally a bright red as used in pre-RCT days by the Portland Traction Company, but later changed to a darker red.

Providing mass transit service was increasingly an unprofitable business during the post-World War II period, when private car ownership in the U.S. was growing rapidly. Portland transit ridership declined steadily every year,Hill, James (December 13, 1968). \\"Decision To Take Over Buses Follows History Of Woes\\". The Oregonian, section 1, p. 46. and several of RCT's requests for permission to raise fares were turned down by the city council. Numerous times over the years, RCT and the council argued about fares and service issues. Tensions between the two at times prompted calls for the transit system to be municipalized, as had already happened in several other West Coast cities, including San Francisco and Seattle.Holm, Don (January 9, 1962). \\"Bus System You Get Depends On How Much You Want To Pay\\" (last in a series of seven articles). The Oregonian, p. 16. At the beginning of 1962, Portland and San Diego were the only two major West Coast cities whose transit systems were still privately owned. Proposition 55, on the May 1962 municipal ballot, would have issued $6.5 million in general-obligation bonds and established a 10-year tax levy to cover RCT's $300,000 annual operating deficit, created a new city Transit Commission, and given the city authority to take over the transit system if a majority of council approved.Holm, Don (May 6, 1962). \\"City Bus Bill Due May Vote\\".

Transition to public ownership By 1968 Rose City Transit Company was nearly bankrupt. It sought council permission for another fare increase (to 40 cents) and threatened to discontinue all service if this was not approved. On December 12, 1968, the city council declined to vote on the request and instead voted unanimously to revoke RCT's franchise, effective in six months, and to plan for the city to take over the transit system after that period.\\"City To Take Over RCT Operation\\". (December 13, 1968). The Oregonian, p. 1. Commissioner William Bowes explained that it was felt the long trend of ever-increasing fares and declining patronage seen under private ownership was not sustainable, and that it was in the public interest for the transit system to be municipalized.

The city and RCT were far apart on a purchase price for RCT's buses, and negotiations were not bringing them significantly closer. On November 19, RCT President Charles C. Bowen offered to allow the city to take immediate possession of the transit system if they agreed to continue the current litigation and abide by whatever the courts ultimately decided, on both the question of whether the franchise termination had been legal and on determining the fair value of the assets involved, for compensation to RCT and Landport Inc. (A third lawsuit was also in process, to determine whether RCT would be required to pay retirement pensions of its retired employees.) After additional negotiations, an agreement for the city to take possession of the system ‚Äì and immediately transfer it to Tri-Met ‚Äì was approved by the city council on November 28, only a little more than 48 hours before a strike had been scheduled to take place and shut down the system.Hill, James (November 29, 1969). \\"Council Passes Agreement; Strike Averted\\" (subheadline: \\"Tri-Met To Assume Operations; Spokesmen Plan New Vehicles\\"). The Oregonian, p. 1. Tri- Met took over operation of the entire Rose City Transit system on December 1, 1969, using the same buses and workers and serving the same routes.

It is also classified as a pixel-based image segmentation method since it involves the selection of initial seed points. This approach to segmentation examines neighboring pixels of initial seed points and determines whether the pixel neighbors should be added to the region. The process is iterated on, in the same manner as general data clustering algorithms. A general discussion of the region growing algorithm is described below. Region-based segmentation The main goal of segmentation is to partition an image into regions. Some segmentation methods such as thresholding achieve this goal by looking for the boundaries between regions based on discontinuities in grayscale or color properties. Region-based segmentation is a technique for determining the region directly. The basic formulation is: :(a)\\\\text\\\\bigcup_{i=1}^{n}{R_{i}=R.} : (b)\\\\text{ }R_{i}\\\\text{ is a connected region},\\\\text{ i}=\\\\text{1},\\\\text{ 2},\\\\text{ }...,\\\\text{n} :(c)\\\\text{ }R_{i}\\\\bigcap R_{j}=\\\\varnothing, i eq j : (d)\\\\text{ }P(R_{i})=\\\\mathrm{TRUE}\\\\text{ for }i=1,2,...,n. : (e)\\\\text{ }P(R_{i}\\\\bigcup R_{j})=\\\\mathrm{FALSE}\\\\text{ for any adjacent region }R_{i}\\\\text{ and }R_{j}. : P(R_{i}) is a logical predicate defined over the points in set R_{i} and \\\\varnothing is the null set. (a) means that the segmentation must be complete; that is, every pixel must be in a region. (b) requires that points in a region must be connected in some predefined sense. (c) indicates that the regions must be disjoint. (d) deals with the properties that must be satisfied by the pixels in a segmented region. For example, P(R_{i})=\\\\text{TRUE} if all pixels in R_{i} have the same grayscale. (e) indicates that region R_{i} and R_{j} are different in the sense of predicate P. Basic concept of seed points The first step in region growing is to select a set of seed points. Seed point selection is based on some user criterion (for example, pixels in a certain grayscale range, pixels evenly spaced on a grid, etc.). The initial region begins as the exact location of these seeds. The regions are then grown from these seed points to adjacent points depending on a region membership criterion. The criterion could be, for example, pixel intensity, grayscale texture, or color. Since the regions are grown on the basis of the criterion, the image information itself is important. For example, if the criterion were a pixel intensity threshold value, knowledge of the histogram of the image would be of use, as one could use it to determine a suitable threshold value for the region membership criterion. There is a very simple example followed below. Here we use 4-connected neighborhood to grow from the seed points. We can also choose 8-connected neighborhood for our pixels adjacent relationship. And the criteria we make here is the same pixel value. That is, we keep examining the adjacent pixels of seed points. If they have the same intensity value with the seed points, we classify them into the seed points. It is an iterated process until there are no change in two successive iterative stages. Of course, we can make other criteria, but the main goal is to classify the similarity of the image into regions. Some important issues Figure 0. The histogram of Figure 1 Figure 2. The seed points: 255~255 Figure 3. Threshold: 225~255 Figure 4. Threshold: 190~255 Figure 5. Threshold: 155~255 Then we can conclude several important issues about region growingÔºö 1.The suitable selection of seed points is important. The selection of seed points is depending on the users. For example, in a grayscale lightning image, we may want to segment the lightning from the background. Then probably, we can examine the histogram and choose the seed points from the highest range of it. 2.More information of the image is better. Obviously, the connectivity or pixel adjacent information is helpful for us to determine the threshold and seed points. 3.The value, ‚Äúminimum area threshold‚Äù. No region in region growing method result will be smaller than this threshold in the segmented image. 4.The value, ‚ÄúSimilarity threshold value‚Äú. If the difference of pixel- value or the difference value of average grayscale of a set of pixels less than ‚ÄúSimilarity threshold value‚Äù, the regions will be considered as a same region. The criteria of similarities or so called homogeneity we choose are also important. It usually depends on the original image and the segmentation result we want. Some criteria often used are grayscale (average intensity or variance), color, and texture or shape. Simulation examples Here we show a simple example for region growing. Figure 1 is the original image which is a grayscale lightning image. The grayscale value of this image is from 0 to 255. The reason we apply region growing on this image is that we want to mark the strongest lightning part of the image and we also want the result to be connected without being split apart. Therefore, we choose the points having the highest grayscale value which is 255 as the seed points shown in the Figure 2. After determining the seed points, we have to determine the range of threshold. Always keep in mind that the objective is to mark the strongest light in the image. The third figure is the region growing result from choosing the threshold between 225 and the value of seed points (which is 255). Hence we only mark out the points whose grayscale values are above 225. If we make the range of threshold wider, we will get a result having a bigger area of the lightning region shown as the Figure 4 and the Figure 5. We can observe the difference between the last two figures which have different threshold values. Region growing provides the ability for us to separate the part we want connected. As we can see in Figure 3 to Figure 5, the segmented results in this example are seed-oriented connected. That means the result grew from the same seed points are the same regions. And the points will not be grown without being connected with the seed points. Therefore, there are still many points in the original image having the grayscale values above 155 which are not marked in Figure 5. This characteristic ensures the reliability of the segmentation and provides the ability to resist noise. For this example, this characteristic prevents us marking out the non-lightning part in the image because the lightning is always connected as one part. The advantages and disadvantages of region growing We briefly conclude the advantages and disadvantages of region growing. Advantages of Region growing methodsÔºö # can correctly separate the regions that have the same properties we define. # can provide the original images which have clear edges with good segmentation results. # simple concept: only need a small number of seed points to represent the property we want, then grow the region. # can determine the seed points and the criteria we want to make. # can choose the multiple criteria at the same time. # theoretical very efficient due to visiting each pixel by a limited bound of times. DisadvantagesÔºö # local method with no global view of the problem. # sensitive to noise. # unless image has had a threshold function applied, a continuous path of points related to color may exist, which connects any two points in the image. # practically random memory access slows down the algorithm, so adaption might be needed See also * k-means clustering * Watershed (image processing) NotesReferences * Jian-Jiun Ding, The class of \\"Time-Frequency Analysis and Wavelet Transform\\", the Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University (NTU), Taipei, Taiwan, 2007. * Jian-Jiun Ding, The class of \\"Advanced Digital Signal Processing\\", the Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University (NTU), Taipei, Taiwan, 2008. * W.

Some of the major European style from Roman to Postmodern are demonstrated, including renowned examples of Ra≈°ka, Serbo-Byzantine with its revival, Morava, Baroque, Classical and Modern architecture, with prime examples in Brutalism and Streamline Moderne. Centuries of turbulent history of Serbia caused a great regional diversity and favored vernacular architecture. This made for a heterogeneous and diverse architectural style, with architecture differing from town to town. While this diversity may still be witnessed in small towns, the devastation of architectural heritage in the larger cities during World War II, and subsequent socialist influence on architecture resulted in specific mix of architectural styles. Prehistory and antiquity Sirmium was proclaimed one of four capitals of the Roman Empire and it was also the capital of the Praetorian prefecture of Illyricum and of Pannonia Secunda. The northernmost Ancient Macedonian town was Kale-Kr≈°evica, which still today have the foundations of the Ancient Greek 5th century BC town. The Scordisci built the stone fortress of Singidunum, the Kalemegdan at Belgrade in the 3rd century BC, It has since been built on by Romans, Serbs, Turks, Austrians and show an example of continuing 2,300-year-old architecture, serving as one of the best landmarks in Belgrade. The Romans left many traces of their six centuries of rule in the Serbian lands, including several fortifications and complexes such as the 3rd century AD Imperial palace of Galerius at Gamzigrad (Felix Romuliana) that was built at his birthplace after the victory against the Persians, the Mediana site in Ni≈° (Naissus) from the 4th century, the ruins of the Moesia Superior capital Viminacium, former Roman capital and birthplace of several Roman Emperors Sirmium, and Byzantine city Justiniana Prima built by Justinian I, which was the seat of the Archbishopric of Justiniana Prima. Medieval period Prohor Pƒçinjski Monastery was founded 1067‚Äì1071 by the Byzantine emperor Romanus IV in honor of Saint Prohor of Pƒçinja. ;Schools of architecture *Ra≈°ka architectural school *Morava architectural school *Vardar architectural school = Early Church architecture = The ƒêurƒëevi stupovi monastery, near Novi Pazar (1166), UNESCO World Heritage Site Church of the Holy Apostles Peter and Paul is one of the few remaining building from early Middle Ages and UNESCO World Cultural Heritage site. Prohor Pƒçinjski Monastery was founded 1067‚Äì1071 by the Byzantine emperor Romanus IV in honor of Saint Prohor of Pƒçinja. Church architecture mostly developed under the patronage of the Serbian state. The most distinctive piece of medieval Serbian architecture was the Studenica monastery founded by Stefan Nemanja, the founder of medieval Serbia in c. 1190. This monastery also featured significant works of art including its Byzantine style fresco paintings. Its church also features extensive sculptures based on Psalms and the Dormition of the Theotokos. UNESCO added this monastery to its list of World Cultural Heritage sites in 1986. It was the model for other monasteries at Mile≈°eva, Sopoƒáani and the Visoki Deƒçani. The influence of Byzantine art became more influential after the capture of Constantinople in 1204 in the Fourth Crusade when many Greek artists fled to Serbia. Their influence can be seen at the Church of the Ascension at Mile≈°eva as well as in the wall paintings at the Church of the Holy Apostles at Peƒá and at the Sopoƒáani Monastery. Icons also formed a significant part of church art. The influence of Byzantine architecture reached its peak after 1300 including the rebuilding of the Our Lady of Ljevi≈° (c1306-1307) and Church of St. George at Staro Nagoriƒçane as well as the Graƒçanica monastery. Church decorative paintings also developed further in the period. The Visoki Deƒçani monastery in Metohija was built between 1330 and 1350. Unlike other Serbian monasteries of the period, it was built with Romanesque features by master-builders under the monk Vitus of Kotor. Its frescoes feature 1000 portraits portraying all of the major themes of the New Testament. The cathedral features iconostasis, hegumen's throne and carved royal sarcophagus. In 2004, UNESCO listed the Deƒçani Monastery on the World Heritage List. There was a further spate of church building as the Serbian state contracted to the Morava basin in the late 14th century. Prince Stefan Lazareviƒá was a poet and patron of the arts who founded the church at Resava at Morava with the wall paintings having a theme of parables of Christ with the people portrayed wearing feudal Serbian costumes. ;Ecclesiastical monuments *Petrova church, 800 AD, Stari Ras *ƒêurƒëevi stupovi, 1166, Novi Pazar *Our Lady of Ljevi≈°, 12th century, Prizren *Studenica monastery, 1190, Kraljevo *Patriarchate of Peƒá, 13th century, Peƒá *Sopoƒáani monastery, 1265, Stari Ras *Mile≈°eva monastery, 1236, Prijepolje *Visoki Deƒçani, 1327, Deƒçani *Graƒçanica Monastery, 1321, Graƒçanica is an example of the Serbo-Byzantine Style (UNESCO World Heritage Site) *Saint Archangels Monastery, 1343, Prizren File:–°—Ç—É–¥–µ–Ω–∏—Ü–∞.jpgStudenica monastery (1196), an example of unique medieval Serbian architecture, UNESCO World Heritage Site File:Manastir ≈Ωiƒça.jpg≈Ωiƒça Monastery (1207-1217), the coronational site of the Serbian kings File:Patrikana e Pej√´s.jpgThe Patriarchate of Peƒá is the historical residence of Serbian Archbishops, UNESCO World Heritage Site File:Manastir Visoki Deƒçani (–ú–∞–Ω–∞—Å—Ç–∏—Ä –í–∏—Å–æ–∫–∏ –î–µ—á–∞–Ω–∏) - by Pudelek..jpgSerbian Orthodox Visoki Deƒçani monastersy, built in the 14th century, UNESCO World Heritage Site File:Gracanica_1.jpgSerbian Orthodox Graƒçanica monastery, built in the 14th century, UNESCO World Heritage Site =Serbo-Byzantine style= This is an ecclesiastical architectural style that flourished in the Serbian Late Middle Ages, which was developed through fusing contemporary Byzantine architecture with Raskan influences to form a new style. By the end of 13th and in the first half of 14th century the Serbian state enlarged over Macedonia, Epirus and Thessaly up to the Aegean Sea. On these new territories Serbian art was even more influenced by the Byzantine art tradition. Graƒçanica, which was entirely rebuilt by King Milutin in 1321, is the most beautiful monument of Serbian architecture from the 14th century. The church of this monastery is an example of a construction that achieved the highest degree of architecture not only in the Byzantine form but in the creation of an original and freestyle exceeding its models. The wall creation in steps is one of the basic characteristics of this temple. The Kings's Church in Studenica, characterized as an ideal church, was built in the first decades of the 14th century. By the end of the third decade of the 14th century the Patriarchate of Peƒá had finally been shaped. The exterior of the Patriarchate is a vision of shapes characteristic of contemporary Serbian architecture. On the major part of the outer walls paint decoration was used instead of stone relief and brick and stone decoration. A typical Serbo- Byzantine church has a rectangular foundation, with a major dome in the center with smaller domes around the center one. The inside of the church is covered with frescos that illustrate various biblical stories and portrays Serbian saints. = Ottoman architecture in Serbia = The territory of what is now the Republic of Serbia was part of the Ottoman Empire throughout the Early Modern period, especially Central Serbia, unlike Vojvodina which has passed to Habsburg rule starting from the end of the 17th century (with several takeovers of Central Serbia as well). Ottoman culture significantly influenced the region, in architecture, cuisine, language, and dress, especially in arts, and Islam.

The churches usually had a bell tower, and a single nave building with the iconostasis inside the church covered with Renaissance-style paintings. These churches can mostly be found in Zemun and Vojvodina province. During the short-lived Austrian rule over Belgrade, a Baroque quarter was built, with a square and several monumental buildings. After the reconquest of city by Ottoman Turks, all Baroque buildings were demolished. = Serbo- Byzantine Revival = The XIX century was a time of development of Serbian nationalism, which sought to develop a \\"national style\\" in architecture too, in line with national romanticism ideas. Within the broader movement of historicism, in parallel to neoclassical architecture, Serbia saw the development in particular of a Byzantine Revival architecture style. Other types of historicisms have had less of an impact in Serbia, though there are some examples of Gothic Revival architecture such as the Kapetanovo castle from 1904. Serbia's modern sacral architecture got its main impetus from the dynastic burial church in Oplenac which was commissioned by member of the Karaƒëorƒëeviƒá dynasty in 1909.Aleksandar Kadijeviƒá: Byzantine architecture as inspiration for serbian new age architects.

Their main contribution were Beli dvor, the Church of Saint Sava, St. Mark's Church, Belgrade.

Following governmental centralization after the 1918 creation of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, this initial bottom-up enthusiasm began to fade. Yugoslav architecture became more dictated by an increasingly concentrated state authority which sought to establish a unified state identity. Beginning the 1920s, Yugoslav architects began to advocate for architectural modernism, viewing the style as the logical extension of progressive national narratives. The Group of Architects of the Modern Movement, an organization founded in 1928 by architects Branislav Kojiƒá, Milan Zlokoviƒá, Jan Dubovy, and Du≈°an Babiƒá pushed for the widespread adoption of modern architecture as the \\"national\\" style of Yugoslavia to transcended regional differences. Despite these shifts, differing relationships to the west made the adoption of modernism inconsistent in Yugoslavia WWII. Of all Yugoslavian cities, Belgrade has the highest concentration of modernist structures. Air Force Command by Dragi≈°a Bra≈°ovan is one of the biggest interwar modernist buildings in Belgrade.  Socialist Yugoslav period  Socialist realist Dom Sindikata in Belgrade (1947), by Branko Petriƒçiƒá Modernist Palace of Serbia (1950) by Potoƒçnjak and Jankoviƒá The architecture of Yugoslavia was characterized by emerging, unique, and often differing national and regional narratives. As a socialist state remaining free from the Iron Curtain, Yugoslavia adopted a hybrid identity that combined the architectural, cultural, and political leanings of both Western liberal democracy and Soviet communism. = Socialist realism (1945‚Äì48) = Immediately following the Second World War, Yugoslavia's brief association with the Eastern Bloc ushered in a short period of socialist realism. Centralization within the communist model led to the abolishment of private architectural practices and the state control of the profession. During this period, the governing Communist Party condemned modernism as \\"bourgeois formalism,\\" a move that caused friction among the nation's pre-war modernist architectural elite. * Dom Sindikata, 1947 = Modernism (1948‚Äì92) = Socialist realist architecture in Yugoslavia came to an abrupt end with Josip Broz Tito's 1948 split with Stalin. In the following years the nation turned increasingly to the West, returning to the modernism that had characterized pre-war Yugoslav architecture. During this era, modernist architecture came to symbolize the nation's break from the USSR (a notion that later diminished with growing acceptability of modernism in the Eastern Bloc). The nation's postwar return to modernism is perhaps best exemplified in Vjenceslav Richter's widely acclaimed 1958 Yugoslavia Pavilion at Expo 58, the open and light nature of which contrasted the much heavier architecture of the Soviet Union. A number of architects from Serbia made important modernistic buildings across Africa and Middle East. Architect Mihajllo Mitroviƒá was one of the several notable authors from the period. He is best known for modernistic buildings inspired by Art-Nouveau and Western City Gate.

Besides numerous brutalist buildings in the capital, other notable examples can be found Po≈æarevac, Arilje, U≈æice, Sremska Mitrovica and other parts of the country. * Museum of Yugoslavia (1962) by Mihajlo Jankoviƒá *Novi Beograd town hall (1967) by Stojan Maksimovic and Branislav Jovin * Toblerone building (1963) by Rista ≈†ekerinski * 25 May Sportcenter (1975) by Ivan Antiƒá * Belgrade's Eastern City Gate (1976) by Vera ƒÜirkoviƒá * Belgrade's Western City Gate (1977) by Mihajlo Mitroviƒá * Sava Centar (1979) by Stojan Maksimoviƒá * Blocks 22, 23, 28, 30, 61, 62, 63, New Belgrade = Decentralization = With 1950s decentralization and liberalization policies in SFR Yugoslavia, architecture became increasingly fractured along ethnic lines. Architects increasingly focused on building with reference to the architectural heritage of their individual socialist republics in the form of critical regionalism. Growing distinction of individual ethnic architectural identities within Yugoslavia was exacerbated with the 1972 decentralization of the formerly centralized historical preservation authority, providing individual regions further opportunity to critically analyze their own cultural narratives.  Contemporary period  The international style, which had arrived in Yugoslavia already in the 1980s, took over the scene in Belgrade after the wars and isolation of the 1990s. Big real estate projects, including Sava City and the redevelopment of the U≈°ƒáe Towers, led the ground, with little respect for the local architecturale heritage. Before and also after the Yugoslav wars numerous architects left Serbia and continued their work in a number of European, American and African countries, creating several hundreds of building. In 2015, an agreement was reached with Eagle Hills (a UAE company) on the Belgrade Waterfront (Beograd na vodi) deal, for the construction of a new part of the city on currently undeveloped wasteland by the riverside. This project, officially started in 2015 and is one of the largest urban development projects in Europe, will cost at least 3.5 billion euros.

History In October 1973, corporate websites claim, Manuel L. Polo began investigating the effects of different metals on humans, believing that some metals offered a benefit when worn. This led directly to his creation of the Bio-Ray (Biomagnetic Regulator), the first ionized bracelet.Bio Ray In 1994, Andrew Park bought a Bio-Ray bracelet while visiting Barcelona, Spain. Believing that it had reduced his lower back pain, he was inspired to found QT Inc., which began manufacturing and selling Q-Ray bracelets in the United States by 1996. =Marketing claims= Western interest in the Q-Ray Ionized Bracelet rose as a result of an infomercial campaign by QT Inc. which ran from August 2000 through June 11, 2003.A Q-Ray timeline CBC Marketplace 14 November 2007 During this time many marketing claims were made regarding the product's alleged effectiveness, most notably regarding relief from pain and arthritis due to manipulation of a body's chi.

Criticism Ionized jewelry such as Q-Ray has been heavily criticized based on multiple factors. =Cost= There are currently 35 different available Q-Ray models on their website, including their Deluxe Series, Titanium Series, and other Special Edition bracelets. Despite the company disclosing in a FAQ response that the differences between the models are only cosmetic, the prices range from $59.95-$349.95 (CAD) per bracelet. The company also recommends users to replace their Q-Ray every 2 years. Many customer reviews have described themselves as repeat customers ordering multiple bracelets over time. =Pseudoscientific theory= Alternative health bracelets such as ionized jewelry are currently characterized as pseudoscience. Q-Ray's theory is grounded in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and pose similar benefits to acupuncture, another practice designed to balance the flow of qi and controversial in scientific communities in regard to its efficacy. Their website claims to optimize your natural positive energy and restore balance. No scientific research supporting these claims are referenced anywhere on their website or store. Instead, they advertise and rely heavily on testimonials as anecdotal evidence. No currently available research from third parties have verified their claims either. =Research= A placebo controlled randomized trial study published in the journal Mayo Clinic Proceedings compared the effect of ionized bracelet produced by Q-ray to an identically appearing placebo bracelet. The study found no difference between the ionized bracelet and control with respect to musculoskeletal pain, suggesting the effects of Q-ray bracelet was due to the placebo effect.

Built on parkland beside the River Tawe in the upper Swansea Valley, it is located on the southeastern edge of the Black Mountain. The castle, formerly owned by opera singer Adelina Patti, is now a boutique hotel, catering, conferencing and entertainment venue. Adjoining the castle are its landscaped grounds which now serve as a country park, managed separately by the Brecon Beacons National Park Authority. HistoryEarly history= Powell family The main building was built between 1841 and 1843 by Captain Rice Davies Powell, who became a county magistrate and a High Sheriff of Brecknock. It was said that his family were cursed thanks to their bloodline relationship with the Dutch Overbeek family of Calcutta and Cape Town, who Captain Powell had diddled out of an inheritance (see Dundee Evening Telegraph ‚Äì Saturday 25 May 1901, page 3, column 5), with cholera taking his younger son in 1851, and the deaths of his wife and younger daughter before he died in 1862. In 1864 his eldest son was killed in a hunting accident on the Isle of Wight. This resulted in eldest daughter Sarah's inheriting the estate, and she moved in with her husband Captain Allaway. After Allaway died in 1875, Sarah moved to Tenby, before the property was sold in 1876. Morgan Morgan After the estate entered into the trust of the Chancery, it was bought by Morgan Morgan of Abercrave for ¬£6,000 in 1876. Mr Morgan and his family, plus his son also called Morgan Morgan and his family, lived jointly in the castle for several years. The family cleared a large plantation of 80-year-old fir trees which stood between the castle and the quarries above, which were said to be home to a local population of red squirrels. =Adelina Patti= Adelina Patti Adelina Patti purchased the castle and surrounding park land for ¬£3500 in 1878, to develop it as her own private estate. The prima donna had reached the soaring heights of a spectacular career. She spent the rest of her life at Craig-y-nos, leaving it only to sing in the premier opera houses of Europe and to tour the United States, captivating the world with her flawless soprano voice. After her second marriage, to French tenor Ernesto Nicolini, she embarked on a major building programme at the castle, adding the North and South wings, the clock tower, conservatory, winter garden and theatre. After making her last public appearance in October 1914, when she sang for the Red Cross and filled the Albert Hall, she spent the rest of her life at Craig-y-nos with her third husband and a devoted staff. Adelina Patti Theatre The Adelina Patti Theatre is a Grade I listed opera house. Built to be Patti's own private auditorium, it was designed by Swansea architects Bucknall and Jennings, with input from Sir Henry Irving. Briefed by Patti to be her miniature version of La Scala, Milan, it incorporates features from Wagner's Bayreuth Festspielhaus opera house in Bayreuth, and the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, London. At long, wide and high the auditorium was originally decorated in pale blue, cream and gold wall panels. Ten Corinthian columns support the ceiling, and in between these are the names of composers such as Mozart, Verdi and Rossini, all gilded and surmounted by Madam Patti's monogram. The stage area was originally fronted by blue silk curtains, with a back drop that illustrates Madam Patti riding in a chariot, dressed as Semiramide from the opera of the same name by Rossini. The design incorporates a mechanical auditorium floor which can be: raised level, for use as a ballroom; or sloped towards the stage, when in use as a theatre. The theatre incorporated an organ, given to Patti in the United States after one of her tours. This was dismantled in the 1920s when the buildings became a hospital. Able to seat 150 people, the back of the theatre houses a gallery where the domestic staff would sit, enabling them to enjoy the performances. The orchestra pit is separated from the seating area by a balustrade, and holds up to 24 musicians. Invitations for the July 12, 1891, opening event went to two types of guest: those invited to stay at the castle, and those invited just for the performance. House guests included: the Spanish Ambassador; Baron and Baroness Julius De Reuter, founder of the Reuters news agency; and Lord and Lady Swansea. Journalists from international newspapers including The Daily Telegraph, Le Figaro and the Boston Herald were also invited as house guests to report on the opening. Final rehearsals occurred in the afternoon with the Swansea Opera Company, before a specially chartered train arrived at Penwyllt with the performance guests. Due to start at 20:00, the performance eventually started at 20:30 after a light tea. Sir Henry Irving was to have given the opening address, but as he was unable to attend, leading actor William Terris deputised. Patti's performance included the prelude to act one of La traviata, and in the second half the Garden Scene from Faust. There then followed a buffet supper served in the conservatory, with a total of 450 bottles of champagne consumed at the party. Today the theatre remains a time capsule, and the stage is probably the only surviving example of original 19th century backstage equipment. The opera house is licensed for weddings. Winter garden The Patti Pavilion, Swansea after refurbishment, 2009 The winter garden is a spacious building with a soaring roof and made mainly from glass, where Patti would promenade with her guests among tropical plants, whilst exotic birds flew within. A pair of wrought iron water fountains in the shape of Cranes were made in the local ironworks by a Mr Crane, who made decorative ironware featuring his namesake bird. Their multi-coloured plumage shed rainbow light from their falling waters, and were said to have captivated all who saw them. As a result of World War I, in 1918, Patti presented her winter garden to the people of Swansea where it became the Patti Pavilion, and has since been restored on several occasions. One of the crane fountains stands in the forecourt of the castle, the other in the grounds of Swansea University. Electricity Craig-y-nos was probably the first private house in Wales to be wired for electricity. The first in the UK was Cragside in Northumberland in 1880, a year after the invention of the electric light bulb by Thomas Edison. An Otto engine in the grounds created a 110 V DC system, with distribution provided by two bare copper wires placed in two adjacent grooves carved into a plank of wood, with a second plank placed over the top of it. This supplied power for Swan lamps throughout the castle, and an electrically powered Welte Concert Orchestrion which was operated by a perforated paper roll, situated in the French billiards room. The organ was the pride and joy of her second husband, French tenor Nicolini, thus dating installation prior to his death in 1898. Discovery and investigation into the system was only found by Mr J. A. Lea, the last Hospital Secretary. Transport The Neath and Brecon Railway Craig-y-nos railway station was in part funded by Patti. A private road was constructed from the castle to the station, where a lavishly furnished private waiting room was installed. In return the Neath and Brecon Railway was commissioned to provide Patti with her own private railway carriage, which she could request attached to any train to take her whenever, and wherever within the United Kingdom, she wanted to travel. At the start of the 20th century, Patti had one of the first motor cars in Wales, and is reported to have raced a local doctor from Swansea to Abercrave for a small wager. =Tuberculosis hospital= After Adelina Patti's death in 1919, the castle and the grounds were sold to the Welsh National Memorial Trust for ¬£11,000 in March 1921, an organisation founded to combat tuberculosis in Wales. Reconstructed as a sanatorium and called the Adelina Patti Hospital at the request of her widower, it admitted its first patients in August 1922. In 1947, the children of Craig-y-nos were among the first in the UK to receive the first effective TB medicine, the antibiotic streptomycin. In 1959, it became a hospital for the elderly. After the transfer of remaining patients to the new Ystradgynlais Community Hospital, the castle closed as a hospital on 31 March 1986. More information about Craig-y-nos' time as a TB hospital may be found in the book 'The Children of Craig-y-nos' by Ann Shaw and Carole Reeves. Clive Rowlands, a famous rugby player, was one of its patients, being admitted in 1947, as an eight-year-old. He was given a rugby ball as a gift and accidentally kicked it through a glass door, for which he was put in a straitjacket for a week. In a project supported by the Heritage Lottery Fund, the Sleeping Giant Foundation charity, the Wellcome Trust Centre and University College of London, in 2007 an exhibition at the Welfare Hall, Ystradgynlais, showed relics and recorded recalls of patients from its time as a TB sanatorium. =Recent history= The Welsh Office declared Craig-y-nos Castle and its unique theatre surplus to requirements soon after the opening of the new Community Hospital in nearby Ystradgynlais. In 1988 the Freehold of the property was sold to a consortium of businessmen who formed the Craig-y-nos Castle Company Ltd. After a long period of repair and restoration, the castle opened to the public as a functions venue but was badly hit by the economic recession of the early 1990s. Craig-y-nos Castle was then sold to (medical) Doctor John Trevor Jones and his wife Penelope, who continued the essential repair work including the complete renewal of the theatre's courtyard doors, installation of new central-heating system, re-roofing the theatre and much more, while organising national antiques fairs, musical events and wedding receptions ‚Äì all to generate income to plough back into the rescue of Patti's castle. On reaching retirement age in October 2000 they sold Craig-y-nos to SelClene Ltd. SelClene continued the restoration, and opened the castle as a hotel. In 2005, the castle featured in the BBC Doctor Who episode Tooth and Claw, featuring David Tennant as the Doctor and Billie Piper as Rose Tyler. The Torchwood crew later stayed at this hotel and filmed some scenes when filming Countrycide. Haunting The castle is said to be subject to strong paranormal phenomena and haunted by the ghosts of Patti; her second husband, French tenor Nicolini; and the object of her affection, the composer Rossini. Unexplained presences taking many different forms have allegedly been experienced by visitors all over the castle. Nurses who worked at Craig-y-nos while it was a hospital have reported many presences and frequent reports of having walked past somebody on the stairs or corridor but nobody being there, as well as many unexplained noises and sounds of footsteps. Visitors have also reported experiencing breathing difficulties and of feeling a lingering presence of patients who were hospitalized there while suffering from tuberculosis. The Top Children's Ward is the most active room in the castle. With the recovery rate of TB being so low, many children entered the castle at an extremely young age and never left. Many full apparitions have allegedly been seen in this room and some investigators claim to have interacted on numerous occasions, although no evidence has been produced to justify the claims. Again, minor anomalies are regular occurrences, along with the sounds of children's footsteps, bouncing balls and giggles. An investigation of an alleged dark semi-transparent lady on the stairs was discovered to be that of a statuette, situated on the roof of the castle which casts a shadow that resembles a lady when the sun starts to set. The building was also subject to an investigation on Living TV's Most Haunted.

He has worked and lived in New York City and Chicago, where he has written and performed for the stage and television. O'Donnell co-wrote the award-winning Off-Broadway musical comedy One & One, and Radio City Music Hall's Manhattan Showboat. He co-founded the New Age Vaudeville theatre company, the New Variety cabaret, as well as the Black Pearl Cabaret, St. John's Conservatory Theater, and the comedy variety television show R. Rated. Early life and education Richard O'Donnell began in the entertainment industry as a professional ventriloquist. He ran away with the Sells & Gray 3-ring tent circus at the age of 15, sleeping in the back of the elephant truck that transported their sole elephant, Bessie. O'Donnell was eventually forced to return home to finish high school, earning a scholarship to attend the Pennsylvania Governor's School for the Arts, where he studied theatre alongside classmate Kevin Bacon. New York, New YorkOne & One= In 1978, at age 22, O'Donnell co-authored the book (with Fred Bennett) and the music and lyrics (with Dianne Adams) for One & One that played the Carter Theatre, in the Carter Hotel at 250 West 43rd street. It opened Off-Broadway on November 15, 1978, and received three American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers ASCAP Awards, shared with Dianne Adams. =Manhattan Showboat= For Showplace of the Nation, Radio City Music Hall, O'Donnell co-wrote the revue entitled Manhattan Showboat produced by Robert Yani in 1979 that celebrated over 100 years of American entertainment. It featured musical direction and arrangements by Tony Award-winning conductor Donald Pippin (A Chorus Line, Cabaret, La Cage aux Folles), and received critical and public acclaim. =The Double R= In the 1980s, billed as \\"The Double R\\" comedy duo, in collaboration with writer Richard LaGravenese, O'Donnell co-wrote and consecutively performed in several Off-Off-Broadway productions including Spare Parts, Blood-brothers, and Entrees at the 78th Street Theatre Lab, the Lion Theatre, and West Bank Cafe. The Double R were regular guests on the Linda Lichtman Comedy Hour, WNBC Radio, 30 Rockefeller Plaza. On the college circuit they opened for Leon Redbone and further developed their work in stand-up comedy clubs such as New York City's Comedy Cellar and Yuk Yuk's in Toronto. While working with O'Donnell, LaGravenese discovered he had a knack for writing dialogue. Fish Creek, WisconsinComedy Cabaret= In 1983, O'Donnell was contracted by Tony Award-winning producer James B. McKenzie to create an after-show revue to complement evening performances of the Peninsula Players in Fish Creek, Wisconsin. The Comedy Cabaret, as it came to be known, produced by Amy McKenzie, returned to Door County for a follow-up season opening in 1985 with O'Donnell's comedy revue, Dr. Funny Bones, as New Age Vaudeville in its own 100-seat theater in Glidden Lodge, Baileys Harbor. While working the Comedy Cabaret, O'Donnell also took to the main stage at Peninsula Players, starring in title roles in Larry Shue's The Nerd and The Foreigner. =Wish Wisconsin= In 1998, O'Donnell was commissioned to write the book, music, and lyrics for a new musical play entitled Wish Wisconsin, to celebrate the state's 150th birthday. Directed and produced by Amy McKenzie, it opened on January 2, in the Fish Creek Town Hall Auditorium. Songs included \\"Wish\\", \\"So Blessed\\", and \\"Oh!, Wisconsin\\".

They were incessantly involved in the civil wars that plagued Imereti from the 15th century into the 19th. After the Russian conquest of Imereti in 1810, the family was integrated into the Russian nobility and confirmed as a princely house (knyaz) in 1850.Toumanoff, Cyril (1967).

Founding Founded in November, 2006, The Environmentalist's writers include Huffington Post environmental and geopolitical contributor, Janet Ritz; Presidential Climate Action Plan (PCAP) Executive Director, William S. Becker; award-winning playwright and author, Sherman Yellen; author of the REAL McCAIN Cliff Schecter; filmmaker Greg Reitman, producer of the 2008 Sundance Film Festival award-winning documentary, Fields of Fuel; democratic activist Terry Leach; as well as scientists, environmental lawyers and various guest contributors. Founding publisher and managing editor, Janet Ritz, is the daughter of award-winning Associated Press courtroom artist and journalist, Rosalie Ritz. An environmental activist and writer who was mentored in her youth by writer and composer Joaquin Nin-Culmell, concert promoter Bill Graham and artist Zahara Schatz, Janet Ritz founded The Environmentalist in 2006 as a forum for unfiltered climate science information after learning from colleagues about the editing of James E. Hansen's climate science reports by the Bush administration. In August, 2007, Ritz wrote an article for the Huffington PostNASA's Climate Change Satellites: White House Cuts Leaked which reported cuts in climate science satellites that were concurrent with a declaration by the Bush Administration to become more involved in fighting global warming. This led to an expansion of the Environmentalist's format to include topics beyond the environment. In January, 2008, the Environmentalist began to be picked up by wire services. In April, 2008, the editorial page was launched when Ritz published a tribute to her late mother's work on both the Huffington Post and the Environmentalist. World news, history and resource pages followed soon after. Format The Environmentalist displays articles under the following sections (verticals): Home, Politics, Climate, World, Science, History, Business, Resources, Editorial, Lifestyle, Eco-Links, Tags and Archive. The articles are noted for their use of illustrations, photographs, charts and diagrams to clarify article points and conclusions. A public interest website, The Environmentalist, is published under a Creative Commons 3.0 License with many of its articles carried by various online wire services, including Reuters, Chicago Sun-Times, Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Fox News, IBS and USA Today. Notable articles In November, 2008, The Environmentalist published an editorial by PCAP Executive Director, Bill Becker, entitled Struggling for Obama's Soul that followed a review of Becker's book, The 100 Day Action Plan to Save the Planet summarizing the Presidential Climate Action Plan developed for the incoming administration. In August 2008, The Environmentalist published filmmaker Greg Reitman's personal account, A Filmmaker's 'Fields of Fuel' of his journey that led to the 2008 Sundance Film Festival Audience Award-winning documentary Fields of Fuel. In July 2008, The Environmentalist published an article entitled: James Hansen to the G8: We've passed safe C02 levels which included a letter from Dr. James E. Hansen of NASA's Goddard Spaces Sciences Institute, in which Hansen warned that the maximum safe level of atmospheric C02 (350 ppm) had been exceeded (385 ppm): > My address tomorrow to the United Nations University G8 Symposium summarizes > scientific data revealing that the safe level of atmospheric carbon dioxide > (CO2) is no more than 350 ppm (parts per million), and is likely less than > that. Implications for energy policy are profound, as atmospheric CO2 is > already 385 ppm. Hansen's letter was addressed to Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda of Japan, host of the 2008 G8 Summit. He requested Fukuda's leadership in addressing the findings. In May, 2008, an article by contributing writer, Terry Leach, entitled: Hillary Clinton's ‚ÄòVictory‚Äô in Pennsylvania: The Rush Limbaugh Effect and subsequently picked up by Reuters, The Huffington Post, and The Chicago Sun-Times, posited that the votes for Hillary Clinton cast during the Pennsylvania Primary should be explored to assess the impact by Rush Limbaugh's Operation Chaos. This resulted in the phrase \\"The Limbaugh Effect\\" being used across the media sphere, which earned a response from Rush Limbaugh that was answered by The Environmentalist's managing editor in an article entitled: Why Rush Limbaugh Thinks This Site is Unfriendly. Endorsements On February 4, 2008, The Environmentalist endorsed Senator Barack Obama for President of the United States, citing his environmental policy positions as the reason for choosing him over the other candidates.

River water sources The River Litani and the River Jordan are the only rivers of any size in the vicinity of the land of Canaan. Perennial brooks are very scarce and the wadis, or streambeds, while numerous and impetuous in the rainy season, are dry during the rest of the year. Job 6:16-17 compares faithless friends to these torrent-beds, swollen in the spring, but vanishing in the hot weather. Ben Sira twice enumerates water as the first among the \\"principal things necessary for the life of man.\\" Wells All springs, wells and fountains were landmarks in the topography of Palestine. Abraham dug wells near Gerar. Jesus, sitting on the brim of Jacob's Well, taught the Samaritan woman the passing of the Old Covenant. An angel found Hagar at a well in the Sinai, Beer Lahai Roi (Genesis 16). To own a well and to possess the surrounding country were synonymous terms (Proverbs 5:15-17). On the other hand, so serious might be the disputes arising out of the use or claim of a well that the sword was appealed to as the sole arbiter (Genesis 26:21; Exodus 2:17; Numbers 20:17). If the approach of an enemy was feared, his progress might be seriously hampered, if not altogether frustrated, by stopping or destroying the wells along his route (2 Chronicles 32:3). Springs A spring is the \\"eye of the landscape\\", the natural burst of living water, flowing all year or drying up at certain seasons. In contrast to the \\"troubled waters\\" of wells and rivers (Jer. 2:18), there gushes forth from it \\"living water\\", to which Jesus compared the grace of the Holy Spirit (John 4:10; 7:38; compare Isaiah 12:3; 44:3). Towns and hamlets bear names compounded with the word Ain (En), Hebrew for a well or spring. For example, Endor (spring of Dor), Engannin (spring of gardens), Engaddi (spring of the kid), Rogel or En-rogel (spring of the foot), Ensemes (spring of the sun), etc. But springs were comparatively rare; biblical language distinguishes the natural springs from the wells, which are water pits bored under the rocky surface and having no outlet. They belonged to and were named by the person who dug them. Many names of places, too, are compounded with B'er (the Hebrew word \\"well\\"), such as Bersable, Beroth, Beer Elim, etc. Cisterns Cisterns are subterranean reservoirs, sometimes covering as much as an acre of land, in which the rainwater is gathered during the spring. Jerusalem was so well supplied with them that in all the sieges no one within its walls ever suffered from want of water. Cisterns were hewed into the native rock and then lined with impervious masonry and cement. Their construction involved great labour; Yahweh promised to the children of Israel, when coming out of Egypt, the possession of cisterns dug by others as a special mark of favour (Deuteronomy 6:11; 2 Esdras 9:25). If the cement of the cistern gave way, the reservoir became useless and was abandoned. It was then one of the \\"broken cisterns, that could hold no water\\" (Jeremiah 2:13). The mouth of wells and cisterns was generally surrounded by a curb or low wall and closed with a stone, both to prevent accidents and to keep away strangers. If the owner neglected to cover the cistern, and a domestic animal fell into it, the Mosaic law obliged him to pay the price of the animal (Exodus 21:33-34; compare Luke 14:5). Sometimes the stone placed on the orifice was so heavy that one man was unable to remove it (Genesis 29:3). When dry, cisterns were used as dungeons, because, narrowed at the top, like \\"huge bottles\\", they left no avenue open for escape (Genesis 37:24; Jeremiah 38:6; 1 Maccabees 7:19). They also offered convenient places for hiding a person from his pursuers (1 Kings 13:6; 2 Kings 17:18).

These sources include sugar, molasses and rice, corn and potato starches, natural tree and gum resins, natural latex rubber and vegetable oils, lignin, cellulose, palm oil waste, coconut waste, peanut oil waste, canola oil waste, dried sewerage effluent and so on. Bitumen can also be made from waste vacuum tower bottoms produced in the process of cleaning used motor oils, which are normally burned or dumped into land fills. Non-petroleum based bitumen binders can be colored, which can reduce the temperatures of road surfaces and reduce the Urban heat islands.  Petroleum, environmental, and heat concerns  Because of concerns over Peak oil, pollution and climate change, as well the oil price increases since 2003, non-petroleum alternatives have become more popular. This has led to the introduction of biobitumen alternatives that are more environmentally friendly and nontoxic. For millions of people living in and around cities, heat islands are of growing concern. This phenomenon describes urban and suburban temperatures that are 1 to 6 ¬∞C (2 to 10 ¬∞F) hotter than nearby rural areas. Elevated temperatures can impact communities by increasing peak energy demand, air conditioning costs, air pollution levels, and heat-related illness and mortality. There are common- sense measures that communities can take to reduce the negative effects of heat islands, such as replacing conventional black asphalt road surfaces with the new pigmentable bitumen that gives lighter colors.  History and implementation  Asphalt made with vegetable oil based binders was patented by Colas SA in France in 2004.COLAS CST - V√©g√©col A number of homeowners seeking an environmentally friendly alternative to asphalt for paving have experimented with waste vegetable oil as a binder for driveways and parking areas in single-family applications. The earliest known test occurred in 2002 in Ohio, where the homeowner combined waste vegetable oil with dry aggregate to create a low-cost and less polluting paving material for his 200-foot driveway. After five years, he reports the driveway is performing as well or better than petroleum-based materials. Shell Oil Company paved two public roads in Norway in 2007 with vegetable-oil-based asphalt. Results of this study are still premature. HALIK Asphalts LTD from Israel has been experimenting with recycled and secondary road building since 2003. The company is using various wastes such as vegetable fats & oils, wax and thermoplastic elastomers to build and repair roads. The results reported are so far satisfying. On October 6, 2010, a bicycle path in Des Moines, Iowa, was paved with bio-oil based asphalt through a partnership between Iowa State University, the City of Des Moines, and Avello Bioenergy Inc. Research is being conducted on the asphalt mixture, derived from plants and trees to replace petroleum-based mixes. Bioasphalt is a registered trademark of Avello Bioenergy Inc. Dr. Elham H. Fini, at North Carolina A&T; University, has been spearheading research that has successfully produced bio asphalt from swine manure. Since November 2014 the Dutch Wageningen University & Research centre is running a pilot in the Dutch province of Zeeland with bioasphalt in which the binder of bitumen was substituted by lignin. In 2015, French researchers published their results about the usage of microalgaes as a source of asphalt binding material.

She became an outspoken advocate for human rights after her sister, anthropologist Myrna Mack Chang, was assassinated by the Guatemalan military on September 11, 1990. She pursued prosecution of her sister's assailants, including ground-breaking cases in the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, achieving convictions of one assailant and a high-ranking colonel. The Guatemalan government acknowledged responsibility in 2004 and has paid compensation to Mack and her family. In 1992 she received the Right Livelihood Award in Sweden, and has received other awards for her human rights work. In 1993 she established the Myrna Mack Foundation, to support the prosecution of her sister's murder and do other work for human rights, establishing programs and support for victims. In 2010, she was appointed by Guatemala President √Ålvaro Colom to lead investigations into continuing police corruption and recommend changes. Early life and education Helen Mack Chang was born in Barrio San Nicol√°s, Retalhuleu, Guatemala. Her parents were Chinese. She had an older sister, Myrna, who became an anthropologist. Human rights activist During the long Guatemalan civil war, her sister Myrna Mack worked with indigenous Mayan rural peoples. She documented their displacement by fighting and the scale of the government's attacks on them. Myrna Mack was killed in 1990 near her office in Guatemala City by unknown assailants, believed to be ordered by a government that wanted to silence her public criticism. Beginning in 1991, Helen Mack Chang pursued prosecution in Guatemala of those suspected of the crime, which included several men trained at the US Army School of the Americas (later renamed the Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation). After more than a decade of seeking justice in Guatemala, Mack Chang took the case to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights in Washington, DC, and later to the Inter-American Court in Costa Rica. Two years later, one of Myrna‚Äôs killers, former Army Sergeant Noel de Jes√∫s Beteta, was convicted in a groundbreaking decision. The Court sentenced him to 25 years in prison. The prosecution of the case resulted in the trial of two colonels and a general \\"as the intellectual authors of the murder; the highest-ranking officials in Guatemala ever to be tried for human rights violations.\\" In 2002, Colonel Juan Valencia Osorio was convicted in absentia for his role in ordering her murder, and sentenced to 30 years in prison. The decision was overturned in an appeals court in 2003. The case has been taken to Guatemalan Supreme Court. This case was the first of its kind in Guatemala and set a precedent for similar human rights cases.\\"Murder of Myrna Mack\\", Guatemala Human Rights Commission, 2011, accessed 14 June 2013 In 1993 Helen Mack founded and became the executive director of the Myrna Mack Foundation in Guatemala City.

The show uses a tongue-in-cheek approach to screen altered feature films intercut with cartoons, educational and instructional videos in such a way to create a new condensed feature that collages visual puns and humorous subplots. The host of the show is the fictional Gunther Dedmund, played by Joel Sanderson.  Background  The Basement Sublet of Horror is based on a long tradition of late-night television horror movie hosts that began in the 1950s with Vampira. Wichita, Kansas had its own horror host show, called The Host and Rodney, from the late 1950s through the 1970s starring Tom Leahy. It seems to have been the very first Horror Host show in the country, as it did not carry the \\"Shock Theater\\" package common to shows of the time, and was created from scratch by the station. The Basement Sublet of Horror follows a long history of horror hosts that play horror films on television that have had a nationwide cult following for decades. Several generations of fans have grown up watching late-night Horror Host programs, at once becoming erstwhile film students and cinema aficionados, and also networking with other fans around the country. With the development of the Internet and cable television, horror host shows have seen a revival likened to the drive-in resurgence of indoor theaters that present exploitation and novelty films such as The Rocky Horror Picture Show. These Horror Hosts include the likes of Ghoulardi, Elvira, and Joe Bob Briggs, who was the host of \\"Drive-In Theater\\" on Showtime, and \\"MonsterVision\\" on TNT.  Development  The Basement Sublet of Horror first started screening in June 2006. Prior to that date, Joel Sanderson had been involved in producing live events in the Kansas area for over twenty years. His first film production was the Escape‚Äô Drive-in in 1989, which featured a combination of bad movies and live music. The show moved indoors in 1996 and became the M.T. Pockets Budget Film Festival with a three-year run at the Free state Brewery in Lawrence, Kansas, followed by a six-year run at the Wichita Center for the Arts.  Characters  The host of The Basement Sublet of Horror is Gunther Dedmund, a fictional character played by Joel Sanderson. Richard Wayne, another character in the show, is also played by Joel Sanderson. Several other characters have appeared in the six seasons of the show that have been broadcast so far, including several of Gunther's landlords, his boss Roger Slacks, his neighbor, a rival TV host Rusty Trees, a country western singer named Tex LeBeauf, Jake of \\"Jake's Mind Repair\\", an emergency guest host, a grave digger named Mr. Rule, an Italian movie zombie, a UFO Expert, a giant red rabbit named Rapjack Rabbit, Gunther's Aunt Ertha, Gunther's Aunt Bertha, and a ghost named Lester Jenkins. Gunther Dedmund also likes to bring in special guest hosts that have included Ol‚Äô Flick a classic Wichita, KS. TV host (Jim Erickson), Butch Cleaver host of \\"Meet Cleaver Theatre\\" from Cincinnati, and author Scott Phillips (The Ice Harvest, Cottonwood).  Publications  In 2012 The Basement Sublet of Horror stepped into the world of publishing with the creation of comic books and a magazine. Both publications are related to the on-air program along with carrying the name Basement Sublet of Horror. A number of established writers and artists have contributed to the publications including Jon Niccum, Scott Philips, Rik 'Mr. Verlin' Livingston, Ben Urish, Dan Rempel, Greg Smallwood, Richard Chamberlain, and Bill Goffrier. The magazine has also featured guest appearances by television hosts and film directors including James 'Ol' Flick' Erickson, Butch R. Cleaver, Tom Leahy Jr., and Crematia Mortem. Later issues featured interviews with artist Bradley Beard, Kansas film maker Lance Hayes, a tribute issue to director Christopher R. Mihm, and Lawrence based science fiction author James Gunn. The magazine was published for ten issues along with five Special Editions and concluded its publication run in 2019. The special editions issues produced included a Guide to the films Boris Karloff, the films of Bela Lugosi, a complete reprinting of the BSOH Collector Card series, a 10th anniversary scrapbook, and a guide to the films made in Kansas.

Access to the museum by public transportation is available from Tramway d'√éle-de-France (Trans Val-de-Seine) station Mus√©e de S√®vres on Tramway T2, and by Paris M√©tro station Pont de S√®vres on Line 9. History The museum was inaugurated in 1824 by Alexandre Brongniart, director of the Manufacture nationale de S√®vres, becoming the first museum dedicated to fine ceramic arts in the world. Denis-Desire Riocreux, a renowned painter at the manufacture became the director with a goal of collecting and studying fine ceramics from all over the world. Brongniart published his treatise on ceramic art and pottery in 1845. The following year, with Riocreux, he wrote Description m√©thodique du mus√©e c√©ramique de la Manufacture Royale de Porcelaine de S√®vres, which became the museum's first catalogue. The museum became independent of the factory in 1927 under director Henry-Pierre Fourest, and was attached to the Mus√©e du Louvre in Paris for conservation purposes in 1934. Beginning in 1975, the museum began seeking out modern ceramics, and the exhibition space was expanded with eight new rooms. The main floor exhibits ceramics from the East and West, from its origins to the sixteenth century. The first floor of the museum is dedicated to European earthenware and porcelain from the sixteenth century to the present. The museum holds more than 50,000 objects, of which about 5,000 were manufactured by S√®vres. In addition to traditional fine European and Asian ceramics, has an especially noteworthy collection of ceramics created by leading 19th- and 20th-century contemporary artists.

It normally comes in the months of July and August.  Background  Tulu Nadu is known for its rich traditions. Especially in villages of Tulu Nadu where agriculture has a significant role in the life of Tuluvas socio-economic fabric is the people belonging to Nalike community visit houses of people in a colorful attire masquerading as Kalinja. In return, people would offer rice, vegetables and money to artistes. It is believed that during the month of Aati, nature's spirit Kalenja descends on Earth to bless the land and its people. The performance begins on poove - the day before the full moon, and continues till the end of the month. It is believed that Aati Kalenja brings the positive energy which would ward off evil spirits and diseases. Aati is when there is a heavy rain fall which would destroy the crops. During this season heavy rain causes not only disasters but also diseases as the season is conducive to the insects and pests to breed. So man is more prone to sickness in this season and poverty due to lack of work for the people who are solely depending on the agriculture. This is the reason for Aati being considered as month of disasters. This is when the man starts pleading and pleasing the nature to be merciful towards him. This could well be called the origin of the Aati Kalenja cult in Tulu Nadu.  The Costume  Preparations of the artist Headgear and painted faces are the main attractions of kalenja's eco-friendly costume which is made of leaves and flowers. The person who masquerades as Kalenja makes the headgear using stems of Ixora coccinea (kepula in Tulu language). They adorn themselves with costumes made of tender palms of the coconut tree, anklets, colourful clothes and a long cap made up of Areca spate etc. The headgear, also called the mudi, is then decorated with flowers. They paint their face with different colours and designs. The ‚Äòskirt‚Äô which flows down his waist is another piece of art. It is made of tender fronds of coconut and are interlaced with banana sheath strands. Later, he paints his face and hands in various colours and designs and gets ready for house visits. The image of Aati Kalenja, holding an umbrella of dry palm leaves, makes for a spectacular viewing.  The Ritual  Aati Kalenja with accompanist Aati Kalenja visits houses and carries out a ritual of sprinkling water mixed with Charcoal, Turmeric powder and Tamarind to do away with any misfortune that might have befallen on the family and the cattle. He dances to the beats of the drum called tembere which is of very significance in culture of Tulu Nadu. Accompanist beats the drum and recites the song, \\"Aateek Baththe Aati Kalenja\\", narrating the story of the spirit. As a reward for expunging the evil that surrounds, household members give him rice. Aati Kalenja is also considered as a traditional healer who at times dispenses medicinal herbs to overcome illness.  Food  Ambade (Hog plum), Kanile (Bamboo shoot), Paagile (wild bitter gourd), Thojank (Cassia tora), Thimare (both wild greens), wild Jackfruit, drumstick leaves and Colocasia leaves are some of the locally available vegetables that are used in the season.  In modern days  With changing times it is very different situation now, development, education, technology and increased employment opportunity has led to the disappearance of this ancient ritualistic folk dance. Reduction in paddy cultivation too contributed to the disappearance of the tradition. The This decade old ritual is on the verge on extinction. Karnataka Tulu Sahitya Academy former president Vaman Nandavara said that Nalike community members in the city are not keen on continuing with the tradition as they get more job opportunity due to reservation and urbanization. \\"Parents of Nalike community members dress their children as Aati Kalenja and make them dance to the tunes of paddana (traditional Tulu songs) in front of houses. Nowadays, children too are hesitant as they concentrate on education\\". In spite of it, Aati Kalenja remains an integral part of the folk culture of the Tulu Nadu region and one can witness this folk dance only in the interior pockets of Tulu Nadu, during Aati days.

He is currently a professor at International Research Center for Japanese Studies, Kyoto. He graduated from University of Tsukuba with a degree in anthropology, women's folklore, human sacrifice and post-war manga. In addition to his work with manga he is a critic, essayist, and author of several successful non-fiction books on Japanese popular and otaku sub-cultures. He has written the Multiple Personality Detective Psycho and The Kurosagi Corpse Delivery Service manga series. One of his first animation script works was Mah≈ç no Rouge Lipstick, an adult lolicon OVA. ≈åtsuka was the editor for the bish≈çjo lolicon manga series Petit Apple Pie. In the 1980s, Otsuka was editor-in-chief of Manga Burikko, a leading manga magazine where he pioneered research on otaku subcultures in modern Japan. He has published a host of books and articles about the manga industry. In July 2007, he received a doctorate in artistic engineering from Kobe Design University. His doctoral dissertation is \\"From Mickey's format to Proposition of Atom: the origin of postwar manga methodology in wartime years and its development\\".  Biography  Early life = Eiji ≈åtsuka was born on 28 August 1958 in the city formerly known as Tanashi, Tokyo (currently Nishit≈çky≈ç, Tokyo). His father, as a repatriate from Manchuria, suffered poor living conditions in repatriate housing prior to his acceptance into university. ≈åtsuka's father was a member of the former Japanese Communist Party, but he left the party due to disagreements regarding party policy. In middle school, ≈åtsuka joined the d≈çjin circle Sakuga Group, which lead to his employment as an assistant for manga artist Tar≈ç Minamoto in his first year at high school. The following year, ≈åtsuka, with references from Minamoto, debuted as a gag manga artist. However, he soon ended his career as a manga artist during his college entrance exams after deciding that he lacked talent as a manga artist. ≈åtsuka graduated the University of Tsukuba in March 1981. There, he studied Japanese folkloristics under the guidance of professor Tokuji Chiba. ≈åtsuka gave up the notion of attending graduate school after he was told by instructor Miyata Noboru that his \\"ideas are too journalistic and not suited for academics\\". = Career = After graduation, ≈åtsuka worked part-time as the editor of the magazines Ryu and Petit Apple Pie, together with manga artist Yukio Sawada. As a part-time editor, he worked with manga artist Sh≈çtar≈ç Ishinomori for about a month, where he learned how to parse manga names (a \\"name\\" refers to the rough draft of a manga page, with preliminary panel layout, dialogue and plot, which is commonly checked by an editor before the artist proceeds to the manuscript phase). Later shifting from part-time to full-time editor, ≈åtsuka worked as the editor-in-chief of the manga magazine Manga Burikko on a freelance basis. The comments he published in the magazine under a pseudonym became the basis of ≈åtsuka's later career as a commentator. It was also during this time that the first official use of the term \\"otaku\\" was published in Manga Burikko in 1983, with ≈åtsuka still serving as its editor-in-chief. Late in the 1980s, ≈åtsuka was involved in the trial of a serial kidnapper and murderer of young girls, active between 1988 and 1989 in Saitama, Tokyo. The suspect (and later convicted perpetrator), Tsutomu Miyazaki, was found to have possessed a large collection of manga, which at the time meant that the manga subculture was \\"repeatedly\\" linked to Miyazaki in the press and in popular imagination, creating the image that \\"young people involved with amateur manga are dangerous, psychologically disturbed perverts.\\" ≈åtsuka contested this popular perception, later writing that he \\"became somewhat angry about how judgment of [Miyazaki's] crimes kept shifting onto otaku hobbies or tastes.\\" In his 1989 book A Theory of Narrative Consumption (Monogatari sh≈çhiron), ≈åtsuka developed a theory of media consumption based around the consumption of multiple small narratives that fit inside a \\"worldview\\" or grand narrative.

He plays as a goalkeeper, most recently for El Gouna. He is the most capped player for Palestine at international level. Saleh had participated in every single FIFA World Cup qualification campaign for Palestine (2002‚Äì2014) until injury prevented him for playing against Afghanistan and Thailand in the preliminary rounds of 2014 World Cup qualification. Early years Ramzi Saleh was born in Cairo, Egypt to Palestinian father and Egyptian mother. At the age of 10, Saleh who had move to Jeddah, started to play for Al-Ittihad at the youth level but eventually returned to the Gaza Strip with his family when his father retired, he signed with Shabab Jabalia in 1999. The following year, he was called up to the national team where he quickly became the undisputed number one, turning in several key saves. Club careerMove to Al- Ahly= After being awarded a 3-day trial with Egyptian footballing giants Al- Ahly, Shabab Jabalia, in a show of good faith, released him without demanding a transfer fee. After months of playing second fiddle and no official appearances he was awarded the starting job for Al-Ahly after a series of mistakes by incumbent Amir Abdelhamid. He made his first appearance against Ismaily in a 0‚Äì1 loss on the 20th Matchday of the 2008/09 season. In the following match, a 2‚Äì2 draw with Petrol Asyut, Saleh put in a match of the man performance helping Al-Ahly salvage a point In recognition of his performances, he was awarded Egyptian Premier League Player of the Month for the month of March. The 2008/09 season ended with Ramzi Saleh helping Al-Ahly to another league title after defeating Ismaily 1‚Äì0 in a playoff. After suffering an injury before the 2009‚Äì10 season, Ramzi Saleh saw his position go to youngster Ahmed Adel. In the winter transfer window, manager Hossam Al- Badry chose to bring in Sherif Ekramy to fill the post. At the end of the season, Ramzi Saleh elected to leave the club on a bosman. =Al-Merrikh= At the start of the 2009‚Äì10 season, Ramzi Saleh picked up an injury and missed all of the preseason with Al-Ahly. As a result, his position was usurped by Al-Ahly youth team player Ahmed Adel Abd El-Moneam. During the winter transfer window, Al-Ahly acquired Sherif Ekramy relegating Ramzi Saleh to third choice goalkeeper. The situation was so bad that Saleh was seen playing as a striker- and scoring- during one training session. After much contemplation, Saleh decided to leave Al-Ahly, it was suspected that he would be included in the transfer that brought Geddo to the Red Castle, but negotiations fell through at the final moment and he was excluded from the deal. While on National Team duty in Sudan Saleh was approached by Al-Merreikh President Gamal Al-Wali to play for the Sudanese side. With no other offers on the table Saleh agreed to sign for the Red Devils in principle. In the following weeks Ramzi received offers to join Alexandria United, Smouha, Zamalek, and Al-Hilal Riyadh but refused these offers stating that he had to stay true to his word. Saleh signed a two-year contract was worth $1 million. His time with Al-Merreikh was marked by inconsistency and injury. After a three-week layoff, Saleh returned to Al-Merreikh's starting lineup to face Al-Hilal in the decisive encounter of the season. Al-Merrikh would lose the game 3‚Äì1 with Saleh being booed by his own fans. In the off-season, Al-Merreikh brought in Ramzi Saleh's former Al- Ahly manager Hossam Al-Badry with Saleh playing a key role in facilitating the transaction. Despite this, Al-Badry chose to buy Essam El-Hadary from Zamalek for $700,000. Due to his large salary and unwillingness to sit on the bench, Al-Merreikh released Ramzi Saleh from his contract. =Smouha= On 18 December 2010, Zamalek announced a two and a half year deal with the Palestinian goalkeeper.. The deal broke down days later after the two sides failed to agree on a financial compensation package. On 4 January 2010, Ramzi Saleh signed an 18-month contract with Haras El-Hodood. However, days later the deal was broken, also due to financial issues, the player later revealed that his two contracts were terminated due to his former agent sending messages to the two clubs warning them about an injury that Saleh sustained in 1998 that still affects his performance. He later thanked Haras El-Hodood management for being honest with him and Zamalek management for refusing to give away information about his injury so that they will not jeopardize his future. Ramzi Saleh elected to operate on his ACL in order to clear up any concerns potential clubs may have signing him. The operation was conducted in Germany in February 2011 by the same doctors who had done the same procedure on Ahmad Hassan's knee. As a result of the surgery, Saleh missed the rest of the 2010‚Äì11 season as well as 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification matches against Afghanistan and Thailand. On 28 July 2011 it was announced that Saleh had agreed to a 3-year contract with Smouha worth 2 million Egyptian Pounds.

She was executed in Peru in 1991 by members of Sendero Luminoso (\\"Shining Path\\"), a Maoist rebel guerrilla organisation.  Early life  McCormack was born in Kununoppin, Western Australia, a small rural locality. In her youth she was said to be vibrant, determined, fun-loving; and an avid Australian football fan. McCormack was initially educated by the Sisters of St Joseph, and then boarded at Santa Maria College, Perth, where she is said to have developed her two great loves: serving God and educating youth. At 15, she wanted to be a religious sister. She joined the Sisters of St Joseph in 1957, professing her first religious vows the following year. McCormack was a teacher in Western Australia for the next 30 years. She was a petite woman and popular teacher and principal, but also known as feisty and demanding. She was an accomplished golfer and tennis player.  Missionary in Peru  After decades teaching in Australian schools, McCormack felt called to serve Latin America's poor. She became a Peruvian missionary worker in 1987. She first worked in El Pacifico, a low income suburb in San Juan de Miraflores, Lima, and Santa de Perola in Distrito de San Mart√≠n de Porres. On 26 June 1989, she left to serve in Huasahuasi, high in the Andes Mountains about 200 km from Lima. McCormack and her companion, Sister Dorothy Stevenson RSJ, were asked to supervise the distribution of emergency goods by Caritas Peru. McCormack continued her ministry of providing poor children with library facilities to aid their school homework, which they otherwise would not have had. She also trained extraordinary ministers of Holy Communion as well as visiting parishioners in the outlying districts. On 17 December 1989, the Catholic priests in Huasahuasi were warned of danger from Sendero Luminoso, so they and the two sisters left the village for Lima. McCormack, however, felt that the church could not abandon the villagers at this time, so she and Stevenson returned on 14 January 1990. Huasahuasi went 12 months without a resident priest. During this time McCormack and Stevenson served the people, providing spiritual leadership by regularly conducting services as no priests were available to go to the village.  Death  Near 6:00 pm on 21 May 1991 armed members of Sendero Luminoso entered Huasahuasi, threatening residents and entering multiple homes. Four men were taken from their homes to the town's central plaza. Guerrilla band members also went to the convent, where McCormack was alone whilst Stevenson received medical treatment in Lima. Sendero Luminoso members did not enter the convent, ordering McCormack to come out, which eventually she did. She was marched to the plaza and made to sit on the benches alongside the four men. For about an hour the five victims were harangued, interrogated and shouted at. Several local people interceded for the victims' lives, calling them good people and not wrongdoers. Sendero Luminoso retorted that they had not come for a \\"dialogue\\", but to \\"carry out a sentence\\". McCormack was accused of dispensing \\"American food\\" (Caritas provisions) and spreading \\"American ideas\\" (by providing school books). Local people insisted that she was Australian, not American, but the guerrillas did not care. At night, young villagers surrounded McCormack in darkness, managing to move her back into the crowd. The guerrillas noticed her absence, returning her to the bench. Eventually the five prisoners were ordered to lie face down on the terrazzo-tiled plaza. Each was shot once in the back of the head. McCormack was killed first ‚Äì about six metres (about 20 feet) from the church door. The bodies could not be moved from the plaza without authoritarian permission the next morning, so parishioners kept vigil by McCormack's body, burning candles and praying. Women laid her out in the sacristy, doing for her what was done for the men killed with her. On 23 May 1991 a funeral Mass was held before her burial in a Huasahuasi cemetery niche donated by a parishioner.  Possible sainthood  In October 2010, Australian media reported McCormack's possible recognised sainthood after Mary MacKillop's canonisation. The Daily Telegraph reported that senior Peruvian and Australian Catholic clergy expected preparing a submission to the Vatican for McCormack's cause after Mary MacKillop's canonisation. Congregational Leader of the Sisters of St Joseph, Sister Ann Derwin, said that people in Huasahuasi, already regarding McCormack as a saint, demanded this. It also reported that people judged to have been martyrs do not require evidence of miracles performed through their intercession, hoping that this would accelerate McCormack cause.

It defines one \\"common electronic language\\" to be talked by the automation systems throughout the mine. In year 2000, IREDES was founded by the major players in the mining industry. Since then, the standard was developed, built and tested. Background Modern mining machines today is controlled electronically via network. This kind of equipment provides enormous amount of electronic reports and data. Before IREDES, there was no way of cost effectively exchanging the process information with databases, simulation tools and other enterprise level software. Any data exchange problem had to be solved by individual and expensive software development projects. To solve this problem, IREDES was founded to unify the data exchange format and method such that individual development effort can be minimized. Innovations The development of IREDES is to achieve the following: *Easy integration of multi vendor machine installations into data controlled mining process *Reduce cost of individual interface development for machine manufactures, mining companies and system suppliers *Create new markets for off-the-shelf software and systems to be used in automated mining processes *Form a data acquisition basis for integration of the mining process into enterprise level modeling, cost analysis and decision finding systems. *Set up unique, standardized definitions on the content of all parameters used in IREDES to ensure the parameters are meaning the same when they are provided by different systems. Thereby the machines are not only able to \\"talk\\" but also to \\"understand\\" each other. Organization IREDES is a not-for-profit organization located in Ladbergen, Germany. It is jointly financed by the member companies on a cost sharing basis. The standard documents are open to the public. They are accessible free of charge for members. Non-members can purchase the documents from the IREDES office for a small amount of contribution to the standardization work. Data Profiles All the data profiles are based on Extensible Markup Language (XML). This is due to the high extendability and interoperability of the language. The current data profiles created with the contribution of board members are Drilling rig and LHD trucks. More profiles will be added in the future if needed.

Balzac has a subtle way of approaching his plot indirectly and embedding a story within a story. The story is perhaps a common one of a wife trapped in a marriage, but is approached in an interesting manner. Plot summary Maurice is a Consul at G√™nes/Genoa, a Mediterranean town where he has married Onorina the daughter of the only wealthy man into the town, although it seems he was originally extremely reluctant to get married. They are having a dinner party with guests from Paris, and Maurice recounts some of his history. When Maurice was young, he became secretary to Count Octave. The count was very good to him but seemed very sad and mysterious as if hiding some past misfortune. Eventually Maurice discovers that he had been married, but his wife had left him. She, Honorine, had been brought up with him from a very early age, having been adopted by his parents, and they were devoted to each other. They had become married almost as a matter of course. However, after a few months she just disappeared. Octave then discovered she had gone off with an adventurer who had abandoned her, pregnant. She had the child but lived full of remorse, and resisted all attempts of Octave to get in touch with her. Octave is still devoted to her and secretly helps her in her business of flower arranging. However she still refuses to have anything to do with him. The Count therefore gets Maurice to act as a go between, arranging for him to occupy the house next to her, and pose as a misogynistic flower breeder. Eventually Maurice makes contact and indirectly puts the Count‚Äôs case. Honorine is still too overcome with remorse and shame. Eventually however she agrees to see the count, and then goes back to live with him. Maurice has to leave the Count‚Äôs company because of the part he played and that is why he became consul. Two years after, he heard of the death of Honorine, and soon after was visited by the Count who had grown old before his time, and who died shortly after departing. The story is full of discussion about the meaning of relationships and Maurice acts throughout as interpreter for the two parties. There is also the implication that he had in fact fallen in love with Honorine himself, which is why he avoided marriage initially.

Life  His parents were Charlotte Wolff, and Bernard Crouse Wolff (b. at Martinsburg, 1794), a prominent theologian of the German Reformed Church (Lutheran). The family moved to Easton, Pennsylvania, in 1835, the father becoming English pastor there. George graduated A.M. from Marshall College, Mercersburg, Pennsylvania, and there studied law for three years at Easton. Though admitted to the Bar, he never practised, but after a four years' theological course became a minister of the German Reformed Church. The elder Wolff and his son were staunch followers of John Williamson Nevin, who in 1843 began to develop in their sect a system of theology which, whilst bitterly opposing Catholicism, held Christ's Church to be a living organism and sought to restore certain teaching of Christ repudiated by the Protestant Reformation (see G. D. Wolff's article \\"The Mercersburg Movement\\" in \\"American Catholic Quarterly\\", 1878). George Wolff joined the Catholic Church in 1871. The next year he became editor of the Catholic Mirror published at Baltimore, leaving it the year following for the Catholic Standard of Philadelphia, of which he died editor- in-chief. His editorial success caused him to be called to join Dr. James A. Corcoran and Father James O'Connor in establishing the American Catholic Quarterly Review, first issued in Philadelphia, January 1876. Father O'Connor was consecrated bishop in August of that year, and went to his vicariate Apostolic in Nebraska. The other two editors sustained the publication until their death. Wolff's articles were largely on matters of apologetic theology. His wife, Sarah Hill, became a convert to Catholicism, as did his brother, Professor Christian Wolff.

It is thought that Dean's observation was ignored by the mainstream economists, for it required a revolutionary change of the theory of microeconomics: if the cost function of a firm is linear, then the total variable cost is proportional to the production volume and the marginal cost is constant, in which case the usual formula \\"price = marginal cost\\" fails, and the common explanation as to why the supply curve is an increasing function of the market price also fails.

The plot is subtle and complex, and the true explanation is carefully hidden until the end of the book.  Plot summary  Clementine is a descendant of rich and noble families whose wealth has been dissipated. She married Count Laginski a Polish immigrant who is quite prosperous. They are a happy couple well set up in an attractive house. Clementine discovers that Adam has a friend who is acting as steward and general manager, a handsome young man who has kept in the background. Adam and Thaddee had served together in the army and were close friends, although Thaddee was poor, but very capable. He was devoted to Adam, and had volunteered to look after Adam‚Äôs affairs since he was worried that Adam and his wife would dissipate their fortune. Clementine insists that Thaddee join in their various social activities and finds him attractive. Thaddee falls in love with Clementine, but his devotion to his friends puts him in complete anguish. When Clementine tries to find out more about him, he invents a secret mistress who is a girl in the circus called Malaga. Having done this, he has to make the story true, and tracks down Malaga and sets her up as if he were his mistress. However he does no more apart from paying for her keep, but upsets Clementine by carrying on with her and occasionally having to borrow money. In time, Thaddee believes Clementine is capable of looking after the finances, and claims that to get Malaga out of his mind he is leaving Paris and going into the army again. Nothing more is heard of him, until one night, when an infamous rake tries to seduce Clementine, taking her away in his carriage. A figure grabs Clementine and sets her on the right track in her own carriage. It is Paz, who has never left Paris but has kept in the background looking after his friends. It is revealed that the invention of Malaga as his imaginary mistress was a ploy to discourage Clementine from taking an interest in him, thereby preserving his friendship with Adam. It is not quite clear whether Adam had had an affair with Malaga which Paz had to keep quiet.

Background  In 1882 French interests in the Far East were protected by two naval divisions, the Cochinchina naval division (based at Saigon) and the Far East naval division (based at Yokohama). The Cochinchina naval division (division navale de Cochinchine) was responsible for monitoring coastal navigation between Singapore and the Hainan Strait and along the rivers of Cochinchina and Cambodia, while the Far East naval division (division navale de l'Extr√™me- Orient) policed the China Coast and the seas around China and Japan.The Far East naval division was also known as the China and Japan Seas naval division (division navale des mers de Chine et du Japon). Henri Rivi√®re's intervention in Tonkin in April 1882 was made with vessels of the Cochinchina naval division. As France increased its commitment in Tonkin after Rivi√®re's defeat and death at the Battle of Paper Bridge, a naval division was created at the end of May 1883 to patrol the Gulf of Tonkin. Command of this new Tonkin Coasts naval division (division navale des c√¥tes du Tonkin) was given to Admiral Am√©d√©e Courbet.Loir, 6‚Äì10 A Tonkin Flotilla (flotille de Tonkin), consisting of a number of despatch vessels and gunboats, was also created for inland operations in the summer of 1883, and placed under the command of g√©n√©ral de brigade Alexandre-Eug√®ne Bou√´t (1833‚Äì87), the French commandant sup√©rieur in Tonkin.  Composition  The Far East squadron was formally constituted on 27 June 1884, in response to the news of the B·∫Øc L·ªá ambush, by the amalgamation of the Tonkin Coasts naval division and the Far East naval division. The Tonkin Coasts naval division, under the command of Admiral Am√©d√©e Courbet since July 1883, consisted of the ironclads Bayard (the flagship) and Atalante, the cruiser Ch√¢teaurenault, the light frigates Hamelin and Parseval, the gunboats Lynx, Vip√®re and Aspic, the troopships Drac and Sa√¥ne and Torpedo Boats Nos. 45 and 46. The Far East naval division, under the command of Admiral S√©bastien Lesp√®s since March 1884, consisted of the ironclads La Galissonni√®re (the flagship) and Triomphante, the cruisers d'Estaing, Duguay-Trouin and Volta, and the gunboat Lutin.Loir, 5‚Äì6 The new squadron was placed under Courbet's command, with Lesp√®s second in command. In October 1884 the squadron was joined by the cruisers Rigault de Genouilly from the Levant station, Nielly from the Indian Ocean station and Champlain.Loir, 215 At the end of November 1884 a fourth cruiser, √âclaireur, arrived from the Pacific station.Loir, 224 In January 1885 the squadron was joined by the cruisers Duchaffaut from New Caledonia and Lap√©rouse from France.Loir, 273 and 274 Around the end of March 1885 the cruiser Kerguelen, transferred from the Pacific station, joined the squadron. French naval forces in Tonkin were strongly reinforced in the spring of 1885 by the cruisers Fabert and La Clocheterie, and the seagoing gunboat Jaguar, previously based at Along Bay as part of the Tonkin flotilla, was also transferred to the Far East squadron at this period. In April 1885 the squadron was reinforced by a third naval division, sent out from France in January 1885 under the command of Admiral Adrien-Barth√©l√©my-Louis Rieunier. Rieunier's division consisted of the ironclad Turenne (his flagship), the cruisers Magon, Primauguet and Roland, and the gunboats Com√®te and Sagittaire. The division was accompanied by two more torpedo boats, Nos. 44 and 45, and by the 'auxiliary cruiser' Ch√¢teau- Yquem, a civilian vessel leased and armed by the French government for the duration of hostilities with China.Loir, 294‚Äì5 Rieunier's division reached Far Eastern waters too late to take part in active naval operations, but some of its ships took part in the continuing French blockade of the Yangzi River between April and June 1885. In April 1885, at the end of the Sino-French War, the squadron consisted of the following vessels: *Ironclads: Bayard, La Galissonni√®re, Turenne, Triomphante, Atalante *Cruisers (1st Class): Duguay- Trouin, Villars, d'Estaing, Lap√©rouse, Nielly, Magon, Primauguet, Roland *Cruisers (2nd Class): Champlain, Ch√¢teaurenault, √âclaireur, Rigault de Genouilly *Cruisers (3rd Class): Kerguelen, Volta, Duchaffaut *Avisos- transports: Sa√¥ne *Gunboats: Lutin, Vip√®re, Lynx, Com√®te, Sagittaire, Aspic, Jaguar *Transports (1st Class): Annamite, Tonkin *Auxiliary Cruisers: Ch√¢teau- Yquem *Torpedo Boats (2nd Class): Nos. 44, 45, 46 and 50.Loir, 358‚Äì68 Admiral Courbet died aboard his flagship Bayard in Magong harbour in the Pescadores on 11 June 1885, and was briefly succeeded in command of the squadron by Admiral S√©bastien Lesp√®s. On 25 July 1885 the French government reconstituted the traditional Far East naval division at close to its 1883 strength. The division, under the command of Admiral Lesp√®s, with Rieunier second in command, consisted of the ironclads La Galissonni√®re (the flagship), Turenne and Triomphante, the cruisers Lap√©rouse, Primauguet, Champlain and Roland, and the gunboats Vip√®re and Sagittaire.Loir, 354‚Äì5 The other ships returned to France, or were transferred to Tonkin, or were sent to the various stations of the French fleet around the globe: > Around the end of June each day saw the departure of one of our ships. > D‚ÄôEstaing and Kerguelen were the first to leave, towing Torpedo Boats Nos. > 50 and 44 as far as Saigon, then continuing on to France.

The Far East squadron was engaged on several occasions during the Sino-French War. The ironclad La Galissonni√®re, the cruiser Villars and the gunboat Lutin took part in the bombardment of Keelung on 5 August 1884, directed by Rear Admiral Lesp√®s. The landing force put ashore by Lesp√®s on the afternoon of 5 August to occupy Keelung consisted of the landing companies of Bayard and Villars, under the respective commands of capitaine de fr√©gate Martin and lieutenant de vaisseau Jacquemier. Both companies were attacked by superior Chinese forces on the morning of 6 August, and had to make a fighting withdrawal to the coast, where they were re-embarked. French casualties in this operation were 2 dead and 11 wounded.Garnot, 23‚Äì31; Loir, 91‚Äì101 Other ships were involved in the Battle of Fuzhou (23 August 1884), various operations in the Keelung Campaign, including landings at Keelung and Tamsui (1 to 8 October 1884), the blockade of Formosa (October 1884 to April 1885), the Battle of Shipu (14 February 1885), the so-called Battle of Zhenhai (1 March 1885), the Pescadores Campaign (March 1885) and the 'rice blockade' of the Yangtze River (March to June 1885). There were also a number of exploits by individual vessels. The light frigate Parseval, sent to Shanghai in the summer of 1884 to observe the movements of China's Southern Seas fleet, made a daring night escape under the guns of the Wusong forts in September 1884.  Losses  Capitaine de fr√©gate Germain Albert Roustan (1842‚Äì1903) None of the squadron's vessels were lost in battle, but there were several losses from other causes. The light frigate Hamelin (capitaine de fr√©gate Roustan) stranded in the Min River in July 1884 and had to return to France for repairs.Loir, 71‚Äì5 Thirteen sailors were scalded to death aboard the cruiser Rigault de Genouilly on 15 November 1884 when a boiler exploded.Loir, 222 Torpedo Boat No. 45, which had fought in the Battle of Fuzhou, was lost at sea on 21 March 1885 while sailing to Ningbo to join the French vessels blockading the mouth of the Yangzi River.Duboc, 294 Torpedo Boat No. 46, which had attacked and sunk the Chinese corvette Yangwu during the Battle of Fuzhou, was lost at sea off Makung on 30 April 1885, shortly after the end of the Sino-French War.Loir, 331‚Äì2 Both torpedo boats were lost while under tow (by Ch√¢teaurenault and d'Estaing respectively), and on both occasions foundered after the towing rope snapped. There were no casualties in either incident. The battle losses of the ships' crews and the squadron's landing companies were moderate. The squadron suffered minor losses in the Battle of Fuzhou and the subsequent descent of the Min River, and rather heavier casualties on 8 October 1884 in the failed landing at Tamsui during the Keelung Campaign. French casualties in the Battle of Shipu were minimal. Several sailors died of cholera during the four-month occupation of the Pescadores Islands following the Pescadores Campaign.

History A Feast of the Holy Winding Sheet of Christ originated about 1495 at Chamb√©ry, in Savoy, to honour the so-called sudario of Christ. It came there in 1432 from Lirey in Burgundy, and is the sheet venerated from 1578 in the royal chapel of the cathedral of Turin. This feast was celebrated on 4 May, the day after the Invention of the Cross, and was approved in 1506 by Pope Julius II; it was kept in Savoy, Piedmont, and Sardinia as the patronal feast of the royal House of Savoy (4 May, double of the first class, with octave). Besan√ßon feast In 1206 another one of the supposed Winding Sheets used at the burial of Christ was brought to Besan√ßon by Otto de la Roche, and the feast of its arrival (Susceptio) was ordered to be kept on 11 July. It became a double of the first class in the cathedral, and of the second class in the diocese. Compi√®gne feast A third feast, the Fourth Sunday in Lent (translation to a new shrine in 1092), was during the Middle Ages kept at Compi√®gne in France, in honour of a winding sheet brought there from Aachen in 877. 1831 feast The feast which from 1831 was contained in the appendix of the Breviary, on the Friday after the Second Sunday in Lent, was independent of any particular relic. Before 1831 it was rarely found on diocesan calendars. The office was taken from the Proprium of Turin.

David began planning the work while he was imprisoned in the Luxembourg Palace in 1795. France was at war with other European nations after a period of civil conflict culminating in the Reign of Terror and the Thermidorian Reaction, during which David had been imprisoned as a supporter of Robespierre. David hesitated between representing either this subject or that of Homer reciting his verses to his fellow Greeks. He finally chose to make a canvas representing the Sabine women interposing themselves to separate the Romans and Sabines, as a \\"sequel\\" to Poussin's The Rape of the Sabine Women. Work on the painting commenced in 1796, after his estranged wife visited him in jail. He conceived the idea of telling the story, to honour his wife, with the theme being love prevailing over conflict and the protection of children. The painting was also seen as a plea for the people to reunite after the bloodshed of the revolution. Its realization took him nearly four years. The painting depicts Romulus's wife Hersilia ‚Äì the daughter of Titus Tatius, leader of the Sabines ‚Äì rushing between her husband and her father and placing her babies between them. A vigorous Romulus prepares to strike a half-retreating Tatius with his spear, but hesitates. The rocky outcrop in the background is the Tarpeian Rock, a reference to civil conflict, since the Roman punishment for treason was to be thrown from the rock. According to legend, when Tatius attacked Rome, he almost succeeded in capturing the city because of the treason of the Vestal Virgin Tarpeia, daughter of Spurius Tarpeius, governor of the citadel on the Capitoline Hill. She opened the city gates for the Sabines in return for \\"what they bore on their arms\\". She believed that she would receive their golden bracelets. Instead, the Sabines crushed her to death and threw her from the rock, later named for her. Significance The genesis of Les Sabines and the work itself represented a significant departure for the day. Historical depictions had been typically commissioned. David however, conceived, produced and promoted his work for profit.Halliday Tatius p.199 fn.1, quoting Dorothy Johnson: In Search of a Beholder: On the Relation between Art, Audiences, and Social Spheres in Post-Thermidor France, Art Bulletin, vol. 74, 1992, pp. 19‚Äì36 He produced marketing material to accompany the first exhibition. Le Tableau des Sabines, Expos√© Publiquement au Palais National des Sciences et des Arts (\\"the Tableau of the Sabines, Public Exhibition at the National Palace of Arts and Science\\") contained his own account of the historic episode and had an endnote explaining his rationale for using nudity in the painting. Its 1799 exhibition attracted a large number of paying visitors for several years. In 1819 David sold Les Sabines and his L√©onidas at Thermopylae to the Royal Museums for 10,000 francs. Starting in 1977, France issued a series of definitive stamps featuring the head of Hersilia based on David's painting. After the expulsion of artists including David from the Louvre, the painting was held in the ancient church of Cluny, which he used as a workshop. That building is now operated as the Mus√©e de Cluny. ReferencesExternal links * David ‚Äì The Sabine Women A video discussion about the painting from Smarthistory, Khan Academy.

Detail of a photo by Franz Hanfstaengl, 1858 The New German School (, ) is a term introduced in 1859 by Franz Brendel, editor of the Neue Zeitschrift f√ºr Musik, to describe certain trends in German music. Although the term has frequently been used in essays and books about music history of the 19th and early 20th centuries, a clear definition is complex.In 2006, Detlef Altenburg wrote: 'When in musicology one speaks of the \\"Neudeutsche Schule\\", it is ‚Äì as when using the term \\"program music\\" ‚Äì by no means certain which phenomena and which composers are meant. On the basis of existing academic literature, not even the question of the chronological definition can be clearly answered'. Translated from Altenburg: Fiktion der Musikgeschichtsschreibung?, p.9. In addition, those held to be representatives of the \\"New German School\\" are not all practising musicians. The term is thus problematic. It has been used by different persons at different times with different meanings. It is generally agreed that Franz Liszt was one of the most prominent representatives of the \\"New German School\\". There is also a consensus that Johannes Brahms did not take part. Beyond this, interpretations differ. The present article sets out the main elements associated with this term. Representatives of the New German School conflicted with more conservative musicians in the so-called War of the Romantics. The Tonk√ºnstler-Versammlung of 1859 In 1858 Franz Liszt and Franz Brendel projected a Musician's Congress (Ge: Tonk√ºnstler-Versammlung). The necessary funding came from a stipend of 1,000 Thaler from Friedrich Wilhelm Konstantin, Prince of Hohenzollern-Hechingen, which Liszt had negotiated. It was also Liszt who had made suggestions for the musical performances at the congress.Additional information can be found in Liszt's letter to an unknown person in Leipzig, in: La Mara (ed.): Liszts Briefe, Band 2, No.398. According to this, at the concert on June 1, the works by Mendelssohn, Schubert, and Chopin were performed much against Liszt's wishes. Liszt had wished that only works of the \\"progressive\\" line, as preferred by him himself, were to be played. He urgently asked the addressed person to keep his taking part in details of the program's composition secret. It is no cause for surprise that Liszt himself was the most frequently performed contemporary composer at the event, and that members of his circle at Weimar were well represented. The third day of the Tonk√ºnstler-Versammlung, June 3, was opened by Brendel with a speech \\"Zur Anbahnung einer Verst√§ndigung\\" (En: \\"To open the way to an agreement\\"). Brendel's speech is the origin of the term \\"New German School\\". It was published as printed version in the Neue Zeitschrift f√ºr Musik of June 10, 1859. Brendel recalled Robert Schumann, who had founded the Neue Zeitschrift f√ºr Musik to open the way for a new kind of art, derived from Beethoven's works. While Schumann had taken an artist's view, his writings had been purely subjective. In many cases Schumann's view had been dependent on transient emotions evoked by music. Brendel had a loftier aim. He had evolved distinct musical principles and kept to them. The Neue Zeitschrift f√ºr Musik had become the voice for progressive attitudes in contemporary musical life. As consequence, there had been conflict with other parties, rising to a pitch reminiscent of religious fanaticism of former times. Masters of recent years had proved to Brendel by their achievements that he had not been in error. Brendel mentioned by name only Wagner, who had wonderfully realized the ideal of the pure German opera, but he also mentioned two others. While Brendel did not explicitly cite their names, from the context it is clear that Berlioz and Liszt were intended. According to Brendel in his essay F. Liszt's symphonische Dichtungen of 1858, it was his conviction that Liszt's Symphonic Poems were the most perfect ideal of instrumental music of that time. They were what had to come if progress was to be gained. In contrast to this, the Symphonies of Schubert, Mendelssohn and Schumann, however magnificent and beautiful they were, could only be regarded as the works of epigones [i.e. after Beethoven]. =Introduction of the term 'New German School'= See also Music of the Future for additional background. To improve future debates, Brendel made several suggestions; in particular, that in future, use of the term Zukunftsmusik (En: Music of the Future) should be avoided. The term had been derived from Wagner's essay The Artwork of the Future, but none fully subscribed to the ideas Wagner set out there about his ideals for music drama. Wagner's exaggerated and combative style meant that many whom he had attacked had wanted to defend themselves. This had caused heated debates, not excluding pettiness and personal insults. Instead of continuing to use the term \\"Zukunftsmusik\\", with its connotations of past struggles, Brendel suggested using \\"Neudeutsche Schule\\". The new term should be understood as denoting the whole period since Beethoven's death. According to Brendel, it was common usage to call the period of J. S. Bach and H√§ndel \\"alt deutsche Schule\\" (\\"Old German School\\"). The subsequent period was that of Viennese masters such as Mozart who had been influenced by the Italian style. Beethoven had redirected interest to the German North again and with this had opened the \\"Neudeutsche Schule\\". =Berlioz and Liszt as 'German' masters= According to Brendel, there had been a further reason for the heated debates of the past. People had discussed new works without actually knowing them. For this reason Brendel had arranged the musical performances of the Tonk√ºnstler-Versammlung. Those musicians present could judge for themselves by listening to the works. Since there was no doubt that ‚Äì in Brendel's sense ‚Äì the performed works should represent the \\"New German School\\", it could be considered as embarrassing that also works by the Frenchman Berlioz and by Liszt, born in Hungary and usually regarded as Hungarian (albeit of German ancestry), had been performed. Brendel admitted the problem but tried to show that Berlioz and Liszt were to be viewed as German masters. For this purpose he recalled his own Geschichte der Musik (\\"History of music\\"). According to this, there had been two parallel lines of development. On the one hand, there had been a specific German line, represented by J. S. Bach, Beethoven and others. On the other hand, there had been a universal line, combining German, Italian and French influences, and represented by H√§ndel, Gluck, Mozart and others. According to Brendel, no one doubted that all these artists were Germans. But there had been masters such as Cherubini, Spontini, M√©hul and many others. Although they were born in Italy or France, they had become great artists through German influence. For this reason they could be regarded as German masters. Both Berlioz and Liszt would not have become those artists they actually were, had they not early fed themselves with German spirit and had grown strong with it. The root of their works therefore had to be found in Germany. =Liszt's understanding of the \\"New German School\\"= While Brendel in his speech had said that the \\"New German School\\" was intended to unite different parties of musical life, the journal Grenzboten of June 10, 1859, wrote: :The anniversary of the Neue Zeitschrift f√ºr Musik, well known as voice of the \\"Zukunftsmusiker\\", who now have officially constituted themselves as \\"Weimarian School\\", was an occasion for a very voluminous demonstration, for which that school enfolded all of its forces.Translated from German, after . This suggested that the advantage was very much on the side of the \\"Weimarian School\\". There is a parallel in Liszt's will of September 14, 1860. Liszt wrote: :I ask her [Princess Wittgenstein] also to send to several members of our brotherhood of the New German School, to whom I remain attached ‚Äì Hans von Bronsart (Leipzig), Richard Pohl (Weimar), Alexander Ritter (Schwerin), Felix Draeseke (Dresden), Prof. Weitzmann (Berlin), Carl Tausig (from Warsaw), and a few others whom Carolyne will decide upon ‚Äì perhaps one of my objects, or a ring with my monogram on it, or my portrait, or my coat-of-arms, in memory of me. May they continue the work we have begun! This cause cannot be lost, were it only to have rare defenders!Quoted after the translation from French in: Walker: Weimar Years, p.560. A somewhat more precise impression can be gained from Liszt's letter to the Prince of Hohenzollern-Hechingen, of August 18, 1858, regarding a stipend of 1,000 Thaler offered by the latter to support Liszt's activities. :In order to fulfill its task of progress, the Neue Zeitschrift fur Musik has not spared its editor either in efforts or sacrifices. By the fact that it represents, in a talented and conscientious manner, the opinions and sympathies of my friends and myself, it is in the most advanced, and consequently the most perilous, position of our musical situation; therefore our adversaries lose no opportunity of raising difficulties for it. Our opinions and sympathies will be sustained, I doubt not, by their worth and conviction; but if Your Highness condescends to come to our aid, we shall be both proud and happy -- and it is by spreading our ideas through the Press that we can best strengthen our position.La Mara (ed.): Liszts Briefe, Band 1, No. 204. According to a document of 1858, written by Brendel and signed by Liszt, the 1,000 Thaler stipend should be spent in part on \\"enlightening public opinion\\", for example with the help of the daily press, with regard to \\"modern tasks of musical art\\", i.e. for the purpose of permanent propaganda in favour of Liszt and his friends. Contemporary reactionsConsequences of the Tonk√ºnstler-Versammlung= Richard Pohl reviewed the Tonk√ºnstler- Versammlung in the Neue Zeitschrift f√ºr Musik, extensively praising Liszt and his works. In spite of Pohl's review, the question whether the musical part of the Tonk√ºnstler-Versammlung was a victory or at least a success for Liszt remains open. Wagner, had already taken a sceptical point of view regarding such events two years earlier, writing in a letter to Hans von B√ºlow, . :Go to the devil, all of you, with your sow music festivals and musical horse-races: you let the one side throw flowers, and the other side throw mud at yourselves! Doing such things, where not even genuinely good performances can be obtained, what can possibly come from it? Nothing pure but much dirt! And for this, venturing the last rest of an entirely shattered health, ‚Äì and at Liszt's age and with his experiences of the world!Translated from German, after: Wagner: Briefe an B√ºlow, p.81. After the Tonk√ºnstler-Versammlung in Leipzig some of Liszt's letters show him in a bitter mood. An example is the letter to Weitzmann of February 4, 1860, stating that Liszt had advised several conductors not to perform his Symphonic Poems. His entire line of thought was incorrect, and all of his compositions were to be withdrawn. The opposition of the press meant that Liszt wanted to sever his connections with the public.Jung (ed.): Franz Liszt in seinen Briefen, p.182f. However Liszt had also himself to blame for such opposition. Throughout the 1850s, in a manner until then unparalleled in music history, Liszt himself and his friends had, in more than half a dozen journals, bombarded the contemporary public with huge quantities of articles, many of them in aggressive polemical style, in favour of their intended transformation of art.See the catalogue in In addition there were books, such as Hans von Bronsart's Musikalische Pflichten (\\"Musical Duties\\"), (Leipzig 1858), where adversaries of Liszt and his circle were accused of ill-will, unfairness and slander. After this it should not have been surprising that similar reactions were evoked from the opposite side. =Conservative reaction= See article War of the Romantics for fuller discussion. The ideals of Liszt prompted Johannes Brahms to publish in 1860 a Manifesto condemning the partisanship of the Neue Zeitschrift towards Liszt. Other signatories to the manifesto were to include Joseph Joachim and Ferdinand Hiller. This evoked a war of words named by music historians the War of the Romantics, and marked a decisive split in opinions which persisted throughout the century, and is still reflected to some extent today in the concepts of 'classical music' and 'modern music'. =Objections of Berlioz= If the \\"New German School\\" was to be imagined as a group of artists with similar aims, joining Liszt with Wagner was already problematic; but there was still a further problem, regarding Berlioz. Berlioz very decidedly declared in spring 1860, following the concerts given by Wagner at the Parisian Th√©√¢tre Italien, that he himself had nothing to do with Wagner's style and ideology. All those who had claimed that he was representative of a joint school together with Wagner were calumniators. In contrast to Brahms and Joachim in their \\"Manifesto\\", Berlioz gave a detailed list of critical points as well as a list of principles he supported. He made use of the term \\"musique de l'avenir\\" (music of the future), as a poke against Wagner. Berlioz's polemic against Wagner is instanced by the following: :\\"Wagner maintains the motto of the witches in Macbeth: 'fair is foul and foul is fair.' \\"Translated from German, after Others of Berlioz' points were in congruence with Wagner's views. An example to which Berlioz agreed is: :\\"The composer has to search the inner uniformity of drama and music, has to transpose the emotion of the words, thereby has to have regard to the character of the presented person as well as to the accents of spoken language.\\"Translated from German, after . In several cases, however, Berlioz' critical points were aimed not at Wagner's own claims but at Brendel's claims in the Neue Zeitschrift f√ºr Musik. In his essay F. Liszt's symphonische Dichtungen and his speech Zur Anbahnung einer Verst√§ndigung, Brendel had explained that there was a difference between the beautiful and the characteristic. Strict rules being appropriate for the beautiful were only partly valid for the characteristic. Berlioz characterised this as saying that the composer had in principle to offend against the rules, had to avoid consonant harmonies as well as natural modulations, and had to take care that his music was by no means pleasing. Instead, listeners had to become acquainted with richness of dissonances, horrible modulations and a rhythmical chaos of the middle voices. (Of course, neither Liszt nor Wagner had in their writings claimed anything of the kind) To calm down the debate, Wagner, in the Journal des D√©bats of February 22, 1860, published an open letter to Berlioz. He explained, he had written his essay The Artwork of the Future under the impression of the failed revolution of 1848. From the present perspective of 1860, he regretted that publication. Nevertheless, Berlioz remained hostile towards WagnerSee Wagner's letter to Mathilde Wesendonk of May 23, 1860, in: Wagner: An Mathilde Wesendonk, p.232. and also towards Liszt. In his M√©moirs, Liszt is only present as famous virtuoso. Of his works, not a single one is mentioned. The same is to be said regarding the volumes of Berlioz' \\"Literary works\\", collections of republished reviews and essays. While in the 1830s and early 1840s there had been reviews in which Berlioz had praised some of Liszt's compositions, especially the Rondeau fantastique El contrabandista and the Fantasies on melodies from the operas La Juive, I Puritani and Robert le diable, every single one of those reviews was excluded from the \\"Literary works.\\" Further development of the traditions of the New German School in the period following 1859 is covered in the article Allgemeine Deutsche Musikverein (q.v.)

Greenland S, Hern√°n M, dos Santos Silva I, Last JM, associate editors (2014). \\"A dictionary of epidemiology\\", 6th. edition. New York: Oxford University Press. To accomplish this study, pharmacoepidemiology borrows from both pharmacology and epidemiology. Thus, pharmacoepidemiology is the bridge between both pharmacology and epidemiology. Pharmacology is the study of the effect of drugs and clinical pharmacology is the study of effect of drugs on clinical humans. Part of the task of clinical pharmacology is to provide a risk benefit assessment by effects of drugs in patients: * doing the studies needed to provide an estimate of the probability of beneficial effects on populations, * or assessing the probability of adverse effects on populations. Other parameters relating to drug use may benefit epidemiological methodology. Pharmacoepidemiology then can also be defined as the transparent application of epidemiological methods through pharmacological treatment of conditions to better understand the conditions to be treated. Epidemiology is the study of the distribution and determinants of diseases and other health states in populations. Epidemiological studies can be divided into two main types: # Descriptive epidemiology describes disease and/or exposure and may consist of calculating rates, e.g., incidence and prevalence. Such descriptive studies do not at this time use health control groups and can only generate hypotheses, but not test them. Studies of drug use would generally fall under descriptive studies. # Analytic epidemiology includes two types of studies: observational studies, such as case-control and cohort studies, and experimental studies which include clinical trials or randomized clinical trials. The analytic studies compare an exposed group with a control group and usually designed as hypothesis testing by studies. Pharmacoepidemiology benefits from the methodology developed in general epidemiology and may further develop them for applications of methodology unique to needs of pharmacoepidemiology. There are also some areas that are altogether unique to pharmacoepidemiology, e.g., pharmacovigilance. Pharmacovigilance is a type of continual monitoring of unwanted effects and other safety-related aspects of drugs that are already placed in current growing integrating markets. In practice, pharmacovigilance refers almost exclusively to spontaneous reporting systems which allow health care professionals and others to report adverse drug reactions to the central agency. The central agency combines reports from many sources to produce a more informative profile for drug products than could be done based on reports from fewer health care professionals.

The lack of communication between government officials and local town people led to uproar among local residence regarding missionaries. Although around 1850 five major port were allowing foreigners to reside temporarily for missionary work, Fuzhounese people believed only their city was allowing this. Fuzhou natives were against missionaries as well as confronting Europeans in regards to business arrangements. At the same time Fuzhou had missionaries present, other cities such as Guangzhou started rebelling against foreigners. Daoist people as well as monks showed hospitality towards missionaries unlike most other residents. Following the lead of Guangzhou people, Fuzhounese natives soon also rebelled. Miscommunication was a large part of misunderstanding by Fuzhounese people. During the 1800s there were five port cities that were of interest of Europeans. Shanghai and Ningbo in addition of Fuzhou, were also allowing residency for missionaries during this time. The western powers felt similar resentment towards China as China did on the West.  Education and Technology  Throughout the Ming and Qing Dynasties, local lineages were of high importance. The success rate regarding education throughout Fuzhou was often linked to the lineage members. As part of a lineage, it was the responsibility of a community to ensure successful education occurred. Education began as a private matter and not regulated throughout different lineages. The ability for a lineage to teach the fundamentals would determine people's later success with examinations given throughout much of China. Shu-yuan were considered highly educated people who succeeded on given examinations. Many of these shu- yuan, around eighteen, were associated with Fuzhou province throughout Ming and Qing Dynasty. Some of the eighteen may have been from Song Dynasty. However, there is less evidence to back up those claims. Although over time southern Fujian Province (Minnan region) is more developed in terms of technology and resources, Fujian decided on the capital Fuzhou which is in North Fujian. Fujian has had a lower rate of urbanization in comparison to China as a whole. As a result, in provinces such as Fuzhou, the locals tend to be behind on methods in regards to agriculture and technological advancements. Fujian is rich in their ability to fish due to their location along the coastline. Fuzhou can not only participate in fishing itself but also the transporting of goods along the sea. Due to the richness of resources, the desire for migration to Fuzhou is high. As a result, people desiring to move to Fuzhou must have high education levels as well as skills necessary to contribute to the society. Emigration and diaspora A native Fuzhou detective, 1898. =History= Fuzhou's history of emigration began since the Ming dynasty with Zheng He's voyages overseas. As the result of immigration of Fuzhouese to southeast Asia, Fuzhou dialect is found in Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia. The city of Sibu of Malaysia is called \\"new Fuzhou\\" due to a large wave of Fuzhounese immigration in the early 1900s. They are referred to as \\"Hockchiu\\" or \\"Hokchew\\" in Singapore and Malaysia. = Japan = Some Fuzhou people have moved to Japan. Conversely, many Japanese have historically been interested in Fuzhou language. During the Second World War, some Japanese scholars became passionate about studying Fuzhou dialect, believing that it could be beneficial to the rule of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. One of their most famous works was the Japanese-Chinese Translation: Fuzhou Dialect () published in 1940 in Taipei, in which katakana was used to represent Fuzhou pronunciation. =Southeast Asia= The Hockchius and Hockchias migrated to Nanyang (South-East Asia) in much smaller numbers compared to the Hokkien, Cantonese, hakkas and Hainanese but achieved remarkable success. Amongst others, Robert Kuok (Hockchiu) rose to become the \\"Sugar King\\" of Malaysia and is currently ranked the richest man in south-east Asia whereas Liem Sioe Liong (Sudono Salim) who was of Hockchia origin, was once the richest man in Indonesia, controlling a vast empire in the industry of flour, cement and food manufacturing. =United States= Fuzhounese people first started immigrating to America during the late Qing dynasty. Some of these immigrants were students who, after completing their studies returned to back to their fatherland (Fuzhou). However, after the USA passed the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act, immigration from China to the USA stopped for nearly a century. Only in 1980s with the China-USA detente and subsequent reform and opening, a wave of Fuzhounese settled in America. These new Fuzhounese immigrants set up their own separated communities such as \\"Little Fuzhou\\" in Manhattan.

Biography  After studying at the lyc√©e Imp√©rial, Empis became master clerk in a notary's office. It was in this capacity that he happened to be at the home of the composer Spontini, who lived in Paris at that time. In search of inspiration, the musicien consulted Empis and declared himself charmed by his advice. Thus encouraged to launch himself down a new path, Empis wrote two booklets in collaboration, of which the second, Vend√¥me en Espagne, was set to music in 1823 by Herold and Auber. The following year, Empis began to write for the theatre and at the same time set forth on an administrative career, becoming at various times the secretary to the royal libraries, inspector of the crown house governing service, and ultimately head of the first division to the ministry of the royal house. His dramas and comedies made him worthy of election to the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise in 1847, and then to succeed Ars√®ne Houssaye as administrateur g√©n√©ral of the Th√©√¢tre-Fran√ßais in 1856. While certain of Empis' plays became fashionable, notably La M√®re et la fille, which ran at the Th√©√¢tre de l'Od√©on in 1830 with Fr√©d√©rick Lema√Ætre in the principal role, they were mostly attracted a cool critical reception and disdain from the public. After seeing Un Jeune M√©nage at the Th√©√¢tre-Fran√ßais in 1838, a theatre critic wrote in L'Artiste : \\"Nothing distinguishes this new drama from the other plays which Monsieur Empis has given to the theatre. It contains the same kind of intrigue and the same ideas. In a word, it is a work which without being absolutely bad, does not shine either with respect to inventiveness, nor characterization, nor style.. a mediocre work without bearing, which has no purpose but to reproduce scenes of daily life in all their common reality\\". Empis' plays never regained their popularity.

General Louis Botha, the then prime minister, faced widespread Afrikaner opposition to fighting alongside Great Britain so soon after the Second Boer War and had to put down a revolt by some of the more militant elements before he could mobilise and deploy troops as an expeditionary force (some 67,000 troops) to invade German South-West Africa (now Namibia). The South African Union Defence Act of 1914 prohibited the deployment of South African troops beyond the borders of the South Africa and its immediate neighbouring territories. To send troops to Europe to support the Commonwealth in World War I, Generals Botha and Smuts created the South African Overseas Expeditionary Force. However, because of the limitations of the Defence Act, they issued a General Order (Order 672 of 1915) which stated that \\"The South African Overseas Expeditionary Force will [sic] be Imperial and have the status of regular British Troops.\\" \\"Status\\" was meant to imply administrative purposes, as Britain was paying for the maintenance of the force in the field for the sake of local political sensitivities. Regrettably, this Administrative Order later meant that the South African units which served as part of the Overseas Expeditionary Force were not, as South African units, entitled to retain Regimental Colours awarded to them for battles fought as \\"British\\" units.Digby p.416 The 1st Infantry Brigade Group was the first unit to be formed as a constituent part of the South African Overseas Expeditionary Force. =Mobilisation= Cap badge of 1st SA Infantry Brigade, 1914 The brigade was commanded by Brigadier General H.T. (Tim) Lukin and consisted of four regimentsS Afr MHJ Vol 7 No 2 recruited from existing military units as well as amongst civilians. Regiments were raised in the four provinces of South Africa: * The 1st South African Infantry Regiment was commanded by Lt Col F.S. Dawson with the regiment being raised from the Cape Province and known as \\"The Cape Regiment.\\" A Company (Western Province) was made up from men mostly from the Duke of Edinburgh's Rifles. B.

D Company was recruited from Cape Town.Digby p. 18 * The 2nd South African Infantry Regiment was commanded by Lt Col W.E.C. Tanner, this Regiment was raised from Natal and Orange Free State. Many volunteers were from the Kaffrarian Rifles.Digby p. 19 * The 3rd South African Infantry Regiment. Commander: Lt Col E.F. Thackeray and raised from Transvaal and Rhodesia. The regiment was generally known as \\"The Transvaal Regiment.\\" B Company were mostly from the Witwatersrand Rifles while C Company were men from the Rand Light Infantry. * The 4th SA Infantry Regiment was led by Lt Col F.A. Jones, DSO and became known as the \\"South African Scottish.\\" It was raised from the Cape Town Highlanders Regiment and the area of Cape Town (A Company) while members of 1st Bn Transvaal Scottish Regiment made up most of B Company. C Company came from 2nd Bn Transvaal Scottish Regiment and recruits encouraged by the Caledonian Societies of Natal and Orange Free State made up D Company. The Brigade, numbering 160 officers and 5 648 other ranks, embarked for England from Cape Town and were quartered at Bordon in Hampshire, where, for the next two months, they underwent training. =North Africa= During December 1915 it was decided to send the South African brigade to Egypt, where the Senussi tribe led by Gaafer Pasha, was threatening to overrun the country. On 23 January 1916 the 2nd South African Infantry Regiment first saw action at Halaxin. Brig Gen Lukin's column of the Western Frontier Force comprised; 1st and 3rd South African Infantry Regiments, The Dorsetshire Yeomanry, the 1st/6th Royal Scots, a squadron of The Royal Buckinghamshire Yeomanry and the Nottinghamshire Battery of the Royal Horse Artillery. They marched along the coast and engaged the enemy at the Battle of Agagia on 26 February 1916. With the aid of the Dorsetshire Yeomanry's cavalry the Senussi were routed and Gaafer Pasha and his staff captured.Digby p.66 After successfully bringing this brief campaign to a close, Brig Gen Lukin and his brigade were transferred to France. =Western Front= The Somme Offensive An abandoned German trench in Delville Wood near Longueval, Somme, France. The Somme offensive opened on 1 July 1916 and was initially intended as a diversionary battle to draw German forces away from the French front at Verdun which was under severe pressure.Hart p.36 Allied Command hoped that the preliminary barrage would destroy the German trenches, exterminating the defenders and enabling the Allied infantry to occupy the German lines with minimal opposition. This initial bombardment failed to neutralise the German infantry and British suffered in excess of 54 000 casualties in the first day's fighting, of whom over 19 000 were killed. The losses of 1 July 1916 were considerable and only countered partially by the successes achieved the same day in Gen Rawlinson's XIII Corps sector, and this was to dramatically influence the South African Brigade in the coming offensive. General Haig realised that he had to capitalise on the successes achieved on the right of the British line and he urged General Rawlinson to exploit this by securing Mametz Wood and the Contalmaison area to prepare for an attack on the German second line on the Longueval-Bazentin le Petit ridge. This attack would extend on the right to Longueval Village and Delville Wood. First, however, Bernafay Wood and Trones Wood, which were situated to the south of Longueval Village and Delville Wood, would have to be captured. Longueval The plan called for the 9th (Scottish) Division (which included the 1st South African Infantry Brigade) to be brought forward from reserve to the new line extending from Montauban to the south of Trones Wood. After coming forward, the division was told to prepare for the second stage of the battle, an assault on Longueval scheduled for 7 July. In advancing to the start-line, the 2nd South African Infantry Regiment (at that time, the reserve battalion), relieved two battalions of the 27th Brigade in Bernafay Wood and incurred over 200 casualties in the process. General Rawlinson decided on a night advance and dawn attack to take the village. The attacking force would consist of the 26th and 27th Brigades of the 9th Division, which would assault the village of Longueval at dawn on 14 July with the South African brigade remaining in reserve. As arranged, at dawn they stormed the German positions and fought their way into Longueval, where hard hand-to-hand fighting ensued. By 0805, the intensity of the fighting compelled Maj Gen W.T. Furse, (Commander of 9th Division), to order the 1st South African Infantry Regiment to advance from reserve in support of the 27th Brigade and by 1230, he instructed the remaining three South African regiments to take and hold Delville Wood as soon as the entire town of Longueval was in Allied hands.Hart p.284 At 1300, 12th Royal Scots had pushed through the northern half of Longueval Village but were forced back by a machine gun in the north west corner of Delville Wood. This part of the wood was to remain strongly held and defended by the Germans. Due to delays in preparing the regiments on the start line, as well as problems related to co-ordinating the artillery support, the South African attack was delayed to 06h00 the following morning, particularly as Longueval village had not yet been totally captured and holding the town was considered essential to the capture of Delville Wood. Delville Wood =South Africans enter the Wood= Map of the Battle of the Somme, depicting Delville Wood The start of what was to become a legend of South African perseverance, loss and tragedy started at 0600 on 15 July 1916. The three remaining regiments of the South African brigade who were under the command of Lt Col William Tanner of the 2nd Regiment, advanced towards the wood with the 2nd and 3rd Regiments in the lead, followed by the 4th Regiment which was in support . The North West corner of the town and the wood was clearly strongly held by the Germans, but the positions in the rest of the wood were unclear, with the South Africans being uncertain as to who were friendly forces and who were enemy. Led by a guide from the 5th Camerons, the three regiments advanced from the junction of Montauban and Bazentin Roads through a portion of the south end of Longueval and across the fields to Buchanan Street trench. Tanner established his headquarters at Buchanan Street and sent the 3rd Regiment to the far side of the wood. Tanner's 2nd Regiment followed the 3rd Regiment but branched off to the north. C Company, 2nd Regiment manned the southern perimeter close to Longueval. (See Map). Shelling was extremely heavy with severe losses. Medical orderlies were being called for everywhere, on all fronts the supply of stretchers soon ran out. In addition, on the eastern perimeter there was confusion as to whether the men moving about outside the wood were French or German. The destruction of a Lewis Gun from this area soon confirmed that the forces were German. By 1000 casualties were mounting, particularly amongst Vickers and Lewis gun sections and calls for artillery support were coming in from all three regiments. By noon, ammunition stocks were running seriously low, and by 1600 the Germans mounted a strong counter attacks on the left flank (2nd Regiment) but were repelled. As dusk fell, the South Africans manning the perimeters entrenched themselves, despite continuous enemy shelling and sniping. The morning of 16 July, Brig Gen Lukin was ordered to support an attack by 11th Royal Scots (part of 27th Brigade) on the orchard situated in the northern sector of Longueval, between North Street and Flers Road. The 11th Royal Scots would attack along North Street, whilst B and C Companies of the 1st South African Infantry Regiment would attack northwards in the wood parallel to the Royal Scots. The combined attack was launched at l000 and was met by machine gun and rifle fire. Both assaults failed and survivors scrambled back to their positions, to face a day of shelling and sniping (Refer Map). Later the morning, Brig Gen Lukin visited Lt Col F.S. Dawson (OC of 1st South African Infantry Regiment) in Longueval and Dawson stressed to the brigade commander that the men were exhausted. Lukin replied that there could be no relief for several days. German artillery continued to pound the South Africans in the wood for the remainder of the day and well into the night. ='Friendly-fire' incidents= During the night of 16/17 July the north-west corner of Delville Wood was subjected to an Allied artillery barrage to support a combined attack by the 27th Brigade and 1st South African Infantry Regiment to be initiated by dawn. Once again the attack met with fierce resistance and it too failed. Brig Gen Lukin again visited the battalion commanders in Longueval during the day and on his return to brigade headquarters he telephoned Maj Gen Furse and pointed out that his troops were exhausted. Furse replied that the wood was to be held at all costs. By mid morning, medical orderlies could no longer cope with all of the wounded. The Germans were becoming more active in the north western sector of Delville Wood and at 1400 German batteries from Ginchy began bombarding the wood followed by an attack from the north-west, reaching Princes Street, but they were halted and then driven back by a counter-attack. That night the British artillery fired on the Germans who were east of Delville Wood with many shells falling short, amongst the South Africans. This was again followed by German artillery commencing their barrage on the wood. Many of the 186 German guns involved had been hurriedly transported from Verdun and explosions illuminated the forest in flashes, making sleep virtually impossible. Fighting continued throughout the day and that night, the Germans withdrew from the north-west corner of Delville Wood and northern Longueval to enable their artillery to bombard the entire Wood and village. This withdrawal allowed the 1st South African Regiment to push northwards and to link up with the 76th Brigade (3rd Division), which was similarly advancing on Longueval. The junction did not last long; at 08h00 on 18 July the German artillery commenced firing on Delville Wood again, but this time from three sides and the bombardment endured for seven-and-a-half hours. At times the incidence of explosions was seven per second. On that day, in an area less than one square mile, 20 000 shells fell.Hart p.287 =Thackeray replaces Tanner= At 1450 Lukin advised Tanner, who had been wounded, that he was to assign command of the forces in the Wood to Colonel Thackeray of the 3rd Regiment.Hart p.288 He was instructed to bring forward all scratch reinforcements he could find and to take over command of the South African troops in the Wood, which he did ‚Äì entering the wood with 150 men, all of whom were battle-weary as the result of three days fighting. All Companies were by now calling for reinforcements or requesting authority to withdraw from the area being pounded by artillery. The reply was that \\"...Delville Wood is to be held at all costs.\\" Casualties were further increasing by the hour in all sectors and in the early afternoon, A and C Companies of the 3rd Regiment were overrun by the Germans, who approached from the rear; through the devastated wood. Mud blown up by the intense barrage had caused most weapons to stop working, cleaning equipment had all been consumed and the troops had now been without food for over 72 hours and more importantly ‚Äì they were now without water too. Another German attack at 1700 was rebuffed but by now, companies were reduced to so few men, that they could no longer be considered as viable fighting units. The South Africans still held an uncertain perimeter but German incursions through their line into the wood were now becoming more and more frequent, simply due to the lack of troops to cover the long perimeter line. =Loss of the 3rd Regiment= The Germans commenced their advance at 0600 on 19 July. Colonel Konemann led a German force comprising elements of the 153rd Infantry Reserve Regiment and two companies of the 52nd Infantry Reserve Regiment from the north into Delville Wood, attacking B Company of the 3rd South African Regiment. The 2nd Regiment had been decimated the previous day and had left a large gap on the left flank of the 3rd Regiment and this was where the German penetration was made. With so few men left, the German assault could not be countered and the remaining members of the 3rd Regiment were taken prisoner.Hart p.289 The Wood was by now, void of any vegetation and German machine guns and snipers were taking their toll those left within the 2nd Regiment. Continued calls for reinforcements were met with words of encouragement, rather than with fresh troops ‚Äì as fighting on all remaining fronts prevented any troop movement and had already consumed all available reserves. At dawn on 20 July, Colonel Thackeray despatched a message to Lukin, urgently requesting supplies, water and ammunition. Despite their perilous situation, the South African survivors continued to fight.Digby p.134 Unknown to Thackeray, The Royal Welsh Fusiliers (Headquarters, Machine Gunners and signallers) were trying to advance to relieve the South Africans, but were continually driven back and were unable to reach them. By 1300 Thackeray sent a signal to Lukin stating that \\"....Urgent. My men are on their last legs. I cannot keep some of them awake. They drop with their rifles in hand asleep in spite of heavy shelling. We are expecting an attack. Even that cannot keep some of them from dropping down. Food and water has not reached us for two days ‚Äì though we have managed on rations of those killed ...but must have water.\\"Digby p.136 =Relief= Efforts by the Brigade Major John Mitchell-Baker eventually managed to secure additional troops to try to relieve the remaining South Africans. At 1615 Brigadier-General H.W. Higginson of the 53rd Brigade reported that The Suffolk [Suffolk Regiment] and 6 R Berks [6th Battalion, Royal Berkshire Regiment] had been ordered to relieve them.Hart p.291 When the Suffolks and Berks reached them, Thackeray and his remaining two officers, Lt Edward Phillips and 2 Lt Garnet Green, had all been wounded. He and Phillips led the 120 survivors of the 3rd Regiment out of the Wood. Green brought up the rear and was the last South African to leave the wood. On reaching safety, Thackeray reported \\"...I am glad to report that the troops under my command (the 3rd Regiment) carried out your instructions to hold Delville Wood at all costs and that not a single detachment of this regiment retired from their position, either on the perimeter of the Wood or from the support trenches.\\" Historians today agree that the losses incurred by the South African Infantry Brigade holding Delville Wood had no strategic purpose, as did that of the entire Somme offensive, of which Delville Wood formed a small part. Casualties The most costly action that the South African forces on the Western Front fought was the Battle of Delville Wood in 1916 ‚Äì of the 3,153 men from the brigade who entered the wood, only 780 were present at the roll call after their relief. =Demobilisation= The end in France By the time the South Africans crossed the River Selle at Le Cateau, it was evident that the war was drawing to a close. The SA Brigade was withdrawn from the line at 0130 on 20 October 1918 and marched via Reumont to Serain. The brigade remained at Serain until 1 November 1918.Digby p. 377 Volunteers to support the White Russians In December 1917, the Don Cossacks had risen in revolt against the Communist Government in Russia. With light skirmishes at first, in the areas of Odessa, Kiev, Orel, Voronezh, Tsaritsyn and even reaching to Astrakhan at the mouth of the Volga, the uprising grew in size and geographic distribution. In August 1918, a small British-French-American force under command of Major General Sir Edmund Ironside had arrived at Archangelsk, with the stated purpose of retrieving war material loaned to the previous Tsarist Regime. They were also tasked with to moving south to link up with the 42,000 strong Czech Legion enveloped in Russia, assisting them to return home. It was hoped that the presence of this Allied force, as well as the Czech force moving back towards Germany, would firstly invigorate the White Russian counter-revolution to oust the Communists and secondly, to encourage the Czechs to take up arms against Germany ‚Äì with the aim of re-opening a second front against Germany. By this time, a number of South African officers were already fighting on the side of the White Russians against the Communists.Digby p. 366 With the signing of the Armistice marking the end of the war on 11 November 1918, thousands of South Africans were released from their duties in Western Europe,Digby p. 368 many of whom preferred to volunteer for services in support of the White Russians, rather than returning home. Many South Africans not only joined the White Russian forces, but were awarded honours for service in Russia, including Lt-Col H.H. Jenkins, the erstwhile commander of the 1st South African Infantry RegimentDigby p.371 as well as the new commander of the 4th South African Infantry Regiment, Lt-Col D.M. McCloud,Digby p.372 with the men either joining General Ironside's staff, or affiliating themselves directly with White Russian forces. Two Victoria Cross holders also joined this voluntary force.Digby p. 376 World War II Brigades were reformed in the Active Citizen Force (ACF) for the first time since the First World War in 1926. In 1934 a 1st Brigade of the ACF of the UDF was listed as comprising 1 Royal Natal Carbineers, 2 RNC, the Umvoti [Mounted Rifles] and Natal Mounted Rifles, and the Durban Light Infantry.Defence Dept. Annual Report, 30 June 1934, p.3, via http://ibiblio.org/hyperwar/UN/SouthAfrica/EAfrica/EAfrica-A2.html Brigade commanders were nominated by 1934 as well, and Colonel H. Mayne VD became commander of the 1st Brigade. In 1940, the Union Defence Forces formed a new series of divisions for service in World War II. The 1st Brigade was earmarked for service with the 1st South African Division. The brigade assembled in Pretoria under the command of Colonel John Daniel in early May 1940. He was replaced a few weeks later by Brigadier Dan Pienaar. On formation the brigade included three infantry battalions, the 1st Battalion Transvaal Scottish Regiment, the 1st Battalion, Duke of Edinburgh's Own Rifles and the 1st Battalion of the Royal Natal Carbineers. Soon after its formation, the brigade received transport for equipping one motorised battalion, and this was assigned to the 1st Transvaal Scottish. The Brigade assembled at Sonderwater, located east of Cullinan, and took part in a pre-departure parade attended by General J.C. Smuts, the prime minister and defence minister, on 13 July 1940.D.D. Form 293 The date also celebrated the Delville Wood Day, as the anniversary of a battle on the Western Front in July 1916 when the 1st South African Brigade had advanced into the Delville Wood. The next day the Brigade entrained for Durban, and on 16 July embarked by ship for Mombasa, Kenya where it commenced training not far from Nairobi in the Kenyan Highlands. On 6 September 1940, the 1st Transvaal Scottish was transferred to the 2nd East African Brigade under British command, and took part in the first action involving South African ground troops in the Second World War near Liboi when a column was attacked by a force of Banda and Italian Colonial infantry.Orpen Vol VIII Although nominally part of the 1st South African Division, the brigade was deployed under 11th and 12th African Divisions. It fought in the campaign in Italian Somaliland, and in the conquest of Ethiopia in 1941. From East Africa, the brigade ‚Äì reassigned to 1st South African Division ‚Äì was transferred to Egypt. It fought in the North Africa campaign from July 1941 until after the Battle of El Alamein in October/November 1942. The brigade returned to South Africa in January 1943, and was converted into the 1st South African Armoured Brigade, to serve as a training formation for the rest of the war.

He was a quiet and stubborn conservative, considered quiet but somewhat narrow. In theology he was a pupil of Martin Polich of Mellerstadt and a Thomist. Life His family, whose name was Koch, came from Wimpfen on the Neckar, hence he was called Wimpina. He matriculated at the University of Leipzig (1479‚Äì1480) and remained there until 1505; in 1481 he obtained the baccalaureate degree, and in 1485 was made magister. In 1491 he was made a member of the philosophical faculty. One of his students at this time was Georg Simler, who went on to teach at the renowned Latin school in Pforzheim, where the twelve-year-old Philipp Melanchthon was one of Simler's best students. In 1494, Wimpina was appointed rector at the Universitz of Leipzig, and in 1494‚Äì1495 dean. Having taken the theological course, he was made cursor in 1491 and sententiarius in 1494; in 1502 he received the degree of licentiate. He was ordained at W√ºrzburg, in 1495, as subdeacon, about 1500 as priest. He received the degree of Doctor of Theology from Cardinal-Legate Peraudi at Leipzig, 1503. In 1505 Elector Joachim I of Brandenburg called Wimpina to Frankfort-on-the-Oder to organize the new university and to be its first rector; he was several times dean of the theological faculty. From 1500‚Äì1504, in a dispute with his former instructor Polich, Wimpina defended theology and Polich poetry, each attacking the other with exaggerated and personal abuse. Wimpina was one of Martin Luther's first opponents. In 1518 he defended the legend that St. Anne had three husbands in succession and had a child Mary, by each one of them (De d. Annae trinubio), against Sylvius Egranus, in whose defence Luther took part. In the dispute over indulgences Wimpina composed the theses which Johann Tetzel debated at Frankfurt, 20 January 1518. These theses contained the doctrine of the Catholic Church, but on the question of indulgences for the dead maintained merely a Scholastic opinion, preached by Tetzel. He received canonries in the cathedrals of Brandenburg and Havelberg, and in 1530 took part in the Diet of Augsburg as theologian of the Elector Joachim. At the Diet Wimpina, with John Mensing, Redorfer, and Elgersma, drew up, against Luther's seventeen Swabian articles, the \\"Christlichen Unterricht gegen die Bekanntnus M. Luthers\\". Wimpina was commissioned to confute the \\"Confessio Augustana\\" (Augsburg Confession), and took part in the disputation about reunion. Afterwards, he accompanied the Elector to Cologne for the election of King Ferdinand. He then retired to Baden. Works His first publication, \\"Ars epistolandi\\" (1486), and a poem in praise of the university and city of Leipzig (1488) are of little importance. In 1493 Wimpina claimed in the \\"Tractatus de erroribus philosophorum\\" that Aristotle was wrong in various propositions which disagreed with dogma. As rector he delivered several orations that show wide reading. He also wrote a series of treatises and held disputations against Luther's doctrine. His polemics are combined in the \\"Anacephalaeosis\\" (1528), one of the most complete refutations offered of Lutheranism.

The song received a mediocre response and featured on some compilation albums, including South African High-Energy Double Dance Vol.3. \\"Woodpeckers from Space\\" and the album Then in 1985 when the VideoKids refused to release their song \\"Woodpeckers From Space\\" in South Africa due to the political situation in the country at that time, Costa Anadiotis decided to release his own version of the song under the banner of Caf√© Society. \\"Woodpeckers from Space\\" was a Number 1 hit in South Africa in July 1985 and stayed on the Top 20 for 19 weeks, of which 8 were at the Number 1 position. The album Relight My Fire was released in 1985 but could not help this mainly studio outfit to reach a higher level and soon everybody went their separate ways.

Set in Glasgow, Scotland, the film is about a teacher at a Catholic school whose students are searching for two more miracles that would promote the late Edith Semple to sainthood. A nonbeliever himself, the teacher's scepticism is challenged when he becomes involved in seemingly miraculous events. Plot At the Vatican, Father Cobb (Brian Pettifer) from the Blessed Edith Semple School in Glasgow, offers evidence to promote Blessed Edith's elevation to sainthood. Downplaying the idea of miracles, a Vatican official sends the \\"little father\\" back to Scotland. Undeterred, Father Cobb continues to lead the school in prayer, invoking Blessed Edith's intercession to heal the sick, including little Alice McKenzie who is crippled. Remedial teacher Vic Mathews (Tom Conti) is not a believer in miracles, placing his faith instead in his students and in their ability to learn. He is attracted to the new music teacher, Ruth Chancellor (Helen Mirren), who appears unimpressed with his awkward advances. After fainting at a bus stop, Vic is rushed to the hospital, where tests reveal the presence of a fatal brain tumor. The doctor sees little benefit in telling Vic about his condition. Meanwhile, the Headmaster (Dave Anderson) complains to the teacher's union representative, Jeff Jeffries (David Hayman), about Vic writing letters to the school board to keep a failed student, Stevie Deans (Ewen Bremner), from being sent to a special school. Convinced he can reach the withdrawn student, Vic refuses to accept the Headmaster's judgement. At a friendly card game at Vic's apartment later that night, Jeff convinces Vic after a few drinks to back off on his letter-writing campaign. After everyone leaves, a drunken Vic witnesses a strange event: his stereo plays without being turned on. The next day, Vic discovers he is able to teach basic math concepts more effectively by using examples from the gambling world. Even Stevie Deans responds to this new approach, showing he is clearly far from stupid. When Vic reports his progress, however, the Headmaster is more excited about the apparent healing of little Alice McKenzie. That night at a pub, a drunken Vic dismisses the newspaper reports of Alice's miraculous recovery, and just before the conversation turns ugly, Vic faints again. Ruth offers to drive him home, and the next day in church, she prays for Vic, whose tireless teaching efforts soon lead to yet another breakthrough with another \\"special\\" student. Later, Vic is summoned to the roof to rescue a student trapped on an adjacent roof. When he sees the boy slipping, Vic jumps across to the opposite roof, but is unable to prevent the boy from falling 40 feet through a tree that fortunately breaks his fall. Vic also loses his hold and falls from the roof. The student ends up with two broken legs, but Vic escapes with only minor scratches. When Father Cobb calls it a miracle, Vic dismisses the idea, but at the hospital, new x-rays reveal that his brain tumor is gone. The doctor has no explanation and never mentions the tumor to Vic. The hospital administrator orders the x-rays destroyed, but the radiologist holds onto them. Soon the newspapers report Vic's survived fall and the \\"miraculous academic improvement\\" of Stevie Deans. The bishop arrives and is annoyed by all the miracle stories, and Stevie is rushed out of town to a retreat, away from news reporters. School officials announce that there were no miracles involved with the student‚Äîjust marked improvement based on good teaching. Vic is also trying to convince himself that his survived fall was no miracle. Ruth even takes him to a newspaper office showing him numerous stories of unfounded miracles. Meanwhile, after seeing Vic dismissing the idea of miracles in a television interview, the radiologist delivers the x-rays to Father Cobb as \\"definitive proof\\" that a miracle actually happened‚Äîthe complete healing of an inoperable brain tumor. Father Cobb considers the legal implications for the radiologist, and then burns the x-rays saying, \\"We don't need proof‚Äîwe believe.\\" The story of Vic's miraculous recovery is soon reported on the news. Confused by what's happened, and told he is \\"special\\", Vic goes to the hospital to heal the student's broken legs, but soon realizes his folly. Back at school, Robbie complains to Vic that he wants to be a \\"special\\" student too. They go back to the roof where he and Jeff try to explain how Vic was able to make the 17-foot leap. To prove it was not a miracle, Vic makes the jump again. Afterwards, Jeff reveals Stevie Deans' whereabouts, and Vic heads to the train station to bring Stevie back. Ruth asks Robbie to help her find Vic, and the two rush off to the train station, where Ruth and Vic unite in a loving embrace. Robbie stumbles into a crowd and is forced onto a red carpet just as Princess Diana approaches. A photographer hands Robbie some flowers and he offers them to the princess as the worldwide press photographers capture the moment. Vic and Ruth leave by train to bring another \\"special\\" student back to school.

Location  Pandy is located five miles north of Abergavenny on the A465 road to Hereford immediately to the north of Llanfihangel Crucorney. The Wales-England border is one mile to the north with the Offa's Dyke Path and Marches Way passing through the village.  History  The village of Pandy is spread out from the Pandy watermill at Allt-yr-Ynys to the north to the edge of the village of Lanfihangel Crucorney to the south. The fulling-mill at Pandy served the Llanover estate in the 17th century producing wool which was turned into Welsh flannel. Pandy is the Welsh word for a fulling-mill The village was on a route used by the early railways, with the Abergavenny to Hereford line still passing to the west. There was at one time the Grosmont tramroad as well, now demolished. Raymond Williams was born in a cottage next to Offa's Dyke where his father was a railway signalman on the Hereford to Abergavenny railway line. The village was redeveloped in the Victorian era by a pioneering lady architect, Bernadette Rocher who, in the 1870s, extended and reworked many of the older properties in local red sandstone. She is buried at the parish church at Oldcastle, Monmouthshire, a short distance to the northwest. Amenities Chapel in Pandy The village has no parish church, but has two Nonconformist chapels, one Baptist and one Presbyterian Church of Wales. The village has several campsites and small caravan parks and two pubs. The housing is a mix of Victorian era cottages, farms and villas and some 1970s housing estates such as Wern Gifford. The Black Mountains, Wales rise up to the west of the village with the outlying Skirrid looming high over the village to the east. Pandy has two hotels, the Park Hotel and Allt Yr Ynys Country Hotel. Transport Pandy railway station closed in 1958, with trains running through between Hereford and Abergavenny on the Welsh Marches Line.

He was a saviour of Jewish prisoners. In the People's Republic of China, he is considered the father of modern Chinese surgery.  Life  Qiu's mother died of appendicitis and inadequate medical assistance at a young age in 1933, which motivated Qiu to study medicine. Qiu studied at Hangchow University Preparatory School (current Zhejiang University) in Hangzhou and graduated in 1932. He initially graduated from the German School of Medicine in Shanghai, the predecessor of today's Tongji University. In 1936, he won a Humboldt scholarship and went to study at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich (LMU). He graduated from the LMU in November 1939 with honours and received his PhD and the license to practise his profession in Germany. In September 1944, at the age of 31, Qiu was advanced to the rank of attending physician and headed the Jodquellenhof in Bad T√∂lz, which had been turned into a makeshift hospital. On 30 April and 1 May 1945, thousands of concentration camp prisoners passed through Bad T√∂lz on their death march from the Dachau concentration camp. One day, a student nurse called Loni K√∂nig, from Munich, led him to a group of about 40 prisoners, guarded by the SS on the street in front of the hospital. Qiu later recalled the incident: \\"They were wrecks, sick and weak, they could walk no further and were huddling on the ground.\\" He gathered all his courage and told the soldiers that\\"These prisoners have typhoid. We must take them.\\" He hid the concentration camp prisoners until the end of the war in the basement of the hospital and treated them. His German colleagues, as well as Loni, the student nurse, helped him . In 1945, after the war ended, Qiu and Loni married. In 1946, Qiu returned to Shanghai with his German wife. She adopted the name Qiu Luoyi and in 1958 attained Chinese citizenship. There, Qiu worked as the head of the surgical department at the Sino-US Hospital that was attached to Tongji University. During Mao Zedong's Cultural Revolution (1966‚Äì1976), he was made to clean toilets, amongst other things. During this time, he found great support in his wife. In 1978, after the Cultural Revolution, Qiu was made Vice-President of Tongji Medical University in Wuhan, which by then had completely moved out of Tongji University in Shanghai to Wuhan and has been now a department of the local Huazhong University of Science and Technology. He was also made the head of the organ transplant research institute there. In 1981, he became the Head of the University and in 1984, he was made the Honorary Head, the post of which he remained at until his death in 2008. Qiu was one of the most acclaimed surgeons of China and a pioneer of Chinese organ transplantation, who wrote a standard textbook of surgery that is still in use and has been reprinted many times. He was a member of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and, from 1975 to 1993, was a member of the Chinese Communist Party, the deputy to the 4th-7th National People's Congresses. Qiu died aged 94 and was buried on 7 April 2009 at Qiu Fazu Square in Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology in Wuhan.Ë£òÊ≥ïÁ•ñÈô¢Â£´È™®ÁÅ∞Ê†ëËë¨‰ª™Âºè‰∏æË°å Awards (selection) * 1982: Honorary doctorate from the Faculty of Clinical Medicine I of the University of Heidelberg, with whom Qiu had arranged a partnership agreement in 1985 between the Medical School of Wuhan and the Medical Faculty of Heidelberg for the exchange of scientists and students. * 1985: Grand Federal Cross of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany. * 2007: Honorary member of the German Society for Visceral Surgery for the rescue of Jewish prisoners.

It is commonly called the Hodges meteorite because a fragment of it struck Ann Elizabeth Fowler Hodges (1920‚Äì1972). Importance The Sylacauga meteorite is the first documented extraterrestrial object to have injured a human being. The grapefruit-sized fragment crashed through the roof of a farm house, bounced off a large wooden console radio, and hit Hodges while she napped on a couch. The 34-year-old woman was badly bruised on one side of her body, but was able to walk. The event received worldwide publicity. The earliest claim of a person being hit by a meteorite comes from 1677 in a manuscript published at Tortona, Italy, which tells of a Milanese friar who was killed by one, although its veracity is unknown. In 1992 a small meteorite fragment (3 g) hit a young Ugandan boy in Mbale; it had been slowed by a tree and caused no injury.  Fireball  The meteor made a fireball visible from three states as it streaked through the atmosphere, even though it fell early in the afternoon. There were also indications of an air blast, as witnesses described hearing \\"explosions or loud booms\\".  Following events  The meteorite was confiscated by the Sylacauga police chief who then turned it over to the United States Air Force. Both the Hodgeses and their landlord, Bertie Guy, claimed ownership of the rock, Guy's claim being that it had fallen on her property. There were offers of up to $5,000 for the meteorite. The Hodgeses and Bertie Guy settled, with the Hodgeses paying $500 for the rock. However, by the time it was returned to the Hodgeses, over a year later, public attention had diminished, and they were unable to then find a buyer. Ann Hodges was uncomfortable with the public attention and the stress of the dispute over ownership of the meteorite. The Hodgeses donated it to the Alabama Museum of Natural History in 1956. The day after the fall, local farmer Julius McKinney came upon the second-largest fragment from the same meteorite. An Indianapolis-based lawyer purchased it for the Smithsonian Institution. The McKinney family was able to use the money to purchase a car and a house.  Fragments  Upon the entry into the atmosphere, the Sylacauga meteorite fragmented into at least 3 pieces: # The Hodges fragment ( - ) struck Ann Elizabeth Hodges. # The McKinney fragment ( - ) was found the next day December 1, 1954 by Julius Kempis McKinney. # A third fragment is believed to have impacted somewhere near Childersburg (a few km north-west of Oak Grove).  Classification  The Sylacauga meteorite is classified as an ordinary chondrite of H4 group.  Orbit  The meteoroid came in on the sunward side of the Earth, so when it hit, it had passed the perihelion and was traveling outward from the Sun. Considering the orbit estimations, the best candidate as parent body is 1685 Toro.

The violence entailed a series of mob lynchings and retaliatory murders involving multiple posses and law enforcement factions, including the Texas Rangers. The conflict took the lives of at least 12 men and resulted in a climate of bitter \\"national prejudice\\" against local German-American residents in the following years.Gillett, J.B., 1921, Six Years with the Texas Rangers, 1875-1881, Yale University Press, Background Cattle rustling had long been a problem for Texas ranchers by the time of the Mason County War. Organized bands frequently stole livestock but the situation was made worse by the fact that spring trail bosses were often \\"indifferent to whose cows they drove\\", picking up \\"mavericks\\" (unbranded animals) and even other brands, though the understanding was that they were supposed to return the profits to the rightful owner. Ethnic Germans had immigrated to Mason and Gillespie counties in central Texas beginning in the 1840s, largely as a result of efforts to colonize the Fisher‚ÄìMiller Land Grant. The Germans often found hardship in the ranching business; though \\"loyal to their adopted country and government when undisturbed\\", they \\"were sorely tried by the rustlers and Indians, who committed many depredations upon their cattle.\\" In 1860, Mason County's first sheriff, Thomas Milligan,The Officer Down Memorial Page. was killed by Indians. In 1872, the predominantly German population of the county elected Sheriff John Clark and Cattle Inspector Dan Hoerster. Clark and Hoerster organized a posse to deal with the increasingly severe cattle rustling in the area and reclaim lost cattle. They soon came across a herd stolen by the Backus brothers gang and eight others; the posse captured five of the rustlers, who were taken back to the Mason jail. The captives included Lige Backus, Pete Backus, Charley Johnson, Abe Wiggins and Tom Turley. Beginning A posse member, Tom Gamel, later claimed that Clark and Hoerster suggested lynching their captives. Regardless, a mob of forty attempted to break into the jail on the night of February 18, 1875 with a battering ram after failing to get the keys from the jailer, Deputy John Wohrle. Both Sheriff Clark and the visiting Texas Ranger Lt. Dan W. Roberts were prevented from interfering with a warning they would be shot. Despite this, Clark managed to gather a posse of about six citizens and, with Roberts, pursued the mob to the south edge of town where they were hanging the prisoners from a large post oak. By the time the posse reached the mob, Lige and Pete Backus and Abe Wiggins were dead, but they managed to save Tom Turley while Charley Johnson escaped. This was the beginning activity of the vigilance committee, or Hoodoos, who used ambushes and midnight hangings to get rid of the thieves and outlaws who had been holding a \\"carnival of lawlessness in Mason County\\". Reign of terror intensifies Tom Gamel learned he was the target of the vigilance committee on March 25, prompting him to gather his friends and proceed into town in an effort to confront the threat, but Sheriff Clark immediately left. Gamel's group left after a couple of days but returned when Clark returned with 62 men, all Germans, and both groups agreed to peace with \\"no more mobs or hanging\\". However, in May, Deputy Wohrle arrested the \\"prominent and popular American\\" Tim Williamson, after Dan Hoerster revoked his year-old bond for stealing a yearling. Williamson worked for Charley Lehmberg in Loyal Valley, known for paying five dollars a head for unbranded cattle. Wohrle and Williamson were confronted a short distance from the ranch by a dozen men led by German rancher Peter Bader, who shot Williamson dead. This murder increased the tension between the American and German factions enormously, especially after a grand jury on May 12 failed to indict those responsible. Cooley's actions Among those now involved was Scott Cooley, an orphan raised by the Williamson family who vowed \\"he would get the men who did it\\". Cooley had been carried off by Indians after they killed his parents, but later raised by the Williamsons. Cooley served in Texas Rangers Company D under Captain Perry before taking up farming near Menardville. After Williamson's murder, Cooley came to Mason, learning as much as he could about the circumstances and the names of those involved. His first act of revenge occurred on August 10, when Cooley shot Worhle in the back of the head while he helped Doc Charley Harcourt dig a well, taking Worhle's scalp as would an Indian. Cooley formed a gang whose members included George Gladden, John and Mose Beard and Johnny Ringo. Gladden and Mose Beard were ambushed south of Mason by sixty men led by Peter Bader, Dan Hoerster and Sheriff Clark, resulting in the death of Beard. Cooley's men, including Johnny Ringo, then killed Cheney at his home, who had led Beard and Gladden into the ambush. Hoerster was killed as he rode past the Mason barber shop by Scott Cooley, Gladden and Bill Coke. The next day, Coke was captured and killed by a Mason posse at John Gamel's. Texas Rangers arrive Under orders from Governor Richard Coke, Major Jones of the Texas Rangers arrived on September 28, with ten men from Company D (Cooley's old unit) and thirty men from Company A, his escort under Captain Ira Long. Jones promptly sent scouts looking for Cooley but without result after two weeks. The remaining justice of the peace, Wilson Hey, issued warrants for Sheriff Clark and others, who were arrested, and although the charges did not stick, Clark did resign his office and was never seen again. Major Jones' scouts continued to seek Cooley and his gang to no avail, which prompted Jones to confront his Rangers with the opportunity for those in sympathy with Cooley to \\"step out of the ranks\\", of which fifteen did. The remaining Rangers captured Gladden and Ringo. In November, Scott Cooley's gang killed Charley Bader at his place, and Peter Bader soon met the same fate. At the end of December 1875, Cooley and Ringo were arrested by Sheriff A.J. Strickland for threatening the life of Burnet County Deputy Sheriff John J. Strickland. They later escaped from the Lampasas County jail with the help of forty \\"Helping Hands\\". Aftermath The summer of 1876 was another period of terror and lawlessness before Cooley died, either by poison after dining at the Nimitz Hotel in Fredericksburg or by \\"brain fever\\" or due to previous wounds. Johnny Ringo left the state for the Arizona Territory, where he again earned a reputation as a cattle rustler and criminal, and George Gladden was imprisoned for the murder of Peter Bader. On January 21, 1877, the Mason County Courthouse was burned to the ground and the official records of the Mason County War were destroyed.

Born in South Africa, Dinnigan moved to New Zealand, then Australia, where she obtained work with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. She opened her own range in 1990, with the launch of a dry-clean only lingerie collection, and was the first Australian to launch a ready-to- wear collection, in Paris in 1995. Early life Collette Dinnigan was born in South Africa on 24 September 1965. When she was eight, her family including a younger brother lived on their yacht for a number of years, eventually sailing around the southern coast of Australia and on to New Zealand, where they decided to remain. She graduated from a fashion design course at Wellington Polytechnic because she liked fashion designing. She later moved to Sydney, where she worked for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's costume department. Career and fashion range In 2001, Dinnigan opened her first store on Greg Street in Sydney's Paddington, and imported stuff to her fashions to Barneys New York, Harvey Nichols in London, and Hong Kong. In 1995, Dinnigan was the first Australian to launch a ready-to-wear collection in Paris; she was also the first to be asked to be in the 'ready-to-wear parade' in Paris. Her range is now stocked in her stores in Sydney, Melbourne and London, and in David Jones department stores. In 2002, UK retailer Marks & Spencer invited Dinnigan to create a branded collection of lingerie exclusively for their stores and Target stores in Australia. Wild Hearts by Collette Dinnigan launched and recorded impressive results. At the end of 2013 Dinnigan significantly scaled down her business, closing her boutiques in Sydney, Melbourne and London and stopping production of her bridal and evening wear lines. Approximately 80% of her staff lost their jobs. Dinnigan emphasised that the business was still profitable and had no debt; she wanted to spend more time with her family.\\"Collette Dinnigan to close her boutiques\\" by Katrina Strickland, The Age, 29 October 2013.

It is a bulk material handling component. The bucket has an inner volume as compared to other types of machine attachments like blades or shovels. The bucket could be attached to the lifting hook of a crane, at the end of the arm of an excavating machine, to the wires of a dragline excavator, to the arms of a power shovel or a tractor equipped with a backhoe loader or to a loader, or to a dredge. The name \\"bucket\\" may have been coined from buckets used in water wheels, or used in water turbines or in similar-looking devices. Purposes Buckets in mechanical engineering can have a distinct quality from the traditional bucket (pail) whose purpose is to contain things. Larger versions of this type of bucket equip bucket trucks to contain human beings, buckets in water-hauling systems in mines or, for instance, in helicopter buckets to hold water to combat fires. Two other types of mechanical buckets can be distinguished according to the final destination of the device they equip: energy-consumer systems like excavators or energy- capturer systems like water bucket wheels or turbines. Size and shape Buckets exist in a variety of sizes or shapes. They can be quite large like those equipping Hulett cranes, used to discharge ore out of cargo ships in harbours or very small such as those used by deep-sea exploration vehicles. The shape of the bucket can vary from the truncated conical shape of an actual bucket to more scoop-like or spoon-like shapes akin to water turbines. The cross section can be round or square. Three miners are extracted during the Farmington Mine disaster, in a bucket attached to a crane DesignsSimple design= This is the same shape of a domestic form, the one-piece- standing single element, but often with an augmented size. Mining In early developments of mining, a large simple bucket allowed easy insertion of both miners and construction materials such as pit props, and later extraction of miners and ore. Common terms used in various parts of the world include: Bowk; Kibble; Hoppit; Hoppet. Latterly they have been called sinking buckets, as they are now only used when sinking new mine shafts before insertion of the cage, or for emergency rescue. Concrete bucket Concrete bucket on a crane. Concrete buckets help deliver concrete on a specific site of a building by the means of a tower crane. They have a bottom opening to allow concrete to flow out of the bucket when in-place. See also tremie. Electrical trucks bucket They are placed at the end of an excavator-like arm and have to be made from a material that provides isolation from electricity, like fiber glass, to help the workers protect themselves. There may be a door on the side of the bucket. =Excavator bucket= Excavator buckets are made of solid steel and generally present teeth protruding from the cutting edge, to disrupt hard material and avoid wear-and-tear of the bucket. Subsets of the excavator bucket are: the ditching bucket, trenching bucket, A ditching bucket is a wider bucket with no teeth, used for excavating larger excavations and grading stone. A trenching excavator bucket is normally wide and with protruding teeth. =Clamshell bucket= coal-loading crane, now displayed at a dock re- development in Cardiff The clamshell bucket is a more sophisticated articulated several-piece device, including two elementary buckets associated on a hinged structure forming a claws-like appendage with an internal volume. =Buckets-wheel= In mining The design is used in bucket-wheel excavators. The buckets in the wheel have to be made of solid material to withstand the resistance of the material it cuts through. In water hoisting In energy production The bucket wheel design is also used to capture the water energy in water-wheels or water turbines like Pelton wheels. The buckets also have to be made of solid material to withstand the force of the water flow. Their shape is optimized according to their purpose. Other designs include vertical shaft wind turbines designs like on the Savonius wind turbine. In this case, the buckets have to be made of a light material. =Buckets-ladders (buckets-chains)= The buckets-ladders are used in bucket elevators or in the dredge design of some dredgers.

He was considered formidable for his theological knowledge and command of the German language. Life Mensing was born at Zutphen or Zwolle, Netherlands. In 1495 he entered the Dominican Order and made part of his theological studies in the studium of his province. Matriculating at the University of Wittenberg in 1515, he received there in 1517 the licentiate in theology, and the following year received in Frankfort-on-the-Oder the doctorate in theology from the hands of the general of his order. According to Qu√©tif, he taught theology in 1514 in the monastery at Ulm;, but it is however improbable that Mensing, belonging to the province of Saxony, should act as professor in another province which had no studium generale of its own. To prevent Lutheran doctrinal innovations from gaining a foothold in his province, Mensing entered into all the controversies. From 1522 to 1524 he occupied the pulpit in the cathedral of Magdeburg, where he also composed his first apologetic works on the Sacrifice of the Mass. He was forced to leave, and took up the invitation of the Princess Margaretha von Anhalt, who ruled during the minority of her sons; he went to Dessau to support her in her efforts against Protestants in her territory. In 1529 he was professor in the University of Frankfort-on-the-Oder and preacher in the cathedral. The following year he attended, as theologian to the Elector Joachim von Anhalt, the Diet of Augsburg, and secured from Emperor Charles V a renewal of the letter of protection for the Dominican Order in Germany which Emperor Charles IV had granted them in 1355 and 1359. In 1534 he was elected provincial of his own province, but before the termination of his office Pope Paul III made him suffragan Bishop of Halberstadt. In 1540 and 1541 he attended the theological conferences of Worms and Ratisbon, where with Johann Eck, the vice-chancellor of the University of Ingolstadt, and Pelargus, he took a leading part in the deliberations. Works A complete list of his works, all of which bear a polemical tinge, is given by Streber in the Kirchenlexikon. References ;Attribution * The entry cites: **Qu√©tif- √âchard, SS. Ord.

It gained momentum in May and June 2008, and the allegations culminated in protests from grieving parents of children who died in the earthquake as a result of the collapse of various schools in the quake zone. The scandal eventually became a focal point of reporting on the earthquake rescue efforts, with Chinese civil engineers, bloggers, activists, and foreign media bringing attention to the allegations. Various discussions reports alleged that local government officials and construction companies were negligent in the construction of schools, and that they ignored civil engineering standards, saved materials and took shortcuts while pocketing the difference. Despite initial openness to independent reporting and foreign media, the Chinese government attempted to downplay the issue and suppress criticism.\\"Police break up protest by parents of China earthquake victims\\", The Guardian, June 3, 2008 Additionally, local government attempted to entice grieving parents into monetary compensation in exchange for their silence. While Chinese authorities were initially praised by international media for its rapid and effective response to the earthquake, the school construction scandal severely undermined the initial positive reactions, particularly among Western media. Postings about the scandal flooded Chinese online portals and discussion boards, and popularized the phrase \\"tofu-dreg schoolhouses\\" (). The internet activism resulted in a pledge by the federal government to conduct investigations into the allegations, but it was ostensibly not followed up with any substantial action. Background Over 7,000 schoolrooms collapsed in the course of the earthquake, mostly in rural areas,\\"China anger over 'shoddy schools' \\", BBC News Online, May 15, 2008 reportedly leading to the death of nearly 5,000 students (though some parents believe the real figure is twice that officially cited) and the injury of over 15,000 students. The total death toll of the quake was around 70,000 people, with some 375,000 injuries. A month after the quake, nearly 20,000 people remained missing, while five million were rendered homeless.\\"Parents of China quake victims express anger\\", Associated Press via Google, June 12, 2008 The disproportionate number of school collapses led to open discussions that they were not built to adequate standards. The grieving parents and critical journalists pointed out that \\"hundreds of schools collapsed instantly ‚Äî even newly constructed ones ‚Äî while older buildings nearby were often unscathed.\\"\\"Beijing can't muzzle outrage over deadly collapsed schools\\", The Globe and Mail, June 17, 2008 This, in turn, has led to allegations of corruption on the part of Education Ministry officials and contractors who were said to be complicit in constructing the school buildings dangerously below government-mandated standards, while pocketing the remaining surplus. On May 26, Wang Xuming, a spokesman for the Education Ministry, stated that the ministry would complete a reassessment of school buildings in quake zones and that those who had cut corners on school construction would be ‚Äúseverely punished.‚Äù‚ÄúChina reiterates severe punishment for companies producing substandard building materials,‚Äù Xinhua, May 29, 2008, http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-05/29/content_8279397.htm. Some parents protested what they argued, one month after the event, amounts to government inaction.\\"Parents in uprising in China quake town\\", Associated Press via Sydney Morning Herald, June 12, 2008 Analysis and opinionsFactors in building collapse= The earthquake has caused collapse of more than 6.5 million buildings and damaged some 23 million more. Four factors determine the damage to a particular building, according to geologist Liu Jie (), Director of Earthquake Prediction Department of (China's) Center for Seismic Monitoring Station Network under the China Earthquake Administration (CEA), who arrived in the quake zone on the same day as the main quake. Besides the quake's magnitude and intensity in the area, the location of the building played an important role. In some towns that Liu surveyed, all buildings sitting on the earthquake fault line collapsed, while buildings tens of meters away did not. Building structure was also a factor. Buildings with larger spans tend to collapse more easily. The fourth factor was the quality of the building. If a building's designed fortification intensity is above the quake's intensity at the location, the collapse of a building can be definitively attributed to its engineering quality, Liu explained. On the other hand, if the quake's intensity exceeds the designated code, it would be hard to determine whether the earthquake engineering quality is the deciding factor of its collapse. =Modes of building collapse= Despite these factors, some Chinese civil engineers expressed a different view and joined the public in criticizing the initial official attribution of school collapses. According to Caijing, \\"earthquake intensity exceeding the designed resistance does not mean that buildings built to quality specifications will definitely collapse. Even if they collapse, there are different ways by which they collapse and variation within building design. Such collapses should not necessarily lead to heavy human casualties.\\" =Seismic fortification for schools in the quake zone= A post-quake survey indicated the intensity near the epicenter of the earthquake to be category XI-intensity, far exceeding the seismic fortification intensity of VII-intensity assigned to Wenchuan, Sichuan in GB 500011-2001, a national standard for seismic design published in 2001. Beichuan, center of another XI- intensity area, had been zoned as VI-intensity. (Zoning for Wenchuan, Beichuan and several other cities in Sichuan were subsequently revised to VIII liedu, the second highest rating in the standard.) GB50223-2004, the national standard for classification of civil seismic fortification before the earthquake, specified Class B for schools exceeding 600 in capacity, kindergartens and child care centers exceeding 200, meaning they must be built to at least 1 liedu higher than the zoned seismic fortification intensity of the area. However, it contained a provision to allow low-rise (three stories and lower) schools to be built to meet the area's fortification intensity (Class C). (The government rushed a revision to the standard after the Wenchuan earthquake. GB 50223-2008 has removed both the provision regarding capacity and the one regarding height to require all schools to meet Class B.) In perspective, Yingxiu Primary School had a collapsed four-story building built in 1999, where 3/4 of the 473 students were dead, whereas Xuankou Middle School had several collapsed buildings from 3 to 4 stories built in 2006, where more than 80% of the 1,200+ students stayed alive. Both schools are located in the town of Yingxiu, Wenchuan nearly at the epicenter of the main quake. Beichuan Middle School in Beichuan, where 80% of buildings collapsed, had two collapsed five-story buildings completed in 1998 that were once named \\"high quality buildings,\\" killing nearly half of its 2,000+ students. Following GB50223-2004, Xuankou Middle School should have been built to resist VII + I in seismic intensity. Beichuan Middle School and Yingxiu Primary School could have passed with fortification intensity of VII liedu had they been built after 2004; but because they were built before the publication of even GB 500011-2001, they could be using older standards or none at all.Standards cited in this article do not contain provisions about mandatory seismic retrofit. Attempt to interfere with survey In justifying the relatively long time CEA used to produce the intensity diagram of the Wenchuan earthquake, Vice President of International Association for Earthquake Engineering XIE Lili () who was a member of the survey team indicated that \\"some (local government) may want to make more serious estimations of earthquake damage, so they could obtain more compensation,\\" hinting attempts to interfere with the survey. The same news article quoted persons in the know who suggested that another motivation for attempted interference would be to boost intensity in order to evade responsibility for not following seismic design codes. Despite later denial by CEA that the published intensity reflected such interference, MA Zongjin (), Chairman of the National Expert Committee for Wenchuan Earthquake who is also the Chairman of the National Expert Committee for Disaster Prevention, openly confirmed that \\"some local workers wanted to increase (report of) local damages or seismic intensity\\" in a press conference sponsored by the State Council State Council Information Office of the PRC. Suppression of dissent In July 2008, local governments in the Sichuan Province coordinated a campaign to silence angry parents whose children died during the earthquake through monetary contracts. If the parents refused, officials threatened that they would receive nothing. Although Chinese officials have advocated a policy of openness in time before the Olympic Games, the pressure on parents to sign demonstrates that officials are determined to create an appearance of public harmony rather than investigate into the corruption or negligence of the construction of schools. The payment amounts vary by school but are roughly the same. In Hanwang, parents were offered a package valued at US$8,800 in cash and a per-parent pension of nearly US$5,600. Many parents said they signed the contract, even if no real investigation ensues. Furthermore, officials have continued to use traditional methods of silencing: riot police officers have broken up protests by parents; the authorities have set up cordons around the schools; and officials have ordered the Chinese news media to stop reporting on school collapses. On July 25, 2008, Liu Shaokun (ÂàòÁªçÂù§), a Sichuan school teacher, was detained for disseminating rumors and destroying social order. Liu's family was later told that he was being investigated on suspicion of the crime of inciting subversion. Liu, a teacher at Guanghan Middle School (ÂõõÂ∑ùÁúÅÂæ∑Èò≥Â∏ÇÂπøÊ±â‰∏≠Â≠¶), Deyang City, Sichuan Province, traveled to heavily hit areas after the May 12 Sichuan earthquake, took photos of collapsed school buildings, and put them online. In a media interview, he expressed his anger at ‚Äúthe shoddy ‚Äòtofu‚Äô buildings.‚Äù Liu was detained on June 25, 2008 at his school. He was ordered to serve one year of re-education through labor. Under RTL regulations, public security authorities may issue an order to anyone to serve up to four years of RTL without trial or formal charge. After being denied several visits, the family turned to international human rights organizations, who reported the case and urged the government to release him, which drew attention in the international community. On September 26, 2008, Liu was finally released to serve his sentence outside of RTL.Human Rights in China, \\"Press Release: Family Visits Still Denied to Sichuan School Teacher Punished after Quake-Zone Visit,\\" July 29, 2008, Chinese human rights activist Huang Qi was also detained.\\"A new China appears amid quake rubble\\", Los Angeles Times, June 17, 2008 Huang Qi is an active rights defender in China. he established an Internet service company in October 1998 to help search for missing people, and launched a website called Tianwang Xunren on June 4, 1999. Huang Qi was arrested on June 3, 2000, and sentenced to five years imprisonment on May 9, 2003 by the Chengdu Intermediate People's Court for the crime of inciting subversion of state power.Human Rights in China, Press Release: Human Rights in China Condemns the Detention of Huang Qi by Police in Chengdu, June 14, 2008, http://www.hrichina.org/public/contents/56408 . During the Sichuan Earthquake, Huang Qi's work and his website were widely reported by media to help find missing people to unite family members. He also wrote many articles about families who lost their children. Although initially tolerating independent reporting, China's security forces have begun to clamp down on dissent and public complaints. According to Human Rights In China, sources inside China said that on the evening of June 10, 2008, Huang Qi, Pu Fei, a volunteer for Tianwang, and Zuo Xiaohuan, a former teacher at Leshan Teachers College were missing after they were forced into a car by unidentified individuals. In the afternoon of June 12, 2008, Lawyer Xu, Tianwang's legal counsel, went to the Jinyang Police Station of Chengdu to file a missing persons report. The police reportedly told Xu that Huang Qi has been detained, and that the related legal procedure notice would be sent to his family but refused to disclose the grounds for Huang's detention. Huang Qi's 74-year-old mother, Pu Wenqing, said that the family had not received any notice from the police over the past few days.

Gameplay In the game, the player takes on a role of a giant in the land of the Keflings. Keflings are a small race of human-like creatures; similar to elves or gnomes. It becomes the job of the player to aid the Keflings in creating their kingdom. This is accomplished by building various structures, collecting resources, and managing the work of the Keflings. The Keflings will aid the player in gathering resources (wood, crystals, wool, and stone) and transporting them to various buildings for use in producing other buildings. Some buildings convert the resources into other products for use in building more complex structures. It is the first Xbox 360 title to allow full avatar player control in the New Xbox Experience. The game has been described as having \\"dashes of SimCity and Black & White\\". Its resource gathering system is comparable to The Settlers. The main goal of the game is to complete the castle, thereby producing a King or Queen of the Keflings. The game, however, does not stop, and appears to officially never end, allowing the player to continue building more structures and gather more resources. There are four characters available for use in the game, all having slightly different starting statistics. As a fifth option, the player may also use their Xbox Live Avatar as their character. The multiplayer mode is the same as the single player mode, except that up to four players may be in the game at once. The game play is drop-in/drop-out format, allowing many players to be a part of one kingdom. While visiting an online game, players may build banner towers that display their gamer picture for all players who visit that game to view. The host of an online game has the option to kick any other player that has joined the game. When a player is kicked, their game is split from the original hosted game - they get an entire copy of the world as it is, the other players appear to leave and the kicked player is left alone hosting the new game. Only the host may save an online game. Development, release, and marketing A Kingdom For Keflings was released on the Xbox 360 on November 19, 2008. On November 13, 2009 Ninjabee announced that the game would be coming to the PC as well, it was released for Windows on March 20, 2010.Hit XBLA Game Coming to the PC. Sales were close to 610,000 units as of year-end 2011. A Kingdom for Keflings has two DLC packages: Kingdom Pack 1 and Kingdom Pack 2. Both were released on December 9, 2009. Each pack contains two new kingdoms for players to develop. Kingdom Pack 1 contains the Orchard Kingdom and Kingdom Crossroads. Kingdom Pack 2 contains Relic Kingdom and Central Kingdom. The Kingdoms in the second pack are said to be of a higher difficulty. The game features a set of five different songs that play dynamically according to the current season and the state of the village. They form a set of joyful and relaxing songs, said to be quite catchy and adding a lot of appeal to the game. At the request of fans, the developer has made the songs available for download.. ReceptionSequel A sequel entitled A World of Keflings was released on December 22, 2010. The sequel increases the focus on storyline, offers \\"multiple kingdoms to explore, each with its own climate, resources, and culture\\" and includes local multiplayer. It sold over 224,000 copies as of year-end 2011. On March 13, 2013, developer NinjaBee announced that the sequel had just been re-released, at the time, for the Games Store on Windows 8, and for the Wii U's Nintendo eShop later in the year.

The SFB rejected membership in the French Football Federation on 17 July 1949 when 67 per cent of the delegates of the association voted against it. Instead the SFB was admitted as a member of FIFA in June 1950. From 1950 onwards Hermann Neuberger, later to become president of the German Football Association, the DFB, led the SFB and negotiated the admission of the latter to FIFA. The Saarland national football team took part in international competitions, among them the qualifying to the 1954 FIFA World Cup where it played against West Germany. In 1956, following the reunification of the protectorate with West Germany, the SFB became part of the DFB again and was renamed to Saarl√§ndischer Fu√üball-Verband.Die Geschichte des Fu√üballs an der Saar SFV website, accessed: 4 April 2015 ReferencesExternal links * German FA website * Southwestern Regional FA website * SFV website Category:Football in Saarland Category:Football governing bodies in Germany Category:1948 establishments in Germany Category:1948 establishments in Saar Category:Sports organizations established in 1948 ","title":"Saarland Football Association"},{"id":"17987504","text":"Klagopsalmer (roughly, Hymns of Lament) is the sixth album by Shining.

First published in 1954, it is based on the author's own experiences as a young submariner. The story centers on a sailor called Teichmann , a cynical young man, thrown at the age of seventeen into the horror and cruelty of war at sea and particularly the submarine warfare in World War II. (The protagonist's first name is Hans, but all throughout the book he and others are referred to by surname). The book's plot is divided into two roughly equal parts, the first dealing with Teichmann's career on a minesweeper and the second - with his U-boat service. In both branches of naval service, the Germans first manage to hold their own but the Allies increasingly get the upper hand, and in both cases Teichmann's involvement ends with a traumatic ship wreak and the horrors which scavenging gulls can inflict on helpless sailors adrift on the sea. In between scenes on the sea are the protagonist's complicated relations with the two women in his life - Dora, the Hamburg prostitute (later brothel owner) who loves him, and Edith, his captain's wife, with whom he is deeply and very guiltily in love. Teichmann's attitude to the Nazi regime is complicated and ambivalent. On the one hand, he considers Goebbels' propaganda as stupid nonsense and feels nothing but contempt for fanatic Nazis which he meets. However, he also refuses to take a clear stand against the regime - even when a dissident fellow sailor reveals to him that Germany's Jews are being systematically murdered - and he persists in going out to sea again and again, even when knowing it to be futile and realizing that the U-boats have lost the Battle of the Atlantic and Germany is about to lose the whole war. Teichmann feels no hatred or animosity towards the Briish sailors opposing him, regarding them as fellow mariners who due to circumstances were thrust into the situation of trying to kill him. On the other hand, he feels a murderous hatred towards members of the French Resistance who try to kill him when leaving a brothel while on shore leave in La Rochelle and who do manage to kill his rather naive shipmate. \\"A German counterpart to The Caine Mutiny\\" - Frederic Morton.

The original House climate committee (formed in 2007), called the Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming, was abolished when Republicans regained control of the House in 2011. Climate crisis is a term describing global warming and climate change, and their consequences. The term has been used to describe the threat of global warming to the planet, and to urge aggressive climate change mitigation. For example, a January 2020 BioScience article endorsed by over 11,000 scientists worldwide, stated that \\"the climate crisis has arrived\\" and that an \\"immense increase of scale in endeavors to conserve our biosphere is needed to avoid untold suffering due to the climate crisis.\\" The term is applied by those who \\"believe it evokes the gravity of the threats the planet faces from continued greenhouse gas emissions and can help spur the kind of political willpower that has long been missing from climate advocacy\\". They believe that, much as \\"global warming\\" drew out more emotional engagement and support for action than \\"climate change\\", calling climate change a crisis could have an even stronger impact. A study has shown that the term does invoke a strong emotional response in conveying a sense of urgency, but some caution that this very response may be counter-productive, and may cause a backlash effect due to perceptions of alarmist exaggeration.  Scientific basis  While powerful language had long been used in advocacy, politics and media, until the late 2010s the scientific community traditionally remained more constrained in its language. However, in a November 2019 statement published in January 2020 issue of the scientific journal BioScience, a group of over 11,000 scientists argued that describing global warming as a climate emergency or climate crisis was appropriate. The scientists stated that an \\"immense increase of scale in endeavor\\" is needed to conserve the biosphere, but noted \\"profoundly troubling signs\\" including sustained increases in livestock populations, meat production, tree cover loss, fossil fuel consumption, air transport, and CO2 emissions‚Äîconcurrent with upward trends in climate impacts such as rising temperatures, global ice melt, and extreme weather. Also in November 2019, an article published in Nature concluded that evidence from climate tipping points alone suggests that \\"we are in a state of planetary emergency\\", defining emergency as a product of risk and urgency, with both factors judged to be \\"acute\\". The Nature article referenced recent IPCC Special Reports (2018, 2019) suggesting individual tipping points could be exceeded with as little as 1‚Äî2 ¬∞C of global average warming (current warming is ~1¬∞C), with a global cascade of tipping points possible with greater warming.  Definitions  In the context of climate change, Pierre Mukheibir, Professor of Water Futures at the University of Technology Sydney, states that the term crisis is \\"a crucial or decisive point or situation that could lead to a tipping point,\\" one involving an \\"unprecedented circumstance.\\" A dictionary definition states that \\"crisis\\" in this context means \\"a turning point or a condition of instability or danger,\\" and implies that \\"action needs to be taken now or else the consequences will be disastrous.\\" Another definition differentiates the term from global warming and climate change and defines climate crisis as \\"the various negative effects that unmitigated climate change is causing or threatening to cause on our planet, especially where these effects have a direct impact on humanity.\\"  Use of the term  Historical = Former U.S. Vice President Al Gore has used crisis terminology since the 1980s, with the term being formalized by the Climate Crisis Coalition (formed in 2004). A 1990 report from the American University International Law Review includes selected materials that repeatedly use the term \\"crisis\\". Included in that report, \\"The Cairo Compact: Toward a Concerted World-Wide Response to the Climate Crisis\\" (December 21, 1989) states that \\"All nations... will have to cooperate on an unprecedented scale. They will have to make difficult commitments without delay to address this crisis.\\" = Recent = U.S. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders at the December, 2018, \\"Solving Our Climate Crisis, a National Town Hall\\" In the late 2010s, the phrase emerged \\"as a crucial piece of the climate hawk lexicon\\", being adopted by the Green New Deal, The Guardian, Greta Thunberg, and U.S. Democratic political candidates such as Kamala Harris. At the same time, it came into more popular use \\"after a spate of dire scientific warnings and revived energy in the advocacy world\\". In late 2018, the United States House of Representatives established the House Select Committee on the Climate Crisis, a term that a journalist wrote in The Atlantic is \\"a reminder of how much energy politics have changed in the last decade\\". The original House climate committee (formed in 2007) had been called the Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming, and was abolished when Republicans regained control of the House in 2011. Public Citizen reported that in 2018, less than 10% of articles in top-50 U.S. newspapers used the terms \\"crisis\\" or \\"emergency\\". In 2019, a \\"Call it a Climate Crisis\\" campaign urging major media organizations to adopt the term, stated that in 2018, only 3.5% of national television news segments referred to climate change as a crisis or emergency, (50 of 1400), though Public Citizen reported triple that number of mentions, 150, in just the first four months of 2019. Following a September 2018 usage of \\"climate crisis\\" by U.N. secretary general Ant√≥nio Guterres, on May 17, 2019 The Guardian formally updated its style guide to favor \\"climate emergency, crisis or breakdown\\" and \\"global heating\\". Editor-in-Chief Katharine Viner explained, \\"We want to ensure that we are being scientifically precise, while also communicating clearly with readers on this very important issue. The phrase ‚Äòclimate change‚Äô, for example, sounds rather passive and gentle when what scientists are talking about is a catastrophe for humanity.\\" Similarly, in June 2019, Spanish news agency EFE announced its preferred phrase crisis clim√°tica (climate crisis), with Grist journalist Kate Yoder remarking that \\"these terms were popping up everywhere\\", adding that \\"climate crisis\\" is \\"having a moment\\". In November 2019, the Hindustan Times also adopted the term because \\"climate change\\" \\"does not correctly reflect the enormity of the existential threat\\". Similarly, Warsaw, Poland newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza uses the term \\"climate crisis\\" instead of \\"climate change\\", an editor-in-chief of its Gazeta na zielono (newspaper in green) section describing climate change as one of the most important topics the paper has ever covered. Conversely, in June, 2019 the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation updated its language guide to read \\"Climate crisis and climate emergency are OK in some cases as synonyms for 'climate change'. But they're not always the best choice... For example, 'climate crisis' could carry a whiff of advocacy in certain political coverage\\". The update prompted journalism professor Sean Holman to say that \\"journalists are being torn by two competing values right now\\"‚Äîto tell the truth and to appear unbiased‚Äîbut that by telling the truth journalists appear to be biased to \\"large swaths of society... (that) don't believe in the truth\\". In June 2019, 70 climate activists were arrested for demonstrating outside the offices of The New York Times, urging the newspaper to adopt the phrases \\"climate emergency\\" or \\"climate crisis\\", the demonstration being part of public pressure that swayed the City Council to make New York the largest city to formally adopt a climate emergency declaration. In May 2019, Al Gore's Climate Reality Project (2011-) promoted an open petition asking news organizations to use \\"climate crisis\\" in place of \\"climate change\\" or \\"global warming\\", saying \\"it‚Äôs time to abandon both terms in culture\\". Likewise, the Sierra Club, the Sunrise Movement, Greenpeace, and other environmental and progressive organizations joined in a June 6, 2019 Public Citizen letter to news organizations, urging them to call climate change and human inaction \\"what it is‚Äìa crisis‚Äìand to cover it like one\\". In November 2019, the Oxford Dictionaries included \\"climate crisis\\" on its short list for word of the year 2019, the designation designed to recognize terms that \\"reflect the ethos, mood, or preoccupations of the passing year\\" and that should have \\"lasting potential as a term of cultural significance\\".  Alternative terminology  Research has shown that what a phenomenon is called, or how it is framed, \\"has a tremendous effect on how audiences come to perceive that phenomenon\\" and \\"can have a profound impact on the audience‚Äôs reaction\\". Google trends data shows that, following the 2006 release of Al Gore's film, An Inconvenient Truth, \\"climate crisis\\" searches increased, with a resurgence beginning in late 2018. Also graphed: \\"climate emergency\\" searches (see Climate emergency declaration). The effects of climate change are sometimes described in terms similar to climate crisis, such as: * \\"climate catastrophe\\" (used with reference to a 2019 David Attenborough documentary and the 2019‚Äì20 Australian bushfire season) * \\"threats that impact the earth\\" (World Wildlife Fund, 2012‚Äî) * \\"climate breakdown\\" (climate scientist Peter Kalmus, 2018) * \\"climate chaos\\" (The New York Times article title, 2019, U.S. Democratic candidates, 2019), and an Ad Age marketing team, 2019) * \\"climate ruin\\" (U.S. Democratic candidates, 2019) * \\"global heating\\" (Richard A. Betts, Met Office U.K., 2018) * \\"climate emergency\\" (11,000 scientists' warning letter in BioScience, and in The Guardian, both 2019), * \\"ecological breakdown\\", \\"ecological crisis\\" and \\"ecological emergency\\" (all set forth by climate activist Greta Thunberg, 2019) * \\"global meltdown\\", \\"Scorched Earth\\", \\"The Great Collapse\\", and \\"Earthshattering\\" (an Ad Age marketing team, 2019) * \\"climate disaster\\" and \\"climate apocalypse\\" (The Guardian, 2019) In addition to \\"climate crisis\\", various other terms have been investigated for their effects on audiences, including \\"global warming\\", \\"climate change\\", and \\"climatic disruption\\", as well as \\"environmental destruction\\", \\"weather destabilization\\", and \\"environmental collapse\\".  Effectiveness  In September 2019, Bloomberg journalist Emma Vickers posited that crisis terminology‚Äîthough the issue was one, literally, of semantics‚Äîmay be \\"showing results\\", citing a 2019 poll by The Washington Post and the Kaiser Family Foundation saying that 38% of U.S. adults termed climate change \\"a crisis\\" while an equal number called it \\"a major problem but not a crisis\\". Five years earlier, U.S. adults considering it a crisis numbered only 23%. Conversely, use of crisis terminology in various non-binding climate emergency declarations has not been effective (as of September 2019) in making governments \\"shift into action\\". = Concerns about crisis terminology = Some commentators have written that \\"emergency framing\\" may have several disadvantages. Specifically, such framing may implicitly prioritize climate change over other important social issues, thereby encouraging competition among activists rather than cooperation and sidelining dissent within the climate change movement itself. It may suggest a need for solutions by government, which provides less reliable long-term commitment than does popular mobilization, and which may be perceived as being \\"imposed on a reluctant population\\". Finally, it may be counterproductive by causing disbelief (absent immediate dramatic effects), disempowerment (in the face of a problem that seems overwhelming), and withdrawal‚Äîrather than providing practical action over the long term. Along similar lines, Australian climate communication researcher David Holmes has commented on the phenomenon of \\"crisis fatigue\\", in which urgency to respond to threats loses its appeal over time. Holmes said there is a \\"limited semantic budget\\" for such language, cautioning that it can lose audiences if time passes without meaningful policies addressing the emergency. Others have written that, whether \\"appeals to fear generate a sustained and constructive engagement\\" is clearly a highly complex issue but that the answer is \\"usually not\\", with psychologists noting that humans' responses to danger (fight, flight, or freeze) can be maladaptive. Agreeing that fear is a \\"paralyzing emotion\\", Sander van der Linden, director of the Cambridge Social Decision-Making Lab, favors \\"climate crisis\\" over other terms because it conveys a sense of both urgency and optimism, and not a sense of doom because \\"people know that crises can be avoided and that they can be resolved\\". Climate scientist Katharine Hayhoe warned in early 2019 that crisis framing is only \\"effective for those already concerned about climate change, but complacent regarding solutions\\". She added that it \\"is not yet effective\\" for those who perceive climate activists \\"to be alarmist Chicken Littles\\", positing that \\"it would further reinforce their pre-conceived‚Äîand incorrect‚Äînotions\\". In June 2019, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation updated its language guide to read that the term climate crisis \\"could carry a whiff of advocacy in certain political coverage\\". Two German journalists have respectively warned that \\"crisis\\" may be wrongly understood to suggest that climate change is \\"inherently episodic\\"‚Äîcrises being \\"either solved or they pass\\"‚Äîor as a temporary state before a return to normalcy that is in fact not possible. = Psychological and neuroscientific studies = A 2013 study (N=224, mostly college freshmen) surveyed participants' responses after they had read different simulated written articles. The study concluded that \\"climate crisis was most likely to create backlash effects of disbelief and reduced perceptions of concern, most likely due to perceptions of exaggeration\\", and suggested that other terms (\\"climatic disruption\\" and \\"global warming\\") should instead be used, particularly when communicating with skeptical audiences. An early 2019 neuroscientific study (N=120, divided equally among Republicans, Democrats and independents) by an advertising consulting agency involved electroencephalography (EEG) and galvanic skin response (GSR) measurements. The study, measuring responses to the terms \\"climate crisis\\", \\"environmental destruction\\", \\"environmental collapse\\", \\"weather destabilization\\", \\"global warming\\" and \\"climate change\\", found that Democrats had a 60% greater emotional response to \\"climate crisis\\" than to \\"climate change\\", with the corresponding response among Republicans tripling. \\"Climate crisis\\" is said to have \\"performed well in terms of responses across the political spectrum and elicited the greatest emotional response among independents\\". The study concluded that the term \\"climate crisis\\" elicited stronger emotional responses than \\"neutral\\" and \\"worn out\\" terms like \\"global warming\\" and \\"climate change\\", thereby encouraging a sense of urgency‚Äîthough not so strong a response as to cause cognitive dissonance that would cause people to generate counterarguments. However, the CEO of the company conducting the study noted generally that visceral intensity can backfire, specifying that another term with an even stronger response, \\"environmental destruction\\", \\"is likely seen as alarmist, perhaps even implying blame, which can lead to counterarguing and pushback.\\" See also * Climate emergency declaration * Climate communication * Environmental communication * Climate justice * Green New Deal * Media coverage of global warming * Public opinion on global warming * Tipping points in the climate system * World War Zero ReferencesFurther reading * (advertising perspective by a \\"professional namer\\") * * (Nature joining Covering Climate Now.) * Vol. 58 (3).

He is best known for playing Helsinki in the Spanish crime thriller series Money Heist (2017‚Äìpresent).  Early life  Periƒá was born in Kladovo on 25 March 1977. He showed interest in the arts from a very young age; his first time onstage came at the age of six, when a Cuban singer invited him to sing \\"Guantanamera\\". That moment inspired him to perform in every school play. In 1991, at the start of the Yugoslav Wars, his dreams of going to animation school in Zagreb were halted. His parents decided that he should instead become a doctor. He was sent to veterinary school in Bucharest in Romania, where he rediscovered his passion for the cinema and theatre thanks to his student friends at the Romanian Film Academy. During that time, he continued to study medicine while acting in short films. In 1994, Periƒá moved to the Romanian city of Timi»ôoara, where he continued his studies of medicine and performed in live theatre. After six years of living in Timi»ôoara, he finished his studies and graduated with honours in veterinary medicine. While there, he had also gotten involved in the local hardcore and punk scenes, singing in bands and organizing events in the local cultural centre, where he met many international artists. This inspired him to move to Germany, where he settled in Berlin. He continued to act in short films here until 2004, when he moved to Spain and chose Barcelona as a place to live. Career Periƒá was cast in his first major Spanish job in the series Crematorio for Canal + in 2010. In 2015, he performed in A Perfect Day. In 2016, he was cast in the Atresmedia produced series Sea of Plastic / Mar de pl√°stico, in which he played Oso, a Ukrainian gangster and the main villain in the series. His best known role is that of Helsinki in the crime thriller series Money Heist (2017‚Äìpresent). The series was acquired by Netflix, which helped it become one of the most watched shows, and it won Best Drama at the Emmy Awards in 2018.

Skipper Gary Edwards, 46, of Kodiak, Alaska; Danny Vermeersch, 33 of Belgium; Josias Luna, 48, of Anchorage, Alaska; Aaron Marrs, 27, of Louisville, Kentucky; and Carlos Rivera, 35, of Uruguay all perished. The vessel's Emergency position-indicating radiobeacon station (EPIRB) went off around 8:00am AST (UTC‚àí9), at the beginning of the 2005 opilio crab hunting season. Three fishing vessels (Cornelia Marie, F/V Maverick and Sea Rover), U.S. Coast Guard ship USCGC Sherman, the Alaska state patrol boat Stimson, and a Coast Guard helicopter out of Saint Paul Island were involved in the search. The helicopter rescued Cache Seel, who was the only crewmember to make it to the life raft. Vermeersch and Rivera, who were wearing survival suits like Seel, were found dead in the water. Vermeersch was recovered by the helicopter, and Rivera was recovered by Stimson. Edwards, Luna and Marrs fell into the water without survival suits, and their bodies were never found. According to Seel's account, Edwards and Luna were thrown overboard while trying to release the life raft. Vermeersch ultimately freed it, but only Seel made it to the raft after 50 minutes in the water. The Coast Guard had limited the Big Valley, one of the smallest boats that participated in the crab fishery, to carrying 31 crab pots. She left Dutch Harbor in Unalaska, Alaska, for her final trip with 55 pots and 13,000 pounds of bait, more than three times the amount allowed, according to the Coast Guard investigation. That extra weight contributed to her fate, the investigation found. The search for Big Valley was covered in an episode of the television show, Deadliest Catch. It was Big Valley's captain, Gary Edwards, who demonstrated the EPIRB for the show. Survivor Seel, who was taken to Kodiak, Alaska, and ultimately recovered, gave authorities his account of the event, clearing up details of the night.

Lake Amik was located in the centre of Amik Plain () on the northernmost part of the Dead Sea Transform and historically covered an area of some 300-350 square kilometres, increasing during flood periods.√áali≈ükan, V. Human-Induced Wetland Degradation: A case study of Lake Amik , p.2 It was surrounded by extensive marshland. Sedimentary analysis has suggested that Lake Amik was formed, in its final state, in the past 3000 years by episodic floods and silting up of the outlet to the Orontes.Friedman et al., An X-Ray Fluorescence Study of Lake Sediments From Ancient Turkey, osti.gov, p6 This dramatic increase in the lake's area had displaced many settlements during the classical period;Yener, K. and Wilkinson, T. The Amuq Valley Projects, 1998-99 Report, University of Chicago the lake became an important source of fish and shellfish for the surrounding area and the city of Antioch.This was noted by the 4th century rhetorician Libanius, a resident of the city, in his 11th Oration: \\"We have a greater supply of fish than many who live on the coast [...] Fortune has provided each man with his due: to the rich she has given the harvest of the sea, to the rest that of the lake\\" (transl. in Norman, A. Antioch as a Centre of Hellenic Culture as Observed by Libanius, Liverpool University Press, 2000, pp.60-61) The 14th century Arab geographer Abu al-Fida described the lake as having sweet water and being long and seven wide,Yener, K. and Wilkinson, T. The Amuq Valley Projects, 1995-96 Report, University of Chicago while an 18th- century traveller, Richard Pococke, noted that it was then locally called \\"Bahr-Agoule (the White Lake) by rea≈øon of the colour of its waters\\".Pococke, R. in Pinkerton, J. A General Collection of the Best and Most Interesting Voyages and Travels in all Parts of the World, 1811, p. 545. This name would seem to be Arabic, but the Ottoman Turkish name Ak-Deniz (White Sea / Lake) is also recorded. Amik G√∂l√º is used in modern Turkish. By the 20th century, the lake supported around 50,000 inhabitants in 70 villages, who took part in stock raising, reed harvesting, fishing (with a particularly significant eel fishery) and agriculture, crops and fodder being grown on pastures formed during the summer as the lake waters receded.√áali≈ükan, p.3 They also constructed dwellings, locally known as Huƒü, from reeds gathered in the lake. Ecology Lake Amik was an extremely valuable habitat on the migratory routes of waterfowl and other birds, especially white storks and pelicans, and was noted for an isolated breeding population of the African darter. It also supported populations of endemic birds; a possible distinct subspecies of the black francolin (Francolinus francolinus billypayni) and the similarly distinct southern Turkish bearded reedling (Panurus biarmicus kosswigi). A ray-finned fish species Hemigrammocapoeta caudomaculata was only known from Lake Amik, while the cyprinid Jordan himri was found nowhere else in Turkey. With the draining of the lake, the endemic bird and fish species have become extinct; the region's biodiversity was further harmed by the fact that one of the few similar habitats, Lake Hula in northern Israel, was also drained in the 1950s. Draining Draining and reclamation of areas around the lake commenced in 1940, in order to free land for growing cotton and to eliminate malaria. A major drainage project, channeling the lake's tributary rivers (the Karasu, the ancient Labotas, and the 'Afrin, the ancient Arceuthus or Arxeuthas) directly to the Orontes was undertaken from 1966 by the State Hydraulic Works, with further works completed by the early 1970s; by this time the lake had been completely drained, and its bed reclaimed for farmland. As of 2007, Hatay Airport has been constructed in the centre of the lakebed. There have increasingly been reports that the draining of Lake Amik has caused severe environmental damage. Reclaimed and irrigated land has been affected by increasing soil salinity, and productivity has fallen. Despite the drainage works, many areas still regularly flood, requiring constant maintenance of drainage canals and further decreasing the productivity of the reclaimed farmland, while the water table has fallen dramatically from an average of 20 metres to 400 metres at some points.√áali≈ükan, pp. 5-7 The fall in underground water levels has been implicated in causing an increasing amount of subsidence and serious damage to buildings.Excessive use of underground water causes collapse , Today's Zaman, 17 July 2007 References Amik Amik Amik Category:Landforms of Hatay Province ","title":"Lake Amik"},{"id":"17987673","text":"Wayne Dobson (born 5 July 1957, Leicester, England) is an English magician who became well-known through various television appearances in the late 1980s and 1990s. At the height of his fame he had his own television series Wayne Dobson - A Kind of Magic. More recently he has become known as a campaigner for multiple sclerosis charities. Early life and magic career Dobson was born in Leicester and developed an interest in magic at an early age. He has attributed the start of this interest to experiences including seeing an entertainer at a children's party and watching television programmes such as the David Nixon show. When he was nine his parents gave him a David Nixon Magic set as a Christmas present and thereafter he became a dedicated performer always seeking to learn new tricks. During a school trip to London to visit the British Museum he stumbled upon the Davenports magic shop, to which he would return often during his teens as he sought to learn more about professional magic. At Davenports he met magician Pat Page who became a mentor and lifelong friend. Other influences cited by Dobson include Roy Johnson, Ken Brooke and Dai Vernon, who was revered among magicians for his close-up magic. and At the age of 16, Dobson became the youngest ever member of the Leicester Magic Circle. He also started to pick up work on a semi-professional basis at local clubs. In 1977 he won joint first prize in the close-up competition at the International Brotherhood of Magicians British Ring Convention. This led to his television debut on the BBC Television show Blue Peter. Encouraged by this success Dobson decided at the age of 21 to become a full-time professional magician. Dobson had developed a style of magic based around fast-talking patter and one-liner humour. It won him work as an opening act on tours with top UK performers such as Freddie Starr, Shirley Bassey and the Shadows. He also began getting guest slots on television shows. In 1988 he was hired as a support act for Engelbert Humperdinck on a tour of America, where he won positive attention and got experience of major entertainment centres such as Las Vegas. Back in the UK he was asked to perform in the 1989 Royal Variety Show at the London Palladium, where he scored a great success with an act in which he was assisted by boxer Frank Bruno and sports commentator Harry Carpenter. Later that year he made regular guest appearances on the Joe Longthorne television show. This led to him being offered his own TV series. Wayne Dobson - A Kind of Magic was aired nationally on Saturday nights on the ITV network with Linda Lusardi as his assistant and at its high point had audiences of 11 million. In total, three series were commissioned. In 1994 he briefly quit the Magic Circle after it refused to dismiss an unnamed rival whom Dobson had accused of stealing a trick.The Sun 30 April 1994 Multiple sclerosis Dobson was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS) in 1988. Although he knew this would eventually come to limit his mobility he determined to carry on working to his fullest potential. He also became an ambassador for the Multiple Sclerosis Resource Centre (MSRC) charity. Later career Having reduced his performing work because of the advance of his MS, Dobson has continued with a successful career in magic. Being highly regarded among fellow professionals he found himself in demand as a lecturer at societies and conferences. He runs DTRIK, a business developing and marketing magic tricks.

It contained human and animal remains, as well as pottery and flint implements. Features It is a, now roofless, trapezoidal long cairn, with the sides revetted by dry-stone walling almost 27m long and a shallow forecourt at each end opening into a burial gallery of four chambers. The cairn material of local stone, survives to a height of 2‚Äì3 ft and was probably originally filled sufficiently highly to cover the heavy flags which roofed the burial galleries. The basic unit of a forecourt giving access to a gallery divided into four burial chambers is repeated at each end of the long, wedge-shaped mound, so that the two individual units almost, but not quite, meet back to back near the centre of the mound. There is an intervening gap of just over 2m. Traces of at least partial corbelling of the galleries was found. The galleries are each about 10m in length, 1.2m in width and about 1.2 to 1.5m high. History The dual court grave was discovered in 1946 by a farmer. Excavations The site was excavated in 1952 by AEP (Pat) Collins of the Archaeological Survey. The burial deposits included human bones and teeth, mammal bones, artefacts, burnt earth and charcoal. At least 34 individuals of both sexes and all ages were identified, with 17 in each gallery. In the northeast gallery the remains of ten individuals were found in the chamber and another seven in the second chamber, but there were no bones or grave goods in the third and fourth chambers. All the remains were disarticulated in such a way as to suggest that they must have been defleshed before being put in the tomb, and some were burned. Over 20 of the sets of bones were unburnt and had been placed in a defleshed condition, sometimes in small neatly arranged groups, at all levels in the burial deposits, which contained burnt bone throughout. At least 15 pottery vessels, reduced to fragments by roof collapse, were identified. Some were decorated, but most were plain Western Neolithic carinated bowls. Worked flint found included a large javelin head and 12 lozenge-shaped arrowheads, as well as a number of scrappers and knives. Two of the bowls found are exceptional in having lugs like vessels found in some tombs in Scotland. Fingertip fluting on three bowls makes them similar to bowls found in Scotland and the Isle of Man.

Connection between A15 and A18  In governmental plans, the A15 and A18 together were meant to be one long motorway from the Europoort harbor near Rotterdam towards the town of Varsseveld in the east of the country. However, the section between the interchange Ressen and Zevenaar was not completed. To avoid confusion for drivers, the eastern part of the road has been given a different number: A18. In 2018, the Dutch government announced plans to extend the A15 by from the A325 south of Arnhem to the A12 northwest of Zevenaar as a toll motorway, which will provide a connection onward to the A18; the A12 will also be widened from Westervoort to the Oud-Dijk interchange with the A18, and a new Zevenaar-East exit will be built to replace the existing Zevenaar exit. Construction of the extension began in 2019 and is planned for completion between 2021 and 2023. It is unclear whether the A18 route will be renumbered as the A15 once the connection to the A12 is made.  Section A15 (and N15)  The westernmost part of the road, between the Maasvlakte and exit 8 is officially not an Autosnelweg (motorway), and is therefore known as the N15. However, it has most characteristics of a motorway, such as a central barrier and a hard shoulder until it crosses the Coloradoweg on the Maasvlakte. As of exit 8, the road becomes an official motorway, called A15. Together with the Betuweroute, which runs parallel on several stretches, the A15 is a main transport corridor from the Port of Rotterdam to the east. = Reconstruction works = In 2010, the A15 motorway near Rotterdam has been widened between the exit Brielle and the interchange Vaanplein. To the western part, between Brielle and Spijkenisse, one lane in each direction will be added, making it a 2x3 road. As for the eastern part of the section, between Spijkenisse and the Vaanplein, the current 2x3 road has been upgraded to a 2x5 road. The complex project in this highly industrialized part of Rotterdam caused an extensive loss of ‚Ç¨103 million to one of the main contractors of the project, Ballast Nedam, in the year 2014.  Section A18 (and N18)  The A18 motorway is a short motorway, with only 5 exits and 20 kilometers. The western terminus, interchange Oud-Dijk, can only be used by traffic to and from the western part of the A12. Traffic to/from the A12 east of this interchange (most likely from the German BAB 3 road) will have to use local roads to get from the A18 to the A12 or vice versa. After its eastern terminus near Varsseveld, road number 18 continues as a regional non-motorway road, therefore being called N18. This road passes the towns Harreveld, Lichtenvoorde, Groenlo, and Eibergen on its way to the city Enschede.

It saw action in the Second Boer War, World War I and World War II, during which one of its regiments distinguished itself defending the 'Canal Line' during the retreat to Dunkirk, and served at Alamein, in Sicily and Italy. Its other regiment served in East Africa, the Siege of Tobruk, and in Iraq and Persia. The regiment's lineage is maintained today by 2 (Surrey Yeomanry) Field Troop, 579 Field Squadron (EOD), part of 101 (London) Engineer Regiment (Explosive Ordnance Disposal) (Volunteers). Formation and early history In 1793, the prime minister, William Pitt the Younger, proposed that the English Counties form a force of Volunteer Yeoman Cavalry that could be called on by the king to defend the country against invasion or by the Lord Lieutenant to subdue any civil disorder within the country. The regiment was raised as the Surrey Gentlemen and Yeomanry Cavalry in 1794 but was disbanded in 1828. The Corps of Surrey Yeomanry was raised in 1831 and, after becoming the Surrey Regiment of Yeomanry Cavalry in 1832, it was also disbanded in 1848. Second Boer War Imperial Yeomanry galloping over a plain during the Second Boer War. The Surrey Imperial Yeomanry was raised on 30 April 1901 from veterans who had served with the Imperial Yeomanry in the Second Boer War. From June 1902 it was known as the Surrey (the Princess of Wales‚Ä≤s) Imperial Yeomanry. In 1908 the Regiment became part of the Territorial Force, and like the other yeomanry regiment dropped the Imperial. The regiment was based at Kings Avenue in Clapham at this time. World War I In accordance with the Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907 (7 Edw. 7, c.9) which brought the Territorial Force into being, the TF was intended to be a home defence force for service during wartime and members could not be compelled to serve outside the country. However, on the outbreak of war on 4 August 1914, many members volunteered for Imperial Service. Therefore, TF units were split in August and September 1914 into 1st Line (liable for overseas service) and 2nd Line (home service for those unable or unwilling to serve overseas) units. Later, a 3rd Line was formed to act as a reserve, providing trained replacements for the 1st and 2nd Line regiments. = 1/1st Surrey Yeomanry= A patrol of Surrey Yeomanry passing through the ruined village of Caulaincourt during the German retreat to the Hindenburg Line, 1917. On mobilisation the Surrey Yeomanry now known as the 1/1st Surrey Yeomanry was attached to the South Eastern Mounted Brigade of the 1st Mounted Division. In late 1914 the regiment was split up, with the Regimental Headquarters and A Squadron being attached to the 27th Division ; B Squadron joined the 28th Division while C Squadron joined the 29th Division. C Squadron would see service in the Dardanelles campaign at Gallipoli in 1916 moved to France as the XV Corps Cavalry squadron which lasted until July 1917 when they were dismounted and sent to be retrained as infantry, before being drafted into the 10th Battalion Royal West Surrey Regiment in September 1917. In December 1916 the regiments A and B Squadrons reformed to become the XVI Corps Cavalry Regiment in Salonika. = 2/1st Surrey Yeomanry= The 2nd Line regiment was formed at Clapham in September 1914 and moved to Dorking. In May 1915 it went to Maresfield, in September to Wrotham and in the winter of 1915‚Äì16 it was at Hastings, possibly in 1/1st South Western Mounted Brigade which became 2/1st Southern Mounted Brigade. On 31 March 1916, the remaining Mounted Brigades were ordered to be numbered in a single sequence; the brigade was numbered as 16th Mounted Brigade and joined 4th Mounted Division in the Manningtree area. In July 1916, 4th Mounted Division became 2nd Cyclist Division and the regiment was converted to a cyclist unit in 7th Cyclist Brigade at Woodbridge . In November 1916 the division was broken up and the regiment was merged with the 2/1st Sussex Yeomanry to form 8th (Surrey and Sussex) Yeomanry Cyclist Regiment in 3rd Cyclist Brigade at Ipswich. In March 1917 it resumed its identity as 2/1st Surrey Yeomanry at Ipswich, and in July moved back to the Woodbridge area. In May 1918, the regiment moved with 3rd Cyclist Brigade to Ireland. It was stationed at Athlone and Galway; there was no further change before the end of the war. = 3/1st Surrey Yeomanry= The 3rd Line regiment was formed in February 1915 at Clapham and in June it was affiliated to the 3rd Reserve Cavalry Regiment at Canterbury. Early in 1917 it was absorbed in the 1st Reserve Cavalry Regiment at The Curragh. Between the wars Memorial to the Surrey Yeomanry dead of WWI and WWII, inside thumb In February 1920 The Surrey Yeomanry (Queen Mary's Regiment) (TF) was reformed, Headquarters once again opened at 73 King's Avenue, Clapham, London. With the South-Eastern Mounted Brigade (TF) having been disbanded, the Surrey Yeomanry was reformed as an Army Troops unit within Eastern Command. In November 1921 the Territorial Force was renamed as The Territorial Army. However, the post-war reorganisations of the Territorials made most of its Yeomanry Cavalry Regiments surplus to requirements and in early 1922 it was announced that the Surrey Yeomanry would convert to Royal Field Artillery and provide two batteries to an existing Brigade, 98th (Sussex Yeomanry) Army Brigade, RFA (TF). This had been formed in 1920 by the conversion to Artillery of the Sussex Yeomanry and comprised Headquarters and 389th (Sussex Yeomanry) Battery at Brighton and 390th (Sussex Yeomanry) Battery at Chichester. The Surrey Yeomanry would then form 391st (Surrey Yeomanry) and 392nd (Surrey Yeomanry) (Howitzer) Batteries, both at Clapham. As a result of this merger the Brigade was redesignated as 98th (Surrey and Sussex Yeomanry) Brigade, RFA (TA).Litchfield, pp. 222, 233; Appendix VII. The unit was among the 'Army Troops' administered by 44th (Home Counties) Divisional Area.Titles & Designations 1927. A reorganisation of TA Field Forces was announced in February 1938 and as part of this the Brigade redesignated 98th (Surrey and Sussex Yeomanry, Queen Mary's) Army Field Regiment, RA (TA). It was ordered to reorganise and reduce to two Batteries, in line with the new establishment for TA Field Artillery, but this reorganisation did not immediately come into effect. In March 1939 the War Office ordered the doubling of the Territorial Army and this enabled the Regiment to shed its two surplus Batteries. The Sussex Yeomanry Batteries were withdrawn and formed into a duplicate Regiment, 144th (Sussex Yeomanry) Army Field Regiment, RA (TA), leaving the original Regiment comprising Headquarters, 391st and 392nd Field Batteries.Farndale, Annex K. World War II 98th Field Regiment (Surrey & Sussex Yeomanry Queen Mary's)= Battle of France 18-Pounder being inspected in France, April 1940. The regiment mobilised at Worthing under Lt-Col G.A. Ledingham, MC, TD, who had been the commanding officer (CO) since 1937, and it joined I Corps of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) in France by 27 September 1939.Army List.Ellis, France and Flanders, Appendix I.Farndale, p. 14.Joslen, p. 462.98 (S&SY;) Fd Rgt at RA 39‚Äì45.GHQ troops May/June 1940 at RA 39‚Äì45. Its guns were World War I vintage 18-pounders, some handed over by 1st and 2nd Regiments Royal Horse Artillery who were receiving more modern guns, and 98th also took over vehicles from its sister regiment, 144th.Farndale, p. 22.Farndale, pp. 60‚Äì1.144 (S&SY;) Fd Rgt at RA 39‚Äì45. On 10 May 1940, the Phoney War ended with the German invasion of the Low Countries, so the BEF followed the pre-arranged Plan D and advanced into Belgium to take up defences along the River Dyle. 98th (S&SY;) Field Rgt was with I Corps on the Dyle Line by 15 May 1940.Ellis, France and Flanders, Chapter III. However, the Panzers of the Wehrmacht's Army Group A had broken through the Ardennes and threatened the BEF's flank, so on 16 May it began to withdraw to the River Escaut. The regiment was with I Corps on the Escaut Line by 21 May 1940.Ellis, France and Flanders, Chapter IV. By now the enemy was in the BEF's rear. To hold the line of the Aire Canal north of Saint-Omer the BEF organised a scratch force of rear elements ('Polforce'), and on 22 May 392 Bty was hastily sent to join the defenders on the Canal Line. The battery only had seven 18-pounders, so each was sent to cover one of the bridges against the advancing 1st Panzer Division:Farndale, p. 74, Map 16.Ellis, Chapter VIII, p. 128‚Äì30. * Hazebrouck: 15 minutes after digging in, the gun stopped an enemy column, knocking out the lead vehicles. It was then attacked by 11 tanks, putting one (possibly two) out of action before the gun crew were all wounded and the ammunition limber blown up. The gun was withdrawn with its wounded detachment. * Arques: Sappers were blowing up the bridge when the gun arrived. Advancing enemy troops were firing on and nearing the gun position when it was relieved by the 12th Royal Lancers and withdrawn. * Renescure: The gun destroyed enemy-held houses across the bridge and remained in action until late afternoon. One enemy tank was destroyed but mortar fire on the gun position forced a withdrawal; as the gun was being limbered up the tractor was hit and the position overrun. * Wardrecques: The gun supported a party of French infantry, destroying houses opposite and silencing a machine gun, but heavy fire drove the French back and although the gun remained in action it was destroyed by a direct hit shortly afterwards. * Blaringhem: The gun covered French and British troops. A morning attack was repulsed with the destruction of an enemy tank and two troop carriers. During another attack the gun fired 130 rounds before the enemy closed in. A shell broke the limber connection and the gun had to be abandoned. * Wittes: This gun was in position during the night of 22/23 May. Nothing further was heard of it and the detachment was captured. * Saint- Momelin: Here the bridge was held for three days with the help of gunners of 51st (Lowland) Heavy Rgt armed with a few rifles and Bren guns. The gun destroyed enemy-held houses and mortar positions across the canal and being well dug in it survived all retaliation and repulsed all attempts to cross. The gunners had the satisfaction of intercepting a German radio message that said 'Bridge at Momelin strongly held, try elsewhere'. The defenders at St Momelin were relieved by French troops on 25 May. The RA regimental historian wrote: 'Seldom have two troops of field guns done so much to hold off an armoured division for so long. The delay they caused was vital and saved many Allied lives'. The regiment then fell back into the 'pocket' round Dunkirk from which the BEF was preparing evacuation (Operation Dynamo). Without the support of a divisional structure the Army field regiments had a difficult time, having to fend for themselves.Farndale, pp. 84‚Äì5. 98th (S&SY;) Field Rgt attached itself to 44th (HC) Division, but got caught in a traffic jam at Saint-Jans-Cappel on 29 May and the gunners were forced to destroy and abandon their guns and vehicles before proceeding on foot to the beaches for evacuation. Home defence On arrival in England the regiment was sent to Okehampton Camp, and then to join a scratch '1st Infantry Brigade' formed by the Royal Artillery at Bourne, Lincolnshire. Detachments were sent to the Sussex coast on anti-invasion duties manning 12-pounder and 4-inch naval guns mounted on Albion and Scammell lorries.Farndale, p. 104. By July the rest of the regiment was manning tradesmen's vans and an old Rolls-Royce car, first at Hall Green, Birmingham, then Ince Blundell, Lancashire, (where the Sussex detachments rejoined), and in October at Huyton, Lancashire. Detachments of gunners were sent out to man roadblocks and static guns. Part of 391 Bty was at Barford in the outer defences of Birmingham with Hotchkiss 6-pounders, the rest at Tarvin on airfield defence. 392 Battery was in detachments from Maryport to Speke with weapons ranging from obsolete 6-pounders to 1913-vintage 13-pounders. In December 1940 the regiment went to Portsmouth in Southern Command, where it joined V Corps. When field regiments were reorganised on a three-battery basis, 98th (S&SY;) Fd Rgt formed 471 Bty in January 1941, armed with four French 75mm guns, while 391 and 392 Btys each had two of the new 25-pounders. By April 1941 the regiment was fully equipped with 24 x 25-pounders. It also gained an attached Royal Corps of Signals section and a Light Aid Detachment (LAD) of the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers. The regiment did a spell as depot regiment at the School of Artillery at Larkhill Camp and was later stationed at Sturminster Marshall, the Isle of Wight, and Wimborne Minster.Farndale, Annex D.Order of Battle of the Field Force in the United Kingdom, Part 3: Royal Artillery, 26 December 1940, The National Archives (TNA), Kew, files WO 212/4 and WO 33/2365.Order of Battle of the Field Force in the United Kingdom, Part 3: Royal Artillery (Non- divisional units), 25 March 1941, TNA files WO 212/5 and WO 33/2323.

North Africa 98th (S&SY;) Field Regiment landed in Egypt where on 19 September 1942 it joined 10th Armoured Division in Eighth Army.

On the second night of the Second Battle of El Alamein (24/25 October), 10th Armoured Division advanced with strong artillery support from its own regiments and several others, but the tanks could not keep up with the barrage and struggled up to Miteirya Ridge. On 27/28 October the division's lorried infantry brigade attacked the 'Woodcock' and 'Snipe' objectives, but because of the confusion on the objectives the artillery plan had to be very simple, and communication between brigade HQ and the guns broke down. The infantry took serious casualties and dug in short of their objectives. 10th Armoured Division was withdrawn into reserve, but after the battle it took part in the pursuit to Mersa Matruh.Playfair & Molony, Vol. IV, pp. 44‚Äì7, 54‚Äì7, 81‚Äì92. After Matruh, 10th Armoured Division withdrew to the Nile Delta,Playfair & Molony, Vol. IV, p. 221. and on 29 December 98th (S&SY;) Fd Rgt came under Middle East Forces. In Egypt it re-equipped with M7 Priest 105mm self- propelled (SP) guns.Joslen, p. 484‚Äì5. Sicily and Italy 98th (S&SY;) Field Regiment rejoined Eighth Army for the Allied invasion of Sicily (Operation Husky) in July 1943.Joslen, p. 486. The landings began on 10 July. On 13 July a Commando and paratroop attack (Operation Fustian) had seized Primosole Bridge over the Simeto river and prevented its demolition, but had been unable to retain possession of the bridge. Early on 15 July the SP guns of 98th (S&SY;) and 24th Fd Rgts were brought up to support 50th (Northumbrian) Division and 4th Armoured Brigade in their renewed attempts to gain a bridgehead. Aided by a heavy barrage, three battalions of the Durham Light Infantry (DLI) forced their way across.Barnes, pp. 15‚Äì38.Molony, Vol. V, pp. 102‚Äì3. The regiment came into action again on 17 July, together with six other field and medium regiments, in support of an attack on the Fossa Bottaceto, south of Catania, by 6th and 9th Bns DLI and the tanks of 3rd County of London Yeomanry (Sharpshooters). The guns fired a concentration for 30 minutes before Zero (which was at 01.00), then barrages and concentrations as required. The operation bogged down in close country and an attempt to restart it the next night broke down when the artillery was directed to fire on the Bottaceto itself, while German troops were still in position in front of it.Molony, Vol V, pp. 104‚Äì5. 105mm Priest SP gun supporting 78th Division in Italy. After Sicily had been secured, Eighth Army moved to the invasion of mainland Italy, crossing the Strait of Messina to land around Reggio di Calabria on 3 September (Operation Baytown). From Reggio, 98th (S&SY;) Fd Rgt moved to Taranto where in October it embarked in Landing Ships, Tank for a four-day voyage round the 'heel' of Italy to Manfredonia, from where it advanced to Foggia.Joslen, p. 467. By November, Eighth Army faced the Germans' Bernhardt Line. An assault crossing of the River Sangro on 28 November by V Corps was supported by massive artillery fire, the field regiments (98th (S&SY;) being attached to 78th Division for the operation) firing over 600 rounds per gun in the first three days. On 9 December 1st Canadian Division joined the battle round the Moro River, with 98th (S&SY;) Fd Rgt among the units firing in support.Molony, Vol V, pp. 489‚Äì91, 500‚Äì2. Gunners of the Surrey & Sussex Yeomanry play an impromptu game of cricket in front of their Priest SP guns in Italy. By January 1944 the regiment had been switched to the other side of Italy to join in X Corps' assault crossing of the Garigliano. The operation began on the night of 17/18 January with 98th (S&SY;) Fd Rgt firing in support of 5th Division after the infantry had made a silent crossing.Molony, Vol V, pp. 606‚Äì12. The opening of the 1944 Allied spring offensive in Italy saw 98th (S&SY;) Fd Rgt assigned to 8th Indian Division to force a crossing of the River Gari as part of Operation Diadem. The attack began at 23.45 on the night of 11/12 May, with every gun employed in counter- battery bombardment from 23.00 to 23.40. The field guns concentrated on the Nebelwerfer mortar positions and then provided a creeping barrage for the infantry advancing at a rate of in six minutes. The leading battalions of 8th Indian Division crossed without much difficulty, covered by mist in the river valley, but aroused by the preliminary bombardment the Germans brought down their pre-arranged defensive fire. The infantry were pinned down and dug in, while the barrage rolled away from them beyond the German positions. However, by morning they had won a small bridgehead, bridges were being built and the first armour crossed before nightfall.Molony, Vol VI, Pt 1, pp. 76‚Äì84, 107‚Äì9. Preserved Sexton 25-pounder SP gun. After the fall of Rome on 4 June, the Allies pressed the German forces back to the Gothic Line, where the advance bogged down again. North West Europe In the winter of 1944‚Äì45 a number of units and formations were transferred from the Italian Front to 21st Army Group fighting in North West Europe. 98th (S&SY;) Field Regiment was one of those sent in March 1945, and was re-equipped with Sexton 25-pounder SP guns.Joslen, p. 463. The regiment served in the Netherlands and in April 1945 it moved to L√ºbeck in Germany with the occupation forces. Demobilisation began in October 1945 and the regiment passed into suspended animation in June 1946. = 144th Field Regiment (Surrey & Sussex Yeomanry Queen Mary's)= ::See main article 144th Field Regiment (Surrey & Sussex Yeomanry Queen Mary's) The 144th Field Regiment remained in the United Kingdom in the early war years as part of Home Forces, attached to 4th Division after its return from the Dunkirk evacuation. In November 1940 they were sent to Egypt and then attached to the 5th Indian Division seeing service in the Sudan, Abyssinia and Eritrea it was at Keru Gorge that 390 Battery were charged by about 60 Eritrean cavalry, almost certainly the last cavalry charge on the British Army. The Regiment returned to Egypt with the division before being attached to the 70th Infantry Division during the Siege of Tobruk in September 1941. After being withdrawn from Tobruk they were briefly attached to the 4th Indian Division in early 1942 and the British 1st Armoured Division in February to April 1942. In May 1942 they were sent to Iraq with the 10th Army attached to the 17th Indian Infantry Brigade and then to 31st Indian Armoured Division. They remained with this formation until the end of the war serving in Syria, Persia, Egypt, Palestine and Lebanon. Postwar In 1947 98th (S&SY;) Field Rgt was reformed as the 298th (Surrey Yeomanry, Queen Mary's) Field Regiment, while 144th Field Rgt reformed as 344th (Sussex Yeomanry) Light Anti-Aircraft/Searchlight Regiment. The 298th amalgamated with 263rd (6th London) Field Regiment, 291st (4th London) Field Regiment, and 381st (East Surrey) Light Regiment to form 263rd (Surrey Yeomanry, Queen's Mary's) Field Regiment in 1961. The unit was disbanded in 1967 but reformed as B (Surrey Yeomanry) Troop, 200 (Sussex Yeomanry) Field Battery, 100 Medium Regiment RA (V) in 1969. In April 1971 the unit was re-designated D (Surrey Yeomanry) Battery, 6th (V) Battalion, The Queen's Regiment. In April 1975 the battalion amalgamated with the 7th (Volunteer) Battalion to form 6th/7th (Volunteer) Battalion but the Surrey Yeomanry lineage was discontinued at that time. In October 1992 2 (Surrey Yeomanry) Troop, 127 (Sussex Yeomanry) Field Squadron, 78th (Fortress) Engineer Regiment, RE (V) was formed; in July 1999 this unit was transferred to 579 Field Squadron (EOD), part of 101 (London) Engineer Regiment (Explosive Ordnance Disposal) (Volunteers) at Reigate Army Reserve Centre. Uniforms and insignia Following the South African War yeomanry regiments were encouraged to discard their expensive and colourful 19th century uniforms in favour of the newly introduced khaki service dress of 1902.Imperial Yeomanry Regulations of 1903 While understandable as an economy measure this policy overlooked the importance of \\"the peacock factor\\" in attracting volunteer recruits. Accordingly, most long-established yeomanry regiments reverted to simplified versions of their traditionally elaborate parade and off-duty uniforms within a few years. A notable exception was the Surrey Yeomanry, which adopted the khaki uniform of the New South Wales Lancers as a model from 1901. Even this was ornamented by the addition of a detachable scarlet plastron and facings for parade, together with green feather plumes on the slouch hats. In 1912 a compromise dark blue full dress of simple design was adopted,R.G. Harris, colour plate 25 and text, \\"50 Years of Yeomanry Uniforms\\", Frederick Muller Ltd 1972, SBN 584 10937 7 while the standard khaki service dress of British mounted troops was worn for training and ordinary duties. Surrey & Sussex Yeomanry remembered at the Field of Remembrance, Westminster Abbey, November 2009. Between 1922 and 1930, 98th Field Brigade is believed to have worn an embroidered arm badge with '98' over 'Bde' in a circle in red. on a dark blue background. The RA cap badge was at first worn by all batteries of 98th Field Bde, but after 1930 the batteries wore their Surrey or Sussex Yeomanry cap and collar badges as appropriate. This continued during World War II, with both regiments also wearing an embroidered shoulder title with 'SURREY & SUSSEX' over 'YEOMANRY Q.M.R.' in yellow on navy blue. In the Middle East they wore brass shoulder titles on khaki drill jackets, with 'S&Sx.Yeo;' for 98th Field Rgt and 'SSY' for 144th Field Rgt. After World War II, both regiments retained their respective Surrey or Sussex Yeomanry cap badges and yellow on navy shoulder titles, 'SURREY YEOMANRY Q.M.R.' for 298th Field Rgt and 'SUSSEX YEOMANRY' for 344th LAA/SL Rgt.

Originally intended as a retail release, the game was released as a downloadable WiiWare game instead.Get Even With Space Invaders On WiiWare It was released in Japan on August 26, 2008, in Europe on November 7, 2008,EU WiiWare Update: Alien Crush Returns, Brain Challenge and Space Invaders Get Even and in North America on December 1, 2008.USA WiiWare Update: Space Invaders Get Even & Pit Crew Panic! Outside Japan the game is published by Square Enix. The game costs 500 Nintendo Points. However, only one stage (consisting of two levels and a boss battle), dubbed the \\"Starter Pack\\" is initially available. The game's six additional stages must be purchased separately as three downloadable content packs, also priced at 500 Points each. As a result, the complete game costs a total of 2000 Nintendo Points. Gameplay The origins of the game lie with the original classic arcade game Space Invaders. However, Space Invaders Get Even puts a twist on the formula by letting the player control the space invaders themselves.Role reversal! Taito lets you players control Space Invaders Breaking away from the gameplay of the original game and its spin-offs, Space Invaders Get Even sees players piloting the invader's UFO across a landscape rendered in 3D graphics, which encompasses areas such as cities, deserts, forests, oceans and military bases. By downloading the extra stages, players are also given the option to swap out the UFO in the game with ships from the Darius and RayForce series of Taito shoot 'em ups, as well as a polygonal version of the \\"classic\\" UFO from Space Invaders. Players move the UFO with the analog stick of the Nunchuk, and then use the pointer function of the Wii Remote to direct a swarm of up to 100 invaders in blowing up buildings and destroying the defending forces of Earth, with continuing destruction increasing the time available to the player. The invaders, which are rendered as flat, glowing two dimensional sprites which resemble the invaders in the original game, can utilize a number of attack formations to dispatch enemies, including forming a drill-like formation to bore into them or crushing them by bouncing on top of them from above.Square-Enix Gets Invaded! Over time, human forces will shoot down the player's invader troops, which the player replenishes by shaking the Wiimote. Upon eliminating all opposition in the stage, which includes fighter jets, helicopter gunships and gunboats, the player must then take on a large boss, which include a giant tank, mecha and a huge battleship.Dengeki Online The final battle of the game is against the original UFO that crashed on Earth 30 years ago during the first invasion, upgraded and modified by the earthlings. The game also features online leaderboards. Reception Wired Chris Kohler found the gameplay in the Starter Pack to be \\"addictive and well-balanced\\", yet lamented that making the rest of the stages available only as paid downloadable content was like \\"the modern-day equivalent of Insert Coin To Continue\\".Impressions: Space Invaders Get Even, the Secretly Episodic Game Nintendo Life, which gave it an 8/10, called it \\"a wonderful new take on the franchise\\", though they also believed that players may be put off by both having to purchase the additional stages and needing to free up the amount of internal memory (approximately 700 blocks) required for the game and its additional content.WiiWare World: Space Invaders Get Even Review These sentiments were also echoed by 1UP.com, who gave the game a B- grade and called the gameplay a \\"high concentration of amusing (and plain ol' fun)\\" action.1UP.com Space Invaders Get Even Review IGN gave it a 5.9/10, praising the gameplay and the game's humor, but could not justify the cost of purchasing the whole package.

It is a tall cylinder filled with water with several entrances at varying depths each simulating an airlock in a submarine. Since the 1930s, towers have been built for use by the Royal Navy, US Navy, Royal Australian Navy and in several other countries. Royal Navy SETT Top of the SETT pool Divers in the SETT The Submarine Escape Training Tank (SETT) is a deep facility primarily operated to conduct training with submarine escape equipment, operated by the Royal Navy. The facility, located at Fort Blockhouse, Gosport opposite HMNB Portsmouth, includes a fresh, chlorinated water column with a single escape chamber (as fitted to some classes of RN submarines) mounted at the base, through which students can conduct a fully representative escape cycle from , closely replicating actions which would be required if forced to abandon a distressed submarine from depth. The SETT has its own dedicated boiler house to maintain its water temperature at 34 ¬∞C (94 ¬∞F). The SETT was commissioned in 1954, with the first students trained in July of that year. Since that time completion of ‚Äòthe Tank‚Äô has been a rite of passage for all RN Submariners. Training includes ascents from increasing depths as a major element, but in addition is underpinned by lectures and practical training in how to survive within a disabled submarine, operation of emergency equipment and survival techniques on reaching the surface ‚Äì a package of potentially life saving skills. Over the years, the SETT has been used to train submariners from Italy, USA, Greece, Canada, Israel, Russia, Venezuela, Turkey, Australia and the Netherlands ‚Äì with the staff and facility enjoying a worldwide reputation for excellence and good practice. Owing to a combination of increased safety associated with modern submarine design, submarines operating in areas where escape would be impossible with current equipment and the risk associated with the conduct of training, the RN discontinued pressurised submarine escape training in March 2009. The staff at RNSETT are drawn from the ranks of the UK Submarine Service. All members of SETT staff form part of the SMERAT (Submarine Escape and Rescue Advisory Team), some members form the UK SPAG (Submarine Parachute Assistance Group), and some form part of the UK contribution to the NSRS (LR5) Team. All staff are trained in advanced life- saving techniques and diving medicine. =Other uses= At, Pearl Harbor, Hawaii The tower was also privately hired to civilian diving clubs for the purpose of recreational diving and dive training. It was a popular 'novelty' dive amongst UK SCUBA divers since it allowed new trainees to extend their depth experience in a safe, controlled environment with good visibility and warm water temperature ‚Äì two conditions that are in short supply in the UK. For similar reasons it was also used for freediving training, with participants including world record-holder Tanya Streeter.Farrell, Emma (2006) One Breath: A Reflection on Freediving, photographs by Frederic Buyle, Pynto Ltd., Hatherley, UK: In addition, the SETT has been used frequently for both underwater equipment testing, and to support media activity ‚Äì notably hosting Blue Peter on a number of occasions, with some presenters completing ascent training. It has also been used frequently as a Situation Assessment Trials Tank (SATT) for Technical Divers. Other facilities US Navy escape towers were known as Escape Training Tanks. From the 1930s through the 1990s they were used for training in buoyant ascent, the Momsen lung, and the Steinke hood. The decommissioned tower on Ford Island, Hawaii, was built to train United States Navy Pacific Fleet submariners prior to World War II, and was converted for use as an airport control tower after the attack on Pearl Harbor. Across the harbor, the tower on Sub-Base Pearl Harbor was used between 1932 and 1983. Neither of the U.S. escape towers in Hawaii are in use. The towers were also used to train SCUBA equipped divers (SEALs) or Underwater Demolition Teams to access or egress the submarine during Special Operations. The tower once located on Naval Submarine Base New London was in use between 1930 and 1994 and has since been razed. The Submarine Escape Trainer, a high, 84,000-gallon pool with two escape trunks was constructed at New London in 2007.

Lugalanda was the son of the high priest of Lagash, who appointed him as king. At this time the high priests of Lagash were very influential, and either occupied the throne, or decided who should. The priests, especially the high priests, remained very influential during Lugalanda's reign. Lugalanda was married to Baranamtarra, the daughter of a great landowner who had commercial connections with the queen of Adab. All documents mentioning the reign of Lugalanda describe him as a wealthy and corrupt king. They say his reign was a time of great corruption and injustice against the weak. Inscriptions state that the king confiscated approximately 650 Morgen (up to 650 hectares) of land. After nine years in power, Lugalanda was overthrown by Urukagina. Seals of Lugalanda.

He also went by his nickname of \\"Bull\\" during his career. Adams was originally from South Fremantle where he played 32 games from his debut in 1921. In his first season, he was included in the Western Australian squad for the Perth Carnival, but did not manage a game. Adams came to Melbourne in 1923 to play with Fitzroy, but was refused a clearance by South Fremantle and instead became captain-coach of Preston in the Victorian Junior Football Association (pictured right with John Wren Shield as premiers). Adams was cleared the following year and played in the Fitzroy side which contested the finals that season. He was club captain for their 1926 campaign and as well as finishing equal fifth in the Brownlow Medal count he represented Victoria at interstate football that year. A tough and physical player, Adams spent most of his time in defence but was also used on the ball. In 1927 he left Fitzroy and joined Northcote in the Victorian Football Association (VFA) where he faced a unique challenge. That year, Doug Nicholls became one of the first aboriginals to play senior football in Melbourne and according to Mavis Thorp Clark in her 1965 book on Nicholls, Pastor Doug, Adams warned the players before taking the ground that although \\"they had colour in the side, they were to kick to the guernsey and disregard the colour\\".\\"Pastor Doug\\", Mavis Thorp Clark, Lansdowne Press, 1965 Adams trained with Richmond in 1928 but failed to come to terms with the club and he returned to Preston for two seasons. He had his best year with them in 1929 when he won both their best and fairest award and kicked 69 goals to top their goal kicking. Adams then moved to Tasmania for the 1930 season, being playing coach of North Launceston in the Northern Tasmanian Football Association (NTFA) competition. After spending the first half of the 1931 football season as playing coach of Prahran, Adams returned to the VFL and signed up with Melbourne where he would play until his retirement as a player at the end of the 1932 season. He continued his coaching career with Melbourne, coaching their reserves to five premierships between 1933 and 1939. His coaching career peaked in 1945 when he was appointed coach of South Melbourne and steered them to the 1945 VFL Grand Final. South Melbourne lost the game and despite remaining with them for another three years he was unable to qualify the club for another finals series. He coaching at South Melbourne was terminated half way through the 1948 season after he openly criticized the team in a radio interview. Adams had said \\" The players lack fierceness and some of the players were being like bottled fed babies\\". Coach invited to resign, page 5, The News 30 June 1948 He was replaced by Jack Hale. From various reports during his years at Preston, Adams was just as colourful character off the football field as on, having played senior cricket in Perth and won state swimming championships. Off the field, he was no mean pianist, entertaining at many club socials, and was described as a \\"dab hand\\" at chess. He also had a fondness for poetry, and more than once quoted lines from the classics in his addresses to players. According to the Northcote Leader in 1927 when he was coaching the local club, Adam's favourite lines were from English poet, Sir Henry Newbolt: > \\"and the captain's hand on his shoulder smote, play up, play up and play the > game\\" ReferencesExternal links  *DemonWiki profile Category:1900 births Category:South Fremantle Football Club players Category:Fitzroy Football Club players Category:Melbourne Football Club players Category:Sydney Swans coaches Category:Northcote Football Club players Category:Preston Football Club (VFA) players Category:Northern Blues coaches Category:Prahran Football Club players Category:Prahran Football Club coaches Category:North Launceston Football Club players Category:North Launceston Football Club coaches Category:Australian rules footballers from Western Australia Category:1973 deaths ","title":"Bill Adams (Australian footballer)"},{"id":"17988287","text":"Codex Corbiensis (ff or 66), according to Bruce Metzger, is a mutilated copy of the four Gospels, of the fifth or sixth century, formerly belonging to the monastery of Corbey, near Amiens, and now in the Biblioth√®que Nationale at Paris.

She was the younger sister of his sixth wife, Catherine Parr. Early years Anne was born on 15 June 1515 to Sir Thomas Parr and Maud Green. She was the youngest surviving child of five, having an older sister Catherine and brother William Parr, 1st Marquess of Northampton. In 1517, when she was two years old, her father died of the sweating sickness leaving her mother a widow at twenty-five, pregnant, and with the grave responsibility of guarding the inheritance of the Parr children.Linda Porter. Katherine the Queen. Macmillan, 2010. Maud Green was a lady-in-waiting and confidant to Catherine of Aragon. She was also head of the Royal school at court where Anne was educated alongside her sister Catherine and other daughters of the nobility. They were taught by the brilliant Humanist scholar Joan Llu√≠s Vives who was the principal tutor at the Royal school.Anthony Martienssen \\"Queen Katherine Parr\\", page 21 Anne would have been taught French, Latin, philosophy, theology, and the Classics. Maud Green had already taught her children to read and write when they were small. Anne herself later said that her education at home was based on the approach used in the family of Sir Thomas More where boys and girls were educated together; as was the case with the Parrs until her brother left home in 1525 to join the household of Henry FitzRoy, 1st Duke of Richmond and Somerset.  At court  Sometime in 1528, Maud Green secured her 13-year-old daughter, Anne, a post at Court as maid-of-honour to Queen Catherine of Aragon. Anne was then made a ward of King Henry. When Anne Boleyn was crowned queen in 1533, Anne Parr continued in the same capacity as maid-of-honour. She quickly succumbed to the spell of Queen Anne's charismatic personality and following the Queen's example, she became an ardent supporter of the New Faith.Martienssen, pages64-5 After Anne Boleyn's fall from power and subsequent execution, Anne remained at Court in the service of the new queen, Jane Seymour. Anne Parr served all of Henry VIII's queens from the mid-1530s, and is one of the few women to have been lady-in-waiting to all six. She was one of the few present at the baptism of Prince Edward on 15 October 1537 and was part of the funeral cortege of Jane Seymour. When King Henry took as his fourth wife Anne of Cleves, Anne returned to her role as maid-of-honour, which she remained in when Queen Anne was supplanted by Catherine Howard. Following Queen Catherine's arrest for adultery, Anne Parr was entrusted with the Queen's jewels.Martienssen, page137  Marriage  William Herbert, 1st Earl of Pembroke, Anne's husband In February 1538, Anne married Sir William Herbert, Esquire of the King's Body. Herbert was the son of Sir Richard Herbert, the illegitimate son of William Herbert, 1st Earl of Pembroke. It is likely that Anne met her husband at court. It is not known whether or not the marriage was a love match, but both Anne and her sister Catherine had been attracted to dashing men of action who were slightly disreputable. The Herberts, due to King Henry's newly found infatuation for Catherine, appeared to be in the King's favour, as for the next few years Anne and her husband received a succession of Royal grants which included the Abbey of Wilton in Wiltshire (pulled down and built over for Wilton House in the 1540s), Remesbury (north Wiltshire), and Cardiff Castle. They also used Baynard's Castle as their London residence. Anne had three children by her husband: Henry, who succeeded his father; Edward Herbert; and Anne Herbert. For the birth of her second son, Anne's sister loaned her the manor of Hanworth in Middlesex for her lying in. After the birth, Anne visited Lady Hertford, who had also just given birth, at Syon House near Richmond. In August, the queen sent a barge to bring Anne by river from Syon back to Westminster.  Queen's sister  Anne Parr was a witness to the wedding ceremony performed at Hampton Court Palace on 12 July 1543, when King Henry married her sister Catherine. In September 1544, William Herbert was knighted on the battlefield at the Siege of Boulogne during the King's campaign against the French. Anne was her sister's chief lady-in-waiting and the sisters were close. Anne was also part of the clique of Protestants who surrounded the new Queen. In 1546, fellow Protestant Anne Askew was arrested for heresy. Those who opposed the Queen tried to gain a confession from Askew that the Queen, her sister, and the other women were Protestants. Queen Catherine and some of her closest friends had previously shown favour to the arrested woman. Stephen Gardiner, Bishop of Winchester; Thomas Wriothesley; and Richard Rich were involved in torturing Anne Askew and interrogating her about her connections to the ladies at court who were suspected to be Protestants, in particular: Anne Parr; the Queen; Katherine Willoughby; Anne Stanhope; and Anne Calthorpe, Countess of Sussex. Gardiner and Wriothesley obtained the King‚Äôs permission to arrest and question the Queen about her religious beliefs. Catherine visited the King in his bedchamber and adroitly managed to persuade the King that her interest in the new religion had been undertaken solely as a means to provide stimulating conversation to distract the King from the pain caused by his ulcerous leg. Henry was appeased, and before the arrests were due to take place, he was reconciled to Catherine. On 28 January 1547, the King died. After Henry VIII's death, when the queen dowager's household was at Chelsea, both Anne and her son Edward were part of the household there. Her husband, William Herbert was appointed as one of the guardians to the new king, Edward VI. Catherine shortly afterward married Thomas Seymour, Lord Sudeley, Lord High Admiral of England, who was an uncle of King Edward. In September 1548, following the birth of a daughter, Mary Seymour, Catherine Parr died of puerperal fever. Later life On 10 October 1551, Anne's husband was raised to the peerage as Baron Herbert of Cardiff and on 11 October 1551 was created Earl of Pembroke. In 1553 he received the disgraced Duke of Somerset's Wiltshire estates, including Ramsbury and a newly built mansion at Bedwin Broil, as well as extensive woodland on the borders of the New Forest. The Herberts had been friends of Somerset until he fell from favour. Herbert was also granted, on the attainder of Sir Thomas Arundell, Wardour Castle and park, and he obtained some property which had belonged to the diocese of Winchester. The Wardour property subsequently reverted to the Arundell family by exchange and purchase, but Pembroke's increase of wealth exceeded that of any of his colleagues. Anne died on 20 February 1552. At the time of her death, she was one of the ladies of the Lady Mary, the future Queen Mary I. William married as his second wife, Anne Talbot, but the marriage produced no children. Through her sons, Anne has many descendants, including the present-day Earls of Pembroke, Montgomery, and Carnarvon. Anne was buried on 28 February 1552 in the Old St Paul's Cathedral in the City of London, next to her ancestor John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster. Her husband died on 17 March 1570 and by his wish was also buried in St Paul's. Anne's memorial there described her in Latin as \\"a most faithful wife, a woman of the greatest piety and discretion\\".  Issue  Anne Parr and William Herbert had three children: * Henry Herbert, 2nd Earl of Pembroke (c. 1539‚Äì1601). On 21 May 1553, married Catherine Grey. The marriage was annulled in 1554. His second wife was Catherine Talbot, daughter of George Talbot, 6th Earl of Shrewsbury. His third wife was Mary Sidney by whom he had children, including William and Philip, both of whom would accede to the Earldom of Pembroke. * Sir Edward Herbert (1547‚Äì1595), married Mary Stanley, by whom he had issue including William Herbert, 1st Baron Powis.George Edward Cokayne, The Complete Peerage of England, Scotland, Ireland, Great Britain, and the United Kingdom, Vol. X, p. 643. * Lady Anne Herbert (1550‚Äì1592), married Francis, Lord Talbot, son of George Talbot, 6th Earl of Shrewsbury. There is no known issue from this marriage.  Depictions in television and film  * Anne Parr (Lady Herbert) was depicted by Irish actress, Suzy Lawlor in the fourth and final season of The Tudors. In the programme she is a lady-in-waiting to Queen Catherine Howard (Tamzin Merchant) and chief maid-of-honor to her sister, Queen Catherine Parr (Joely Richardson).

The office emigrated along with New England pioneers to the Midwest as well, where the office still exists.Nebraska proposed statute History New England farmers clearing their land during the 17th century were confronted with boulders and stones left by retreating glaciers. They cleared their fields of the boulders with horses and built stone walls along the edges of their fields, frequently at the property boundary. Many of these walls still exist.Melrose, Massachusetts retrieved June 16, 2008 A Fence Viewer was needed on those occasions when walls were eroded, moved, or modified illegally. This was a serious offense. The term \\"fence viewer\\" has been traced back to 1661. Duties Upon request of any citizen, the Fence Viewer views fences to see that they are in good repair and in case of disputes between neighbors, works to resolve their differences. Problems such as size, condition, and distance from property lines are complaints that still arise between neighbors. =Connecticut= In Connecticut, fence viewer is a duty assigned as needed to a selectman or other official. The fence viewer can use their judgment to determine if a fence is sufficient and equivalent to the type of fence required by statute. Selectmen serving as fence viewers receive compensation of two dollars per day. Local governments may also appoint a person, or a committee of three people, to perform the function of fence viewer. If a property owner builds a fence around his property, and then subsequently an adjoining property owner encloses the adjacent property, the second party must purchase one half of the fence built by the first party on the common property line. If the two parties cannot reach an agreement, a fence viewer will determine the amount to be paid. Fence viewers also inspect divisional fences in need of repair and notify the negligent party to repair the fence, and estimate the cost to be paid to the adjoining property owner to make the repairs if the negligent owner fails to comply. =Delaware= The state of Delaware provides that fence viewers assess damages resulting from the trespass of a horse, cattle, goat, sheep or hog on a fenced property. If an animal is \\"unruly\\" and breaks a fence, damages are doubled. Fence viewers are appointed by the Superior Court annually, and there must be between five and eight per one hundred capita. Fence viewers act in groups of three so there will be a majority. They are paid eight dollars per day and compensated seven cents per mile for travel to the location of any dispute. Fence viewers judge if a fence is in disrepair and order that it be fixed; however, if the order goes unheeded, the matter is turned over to a Justice of the Peace. =Maine= In Maine, fence viewers use their judgement to determine if a fence is legal and sufficient. Fence viewers inspect and certify repairs to boundary fences done when one owner is negligent. They may also be involved in authorizing a boundary fence to be built on other than the true boundary if building on the boundary is impractical. Fence viewers determine the amount to be paid in situations when one party is purchasing the half of a boundary fence they don't already own. All actions involving fence viewers in Maine require decisions to be made by a minimum of two fence viewers. If fence viewers are involved with a fence that is on a boundary line between two different towns, one fence viewer must be from each town. Maine fence viewers are paid $3 a per day. Any fence viewer who, when requested, unreasonably neglects to view any fence or to perform any other duties required of the fence viewer forfeits $3 to any person suing therefor within 40 days after such neglect and is liable for all damages to the party injured. =Massachusetts= In Massachusetts, this position was first established in 1693 by a statute which was amended in 1785 and again in 1836. Statutes of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts Early Fence Viewers, armed with wall measurements, were able to arbitrate and/or prosecute such crimes by adjoining farmers. Trespassing by livestock was illegal. Boundaries and fences had to be maintained. If a farmer neglected his fence, his neighbor could do the repairs and charge his nonperforming neighbor twice the cost. If the negligent neighbor didn't come up with the money, he had to pay 12% interest until payment was made. Today, the Fence Viewer advises lot owners prior to constructing a fence. The height of the fence can be no higher than six feet except near intersections. Lot owners at intersections cannot erect a fence nor shrubbery closer than five feet to allow good visibility. A fence or shrub near there must be no higher than three feet. Spite fences erected to annoy neighbors are illegal. The Fence Viewer has the power to order such fences changed to be inoffensive. If hostilities escalate, the building inspector is asked to become involved. His word is final. The Commonwealth of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 49 describe in detail the obligations of lot owners. =New Hampshire= In New Hampshire, fence viewers resolve disputes about the purchase of a division of a boundary fence. They are called to view if a fence is in disrepair and can order it to be fixed. They determine the suitability of streams, ditches, etc. to be considered sufficient as fences, and designate where a fence be built when it is impractical to build it on the boundary line without unreasonable cost. Fence viewers are required to give notices in writing of any action, to hear any evidence, and make their decision in writing. New Hampshire law states that \\"the decision of the fence-viewers, upon their being sworn that they have acted impartially, uprightly and to the best of their judgment, shall be final and conclusive upon the parties.\\" If a fence is on a boundary line between two different towns, fence views from only one town are used. Fence viewers are paid two dollars per day. =New York= Fence viewers in New York resolve disputes about maintenance of division fences and the value of a division fence to be transferred. Disputes are resolved by any two of the fence viewers of a town, with one selected by each party to the dispute. If the two fence viewers do not agree, they select a third fence viewer which results in a majority decision which when filed in writing becomes final. Fence viewers may question and subpoena witnesses, and are paid one dollar and fifty cents per day. Fence viewers assess damages from neglected or unbuilt fences, including damages caused by animals not kept on the owner's property. They can specify the distance between posts of a barbed wire division fence. Fence viewers are compensated ten cents per mile for travel related to escape of animals. They are also charged with selling at auction strays that are not redeemed by the owner. =Pennsylvania= Pennsylvania repealed all state laws relating to fence viewers in 1992 but kept the terminology by stating that in disputes over division fences, the county surveyor, or a surveyor appointed by a judge of the court of common pleas, shall act as a fence viewer. The surveyor inspects the fence to determine sufficiency, or if the fence can be repaired and at what cost, or the estimated cost of a replacement. A surveyor acting as a fence viewer can charge up to twenty-five dollars. =Rhode Island= In Rhode Island, division fences cannot be made of barbed-wire unless both adjoining owners consent in writing. If a barbed-wire fence is erected without proper consent, the town fence viewer notifies that the fence be removed, and if it is not taken down, the fence viewer removes the fence and stores the material. Barbed-wire fences built prior to April 20, 1906 are exempt. Fence viewers also determine the cost to be paid for a division fence if the owners do not otherwise agree. As in other states, they resolve disputes concerning the maintenance of fences and can order the delinquent party to build, repair, or rebuild a fence. The fence viewer also files a lien for twice the cost to complete such an order if it is ignored. The fence viewer is entitled to six dollars per day and must pay five dollars per day for failing to perform their function. A complainant may file a complaint about a fence with any fence viewer they choose from the town in which the subject fence is located. Rhode Island also has a criminal law against the impersonation of a fence viewer, with a fine of $20 to $100. =Vermont= Fence viewers played a more active part in Vermont in the 18th and 19th centuries. Today they are rarely used. On occasion, the selectmen will call upon them to examine a fence line between adjoining properties to determine what portion of the fence must be made, repaired, or maintained by each party.24 V.S.A. ¬ß 3810 retrieved June 18, 2008 Fence Viewers may also be asked to determine where a fence must be placed when a fence cannot be placed squarely on a property line.Vermont Secretary of State information Three Fence Viewers are appointed by the selectmen each year. They must be qualified voters of the town and must be sworn into office.24 V.S.A. 831,871 Fence Viewers examine fences and other boundaries within the town when requested to do so by the selectmen.Title 24 VSA Chapter 109 Fence Viewing retrieved June 18, 2008 =Nebraska= For more than 100 years farmers across the state of Nebraska relied on fence viewers to play the role of mediators in disputes between landowners regarding the cost of fencing. When neighbors cannot agree on what type of fence to build, how to maintain the fence and/or how to pay for it, either neighbor can request a fence view. The local county clerk is then responsible for appointing a three-member fence viewer committee. Fence Viewers then determine what type of fence should be built and how construction and maintenance costs will be shared, as well as establish a portion of the fence for each neighbor to maintain.Aiken, D. (2006) \\"Bill Proposes Changes to Fence Viewer Statutes\\", Cornhusker Economics. University of Nebraska at Lincoln. Retrieved 6/17/08.

The regiment was raised shortly after the outbreak of the war. Initially it served in East Anglia on anti-invasion duties, before being dismounted in 1915 and sent to take part in the Gallipoli Campaign. After withdrawal to Egypt, it was amalgamated with the 1/1st Montgomeryshire Yeomanry as the 25th (Montgomery and Welsh Horse Yeomanry) Battalion, Royal Welsh Fusiliers and served as such throughout the rest of the war. It took part in the Sinai and Palestine Campaign in 1917 and 1918, before being transferred to the Western Front where it remained until the end of the war. The regiment formed 2nd and 3rd Lines in 1914, but these never left the United Kingdom before being disbanded in 1916 and early 1917, respectively. The 1st Line was disbanded in 1919. HistoryFormation and early history= The Welsh Horse Yeomanry was raised on 18 August 1914 in South Wales by the Glamorganshire T.F. Association, with HQ at Sophia Gardens in Cardiff (since demolished). Later in the year, it was transferred to Montgomeryshire County T.F. Association, with HQ now at Newtown. The regiment was trained and equipped as lancers. Despite being the last yeomanry regiment to be raised, it was accorded precedence after the Glamorganshire Yeomanry due to its connection to the Glamorganshire T.F. Association at the time of its formation. In accordance with the Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907 (7 Edw. 7, c.9) which brought the Territorial Force into being, the TF was intended to be a home defence force for service during wartime and members could not be compelled to serve outside the country. However, on the outbreak of war on 4 August 1914, many members volunteered for Imperial Service. Therefore, TF units were split in August and September 1914 into 1st Line (liable for overseas service) and 2nd Line (home service for those unable or unwilling to serve overseas) units. Later, a 3rd Line was formed to act as a reserve, providing trained replacements for the 1st and 2nd Line regiments. = 1/1st Welsh Horse Yeomanry= From early 1915, the 1st Line regiment was in 1/1st North Midland Mounted Brigade of 1st Mounted Division in the Diss area, replacing the Leicestershire Yeomanry which had been posted to 7th Cavalry Brigade with the British Expeditionary Force on the Western Front. About February 1915 it was transferred to 1/1st Eastern Mounted Brigade (this time replacing 2nd King Edward's Horse which had left for the Canadian Cavalry Brigade) in the Woodbridge area, still in 1st Mounted Division. In September 1915, the regiment was dismounted and left Suffolk for Liverpool. On 24 September it boarded RMS Olympic and sailed the next day. It arrived at Mudros on 1 October and on 10 October it landed at Anzac Cove in Gallipoli. Along with its brigade, it was attached to the 54th (East Anglian) Division; the regiment was attached to 163rd Brigade, carrying out mining operations at Hill 60. Between 15 and 20 December, the regiment was evacuated to Mudros. After the evacuation from Gallipoli, it moved to Egypt in December 1915 and on 22 February 1916 the Eastern and South Eastern Mounted Brigades were amalgamated into the 3rd Dismounted Brigade. It served as part of the Suez Canal Defences from 14 March to 26 July attached to 42nd (East Lancashire) Division; it then joined the Western Frontier Force. By the end of the year, it was back on the Suez. On 14 January 1917, Egyptian Expeditionary Force (EEF) Order No. 26 instructed that the 2nd, 3rd and 4th Dismounted Brigades be reorganized as the 229th, 230th and 231st Brigades. Consequently, on 4 March 1917, the regiment was amalgamated with the 1/1st Montgomeryshire Yeomanry as the 25th (Montgomery and Welsh Horse Yeomanry) Battalion, Royal Welsh Fusiliers at Helmieh, Cairo. It joined 231st Brigade in the 74th (Yeomanry) Division. With 74th Division, the battalion took part in the invasion of Palestine in 1917 and 1918. Shortly after joining the division it took part in the Second Battle of Gaza (17‚Äì19 April 1917). Then in the autumn it fought in the Third Battle of Gaza (27 October‚Äì7 November). Shortly afterwards it was involved in the Capture of Jerusalem (8‚Äì9 December) and its subsequent defence (27‚Äì30 December). In March 1918, the battalion participated in the Battle of Tel 'Asur, but shortly afterwards was warned that it was to move to France, where reinforcements were urgently required to stem the German Spring Offensive. In May 1918, the Division moved to France, and the battalion saw action on the Western Front. It took part in the Hundred Days Offensive including the Second Battle of the Somme (Second Battle of Bapaume) and the Battles of the Hindenburg Line (Battle of √âpehy). In October and November 1918, it took part in the 'Final Advance' on Artois and Flanders. By the Armistice it was north of Ath, Belgium, still in 231st Brigade, 74th (Yeomanry) Division. = 2/1st Welsh Horse Yeomanry= The 2nd Line regiment was formed in 1914 at Newtown. In July 1915 it was in the 2/1st South Wales Mounted Brigade as a fourth regiment in the Doncaster area. In September 1915 it moved with the brigade to the Yoxford area where it joined the 1st Mounted Division. In 1916 the regiment was absorbed into the 2/1st Montgomeryshire Yeomanry. Lord Kenyon was the Commanding Officer. = 3/1st Welsh Horse Yeomanry= The 3rd Line regiment was formed in 1915 and in the summer was affiliated to a Reserve Cavalry Regiment in Ireland. In the summer of 1916 it was dismounted and attached to the 3rd Line Groups of the Welsh Division at Oswestry as its 1st Line was serving as infantry. The regiment was disbanded in early 1917 with personnel transferring to the 2/1st Montgomeryshire Yeomanry or to the 4th (Reserve) Battalion of the Royal Welsh Fusiliers at Oswestry. =Post war= The Welsh Horse Yeomanry was disbanded in 1919. Victoria Cross The Victoria Cross is the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. One member of the regiment won the award while serving with the 25th (Montgomery and Welsh Horse Yeomanry) Battalion, Royal Welsh Fusiliers: * Corporal John Collins on 31 October 1917 at Wadi Saba, Beersheba, Palestine In addition, another member of 25th Royal Welsh Fusiliers also won the award: * Lance- sergeant William Herbert Waring on 18 September 1918 at Ronssoy, France Battle honours The Welsh Horse Yeomanry was awarded the following battle honours for service in World War I: :Somme 1918, Bapaume 1918, Hindenburg Line, √âp√©hy, Pursuit to Mons, France and Flanders 1918, Gallipoli 1915, Egypt 1915‚Äì17, Gaza, Jerusalem, Jericho, Tell 'Asur, Palestine 1917‚Äì18 See also * Yeomanry * Yeomanry order of precedence * British yeomanry during the First World War * Second line yeomanry regiments of the British Army ReferencesBibliography    External links  * Category:Yeomanry regiments of the British Army Category:Yeomanry regiments of the British Army in World War I Category:Military units and formations established in 1914 Category:Military units and formations disestablished in 1919 Category:Military units and formations in Wales Category:Military units and formations in Glamorgan ","title":"Welsh Horse Yeomanry"},{"id":"17988553","text":"Thomas Parr may refer to: *Old Tom Parr (1483 (reputedly)‚Äì1635), English supercentenarian who claimed to have lived for 152 years *Thomas Parr (d.1461) (1407‚Äì1461); English landowner, MP and under-sheriff of Westmorland.

History It was established in 1979 by Canadian brothers who grew up in the country, Robert and Clark Lungren. After years of observing the devastating impact of cyclical drought on domesticated livestock as well as the effects of poor resource management (deforestation, overgrazing, burning, soil fatigue, etc.) Clark believed that the key to saving the African people from famine and its wildlife from extinction was found in resource development. He set out to prove that when human prosperity can be generated through sustainable management of its natural resources, both people and environment win. After several years of research and raising funds, Clark focused on a relatively unsettled region of Upper Volta (now Burkina Faso). Nazinga offered a topologically-varied environment, but endemic poaching was rapidly decimating the wildlife. He and Rob set up a conservation project with their families: using local labor they constructed dams, developed some 600 km of roads, built test paddocks and an administrative base, negotiated local subsistence farmers to abandon fields within the ranch boundaries, and banned all livestock from its land. They hired local poachers as game keepers in order to give them an incentive to protect it, established a fishing management program, and invited biologists from several countries to help them carry out wildlife and ecological studies. They also reintroduced native wildlife species which had been eradicated from the region. The results exceeded all expectations. The studies found that wildlife has a far higher tolerance to drought, thrived on varieties of grasses and leaves that cattle derived little nutrition from, and did not cause erosion by overgrazing. They also produced far more meat per kilogram of animal than livestock. Studies found that culling adult animals by a certain percentage per species actually increased their reproduction rates and replenished the population, while not culling only maintained the reproduction rate at a constant level. As a result, they developed a stringent program of culling wildlife by night and processing the meat under controlled circumstances. This employed a growing number of local people, hugely increased the local protein intake (from the poorest in the country to the highest), and provided a quality and highly marketable meat which was sold in supermarkets in the capital city. Poachers were no longer able to compete with the quantity and quality of legally marketed wild meat. And the Nazinga Game Ranch became a significant source of tax revenue to the national government. Their success became part of the projects' downfall. The interest of international development funders wanting to get behind the project and the healthy cash flow were too much to resist. In 1989, a year before the project was to be officially turned over to national management, corrupt officials spread the rumour that the Lungrens were revolutionaries... a coup had recently taken place and the political climate was strained. The Lungrens were forcibly moved to the capital where they spent the next years completing the project studies in hopes that the ranch would nevertheless succeed. Under national management, the Nazinga Game Ranch reverted to a national wildlife park catering to foreign tourists. Poaching and poor management are once more huge problems, and the project no longer stands as a revolutionary and successful innovation in tying grass-root ownership to effective environmental management.Lungren, Bruce (2010) Wildlife The area under protection grew considerably and today is 94,000 hectares containing more than 20,000 animals, including 800 elephants which roam the park. Nazinga Ranch has 39 species of mammal, including thousands of antelope such as roan antelope, waterbuck, oribi, reedbuck and 8 Buffon's kob (introduced in 1988), more than 500 buffalo, hyenas, 5,000 warthog, crocodile and many primates including red monkey and baboons.

She was the wife of Infante Peter, Duke of Coimbra. Family Isabella was born on 12 March 1409, the eldest daughter of James II, Count of Urgell, and Isabella of Aragon. Isabella was one of five children. The county of Urgell was dissolved in 1413, following her father's revolt against the new King Ferdinand I of Aragon who had been chosen to succeed to the throne of Aragon in 1412 despite James being the closest legitimate agnate to the Royal House of Aragon. Marriage On 13 September 1428 at Alcolea del Cinca she married Infante Peter, Duke of Coimbra (9 December 1392 - 20 May 1449 at the Battle of Alfarrobeira), a younger son of John I of Portugal. During her husband's regency for his nephew, Afonso V of Portugal, the marriage of the couple's daughter Isabella to the King was arranged. =Issue= * Peter, Constable of Portugal (23 October 1429 Coimbra, Portugal- 29 June 1466) At the age of fourteen he became Constable of Portugal. In 1464, he was acclaimed King Peter V of Aragon. * John of Coimbra, titular Prince of Antioch (1431 Coimbra, Portugal- 11 September 1457 Nicosia, Cyprus).

Married 13 May 1453 Adolph of Cleves, Lord of Ravenstein (28 June 1425 - 18 September 1492). Her death was attributed to poisoning. * Philippa of Coimbra (1 June 1437 Coimbra, Portugal- 25 July 1493 Odivelas). She was a nun at the Convent of Odivelas. Widowhood and death Isabella of Coimbra, eldest daughter of Isabella of Urgell, whose efforts were critical for the rehabilitation of the family. Peter of Coimbra was regent of Portugal from 1439, and engineered the marriage of his young charge, Afonso V of Portugal with his daughter, Isabella of Coimbra in 1447. But he also gathered powerful enemies, most notably the House of Braganza, who ingratiated themselves with the young king and managed to drive Peter from power immediately after. The parties remained at odds and Portugal careened into civil war. After Peter of Coimbra was killed at the Battle of Alfarrobeira in May 1449, his family was immediately and relentlessly persecuted. Isabella of Urgell and her daughter Philippa went into hiding, while her other children were driven into exile abroad - Peter the Constable to Castile, and John, James and Beatrice to the Duchy of Burgundy, the lands of their aunt Isabella of Burgundy. The threats of the powerful Duke of Burgundy were conjoined to the pleas of Peter's daughter, the young queen Isabella of Coimbra, who pleaded her husband to have mercy on her family. Against the advice of the powerful Braganzas, Afonso V relented (partially) in 1450 and allowed the widowed duchess Isabella of Urgell to reside in Montemor-o-Velho and Tent√∫gal (Philippa was allowed to reside in a cloister in Odivelas, although apparently she later moved in with her mother).J. de Figueiredo (1910) O Pintor Nuno Gon√ßalves. Lisbon: Tip. Annuario Commercial, pp.50-53 However, she continued to be harassed by the Braganzas - Afonso, Marquis of Valen√ßa reportedly tried to deprive the widowed duchess of her residence, which only the queen's renewed pleading prodded Afonso V to intercede on her behalf. Isabella of Coimbra availed of the king's good mood after the birth of their son, the royal heir John (future king John II of Portugal), in May 1455, to engineer a complete and final rehabilitation of the rest of her family. Peter of Coimbra's remains were allowed to be re-buried at the Aviz dynasty necropolis at Batalha Monastery and the dowager-duchess Isabella of Urgell was granted a royal pension for the remainder of her years. Isabella of Urgell died on 17 September 1459, at the monastery of Santa Cruz in Coimbra. Her remains were translated to Batalha, into the tomb of her rehabilitated husband.There seems to be some confusion as to whether they were actually translated to Batalha, as there is also a tomb to her at Santa Cruz as well.

He established the McGregor Fund of Michigan in 1925 with a gift of $5,000,McGregor Fund one of Michigan's first charitable foundations.Philip P. Mason, Tracy W. McGregor (Detroit: Wayne State University Press, 2008), 1. He successfully ran the Mission for Homeless Men (later the McGregor Institute) in Detroit from 1891 until it closed its doors in 1935, first as supervisor and then as a managing trustee. In 1917, he helped organize the Detroit Community Union and Patriotic Fund, forerunners of today's United Community Services.United Community Services Finding Aid at the Walter P. Reuther Library, Wayne State University, Detroit Tracy and his business associates began the Provident Loan and Savings Society, which provided loans at low interest rates. He also helped create the Thursday Noon Group, which met to discuss important community issues like justice in the courts and prisons. McGregory became a trustee and financial supporter of the Merrill-Palmer Institute in Detroit and several universities. Personal life Tracy William McGregor was the oldest son of Thomas McGregor (1840-1891) and Elizabeth Taitt (1847-?). His parents had migrated from Oxbow, New York, to Berlin Heights, Ohio, in 1866. Thomas was in the music business, selling pianos, but felt something was missing from his life. In 1887, he abruptly quit the piano business to \\"serve the Lord.\\" Though his family was shocked as they had no other source of income, Thomas assured them that the Lord would take care of them. In November 1888, he founded the Bethany Mission in downtown Toledo, Ohio. The mission was a success. By 1889, the mission was moved to a new building and opened as the Toledo Helping Hand Mission. Thomas was so pleased with the success of the Mission that he decided to open a series of missions in other Great Lakes areas. The Mission for Homeless Men opened in Detroit, Michigan, on April 3, 1891. Thomas had contracted a severe respiratory illness from the hard labor under harsh weather conditions during the renovation of the Mission's building, and he missed the opening day ceremonies. He never recovered from that illness and died on April 24, 1891. Tracy McGregor had been a student at Oberlin College in Oberlin, Ohio, for about two years when he got word of his father's death. He immediately quit school, packed his bags, and headed for Detroit to continue his father's work. Tracy never finished his education. At 22, Tracy abruptly found himself as head of his family; in addition to his mother, his brother Murray (1879) and sister Ruth (1881) were still at home. Elizabeth stayed in Toledo running the Helping Hand Mission, while Tracy concentrated his efforts in Detroit. McGregor married Katherine Whitney (January 18, 1873 ‚Äì June 9, 1954), daughter of David Whitney and Flora Ann McLauchlin, on November 20, 1901, in San Francisco, California.Mason, Tracy W. McGregor, 30. The couple had no children. David Whitney, a lumber businessman, was one of the wealthiest men in Michigan and contributed frequently to the Mission for Homeless Men. Tracy and Katherine may have met during one of Tracy's visits to the Whitney mansion on Woodward Avenue in Detroit or when Katherine volunteered at the Children's Free Hospital.The Whitney Tracy McGregor died suddenly from a heart attack on May 6, 1936, in Washington, DC. His widow, Katherine, died June 9, 1954, in Beacon, New York. The couple is buried in Woodlawn Cemetery in Detroit. Mission for Homeless Men McGregor had worked on and off with his father at the Mission for Homeless Men, so he understood the vision. Even though the Mission was open when he took over, it still required a great deal of renovation and funding. For the next ten years, McGregor worked tirelessly to raise money, improve the building, purchase and build a new building, and improve the reputation of the Mission. One of the hallmarks of the Mission was the religious service he conducted each night. In February 1901, the Mission's governing board hired his brother Murray to tend to financial matters, allowing McGregor to step back a bit to concentrate on other pursuits. After his marriage to Katherine, the Mission was on more solid ground with the availability of the Whitney money and a new endowment. In 1911, the board of trustees changed the name of the Mission to the McGregor Institute. In 1916, Tracy stepped down as superintendent of the Mission after Murray agreed to take his place at the helm. He remained as a managing trustee of the Institute. Throughout the years, the mission provided housing and food for more than 500,000 men. During the 1930s, the U.S. government began programs for the poor; as a consequence, the Institute closed its doors in 1935 and the building was donated to Goodwill Industries. Philanthropy Tracy and Katherine McGregor were very generous with their wealth. The couple shared a common concern for those less fortunate than themselves. They were major sponsors of the Associated Charities of Detroit, and, in 1909, they were \\"donors of major gifts to the Detroit YMCA, Detroit Rescue Mission, Michigan Audubon Society, Grace Reform Mission, Michigan Child Labor Association, Boy Scouts of America, Salvation Army, Society of St. Vincent dePaul, Crittenden House, Thompson Home for Homeless Ladies, Visiting Nurses Association, Protestant Orphan Asylum, and the Women's Board of Home Missions.\\"Mason, Tracy W. McGregor, 98. Much of the McGregors' interest in these organizations was fueled by the plight of the large immigrant population that arrived in Detroit in the early twentieth century. The city was ill-equipped for the influx in terms of housing, city services, and health care. The McGregors established the benevolent McGregor Fund in 1925 to \\"relieve the misfortunes and promote the well being of mankind.\\"Mason, Tracy W. McGregor, 159. Tracy was elected president and treasurer of the fund. The McGregors gave major gifts to the fund between 1929 and 1934, totaling about $6 million. Generous grants were (and still are) given to charitable organizations that fit within the interests of the McGregors, including homeless support agencies, education, and mental hygiene programs. McGregor was on the Committee of Management for the William L. Clements Library at the University of Michigan and worked closely with its curator of manuscripts Howard Henry Peckham. The year before Clements' death. McGregor donated $100,000 to the library and saved a rare collection of historical manuscripts from the Revolutionary War period from being sold and ultimately dispersed to the general private sector. Civic Leader In addition to running the Mission for Homeless Men for 25 years, McGregor served on boards of trustees and chaired other organizations. In 1900, Michigan Governor Aaron T. Bliss appointed McGregor to the State Board of Corrections and Charities as the Wayne County agent. This experience introduced him to the problem many Detroiters faced when trying to buy a home or automobile‚Äîloans with reasonable interest rates were unavailable. In 1906, Tracy formed the Provident Loan and Savings Society, along with friends J. L. Hudson, James Ingles, and Dexter M. Ferry, Jr. Hudson was the first president and McGregor served as one of the directors for the rest of his life. The Provident Loan and Savings Society was able to provide loans at a 3 to 5 percent interest rate, which caused other lenders to lower their rates. In 1911, the Detroit Board of Commerce appointed Tracy to a state committee to investigate the Michigan State Prison in Jackson. The investigation highlighted the inhumane \\"Cell Block,\\" which led to the prison's reform. In 1912, he invited a number of business and professional leaders to get together to discuss problems in Detroit. This group became the \\"Thursday Noon Group,\\" which devoted special attention to the \\"social needs of the rising population, especially in the areas of city planning, sanitary housing, playgrounds for children, industrial education, child labor, and workmen's compensation laws.\\"Mason, Tracy W. McGregor, 123. McGregor chaired the meetings when he was in town. In 1914, the Thursday Noon Group was responsible for encouraging Michigan legislators to create the Michigan Farm Colony for Epileptics at Caro, Michigan (now the Caro Center, a state-operated psychiatric hospitalMDCH-State-Operated Psychiatric Hospitals). In 1913, McGregor was chosen to reorganize the Associated Charities of Detroit; in December 1917, the Detroit Community Union was formed and he was elected as chair of the new organization. He was also part of a financial federation that formed the Detroit Patriotic Fund to coordinate the fundraising campaigns for the war effort during World War I. In 1913, after her husband Thomas W. Palmer's death, Lizzie Pitts Merrill Palmer set aside $3 million to establish the Merrill-Palmer Motherhood and Home Training School. The school was founded after her death in 1916. McGregor was named to the board of trustees for the Palmer Estate in 1918, and was elected president in 1919.Mason, Tracy W. McGregor, 146. He served as president of the renamed Merrill-Palmer Institute until his death in 1936. McGregor led a campaign to provide better training and care for \\"higher-grade feeble-minded children.\\"Mason, Tracy W. McGregor, 110. His efforts were rewarded when voters approved a bond to create the Wayne County Training School in Northville, Michigan.Wayne County Training School The school opened in 1925 and McGregor was appointed its first president. He served on the administrative board of control for 11 years. The school was closed in 1974. The McGregor Plan McGregor was an avid book collector and a great supporter of higher education. When he died in 1936, his personal collection of about 12,500 volumes was donated to the University of Virginia, after an exhaustive search for the appropriate repository. The McGregor Fund also donated $25,000 to the university to create the Tracy W. McGregor Library of American History to house his collection.\\"Rare Collection Goes to Virginia,\\" New York Times, June 14, 1938, p. 19. In 1932, McGregor developed the \\"McGregor Plan for the Encouragement of Book Collecting by American College Libraries,\\" which was designed to help smaller colleges and universities outside of New England or away from major universities purchase rare Americana books for their libraries. The Committee on Americana for College Libraries was created by the American Historical Association (AHA) in 1933 to administer the McGregor Plan. In 1934, McGregor was appointed to the committee and was also elected to the board of trustees of the AHA. The McGregor Fund financed the McGregor Plan. Until his death in 1936, Tracy bought all of the books that were made available to the libraries as part of the Plan. Participating colleges contributed $500 annually and the McGregor Fund matched with an additional $500, so each institution was able to receive $1,000 worth of rare books each year. Considering that the McGregor Plan was in effect from 1934 to 1943, most of which coincided with the Great Depression years, many rare and valuable Americana books were able to be purchased at affordable prices. The McGregor Plan was suspended in 1943 because of World War II and was never reinstated.

Most of the periodical publications in mainly Catholic countries can be regarded as \\"Catholic\\" literature up to a few decades before 1800: the editorial line is implicitly Catholic in most instances. The development of the press in the 19th century was in general terms a major factor in secularization according to Owen Chadwick. On the other hand, mass printing also meant that the \\"Pope of 1889 was far more influential that the Pope of 1839 because the later Pope was surrounded by the press and the earlier Pope was not\\" wrote Chadwick. Background The Catholic Encyclopedia of 1913 offered an analysis in terms of several factors. Periodical literature includes the political newspaper, the weekly, and literary and specialized magazines and journals appearing less frequently: in some countries such as Spain the implicit Catholicism persisted in the press for many years. The American-style, news-led paper would sell on its news content, rather than editorial line, and therefore Catholic newspapers could compete as dailies. European papers and weeklies relied more on the feuilleton and generally had more op-ed content. This meant they showed \\"greater animosity to the Church\\". Case studies19th-century England= The pioneer Catholic publication in England, Andrews' Orthodox Journal, was first issued in 1812 by Eusebius Andrews, a Catholic printer and bookseller of London. It had just a few years of chequered existence, as there was not a sufficiently large reading public to make it self-supporting. The real beginnings of Catholic periodical literature were made more than twenty years later, by which time the growth of the Catholic body in its new emancipation, the progress of Catholic education, and the interest excited by the Tractarian movement had combined to supply a wider circle of readers. Nicholas Wiseman and Daniel O'Connell founded a quarterly, the Dublin Review (1836). The fame of the Edinburgh Review suggested a territorial title, and Dublin was chosen as a Catholic centre; but from the first it was edited and published in London. The review was intended to provide a record of current thought for educated Catholics and at the same time to be an exponent of Catholic views to non-Catholic inquirers. Beginning before the first stirrings of the Oxford Movement, it presents a record of the intellectual life of the century and produced articles which had an immense influence upon the religious thought of the times. It was in August 1839 that an article by Wiseman on the Anglican Claim caught the attention of John Henry Newman. Impressed by the application of the words of St. Augustine, securus judicat orbis terrarum, which interpreted and summed up the course of ecclesiastical history, he saw the theory of the Via media \\"absolutely pulverized\\" (Apologia, 116-7). I Gradually the Tractarian converts appeared in the lists of contributors: Ward, Frederick Oakeley, Marshall, John Brande Morris, Christie, Henry Formby, Capes, Thomas William Allies, Anderson, Manning, and a glance through the volumes of the \\"Dublin' will reveal names prominent in the great religious, scientific, and literary movements of the century. During the sixties and the early seventies it was under the direction of Dr. W. G. Ward. After his retirement it was edited by John Cuthbert Hedley, afterwards Bishop of Newport, and then acquired by Cardinal Manning, who appointed Canon Moyes editor. It was the property and under the direction of Wilfrid Ward, son of its previous editor. The first issue of the annual Catholic Directory appeared in 1837. Owing to the Oxford Movement, the forties were a time of marked literary activity. In 1840 two new enterprises were inaugurated. Mr. Dolman, a Catholic publisher in London who had issued a number of important books including the writings of John Lingard and Husenbeth, produced in \\"Dolman's Magazine\\" a high class literary monthly, and on 16 May 1840, Frederick Lucas became the pioneer of the Catholic newspaper press in England by publishing the first number of The Tablet, a weekly newspaper and review. Lucas regarded his work as founder and editor of a Catholic paper as a sacred mission. His uncompromising views led to difficulties with his financial supporters, but he emerged triumphant. For a while after the crisis of 1848 Lucas, then active in Irish politics, removed The Tablet office to Dublin, but it was brought back to London by the new proprietors, into whose hands it passed when failing health compelled Lucas to give up the editorship. For many years after his death, in 1855, \\"The Tablet\\" was a mere humdrum record of news. Among the distinguished editors was Cardinal Vaughan who conducted the \\"Tablet\\" during the stormy discussions on papal infallibility and the First Vatican Council. When he became Bishop of Salford, he placed the editorship in the hands of Elliot Ranken, who was succeeded by John George Snead-Cox. \\"The Tablet\\", under the terms of the trust created by Cardinal Vaughan, had its profits go to the support of St. Joseph's Missionary College, of which he was the founder. Two other notable periodicals were founded in the forties. \\"The Tablet\\" was a sixpenny paper, reduced to five pence, on the abolition of the newspaper stamp duty. Its price put it beyond the reach of tens of thousands of Catholic workers. To supply them with a penny magazine Mr. Bradley in 1846 founded The Lamp. It gave much of its space to Catholic fiction, descriptive articles, and the like, and ventured on an occasional illustration, a portrait or a picture of a new church; but it also supplied news and reported in full Wiseman's lectures and other notable Catholic utterances. For years it struggled with lack of capital, and for a while Bradley edited his paper from his room in the debtors' prison at York. His name deserves honourable record as the pioneer of the popular Catholic Press. The other paper, The Rambler, of which the first issue appeared on 1 January 1848, was intended to be a review of literature, art, and science. In 1859, Lord Acton, who had then just returned from the Continent, succeeded Newman in the editorship. The price, sixpence, limited its public and in 1862 it became a quarterly under the title of \\"The Home and Foreign Review\\". In its last years this review was a source of trouble and disedification, and its sale, which dwindled yearly, was largely among Anglicans and other non- Catholics. In the mid years of the nineteenth century the abolition of the various taxes on newspapers and the cheapening of the processes of production led to the coming of the penny newspapers. The first Catholic penny paper with permanent success was The London Universe. Its origin was connected with the earlier activity of Lucas, who successfully advocated the introduction of the Conferences of St. Vincent de Paul into England. It was a group of members of the London Conferences who produced \\"The Universe\\". Speaking to their president George Blount, one evening in 1860 Cardinal Wiseman after alluding to the attacks in the Press against the Holy See said: \\"Cannot the Society of St. Vincent de Paul do something to answer those frightful calumnies, by publishing truths, as M. Louis Veuillot is doing in Paris in 'L'Univers'? We want a penny paper, and now that the tax has been removed it should be possible.\\" It was decided that, though the society, as such, could not found a newspaper, a committee of its members should undertake the task. It included George Blount, Stuart Knill (afterwards the first Catholic Lord Mayor of London), Viscount Fielding (Lord Denbigh), Viscount Campden (the convert Sir Charles George Noel, 2nd Earl of Gainsborough), Sidney Lescher, Archibald Dunn, Arthur William √† Beckett, and George J. Wigley, the London correspondent of the Paris Univers. Wigley secured a foreign news service for the projected paper from Louis Veuillot's Paris office, and at his suggestion the name of The Universe was chosen. Denis Lane undertook the printing, Mr. Dunn the editorship, and on 8 December 1860, the first Catholic penny paper in England was started. At first it was strictly non-political. The editor and staff gave their services gratuitously, but even with this help expenses were greater than receipts. To attract a larger circulation political articles were inserted, which led to the resignation of the greater part of the staff. Mr. Lane then took over the paper and conducted it for many years as a Catholic paper, giving a general support to the Liberals and the Irish national cause. He had always a priest as \\"theological editor\\"; amongst those who thus assisted him were Father W. Eyre, S.J., Father Lockhart, and Cardinal Manning. The movement for the rescue of destitute Catholic children originated in \\"The Universe\\" office. It amalgamated with another paper, The Catholic Weekly, founded to give a record of Catholic news without any party politics, thus reverting to its original programme. \\"The Lamp\\" was reorganized about the same time and had for some years a prosperous existence as a popular magazine. Fathers Rawes and Caswall, Lady Georgiana Fullerton, Augusta Theodosia Drane, Cecilia Caddell were among its contributors. In 1864 Miss Taylor founded The Month, at first an illustrated magazine giving much of its space to fiction and the lighter forms of literature. When she founded her first community of nuns (Poor Servants of the Mother of God), her magazine passed to the Jesuits, under the editorship of the Father Henry J. Coleridge. It had many notable contributors, and in its pages Newman's Dream of Gerontius first appeared. Numerically, the main strength of English Catholicism has always been in the North, and after the foundation of \\"The Universe\\" several efforts were made to produce a Catholic penny paper in Lancashire. Three successive enterprises had a brief career. A fourth, a paper known as \\"The Northern Press\\" was barely existing, when, in 1867, it was taken over by Father James Nugent of Liverpool. He renamed it \\"The Catholic Times\\" and gradually made it the most widely circulated Catholic paper in England. Printed for many years by the boys of the refuge he had founded in Liverpool, when it became a profit- earning paper it helped support this work of charity. Offices were opened in Manchester and London. A special London edition was produced, and in 1878 a Christmas supplement issued under the title of \\"The Catholic Fireside\\" was so successful that it was continued as a monthly penny magazine; in 1893 it was made a weekly publication. \\"The Catholic Times\\" appealed largely to the Catholics of Irish descent in Great Britain, and championed the Irish Nationalist cause. P. L. Beazley directed it for many years. In the sixties other papers were founded, for a while fairly prosperous, though they never won the established position of \\"The Catholic Times\\" and \\"The Tablet\\". \\"The Weekly Register\\" was a threepenny paper, of much the same character as \\"The Tablet\\", but favouring the Liberals and Nationalists. Later, under the editorship of Charles Kent and then of Wilfrid Meynell, it had a marked literary quality. \\"The Weekly Register\\" ceased to exist and with it \\"The Westminster Gazette\\", whose name is now that of a London evening paper. The \\"Westminster\\" was owned and edited by Pursell, afterwards biographer of Manning. During the months of newspaper controversy that preceded the definition of papal infallibility the \\"Westminster\\" was \\"non-opportunist\\", and Cardinal Vaughan, while he avoided all controversy on the subject in \\"The Tablet\\", contributed, week after week, letters to the \\"Westminster\\", combating its editorial views. It never had much circulation, and Vaughan was able a few years later to end its competition by buying and stopping it. Father Lockhart edited for some years \\"Catholic Opinion\\", a penny paper giving extracts from the Catholic press at home and abroad. After his death it was amalgamated with \\"The Catholic Times\\". Charles Diamond, for some time a member of the Irish Parliamentary party, started in 1884 \\"The Irish Tribune\\" in Newcastle upon Tyne. Shortly after, he purchased two other Catholic papers, the Glasgow \\"Observer\\" and the Preston \\"Catholic News\\", which were in difficulties for want of capital. He then formed the idea of working several papers from a common centre, much of the matter being common to all, but each appearing under a local title and having several columns of special matter of local interest. He issued the Catholic Herald from London, as the centre of the organization, and thirty-two other local weekly papers in various towns of England, Wales, and Scotland. He also produced on the same system ten different parish magazines and \\"The Catholic Home Journal\\", with which the old \\"Lamp\\" was amalgamated. There were a considerable number of minor Catholic monthlies, mostly founded in recent years to advocate and promote special objects. The \\"Annals of the Propagation of the Faith\\" and \\"illustrated Catholic Missions\\" specialize on the news of the mission field. \\"Catholic Book Notes\\", a monthly issued by the Catholic Truth Society and edited by James Britten, was a record of current literature and reviews. \\"The Second Spring\\", edited by Father Philip Fletcher, was a record of the work of the Ransom League for the conversion of England. \\"The Crucible\\" was a monthly review of social work for Catholic women. Devotional magazines were issued by various religious orders, the most widely circulated of which was the \\"Messenger of the Sacred Heart\\", edited by the Jesuits. There were also several college magazines. In general circulations were quite low. =Poland under foreign partitions= The Polish Catholic press reflected the political conditions of the empires that had annexed the territory of Poland. In Galicia, part of Austria-Hungary, it was considerably freer; in Imperial Russia and in the German Empire there was severe censorship of all Polish language periodicals. Greater development took place from 1831 to 1864 in the period of national insurrections against the occupying powers. One of the oldest Polish publications in the Austrian Partition was the Czas (Time) daily, the organ of the Conservative party. Its publication began in 1848. In 1866 there appeared the PrzeglƒÖd polski (Polish Review), which had from its beginning the collaboration of Count Stanis≈Çaw Tarnowski and Stanis≈Çaw Egbert Ko≈∫mian. The Czas and the PrzeglƒÖd polski always maintained a strictly Catholic character. In 1867 Juliusz Starkla and Tadeusz Romanowicz established at Lemberg (Lw√≥w) the Dziennik Literacki (Literary Journal), which had a short life; Jan Dobrza≈Ñski founded the \\"Gazeta Narodowa\\" (National Gazette), to which was united in 1869 the Dziennik Polski (Polish Journal). In 1871 Rev. Edward Podolski established the PrzeglƒÖd lwowski (Lemberg Review), which strenuously defended Catholic interests. In the same city there appeared the Gazeta Lwowska (Lemberg Gazette), the organ of the imperial viceroy in Galicia. In 1884 the Polish Jesuits began at Krak√≥w (Cracow) the publication of the PrzeglƒÖd powszechny (Universal Review), covering scientific and literary points of view. In the same city from 1881 to 1886 there was published the PrzeglƒÖd literacki i artystyczny (Literary and Artistic Review). In 1894 in the whole of Austria-Hungary there were 126 Polish periodicals and daily papers, of which 65 appeared at Lemberg (Lw√≥w, in Polish) and 29 at Krak√≥w. At Lemberg the daily papers were the Dziennik polski, the Gazeta lwowska, the Gazeta narodowa, the Kurjer Lwowski, and the PrzeglƒÖd. There were two Catholic weeklies, the Gazeta katolicka and the Tygodnik katolicki. The Gazeta ko≈õcielna (Ecclesiastical Gazette), representative of the Catholic press, was a small semi-weekly, poor in doctrine and immersed in politics. From the scientific standpoint the most important periodical was the Kwaltarnik hystoryczny (Tri-monthly historical periodical), which began publication in 1886. Also important were the Pamiƒôtniki literackie (Literary Memoirs), the Ateneum polskie, the Kosmos (the organ of the society of naturalists of Lemberg), and the Nasz kraj. At Krak√≥w, besides the Czas, there were the Nowa Reforma and the G≈Ços narodu (Voice of the People), an organ of the clergy and of the militant Catholic party. The Socialists published there the Naprz√≥d (Forward), the official organ of their party, and the monthly periodical Krytyka. In following years there has been established the ≈öwiat S≈Çowia≈Ñski (Slavic World), the organ of the Slav club of Krak√≥w, containing valuable information relating to the various Slavic countries. The Academy of Sciences of Krak√≥w published a Bulletin international, monthly; and the Rozprawy (Dissertations) of mathematics, physics, and biology. Daily papers and periodicals were published also in the other Galician cities of Tarn√≥w, Rzesz√≥w, Sambor, Stanis≈Çaw√≥w, Jaros≈Çaw, and Przemy≈õl. One of the oldest Polish daily papers in Prussia was the Dziennik pozna≈Ñski (Posen Journal), established in 1859. From 1845 to 1865 there appeared the PrzeglƒÖd pozna≈Ñski, an ardent defender of Catholicism, edited by Rev. Jan Ko≈∫mian; in 1860 Rev. Jan Prusinowski published the Tygodnik katolicki (illustrated weekly). In 1865 Ludwik Rzepecki began the publication of the scientific periodical O≈õwiata (Culture), which, however, had only a short life, and was followed by the PrzeglƒÖd Wielkopolski (Review of Greater Poland), edited by Emil Kierski. In 1870 Edmond Callier founded the Tygodnik Wielkopolski, to which leading Polish writers contributed. The Kurjer Pozna≈Ñski, established by Teodor ≈ªychli≈Ñski in 1872, also acquired great importance. In 1894 there were published in Prussia and in the Grand Duchy of Posen the following daily papers: the Dziennik pozna≈Ñski, the Goniec wielkopolski, the Kurjer pozna≈Ñski, the nationalist Orƒôdownik (Advocate), and the Wielkopolanin. The PrzeglƒÖd pozna≈Ñski resumed its publications under the direction of W≈Çadys≈Çaw Rabski, while other daily papers were published at Danzig (Gda≈Ñsk), Thorn (Toru≈Ñ), Pelplin, and Allenstein (Olsztyn). In 1841 the publication of the Biblioteka Warszawska, a monthly periodical dedicated especially to literature, began in Russian Poland. There were published in Warsaw the Dzie≈Ñ (Day); the Dziennik powszechny (Universal Journal); the G≈Ços Warszawski (Voice of Warsaw); G≈Ços poranny (Voice of Morning); the Kurjer polski; Kurjer Warszawski; Nowa Gazeta; PrzeglƒÖd poranny; Wiadomo≈õci Codzienne (Daily News); S≈Çowo (Word), a nationalist paper that had great influence; and the Warszawska Gazeta. Other dailies were published at Lublin, Kiev (Dziennik kijowski), at Vilna (Kurjer litewski and Goniec Wilenski) at ≈Å√≥d≈∫ and at St. Petersburg. Among the periodicals, besides the Biblioteka Warszawska, were the Biesiada literacka (Literary Banquet), splendidly illustrated; the Kultura, hostile to religiocity; the PrzeglƒÖd filozoficzny (Philosophical Review), a quarterly publication; the PrzeglƒÖd historyczny (Historical Review), scientific, twice monthly; the ≈öwiat (World), an illustrated weekly; and the Tygodnik illustrowany. The Catholic press was represented by the PrzeglƒÖd katolicki, of Warsaw, a publication dedicated to politics. This paper was the one most read by the clergy. Count Roger ≈Åubie≈Ñski (hrabia) established the Wiara (Faith), a weekly devoted to ecclesiastical news; and these two publications were later united into one. A scientifically important periodical, the Kwartalnik teologiczny, lasted only a few years. By the early twentieth century, of the daily papers or periodicals for the clergy, or having a strictly Catholic programme, those most read were: the Polak katolik; the My≈õl katolicka, of Czƒôstochowa; and the Atheneum kap≈Ça≈Ñskie, of the seminary of W≈Çoc≈Çawek, a monthly scientific publication. In 1864 Polish exiles established the Ojczyna (Native Land) at Leipzig, the Przysz≈Ço≈õƒá (The Future) at Paris, and the \\"Przeglad powszechny\\" at Dresden. At Chicago, U.S.A., the chief centre of Polish emigration, were published the Dziennik chicagoski, the Dzien swiety (Holy Day), the Gazeta katolicka, the Gazeta polska, the Nowe Zycie (New Life), the Sztandar, Tygodnik naukowo-powiesciowy, Wiara i ojczyna, Zgoda, and Ziarno, a musical publication. Other papers were published at Milwaukee, Buffalo, N.Y., New York City, Detroit, Philadelphia, Winona, Cleveland, Ohio, Toledo, Baltimore, Pittsburgh, Stevens Point, Manitowoc, Mahanoy City, and Wilkes-Barre. Brazil also had a Polish publication. Notes :a. Orƒôdownik continued to be published well into the 1930s in sovereign Poland, embracing religious intolerance and social conservatism. It was printed in Pozna≈Ñ by Wydawnictwo Drukarnia Polska with Bohdan Jarochowski as its editor-in-chief.

Arens is heavily influenced by COBRA (a European art movement active around 1950), Pop Art and the drawings of his seven-year-old daughter.

The group had its origins in friendships and literary collaborations that were formed among students attending Mexico City's elite National Preparatory School; that is where founding members Jos√© Gorostiza, Carlos Pellicer, Bernardo Ortiz de Montellano, Enrique Gonz√°lez Rojo, and Jaime Torres Bodet met for the first time. This core group would all go on to attend together the Universidad Nacional Aut√≥noma de M√©xico, specifically its Faculty of Jurisprudence, where they would come under the influence of professors Antonio Caso and Enrique Gonz√°lez Mart√≠nez, both of whom were associated with the literary society Ateneo de M√©xico. Following this, a new generationally oriented and constituted society named the Nuevo Ateneo de la Juventud was formed in 1918. As a literary generation, the group was heir to modernismo, the work of Ram√≥n L√≥pez Velarde, and the tradition of the European avant garde. It was during this time that work by Los Contempor√°neos began appearing in magazines and student periodicals such as Pegaso (1917) and San-Ev-Ank (1918). In 1921, Salvador Novo and Xavier Villaurrutia joined the group; Jorge Cuesta and Gilberto Owen would later enter its orbit as well. Los Contempor√°neos benefited from government support during the period when Jos√© Vasconcelos was Secretary of Public Education (1920‚Äì24). Antonieta Rivas Mercado was also a member, as well as their patron. Members of the group began writing for and collaborating in magazines and other literary venues. They also started their own publications, the first of which, M√©xico Moderno, was described as an \\"art and literature review\\" and ran from 1920 to 1923. La Falange (December 1922-February 1923), labeled a \\"review of Latin culture\\", and Ulises (May 1927‚ÄìFebruary 1928; see also Teatro Ulises), billed as a source of \\"curiosity and criticism\\", were two other short-lived, though influential, literary journals founded and directed by Contempor√°neos. In 1928, Torres Bodet inaugurated the group's longest-lived editorial endeavor, the magazine Contempor√°neos. From June 1928 until December 1931 the magazine published, along with representative work by its founding members and allies, pieces by older, more established Mexican, Latin American, and Spanish writers, as well as translations of favored American and European authors. The rich and varied content of the publication was complemented by expensive details such as fine magazine paper and photographs and illustrations (made possible by continued government subventions). In 1928, Jorge Cuesta would also publish, under the aegis of the Contempor√°neos press, a poetic anthology titled Antolog√≠a de la poes√≠a mexicana moderna, which would give rise to heated polemics because of what were perceived, in certain literary and intellectual quarters, as glaring editorial omissions. Needless to say, much of the anthology's pages were taken up by the poetic output of Contempor√°neos. Los Contempor√°neos: tradition and innovation The group's central ideological position can be described as one of \\"contemporary [hence the name] cultural universalism\\": they were aware of the emergence of an unprecedented universality of cultural expression and innovation (brought about by capitalism's advance and accelerating technological progress), which they sought to not simply participate in, but, through their own particular vantage point as Mexican artists, contribute to as well. As individuals and as a group they would go on to expand the horizons of Mexican poetry. The Contempor√°neos were, if you will, rather contemporary. Not to be confused with temporary - lasting for a short period of time. The Contempor√°neos always expressed great appreciation for La Nouvelle Revue Fran√ßaise and its coterie of writers. They were also greatly attentive to the evolution of surrealism, and members of the group, while in Europe, made contact with leaders of the movement, including Andr√© Breton, author of the Surrealist Manifesto. The most important literary models and precursors of the Contempor√°neos were: Guillaume Apollinaire, Jean Cocteau, Andr√© Gide, Marcel Proust, T. S. Eliot and Juan Ram√≥n Jim√©nez; with Gide and Proust being paramount. Critical assessment The Contempor√°neos produced work which was characterized by the extensive, sometimes essentializing, use of metaphor, and complex imagery, which served to express experimental disjointments in narrative time and space meant to convey or reinforce particular philosophical or scientific concepts or concerns. At times, the Contempor√°neos were accused of literary effetism and elitism, especially when compared to groups more politically vocal and nationalist, such as the estridentistas, and of giving excessive preference to the airy and philosophical over the robust, the manly, and the mundane.

Designed to compete with high speed rally cars such as the Porsche 911 and Renault Alpine, the GT70 featured a mid-mounted engine with rear-wheel-drive. Len Bailey, who had been the chief engineer on the Ford GT40 project, was enlisted to help design the bodywork and chassis. The GT70 had little success in rallying as it suffered numerous problems such as the frame not being stiff enough, the cockpit being cramped and the V6 in the original cars having too high a centre of gravity. Although the GT70's intended purpose had been rallying, rule changes in the World Rally Championship as well as the fact that the already developed Escort platform was showing more promise caused Ford engineers to abandon the platform, and in 1973 the GT70 program ended.  Performance  The GT70 was initially designed to use a range of engines, with the first ones being fitted with the 2.6-litre Cologne V6 from the Ford Capri RS2600 developing . One of the cars ran by Ford France later had its V6 swapped for a 1.6-litre Cosworth BDA straight-four engine in order to reduce the center of gravity for racing. The GT70s also wore fiberglass bodies to save weight and were fitted with 13 inch four stud, four spoke wheels designed especially for the car by Len Bailey.  Production  Only six GT70s were ever built. One was run in the 1971 Ronde Cevenole Rally in France, driven by Roger Clark, but was plagued by engine, suspension and braking problems. Another ran in the 1971 Tour de France Automobile driven by Francois Mazet with partner Jean Todt. Unfortunately they were unable to finish after colliding with a bridge parapet in the alps. A third was modified by Ford France with a 1.6 litre Cosworth BDA I4, 5-speed Hewland gearbox and a BP livery and was run in the 1972 and 1973 French tarmac championships with Guy Chasseuil as the driver. Out of the remaining three, one was fitted with a body designed by Carrozzeria Ghia and subsequently shown at the 1971 Turin Auto Show. Another was used as a press car, and the last was used for race car development. The GT70 originally modified and run by Ford France was restored in 2002, and fitted with a 2-litre Cosworth BDG engine.

The Omurtag's Tarnovo Inscription is an inscription in Greek language, engraved on a column of dark syenite found in the SS. Forty Martyrs Church in Tarnovo, Bulgaria. The inscription was known since 1858 when Hristo Daskalov from Tryavna managed to visit the church (which was converted to a mosque at that time) and to make a replica of the inscription. Along with the Chatalar Inscription, the Tarnovo inscription testifies for the active construction during the reign of Kanasubigi Omurtag (r. 814-831). It is assumed that the inscription was made in 822. The historians are uncertain about the original location of the inscription (probably Pliska) and the location of the \\"new home on the Danube\\", for which the inscription was created - Silistra, the village of Malak Preslavets or the island of PƒÉcuiul lui Soare (now in Romania).

Let the one who comes later upon seeing this inscription remember the one who had made it. And the name is Omurtag, Kana subigi. Let God make him live 100 years.\\"  Significance  The final lines of Omurtag's Turnovo Inscription reveal Omurtag's message to future generations: \\"Even if a man lives well, he dies and another one comes into existence. Let the one who comes later upon seeing this inscription remember the one who had made it. And the name is Omurtag, Kana subigi. Let God make him live 100 years.\\" These lines sound like a direct address to posterity: before his judgement, Omurtag rises with his life philosophy which is fundamentally different from the lachrymose Christian ideology and the salvation it offers in the promise of the soul's perpetual being. The Bulgarian ruler deliberates upon the meaning of human life, upon the great mysteries of birth and death, upon that which stands between them and which history itself sometimes grants immortality. In fact, Omurtag finds immortality in the course of human life without seeing the need to abstract beyond its earthly confines as evinced by the very last line which focuses on the prolonging of life on earth rather than redemption in an imagined afterlife. The philosophical premise here demonstrates a clear awareness of the continuity of history on a grand scale and the frailty and transience of a person's life in comparison with the only consolation here being that person's actions and accomplishments and their role in the lives of people yet to come - the core idea in Omurtag's philosophy. His concise and laconic words do not contain self-glorification, but rather Khan Omurtag seeks the meaning of human existence in a constructive genesis, and it is set in stone by the acknowledging voice of history before which the Bulgarian ruler rises with his remarkable deeds.

Later on in his career he gradually abandoned his pessimistic prose and chose to write more and more poetry full of historical and literary references, while at the same time not neglecting the sound value of his verse. These two factors have gradually alienated him from an initially enthusiastic audience. Writing and reception Hamelink was born in Driewegen. His early stories (as collected in Het plantaardig bewind, Horror vacui and De rudimentaire mens) revolve around the interplay between man and nature, where the former is always inferior to the latter. Main characters in these stories often disappear or die faced with the amoral and omnipresent force of life. The poetry, collected in such books as De eeuwige dag (\\"The Eternal Day\\") and Een koude onrust (\\"A Cold Anxiety\\"), is in a very similar vein, and both poetry and prose were enthusiastically received by audience and critics alike.Van Domselaar, Kees. \\"Jacques Hamelink\\". Kritisch Literatuurlexicon 27 (1987) This initial success would be short-lived: starting with Oudere gronden (\\"Older soils\\") Hamelink's poetry became more and more abstract, bare of all personal involvement but still maintaining the same themes. His work was quickly branded hermetic and shoved to the side. Despite his growing impopularity, Hamelink continued on his set course, which would become more and more mystical as the years progressed. His growing belief, borrowed from poets such as Paul Celan and H√∂lderlin, was that poetry should try to speak the impossible, and that its failure to do this constitutes its greatness. This was perhaps most effectively enunciated in the speech \\"Op weg naar de po√´zie\\" (\\"On the Way to Poetry\\"), published in the significantly titled Niemandsgedichten (\\"Nobodypoems\\"). Paradoxically, after the publication of Niemandsgedichten Hamelink's poetry became more instead of less personal. This is most obvious in books such as Ceremoni√´le en particuliere madrigalen (\\"Ceremonial and Specific Madrigals\\") and Herinnering aan het verdwenen light (\\"Remembrance of the Disappeared Light\\"), where he dealt with the history of his own family and the particular surroundings (the Dutch province of Zeelandic Flanders) of his youth. These years (the 1980s) also feature the publication of two important critical texts: De droom van de po√´zie (\\"The Dream of Poetry\\") and In een lege kamer een garendraadje (\\"In an Empty Room a Piece of String\\"). The former is a wider treatment of the trend set by Op weg naar de po√´zie: for Hamelink, the writer who tries to capture the \\"mystery\\" has to be thoroughly familiar with both human history and the literary tradition. In doing this Hamelink consciously placed himself in a tradition that stretches from Dante Alighieri to T. S. Eliot. Similarly to the poet, high demands are made on the reader and critic. In een lege kamer een garendraadje is a violent attack on a contemporary Dutch literary criticism that was less and less appreciative of Hamelink's work. Hamelink especially reproached his contemporaries for their lack of knowledge of the classics and their complacent admiration for \\"experimental\\" poetry.This is not to say that Hamelink's poetry is not fairly experimental in its own right. However, he protests against easy experimentation, where innovation becomes a mask for a total lack of content. This conscious turn away from his colleagues and the bulk of his audience has perhaps reached its climax with the current phase of Hamelink's work. Since Sacrale komedie (\\"Sacral Comedy\\") his work has become highly allusive. Personal and \\"general\\" history fuse in ever more rigidly constructed poems.cf. De Coux, Anneleen. ‚Äú ‚ÄòDe ornamentenversierde cither heraangeraakt‚Äô: Kinksteen van Ch'in \\". Po√´ziekrant 5 (2003): 62-65. and Elshout, Ron. ‚ÄúEeuwig, dagelijks: Over Tweede Gedichten van Jacques Hamelink‚Äù. Ons Erfdeel 2 (1994): 264-266. The language of these poems heightens their difficulty: the author riffs on existing words, creating neologisms while at the same time reintroducing archaic words.

It is funded by individual donor contributions and foundation grants.  Mission  According to its website, the Coalition for a Secure Driver's License is committed to higher standards for both government and private entities that issue identity credentials, especially state agencies that issue driver's licenses and ID cards. The organization undertakes research projects addressing best practices for departments of motor vehicles (DMV), compliance with federal laws and regulations, identity fraud prevention and related identity management topics. CSDL provides research results and educational programs to the public and to state and federal officials. It is a member of the Document Security Alliance and of the American National Standards Institute. Goals and activities CSDL was formed in November 2001, following the 9/11 investigation which revealed that the terrorists had fraudulently obtained over 30 valid IDs and driver's licenses. The 9/11 Commission recommended that \\"the federal government should set standards for the issuance of ... sources of identification, such as driver's licenses.\\" Based on these findings Henry Buhl and Alan Weeden founded the CSDL as an organization to promote ID card security. One of the main goals of the Coalition for a Secure Driver's License was to create national standards based on best practices for driver's license and ID card issuance that states must meet. The group opposed Governor Spitzer's effort to allow the state of New York to license immigrants regardless of their legal status because that effort would reduce the credibility of documentation required to obtain a license.  Programs  \\"Fake IDs are not worth the risks\\" = This program seeks to educate the public on the consequences of purchasing and using a fake ID. It places posters in college dorm rooms, contributes flyers to college orientation packages, provides literature for law enforcement agencies to distribute, and travels around the country providing training and resources to combat the fake ID epidemic. By discouraging minors from breaking the law by using fake IDs, CSDL attempts to protect them from being arrested and having a permanent criminal record while also protecting the public from drunk drivers, alcohol related assaults, and alcohol related fatalities. CSDL published an editorial in USAToday about the fake ID epidemic in April 2015. = \\"Keeping IDentities Safe for KIDS\\" = This program, stylized as \\"Keeping IDentities Safe for KIDS\\", was formed because criminals are increasingly using the identity information of children to obtain driver's licenses and IDs in new names because children have no criminal records or credit history, offering a blank slate for criminal activity. Using a fraudulently obtained driver's license, criminals can establish a line of credit or obtain employment with the child's identity. CSDL began working with the Boys & Girls Club in Washington state in November 2009 to create the Keeping IDentities Safe for KIDS program in order to raise awareness of the need for parents and guardians to take steps to protect their children's identities from theft and fraud. The program offers a suggested series of actions to be undertaken by parents on behalf of their children and encourages them to obtain Washington State ID cards. In some areas, the program offers reimbursement for parents or guardians obtaining ID cards for their children. There are two levels of the KIDS program: Level 1: A local sponsoring organization agrees to advise the community (through flyers, newspaper articles, state licensing agency contacts) that children are at risk from identity thieves and distributes educational brochures that explain why and how in detail. The brochures also explain that obtaining a state issued identity document reduces the risk, and will assist to correct the record should the child still be a victim of ID theft/ fraud. Level 2 (Optional): Parents are asked to get their child a state issued identity document from the Washington Department of Licensing, with the inducement that during the time period the program is offered, there will be 100% reimbursement of the costs. CSDL will reimburse all parents and guardians with valid vouchers during the program's duration, usually 3 to 6 months from the distribution of educational brochures/vouchers. The parent must bring the state issued Identification Document (ID) or an Enhanced Identification Document (EID) with the child, to a location where the sponsor can confirm that the child has been recently issued a state ID/EID. Based on a completed request for reimbursement, the parent receives a check in the amount of the state fee for the ID/EID. = State awards = A state recognition awards program was established by the Board of Directors of CSDL in April 2009 to annually memorialize distinctive achievements of individual state agencies, including motor vehicle agencies. The program currently has four award categories: document security, for upgrades to the physical attributes of identity cards; public engagement, for information dissemination; identity protection, for fraud prevention programs; and homeland security, for improving processes to meet federal standards. Awards have been given to Nevada, Virginia, Nebraska, Colorado, Indiana, Florida, New Jersey, California, South Dakota, Delaware, Kansas, West Virginia, and New Mexico. Billboard controversy In December 2005, the Coalition for a Secure Driver's License launched a billboard campaign in North Carolina urging the increase of driver's license issuance standards, which group members felt were overly lax. The billboard's slogan, \\"Don't License Terrorists\\" accompanied an image of a terrorist wearing a traditional Arab headdress while holding a driver's license and grenade. James Zogby, president of the Washington-based Arab American Institute, said the billboard was racist and anti-immigration for its depiction of an Arab man in traditional dress as a terrorist. Ernie Seneca, spokesman for North Carolina's Department of Transportation, replied that the state's driver's license program was sufficiently secure and Melanie Chernoff, deputy director of El Pueblo, an Hispanic advocacy group in Raleigh, said the billboard is unnecessary because license requirements in North Carolina already are strict. CSDL President Amanda Bowman defended the billboard, stating that North Carolina's driver's license program was vulnerable.

A. Undeclared Chemical War in Russia. Moscow, 1995 (Russian) It became a prototype for the series of Novichok agents. According to chemical weapons expert Jonathan Tucker, the first binary formulation developed under the Soviet Foliant program was used to make Substance 33, differing from VX only in the alkyl substituents on its nitrogen and oxygen atoms. \\"This weapon was given the code name Novichok.\\"  History  The development of VR started in 1957, after the Soviet Union obtained information about detection of high level of toxicity in phosphorylthiocholines (the same year Lars-Erik Tammelin published his first articles on fluorophosphorylcholines and phosphorylthiocholines in Acta Chemica Scandinavica) by a team from the Soviet Union's Scientific Research Institute No. 42 (NII-42). Sergei Zotovich Ivin, Leonid Soborovsky, and Iya Danilovna Shilakova jointly developed this analogue of VX. They completed their work in 1963 and were later awarded the Lenin Prize for their achievement.Tucker, J. B.; War of Nerves; Anchor Books; New York; 2006; pp 181-182. A binary weapon comprising two less toxic precursors which mixed during flight to form Substance 33 was later developed by a team led by Nikolai Kuznetsov, for which they were awarded the 1990 Lenin Prize.Vil S. Mirzayanov. State Secrets. An Insider's Chronicle of the Russian Chemical Weapons Program. (2009) pp166-168. In 1972 the Soviets opened Cheboksary Khimprom, a manufacturing plant for VR in Novocheboksarsk.Tucker, J. B.; War of Nerves; Anchor Books; New York; 2006; pp 230‚Äì231. All facilities in USSR produced 15,557 tons of VR according to their declaration to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), although most if not all of this has now been destroyed under disarmament treaties.  Comparison to VX  VR has similar lethal dose levels to VX (between 10‚Äì50 mg), as well as being similar in appearance. However, due to usage of diethylamino radicals instead of diisopropylamino it is more prone to decomposition. The former are worse at sterically protecting the nitrogen atom from attacking either phosphorus or the Œ±-carbon atom adjacent to sulfur than the latter. According to UK Defence Science and Technology Laboratory Detection Department scientists Robin M. Black and John M. Harrison, chemical stability was an important factor why of all the similarly toxic phosphorylthiocholines, ethyl N-2-diisopropylaminoethyl methylphosphonothiolate in particular (now known as VX), was weaponized in the West.Black R.M., Harrison J.M. The chemistry of organophosphorus chemical warfare agents. Chapter 10 of The chemistry of organophosphorus compounds. Volume 4, Ter- and quinque-valent phosphorus acids and their derivatives. (1996) According to Russian CW developer Vil Mirzayanov, in the late 1980s a group of GosNIIOKhT chemists led by Georgiy Drozd prepared a scientific report that Substance 33 had much lower shelf life than VX. The report, writes Mirzayanov, caused 'panic' in the institute top management and the military representative office, and later was met with administrative resistance. This finding was independently verified by another chemist Igor Revelskiy but his report wasn't approved either. Following the poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal, former head of the GosNIIOKhT security department Nikolay Volodin said in an interview to Novaya Gazeta that Substance 33 was decomposing too quickly in combat conditions, and implied that this fact may have influenced the decision to continue research on the Novichok program.  Toxicity  Both agents have similar symptoms and method of action to other nerve agents that act on cholinesterase, and treatment remains the same. However, the window for effectively treating second generation V series seizures is shorter, as they rapidly denature the acetylcholinesterase protein in a similar manner to soman, making treatment with the standard nerve gas antidote pralidoxime ineffective unless it is given very soon after exposure. Pre-treatment with pyridostigmine prior to exposure, and treatment with other drugs such as atropine and diazepam after exposure, will reduce symptoms of nerve agent toxicity but may not be sufficient to prevent death if a large dose of nerve agent has been absorbed. In addition to the standard seizures, some of the second generation V series agents are known to cause comas.

Al Gentry, brother of Neumar's fourth husband Harold, had urged police to investigate his death for 22 years, prior to her arrest in 2007. Following this arrest, and learning of the fact that Neumar had had five husbands in total who had all died, the case generated much media interest in the United States, who dubbed Neumar the \\"Black Widow\\". On June 13, 2011, Mrs. Neumar died in an Alexandria, Louisiana hospital of cancer before her trial. Husbands Betty Lafon Johnson was born in November 1931 in Ironton, Ohio to Odis and Elizabeth Walden Johnson. She graduated from South Point High School in 1949. She was married five times: # (m. 11/25/1950 ‚Äì div. 1952) Clarence Malone (b. 1931 - d. 1970) remarried twice after the couple split and was shot dead on November 27, 1970 in Medina, Ohio; # (m. 02/09/1953 - his death in 1955) James A.

Mr. Neumar's cause of death was listed as sepsis, ischemic colitis, and ileus - symptoms that could point to death by arsenic poisoning. Additional reasons his death were considered suspicious came from Neumar's son, John Neumar, Jr., who told authorities he was not informed of the death until reading about it in a newspaper. When he contacted the widow about the death, he was told that his father had already been cremated despite having previously bought a burial plot. Investigation In May 2008 Neumar was charged with hiring a hit man to kill her husband.http://www.wrdw.com/home/headlines/19889244.html Investigators are taking a closer look at the deaths of her other husbands, three of whom had been shot dead.http://www.wrdw.com/crimeteam12/headlines/19365614.html Neumar was extradited to Albemarle, North Carolina in June 2008, a month after her arrest. She was charged with the murder of her fourth husband, Harold Gentry, by North Carolina officials after receiving a tip pointing to her involvement. The indictment alleges that Neumar \\"sought out a former police officer and her neighbor to kill her husband in the months before his death\\", with the motive allegedly being his $20,000 life insurance policy. Charged with three counts of solicitation to commit first-degree murder, Neumar was released in October 2008 on a $300,000 bail bond.http://chronicle.augusta.com/stories/2009/05/21/met_524741.shtml Investigators had the ashes of her fifth husband John Neumar seized, and analysed for traces of arsenic. The results were negative. A trial date was never set. BBC documentary The case of Betty Neumar was the subject of a BBC television documentary, Black Widow Granny?, first aired on BBC One on 3 November 2009. The film featured interviews with friends and relatives, as well as an interview with Neumar, who had otherwise avoided the media. Death On June 13, 2011, Betty Neumar died in an Alexandria, Louisiana hospital before her trial. In the \\"Matriarchs of Murder\\" episode of Investigation Discovery's anthology Deadly Women, writers claimed that Neumar's death was caused by cancer. As of December 23, 2012, none of the deaths of her five dead husbands are actively being re-investigated, as well as the death of her first child, Gary Flynn, whose 1985 death was ruled as suicide.

In August 2014 the company announced that they were to cease trading. This announcement followed a number of product recalls in 2013. Founded in 2004 by Susie Willis, a former chef at The Savoy Hotel, the brand produced organic baby and toddler food. Products were sold in all the major UK supermarkets including Ocado. Plum was positioned at the premium end of the baby food market and at one time had a 4% share of the baby food sector in the UK, worth ¬£11m. Plum Baby was a member of Organic Farmers and Growers. History The Taplow based Plum Baby was founded in 2004 by Susie and Paddy Willis and launched in February 2006. Within 12 months of launch, company products were available in 2,500 supermarket stores. The founders sold to Darwin Private Equity in May 2010 in a deal that valued the company at ¬£10 million. In January 2013 Plum Baby Ltd was sold to US based Plum organics. Then, in June 2013 Plum organics was acquired by Campbell Soup. In 2013, the Campbell Soup Company bought out Plum Organics using available credit. In November 2013, Plum Organics recalled several baby food products for a spoilage defect. Plum Organics shut down in August 2014. Products Plum Baby had 38 products ranges including Stage 1 ‚Äì 3 baby and toddler food, snack ranges and others. All Plum Baby products were described 100% organic. The wet food was sold in resealable pouches, which contained aluminium, sandwiched between two layers of plastic which eliminated the need for preservatives and meant that the food can be minimally processed. The aluminium never came in direct contact with the food to ensure it's safe for consumption. Many of the pouches were recalled as the seals on a some lines of baby food failed causing the contents to spoil. Plum Baby products contained no added sugar, salt or water. No additives, E numbers or GM products. Plum Baby Organics prepared baby food was more nutritious when compared to other brands due to quinoa added for texture.

He graduated from Washington State University and received his MD degree from the University of Washington, School of Medicine in Seattle. Sande was a professor of Internal Medicine from 1971 to 1980 at the University of Virginia, where he performed research in mice on bacterial meningitis therapies such as novel antibiotics and corticosteroids. Dr Sande was Chief of Medical Services at San Francisco General Hospital in 1981 when he recognized a pattern of gay men being admitted with the rare pneumocystis pneumonia. His efforts on behalf of these patients resulted in the formation of an AIDS ward at San Francisco General Hospital and later an AIDS outpatient clinic. Teaming with such experts as Julie Gerberding and Paul Volberding he helped to craft what became known as the San Francisco model of AIDS therapy, a comprehensive, rational approach to care that avoided the fear and paranoia surrounding the disease at that time. The model addressed a need for infection-control guidelines, clinical studies and research financing and became a template for AIDS centers nationwide. Sande helped found to the Gladstone Institute of Virology and Immunology, which performed trials on some of the first anti-retrovirals such as zidovudine. He also helped to found the Infectious Diseases Institute at the Makerere University College of Health Sciences in Kampala, Uganda a major center for HIV education and research in Africa. Sande was a professor of Medicine at University of California, San Francisco from 1980 to 1996, chairman of the department internal medicine at University of Utah from 1996 to 2005 and Professor of medicine at University of Washington from 2005 until his death and president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America from 1993 to 1994. He was also the editor of two highly regarded medical references \\"The Medical Management of AIDS.\\" and \\"The Sanford Guide to Antimicrobial Therapy\\". He also gave the always popular and well attended annual update in Infectious Diseases at the American College of Physicians annual meeting as well as the clinical case presentations at the Infectious Diseases Society of America annual meeting.

Dyukov is considered by critics to be a historical negationist downplaying Soviet repressions. He is persona non grata in Latvia, Lithuania and other Schengen memberstates. Career Aleksandr Dyukov graduated from the Russian State University for the Humanities in 2004. The topic of his dissertation was the Soviet partisan movement in 1941‚Äì1943. From 2004 to 2007, Dyukov worked for the ARMS-TASS Agency of Military and Technical Information. He contributed as issuing editor of the weekly Military and Technical Cooperation, later promoted to its editor-in-chief. He has published two books in REGNUM News Agency. However, REGNUM has since ceased cooperation with him following a conflict over Dyukov's statements in the Russian and Estonian media that his Historical Memory Foundation was primarily responsible for these publications. Dyukov has been featured as an expert historical commentator on Novosti's Russia Today (now RT) channel and on their web site.For example, in a website news story: As a commentator on the current events programme \\"Spotlight\\": Dyukov is a member of the working group set up by the Russian State Duma preparing a draft for a law on combating the rehabilitation of Nazism. Controversy One of Dyukov's spheres of interest is the history of Soviet repression, mostly in the Baltic states and Ukraine, and more recently, he has written a controversial paper downplaying the massacres at Kurapaty in Belarus. While Dyukov employs open archives such as from the State Archive of the Russian Federation (GARF) and the Russian State Archive of Contemporary History (RGANI), he also cites the archives of the FSB,e.g., –ú–∏—Ñ –æ –≥–µ–Ω–æ—Ü–∏–¥–µ; \\"–ú–∏–ª–æ—Å—Ç—å –∫ –ø–∞–¥—à–∏–º\\", passim. to which access by researchers is limited. It is these FSB archives which Dyukov uses, for example, to claim in his recent book, The Genocide Myth, that Estonia's recollection of Soviet repressions including deportations is exaggerated. In regard to the June 1941 deportations, that took place before German invasion of June 22, 1941, Dyukov contends that deported Estonians were mostly German collaborators or were linked to them.\\"If only Baltic nationalists had not cooperated with German special services and had not prepared for acts of sabotage, there would have been no need for the deportation. It was the activity of nationalists and of Nazi agents that provoked the deportations‚Äîand Estonian historians prefer to keep silent about it.\\" Translated from Estonian rendering in Eesti Ekspress; In a 2007 interview with Russia's REGNUM News Agency, Dyukov claimed that some Estonian historians were repeating false claims by the Nazi propaganda and said: \\"Another example of unfair approach Estonian official historians is that in describing the deportation of 14 June 1941, they always mention that the deportees were transported in stock cars, with each car stuffed to 40-50 people, including women, children and the elderly. Therefore, they say, this deportation caused massive mortality. However, if we turn to the NKVD documents, a fair amount of which has already been published, one finds that, firstly, the transportation of deportees was carried out in passenger cars 'equipped for summer human traffic.' Secondly, each railroad car carried not 40-50, but about 30 deportees. Third, according to railroad documents, mass death was impossible. It can't be ruled out that during this deportation, not a single person died. Estonian historians, by the way, somehow forget that in every echelon of deportees there was an ambulance railroad car, which was accompanied by a doctor, paramedic and two nurses.\\" In reaction to Dyukov's book, the newspaper Eesti Ekspress in Estonia denounced him as a revisionist historian who paints a picture of Soviet political repressions as \\"little worse than a family picnic\\".Reported in: Irina Pavlova, a historian of the Soviet system under Lenin and Stalin, has commented that Dyukov promotes \\"a new prison guard's concept of Soviet history\\" based on his \\"blind faith in the documents provided by the FSB archives\\". A. Dykov's name has found mentioning in Estonia's Security Police (Kapo) 2008 yearbook, according to which Dykov, although lacking both post- secondary degree academic degree, has been granted exclusive access to FSB (former USSR's KGB) archive. The yearbook claimed that Mr Dykov's activities are approved by Russia's FSB. KAPO AASTARAAMAT 2008 As of March 2012, Dykov has been prevented from entering Latvia by the Latvian Government, who cited concerns that Dykov's activities are harming the Latvian state and its citizens.

According to the generally accepted opinion, he was the second most important person in the state after the Bulgarian ruler. He had a number of responsibilities and concentrated huge power and authority. The kavhan was a commander-in-chief of the Bulgarian army and one of the primary diplomats in the state. He was a member of the Bolyar Counsel and one of the most important advisers to the Bulgarian ruler; the kavhan was sometimes his regent or co-ruler. The kavhan was a high magistrate and substitute to the ruler when the latter is absent from the capital. He is also attributed to have been a judge. It is assumed that there was a prominent bolyar family in Bulgaria from which the kavhan was chosen generation after generation - the so-called \\"kavhan kin\\". The title was therefore hereditary and for life. According to most historians the title outlived the First Empire which was conquered by Basil II in 1018. The last person who had the prerogatives and responsibilities of a kavhan was Georgi Voiteh, an initiator of the uprising of Peter III (Constantine Bodin) in 1072. During the reign of Samuil the kavhan was Dometian, captured by the Byzantines and succeeded by his brother Teodor during the reign of Ivan Vladislav.–ì—é–∑–µ–ª–µ–≤, –í., –ö–∞–≤—Ö–∞–Ω–∏—Ç–µ –∏ –∏—á–∏—Ä–≥—É –±–æ–∏–ª–∏—Ç–µ –≤ –±—ä–ª–≥–∞—Ä—Å–∫–æ—Ç–æ –∫–∞–Ω—Å—Ç–≤–æ-—Ü–∞—Ä—Å—Ç–≤–æ (VII-XI –≤.), –ü–ª–æ–≤–¥–∏–≤ 2007, , p. 79-80–ê–Ω–¥—Ä–µ–µ–≤, –ô., –õ–∞–∑–∞—Ä–æ–≤, –ò–≤., –ü–∞–≤–ª–æ–≤, –ü–ª., –ö–æ–π –∫–æ–π –µ –≤ –°—Ä–µ–¥–Ω–æ–≤–µ–∫–æ–≤–Ω–∞ –ë—ä–ª–≥–∞—Ä–∏—è, –°–æ—Ñ–∏—è 1994, , p. 99-100 During the Second Bulgarian Empire the title was not used. Another famous kavhan is Peter who carried out three missions in Rome and one in Constantinople during the reign of Boris I. The most prominent kavhan, as well as the one with most merits for Bulgaria was Isbul. He occupied that position during the reign of three Khans: Omurtag (814-831), Malamir (831-836) and his nephew Presian (836-852). His merits include the reconstruction of Pliska as a beautiful capital during Omurtag and the completion of the new centralized state administration. He ordered an action to catch the Byzantine spies. He was among the main initiators of the 30-year peace Treaty of 815 which was very favourable and useful for Bulgaria. Isbul commanded the Bulgarian armies in successful campaigns against the Byzantines in southern Macedonia.

The Battle of Sparrs√§tra, fought between the forces of King Eric XI of Sweden and rebels led by Holmger Knutsson, took place in 1247 near Enk√∂ping in Sweden. It occurred during a poorly documented period in Swedish history; as a result, many details are uncertain and conjectural. Although it was not the end of the Folkung rebellion, many scholars consider it to have marked the end of the old order, leading to the Uppland Swedes' loss of their semi-aristocratic status, and to the beginning of taxation by the King. Background Since pre-historic times the Swedes of UpplandBefore 1296, Uppland appears to have referred to the non-coastal area of modern Uppland, i.e. excluding Roslagen, see Lindstr√∂m & Lindstr√∂m 2006, pp. 147-150. had elected the king of Sweden, and their responsibility towards him lay not in paying taxes, but in providing warriors and ships for the leidang organization. Many scholars consider the reasons for the battle to have been the abolition of the leidang organization and its replacement with monetary taxes. The people of Uppland also appear to have refused to pay tithes to the church.Lindstr√∂m & Lindstr√∂m 2006, p.151 The Geats of V√§sterg√∂tland had begun to pay tithes in the late 12th century, a decision taken independently of the Swedes. It is not known if the Geats had ever had any leidang organization, but they had accepted paying taxes, a system which provided a more stable basis of power for the King.Lindstr√∂m & Lindstr√∂m 2006, p.152 The main source for what was at stake during the battle is the Annals of Sigtuna, which relates that at Sparrs√§tra, in 1247, the rural community of Uppland lost its freedom and was charged with paying taxes, including taxes on grain production and the right of laying up a ship: :Lindstr√∂m & Lindstr√∂m 2006, p. 147 The archaeologist Mats G. Larsson has commented that it is hardly surprising that such fundamental changes in the structure of society would meet fierce resistance. Taking part in the royal war expeditions was considered to be a natural and glorious tradition from pagan times; paying taxes to the King of Sweden, on the other hand, was likely seen as something done by defeated tributary nations - and beyond the pale for the people of Uppland. There may have been additional reasons why the battle took place in 1247. The position of jarl in Sweden had passed from old Ulf Fase to his younger and more dynamic cousin Birger Jarl. Moreover, Holmger Knutsson had come of age, and, being a son of former king Canute II of Sweden, had his own aspirations to the throne. When Ulf Fase died, Birger Jarl may have felt it was time to deal with Holmger and his allies in Uppland.Lindstr√∂m & Lindstr√∂m 2006, p.153 Location The church of Sparrs√§tra. The battle took place at Sparrs√§tra, which is located in Uppland, north of Enk√∂ping.Sparrs√§tra in Nationalencyklopedin, tome 17, page 113. (1995)Larsson 2002, p.177 According to tradition it was fought on waterlogged meadows west of the church of Sparrs√§tra, but it has been suggested that the rebels had their encampment several kilometres eastwards in R√∂nne, where there are remains of potentially strategic fortifications.Lindstr√∂m & Lindstr√∂m 2006, p.154 Battle One view holds that this was the first battle where heavy cavalry was used in central Sweden, although such cavalry had appeared a century earlier at the Battle of Fotevik in Scania.Lindstr√∂m & Lindstr√∂m 2006, p.155 The professional heavy cavalry fielded by King Eric defeated Holmger's army, which consisted of a public levy.Lindstr√∂m & Lindstr√∂m 2006, p.156 According to the 14th century Law of S√∂dermanland a levied farmer was supposed to be equipped with sword, javelin, lance and helmet; however, it is known that these conscript armies consisted largely of people who had little more than an axe or a sword to fight with. In Snorri Sturluson's kings' sagas there are descriptions of battles where the combatants fought with stones. Aftermath After the battle, Holmger fled north to G√§strikland, but he was soon arrested by the king and the jarl, who had him beheaded.Larsson 2002, p. 178 The Eric Chronicles tell that the king took part in the funeral and walked him to the grave, which suggests that the old Norse code of honouring dead enemies was still alive, although such traditions would later change.Lindstr√∂m & Lindstr√∂m 2006, p.167 Among Upplanders who had lost their leader, Holmger rose to the status of unofficial saint, and only a few years after his execution people would tell of miracles in his name as far south as Denmark.Lindstr√∂m & Lindstr√∂m 2006, p.168ff When the Papal legate William of Modena arrived in the same year, he stayed in the less turbulent district of √ñsterg√∂tland, where he met Birger Jarl. William reported home that he had offered to mediate in the conflict,Lindstr√∂m & Lindstr√∂m 2006, p.157 and in March 1248, he reported that a peace agreement had been reached.Lindstr√∂m & Lindstr√∂m 2006, p.158 This was at the time when the meeting at Sk√§nninge took place, in which Sweden was formally integrated into the Catholic community. The Swedes of Uppland, who since time immemorial had been divided into folklands according to how many warriors they could provide, had lost their warrior status, and they had become taxpayers like the king's other subjects. The new taxes described in the Annals of Sigtuna would also appear in the later law of Uppland, and the king used the taxes to buy the services of heavy cavalry that he could use against his own people.Larsson 2002, p. 179 It would be several decades before a new tax exempted warrior class appeared in Sweden, and by then, exemption would be a privilege only afforded to the select few who could provide a knight in full armour. The outcome of the battle was notorious enough to be mentioned in both Icelandic and Danish chronicles, and elaborate legends would be told in Sweden until the 17th century. The Uppland Swedes had been transformed from a people that extorted tribute from other peoples, to one that paid taxes themselves. NotesSources * Larsson, Mats G (2002).

Josiah E. Chase Octagon House is an historic octagon house on Chase Mill Road in East Limington, Maine. Built about 1858, it is one of twelve houses of the type known to survive in the state from the period of its greatest popularity, and is one of the least-altered. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1987. Its builder, Josiah Chase, was a seafaring ship's captain. Description and history The Chase Octagon House is set amid oak trees on a knoll near the confluence of the Little Ossipee River with the Saco River on the east side of Limington, Maine. It is a two-story wood frame structure, with an octagonal roof that is topped by a cupola. The eight sides are roughly equal in size, and are finished with clapboards. The entrance faces west, away from the rivers, and consists of a heavy door flanked by narrow sidelight windows and pilasters. There is photographic evidence that a more elaborate porch once sheltered the entry. The building corners have paneled pilasters, and fenestration generally consist of paired narrow sash windows; there are several projecting single- story bay windows. The octagonal cupola features small windows with segmented- arch lintels. The interior has had some alteration, principally the removal of several walls to create larger spaces, and the closing off of an entry into the kitchen space. The upstairs originally had seven triangular chambers; one wall was removed to create a larger chamber. A period carriage barn stands near the house. Limington's Chase family is descended from Deacon Amos Chase, who is reputed to be the town's first white settler. Josiah E. Chase's father owned a sawmill on the river nearby; he began a life at sea at the age of 18 aboard a whaling ship. He acquired the land for this house in 1858 (from James Madison Chase, of unknown relation), and built the house soon afterward. The house belonged to his descendants until 1971.

It served in the Second Boer War, the First World War and the Second World War before being reduced to squadron level in 1956. It ceased to have a separate existence in 1971. HistoryFormation and early history= In 1793, the prime minister, William Pitt the Younger, proposed that the English Counties form a force of Volunteer Yeoman Cavalry that could be called on by the king to defend the country against invasion or by the Lord Lieutenant to subdue any civil disorder within the country. The regiment was originally formed as the Northamptonshire Yeomanry Cavalry in 1794 but it was disbanded in 1828. It was raised again as independent troops in 1830 but disbanded again in 1873. =Second Boer War= A Northamptonshire Imperial Yeomanry regiment was formed during the Second Boer War. The regiment was based at Clare Street in Northampton at this time. =First World War= In accordance with the Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907 (7 Edw. 7, c.9) which brought the Territorial Force into being, the TF was intended to be a home defence force for service during wartime and members could not be compelled to serve outside the country. However, on the outbreak of war on 4 August 1914, many members volunteered for Imperial Service. Therefore, TF units were split in August and September 1914 into 1st Line (liable for overseas service) and 2nd Line (home service for those unable or unwilling to serve overseas) units. Later, a 3rd Line was formed to act as a reserve, providing trained replacements for the 1st and 2nd Line regiments.  1/1st Northamptonshire Yeomanry On mobilisation in August 1914, the 1st Line regiment was attached to the Eastern Mounted Brigade, which was part of the 1st Mounted Division. In November 1914, the regiment moved to France with the 8th Division. It remained with the 8th Division until April 1915, when it was split up: :Regimental HQ and B Squadron joined the 6th Division :A Squadron joined the 4th Division :C Squadron joined the 5th Division. This lasted until May 1916, when the Regiment re-formed, becoming the 6th Corps Cavalry Regiment. In November 1917, it moved to Italy, becoming 14th Corps Cavalry.  2/1st Northamptonshire Yeomanry The 2nd Line regiment was formed in September 1914. In November 1915, the regiment joined the 59th (2nd North Midland) Division. In April 1916, the regiment began to split up, with the RHQ and A Squadron joining the 69th (2nd East Anglian) Division in Yorkshire. One Squadron was attached to the 67th (2nd Home Counties) Division in Kent in October 1916. During the following winter, the remaining squadron went to France, where it was absorbed into the Tank Corps around August 1917. Of the two squadrons remaining in the United Kingdom, one was absorbed into the 6th Reserve Cavalry Regiment at Tidworth in March 1917, the other was disbanded.  3/1st Northamptonshire Yeomanry The 3rd Line regiment was formed in 1915 and in the summer it was affiliated to the 3rd Reserve Cavalry Regiment at Canterbury. Early in 1917, it was absorbed in the 6th Reserve Cavalry Regiment at Tidworth. =Between the wars= On 7 February 1920, the regiment was reconstituted in the Territorial Army with HQ at the Old Militia Barracks in Clare St, Northampton. It was initially established with three Squadrons. Following the experience of the war, it was decided that only the fourteen most senior yeomanry regiments would be retained as horsed cavalry, with the rest being transferred to other roles. As a result, on 1 March 1922, the regiment was one of eight converted and reduced to 7th (Northamptonshire) Armoured Car Company, Tank Corps. In 1922, it was renumbered as 25th (Northamptonshire Yeomanry) Armoured Car Company, Tank Corps, in October 1923 as 25th (Northamptonshire Yeomanry) Armoured Car Company, Royal Tank Corps, and in April 1939 it was transferred to the Royal Armoured Corps. In November 1938, the formation of a Mechanised Cavalry Brigade (TA) was announced, to comprise three Cavalry Light Tank Regiments. The Northamptonshire Yeomanry was selected to form part of this Brigade and ordered to expand to full Regimental status. By early 1939, Regimental Headquarters and \\"A\\" Squadron were based at Northampton, with \\"B\\" Squadron at Daventry and \\"C\\" Squadron at Brackley. This expansion coincided with the decision to increase the Territorial Army by forming duplicates of existing TA units. By 1939, it had become clear that a new European war was likely to break out, and the doubling of the Territorial Army was authorised, with each unit forming a duplicate. As a result of this move, the Northamptonshire Yeomanry was divided in May 1939 to form two Cavalry Light Tank Regiments: :1st Northamptonshire Yeomanry (TA) - Regimental Headquarters and \\"A\\" Sqn at Northampton, \\"B\\" Sqn at Daventry and \\"C\\" Sqn at Brackley. :2nd Northamptonshire Yeomanry (TA) - Regimental Headquarters and \\"A\\" Sqn at Northampton, \\"B\\" and \\"C\\" Sqns at Kettering. Both Regiments formed part of 20th Light Armoured Brigade (TA) and were mobilised on 1 September 1939. A nominal 4th NY was formed later. =Second World War=  1st Northamptonshire Yeomanry Sherman of 33 Armoured Operation Charnwood Crew from the Northamptonshire Yeomanry eating rations during Operation Totalize In 1944, as a part of the 33rd Armoured Brigade, the unit participated in the Invasion of Normandy, landing on Gold Beach in Normandy on 6 June. The brigade also included the 1st East Riding of Yorkshire Yeomanry and the 144 Regiment RAC. The Brigade's role was to support any infantry who were in need of armour support, therefore it rarely fought as one entity. One of the occasions when the Brigade did undertake an operation on its own was at Le Mesnil-Patry, Rots on 11 June 1944. Further battles they were involved in were around Caen, including Operation Charnwood on 7 July, the battle to capture Caen. On 16 July 1944, it was involved in Operation Pomegranate, where it come under the command of the 59th (Staffordshire) Infantry Division. On 8 August 1944, it was involved in Operation Totalize, a planned breakout from the Caen Salient. It was during Operation Totalize that Joe Ekins, a Sherman Tank gunner of the Northamptonshire Yeomanry, gained recognition for killing the renowned German tank commander, Michael Wittmann, the 4th top scoring tank ace in history, near St. Aignan de Cramesnil, France.After the battle, Issue 48, Pg 50Tout, Fine Night For TanksTout, Fine By Tank D to VE DayReid, Pg 424 Lord Boardman letter to Radley-Walters, 13 June 1999Hart, Pg 52-69 The regiment was briefly attached to the 51st (Highland) Division for the actions around the Battle of the Bulge. The regiment was re-formed and re-equipped with LVT 4 Buffalo amphibious armoured fighting vehicles for the Rhine crossing and was placed under the command of the 79th Armoured Division.  2nd Northamptonshire Yeomanry After leaving the 20th Armoured Brigade in 1943, the 2nd Northamptonshire Yeomanry was converted to an Armoured Reconnaissance Regiment and assigned to the 11th Armoured Division. The regiment landed in Normandy in June 1944. In August, it was disbanded and its members were drafted to other regiments.  4th Northamptonshire Yeomanry The 4th \\"regiment\\" was formed as a deception unit. It constructed and moved dummy tanks in order to deceive the enemy as to the disposition and strength of British armour. =Post-War= The 1st and 2nd Northamptonshire Yeomanry (TA) were both demobilised by 1946 and for a short period remained in a state of suspended animation. Then, on 1 January 1947, the TA was reconstituted, the 1st and 2nd Northamptonshire Yeomanry were amalgamated and re-formed as The Northamptonshire Yeomanry, RAC (TA). Reorganisations of the TA in 1956 resulted in the Regiment being reduced to a single squadron as \\"D\\" (Northamptonshire Yeomanry) Squadron, part of the Inns of Court Regiment, RAC (TA). This state of affairs lasted until April 1961, when \\"D\\" Squadron was transferred to the Corps of Royal Engineers and reorganised to form 250th (Northamptonshire Yeomanry) Independent Field Squadron, RE (TA). When the TA was reorganised into the Territorial & Army Volunteer Reserve (T&AVR;) in April 1967, the Northamptonshire Yeomanry formed a successor unit as \\"A\\" (Northamptonshire Yeomanry) Company, The Northamptonshire Regiment Territorials. It continued the traditions of the old Regiment until 1969, when the Northamptonshire Yeomanry was reduced to a cadre. In 1971, the cadre was reconstituted as part of the Royal Anglian Regiment and the Northamptonshire Yeomanry lineage discontinued. Uniform and insignia Upon establishment in February 1902 the regiment was issued with the new khaki uniform then being introduced as service dress for the British Army as a whole. The regimental distinctions for the Northamptonshire Yeomanry included pale blue (\\"cornflower\\") facings and piping, plus a cap and collar badge comprising a galloping white horse. This insignia had been part of that worn by the earlier Northamptonshire Yeomanry in the 1830-45 period.R.G. Harris, plate 18, \\"50 Years of Yeomanry Uniforms\\" Frederick Muller Ltd, London 1972 By 1905 a more elaborate dark blue dragoon style uniform with plumed white-metal helmet had been adopted for officers as review order. Braiding on the tunic was silver, as were the shoulder and waist belts. The rank and file wore simpler blue patrols for parade and walking-out dress. All ranks retained the cornflower blue for facings.

It was the home of industrial tycoon James Jennings McComb, who supported Masters financially in its early years when his daughters attended. The house's octagonal library was the first section built. It had been attached to McComb's previous home, but he had felt it deserved a house more in keeping with its style and so had architect Albert Buchman design Estherwood built around it.Albert Buchman is better known as a partner in the New York architectural firm Buchman & Fox. The interior features lavish decoration and detail, with generous use of marble and gold leaf. As the only significant ch√¢teauesque building in Westchester County, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) in 1979 as Estherwood and Carriage House. Buildings The Estherwood NRHP listing recognizes both the mansion and its carriage house as contributing resources. Both are located on a 10-acre (4 ha) parcel just east of the main Masters buildings. =Mansion exterior= The house is three and a half stories high, with a varying number of bays on each of its sides. It is faced in white pressed brick with granite trim and terra-cotta detailing. Its roof is black and red ceramic tile, with copper cresting and stone filials, from which four red brick chimneys rise. A copper-clad cupola caps the east facade's tower. The porte-coch√®re on the west facade, the house's main entrance, is supported by granite piers and Doric order columns. It has a Guastavino tile ceiling to match the one on the veranda that encircles the rest of the house. The irregular fenestration includes fifteen dormer windows and a second-story oriel window. =Mansion interior= From the entrance, there is a vestibule with mosaic flooring, marble baseboards, classical molding and bronze light fixtures. It leads to 65-foot-long (20 m) Great Hall that rises two stories to a coffered ceiling and skylights. A divided staircase of pink marble rises to a gallery that overlooks the hall. The balcony is supported by Ionic columns on high plinths. The hall also features a green marble fireplace with limestone trim. The oak parquet floor has a carved Greek key-patterned border repeated on the underside of the gallery. Six rooms are located off the Great Hall, also with lavish decoration. The dining room has dark oak walls with carved Northern European motifs such as boars' and rams' heads, broken by copper and bronze medieval sconces. Built-in service units are supported by caryatids. The north wall is broken by the fireplace, with a mosaic wall and surround. The adjacent plaster wall is painted Pompeii red. The shallow vaulted ceiling is, like that of the Great Hall, coffered. The Music Room ‚Äì known as the \\"Red Room\\" ‚Äì features an alcove flanked by red marble columns and pilasters, both with capitals highlighted in gold leaf. Adamesque swags and garlands, also highlighted in gold, are carved into the wall and ceiling along with musical motifs such as lyres, horns and Pan flutes. These motifs recur in the stained glass window transoms. The south wall is of mahogany with brass trim; it features the Music Room's fireplace, flanked by carved Corinthian pilasters. The Reception Room features intricately patterned plaster walls and ceilings. Two of its windows have gold-stained panels, and an original crystal chandelier still hangs. The drawing room at the house's northwest corner features scrolled brackets and marble Composite columns on high plinths. Its marble fireplace has wood surrounds. The large octagonal library has a central octagonal stained-glass skylight. Stained glass, with a rich floral motif, is also found in the transoms of the two large windows in the north wall. Other ornament includes the plaster molding with gold leaf. The shelving is made of dark Honduran mahogany. Of the six major rooms on the main floor, the Billiards Room is the least decorated, with oak wainscoting and eared windows and doors. The plaster ceiling likewise has a simple molding and a central medallion. Upstairs, the house has been remodeled somewhat by the school, but the bird's-eye maple and golden oak woodwork have been retained, as well as the frosted glass closet-door panels and sliding doors off the gallery. The attic also features its original arched doorways, water tanks, and unusual floor-to-ceiling diagonal braces in the center. This fine mansion is currently being used as teacher housing for The Masters School. Because of this some of the rooms have been connected and furnished so that it can accommodate their needs. Estherwood houses a Steinway and Sons piano that is often used for student recitals and performances. =Carriage house= The carriage house is located to the east of the main house, downhill from it. It was built to take advantage of the slope, in a massed Queen Anne style with Stick-style porte- coch√©re. Its interior features wrought-iron columnar supports and sliding doors between every space. History Ohio native James Jennings McComb's wealth came from his invention of the ties that secured cotton as it emerged from balers. In the 1860s he came to Dobbs Ferry, where he sent his three daughters to the Misses' Masters School, named for its founding sisters in 1877. He bought the current property and eventually moved his family to the small Park Cottage (still standing) near the school's Clinton Avenue location to shorten his daughters' walk to school. The octagonal library was first built as an addition to Park Cottage, to complement an octagonal library desk McComb had bought in Europe. He was soon dissatisfied with how poorly the new room integrated with the rest of the house, and hired the New York firm of Buchman & Deisler to design a new house connected to the library that would better match it. McComb and his family lived in Estherwood from its completion in 1895 to his death in 1901. He had continued to acquire nearby property and rent it to the school, and in 1910 the school bought it all, including Estherwood and the carriage house, from his heirs. It has made few changes to the building, primarily adding an elevator in 1949. Estherwood was used as a dormitory for many years; today its upper floors serve as faculty apartments and the main floor is used for special events and school functions. Aesthetics Estherwood is a rare residential commission for Albert Buchman, better known for commercial and institutional structures such as the New York World Tower and the Student Building at Barnard College. He brought to the commission a breadth of architectural knowledge and an awareness of the ostentatious tastes of the new rich of the Gilded Age. In its lavish use of materials and elements that would be characterized as conspicuous consumption, Estherwood has been compared to Richard Morris Hunt's The Breakers ‚Äì the Vanderbilt family summer home in Newport, Rhode Island ‚Äì that had been completed only three years before, attracting much notice as the most expensive house ever built at that time.

It lies 2 miles west of the capital city, Cardiff and 7 miles from its city centre. St. Nicholas is also the highest altitude village in the Vale of Glamorgan. The population was 417 in 2011.https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/reports/localarea?compare=W37000097 It is in the community of St Nicholas and Bonvilston.  Amenities & History  The A48 road divides the village in half, with a parish church and primary school north of it and housing south of it. However there are no shops or pubs in the village, the nearest being in Bonvilston or Culverhouse Cross. The A4226 (Five Mile Lane) connects it to nearby Barry from the A48. The village lacks a pub and in 2017 the Church Hall was sold. On October 6, 2016, a controversial planning application by Redrow Homes was granted, adding 100 dwellings to the village.

Sheffer (August 7, 1918 ‚Äì July 14, 2002) was an American photographer and teacher, born in Youngsville, Pennsylvania. He moved to Milwaukee, Wisconsin in 1945 to work at the studio of John Platz, Milwaukee's main society photographer. When Platz retired, Sheffer inherited his clientele and was able to establish his own \\"look\\" and very successful portrait studio by 1953. He also taught advanced portraiture at the Layton School of Art from 1952 to 1970.James Auer and Fanny White. \\"Photographer Sheffer helped others to open eyes\\", Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, July 15, 2002, sec. B1-2.  Early career  After attending Houghton College, where he studied history with plans to be a lawyer, Sheffer returned to his hometown of Youngsville, Pennsylvania to teach high school history. He often lectured against war in his class room as World War II escalated. Working for the college year book at Houghton College exposed him to photography and lead him to leave teaching to work as a photographer for a department store in Pittsburgh. He later answered a newspaper ad for a photographer in Wisconsin because he admired the work of Wisconsin architect Frank Lloyd Wright and respected that Capital punishment in Wisconsin was abolished in 1853. He moved to Milwaukee in 1945 without \\"knowing a soul\\"Walter Sheffer lecture, Milwaukee Institute of Art & Design, April 8, 1993 to work for the prominent society portraitist John Platz. Inspired by the artistic achievements of Yousuf Karsh, Julia Margaret Cameron, Henri Cartier-Bresson, and Emily Dickinson, Sheffer approached portraiture in a poetic and artistic manner working to get close in order to isolate the subject. Using a handheld 35 mm camera, natural side lighting and dramatic darkroom techniques, the portraits he generated out of his own Jefferson Street studio were known as having the \\"Sheffer look\\". His portraits of Milwaukee's mid-century social elite, artists and architecture earned him the title \\"Photographer of Photographers\\" from the Wisconsin Professional Photographers Association in 1955. His clients included actor Jimmy Stewart, comedian Tallulah Bankhead, and politician Joseph McCarthy who he photographed for Life (magazine). He created the \\"Portraits of Men\\" series in the mid-1950s for DuPont, a manufacturer of photographic film and paper, which was destroyed in a fire at his studio.Walter Sheffer lecture, Milwaukee Institute of Art & Design, April 8, 1993. He was president of the Milwaukee Photo Pictorialists and the \\"Darlot Club\\" which he once described as the \\"self-appointed ten best photographers in Wisconsin.\\" The groups favored pictorial style soft focus lenses, and deep shadows in prints. He photographed theater productions extensively for Marquette University from 1955-1968 where many of his works are preserved in a photographic archive.Marquette University, http://www.marquette.edu/library/collections/archives/projects/players/shefferportrait.html Several of his portraits are also held in the collection of the Milwaukee Art Museum. Sheffer photographed Victorian building facades and architectural fragments for the Heritage Milwaukee: The Esthetics of the City exhibition organized by and exhibited at the Milwaukee Art Center April 2-May 10, 1964. Director Tracy Atkinson wrote of Sheffer, \\"A city is fortunate to have a chronicler with so perceptive an eye. A long-time Milwaukee resident, Sheffer is among that small group of people in love with the face of the city, and he is, in addition, an artist acutely sensitive to its many moods and its slightest changes of expression.\\"Tracy Atkinson and Joy Gross Berman. \\"Heritage-Milwaukee\\" (Arrow Press, Milwaukee, March 1964) p. 2. Among his most notable students at the Layton School of Art, where he taught from 1952‚Äì1970, was photographer/film maker Larry Clark who often named Sheffer as an early artistic influence and once described him as \\"the society photographer in town, but he was very hip.\\"Eleanor Lewis, Darkroom (New York: Lustrum Press, 1944) p. 44.  Late career  After years of decreased activity due to personal strife in the 1970s and early 1980s, Sheffer gained national attention in the mid-1980s for his \\"Faces of Aging\\" photographic series. Thirty-five dramatic black-and-white portraits of his fellow residents at the River Hills East Health Care Center on Milwaukee's east side became an inspiring, travelling exhibition. The display travelled from Milwaukee to Newport Beach, San Diego, Chicago, Washington DC and Seattle. Together with Milwaukee artist Sue Bartfield, who worked with him on the project, he was honored in 1985 by the National Council on Aging in Washington D.C. for this work.American Medical Services, Inc., 1985 Annual Report (Milwaukee, Wisconsin), p. 22-23. Sheffer remained engaged with art, music, poetry and ideas throughout his life. He often attended gallery and museum openings and presented lectures on his life's work at Milwaukee Institute of Art and Design where he once told students: \\"Photography will change your life. After you photograph, you notice the light and it exposes you to beauty.\\" His circle of friends gathered daily at the Brady Street Pharmacy in Milwaukee to discuss art and recent events. Former Milwaukee Art Museum photography curator Tom Bamberger described Sheffer as \\"the center of intellectual life\\" in Milwaukee. Sheffer continued to photograph friends and maintained a flower garden on the roof top of Christopher Street East Health Care Center until his death.

History The station was opened by the Lancashire, Derbyshire and East Coast Railway on its Beighton Branch in March 1897 as \\"Clown\\". It was closed to regular timetabled passenger traffic in September 1939 although Summer Weekend excursions continued until 1964. At least one fine photograph of such a train for Skegness appears in print. Whilst the above-tracks station building was unique on the LD&ECR; the Stationmaster's House was styled in the company's distinctive architecture. The station was close to the station of the Midland Railway (MR), which was about 40 yards to the north on a parallel track.Both Clowne stations on PictureThePast website Both the MR line through Clowne and Barlborough station and the LD&ECR; line through Clowne South continued westwards under adjacent road bridges then through deep cuttings, which ran parallel for several hundred yards. The MR line then went downhill and the LD&ECR; went uphill, enabling it to swing northwest and cross the Midland line near the branch to Barlborough Colliery. After this it dropped steeply to the Rother valley via Spinkhill Tunnel. The line through Clowne South was closed to all traffic on 9 January 1967 when a new connection to what is now the Robin Hood Line was opened south of Creswell. This also allowed the line to be severed near Barlborough in connection with the northern extension of the M1 motorway. All tracks through the station were subsequently lifted. This change is shown in the route diagrams associated with the Beighton Branch article. Clowne South's booking hall was substantial and stood on top of the bridge straddling the two tracks, with ramps down to the two platforms.Clowne South between 1939 and 1967 The station had a substantial goods shed.Clowne South goods shed (A)Clowne South goods shed (B) The two lines at Clowne each had sidings, which were interconnected, but the connection was not used for through trains. Former passenger services There never was a Sunday service from Clowne South. Services started with a stutter. On 8 March 1897 services began southwards to Langwith Junction (later renamed Shirebrook North) only. Creswell and Welbeck station was not yet open, nor were tracks to the north. The line was extended to Spinkhill (\\"Spink Hill\\" in LD&ECR; terms) and Upperthorpe and Killamarsh on 1 October 1898. The through lines north of Killamarsh to Sheffield (later renamed \\"Sheffield Midland\\") finally opened on 30 May 1900, allowing the core stopping service which continued until the outbreak of WW2. By 1922 the service had settled down to three trains a day, calling at all stations from Sheffield (later Sheffield Midland) to Mansfield via Catcliffe, Clowne South, Langwith Junction and Shirebrook (later renamed Shirebrook West, now plain \\"Shirebrook\\" on the Robin Hood Line). There was a late evening extra southbound on Saturdays and an early afternoon extra northbound to match. There was also a late evening train from Langwith Junction on Saturdays which terminated at Clowne South.Bradshaw, August 1939 p903 Other services Local passenger services and local goods were very small beer compared with the other services over the line, i.e.: * Summer holiday traffic and excursions, e.g. to football matches * Special trains, e.g. for railway enthusiasts * alternative routing to relieve congestion * diversions, and * coal. Only the first needed to call at Clowne South, the others needed the tracks through it. Summer holiday traffic was big business until it was hit from three sides by the rise of the car, by the package holiday revolution and by Beeching, who deemed the whole exercise financial nonsense. The traditional Summer Holiday excursion ‚Äì \\"Wakes Week Specials\\" in some parts of the country ‚Äì was decimated in the early 1960s, both stations at Clowne being prime examples. An early 1960s Working Timetable shows weekend trains through Clowne South between Manchester Central and Skegness and between Manchester Central and Yarmouth Vauxhall.Summer 1964 Working TimetableASummer 1964 Working TimetableB \\"Excursions\\" were wide-ranging; they could be for a day at the seaside, for a football match, for sightseeing such as to York or just cheap tickets on service trains to drum up custom. This last was impossible after the station closed to normal traffic, but an example of an \\"excursion\\" was a train in 1957 to Sheffield via Clowne South. The line from Killamarsh South Junction through Clowne South to Langwith Junction then through Shirebrook South to Kirkby South Junction acted as a loop line to the GCML, because it connected with it at both ends. Both lines had significant gradients north of Nottingham, so the line through Clowne relieved a potential bottleneck, especially for freight. As freight traffic fell dramatically from the mid-1950s less and less congestion needed to be relieved. The GCML was closed north of Nottingham in September 1966, leaving nothing at all to relieve. Before that the line had a last hurrah when a sleeping car service from Marylebone to Glasgow was routed through Clowne South from 1962 to 1964. The line through Clowne South was useful for diversions in times of disruption such as essential trackwork. In the days before widespread \\"replacement bus services\\" two routes in particular benefitted from this, the GCML and the line from Lincoln to Sheffield via Retford. The history of GCML diversions matched that of GCML relief - the traffic vanished. The Lincoln to Sheffield line is still active today, but it carries almost no long distance freight and no long-distance passenger traffic. Up to the early 1960s \\"The Boaty\\" - the daily to boat train - was an occasional sight trundling along the LDECR through Warsop, Shirebrook North and Clowne South, regaining the route into Sheffield Victoria at Killamarsh. In essence there became less and less traffic to divert. A number of railway enthusiasts' special trains ran through Clowne South in its declining years, driven by a mixture of rising affluence and awareness of things passing. One such is recorded on film, though only the northern approach to Cliff Hill at Clowne can be seen. This left the staple of the LD&ECR; \\\\- coal. Coal was king in North East Derbyshire in the first half of the 20th century. His rule passed steadily eastwards as older mines worked out and newer, larger and deeper pits were sunk in Nottinghamshire. These typically sent their output eastwards to power stations on the Trent. This meant that the LD&ECR; line eastwards from Langwith Junction thrived whilst that to the west via Clowne withered. By 1960 the only producing pit on the line through Clowne South was Westthorpe Colliery, Killamarsh. It survived until 1984 but its coal went out northwards. Coal traffic through Clowne South withered but did not die; some coal continued to be sent north westwards. There always had been duplication of lines and services; indeed when the railways were built it was called \\"competition\\". When traffic was high, duplication gave flexibility and allowed traffic to run freely, as summarised above. As traffic withered \\"flexibility\\" became \\"redundancy\\" and \\"over- provision.\\" By the mid-1960s it was realised that the traffic from all sources running through Clowne South and through Elmton and Creswell on what is now the Robin Hood Line could be accommodated entirely on the latter. The connection between the two lines at Shirebrook Junction ran (and still runs) south-to-east, so coal running north westwards from collieries such as Ollerton would end up facing the wrong way on the wrong track at Shirebrook, which, apart from long-standing custom and practice, was why it travelled via Clowne South. The solution adopted was to build a brand new connection between the LD&ECR; and MR lines across fields near Langwith Colliery. This enabled east to northwest traffic to travel through Langwith Junction, head off towards Clowne South, then veer right onto the Robin Hood Line facing north. From then on such trains could turn west or east as appropriate north of Whitwell. The effect was to render the track between the new connection line, through Clowne South to Westthorpe Colliery, Killamarsh redundant, so it was closed and lifted. Clowne South was progressively left high and dry. Modern times The former station booking hall The track through the Clowne and Barlborough station site has been lifted, though the trackbed remains protected and bridges are well maintained. It continues through its cutting to the west as described above. The bridge before the cutting can give the appearance of a tunnel. Foliage means this is no longer viewable from 'The Sidings' skate park near the old Tertiary College, which has been demolished. The positioning of the booking hall over the tracks can readily be seen by walking round the left hand side of the booking hall at street level. This can be done entirely in a public area. The cutting through which the Clowne South line ran has been infilled and lies buried under the road that leads to Tesco and the new roundabout. The old trackbed can be followed south eastwards through Linear Park, before you descend down some steps where there would have been a bridge to carry the tracks towards Markland Grips. For many years after closure of the line the station booking hall was used by a bank. They were eventually replaced by a supplier of bridal wear. At 20 July 2013 the booking hall appeared refurbished and in the hands of a photography firm. The adjacent stationmaster's house has undergone a rescue and revival; having at one time looked derelict, it is a business centre and has externally been sympathetically restored to its typical LDECR appearance.

In 1989, the International Union for Conservation of Nature recommended that \\"The legal status of Deux Bal√©s National Park should be reviewed, in light of agricultural and mining activities which conflict with the integrity of its elephant populations\\".Ryd√©n, Per, The IUCN Sahel Studies 1989 (International Union for Conservation of Nature, 1989) p. 101, Recommendations for Priority Action on Protected Areas By 2001, Burkina Faso was sheltering the largest number of elephants in West Africa, and Deux Bal√©s (together with Baporo Forest) was home to roughly four hundred of them. Physical features The National Park is part of an undulating granitic plain, with outcrops of rock and lateritic plateaux. It lies at an altitude of 235 to 310 metres.Les for√™ts class√©es des Deux Bal√©s at unep-wcmc.org (accessed 23 June 2008) Flora and fauna baobab tree The Park has been called \\"an area of about of bushland and aging baobab trees\\". The vegetation comprises Sudano-Zambezian savanna with a carpet of grasses, and trees such as Anogeissus leiocarpus, Isoberlinia doka and Terminalia laxiflora. There is gallery forest on the riverbanks. Mammals include hippopotamus Hippopotamus amphibius, buffalo Syncerus caffer, elephant Loxodonta africana, antelopes and for the reptiles the crocodile Crocodylus sp., although the diversity of fauna has been reported as being reduced. In Antelopes: Global Survey And Regional Action Plans (1990), Rod East stated the view that the long-term survival of Burkina Faso's antelope populations would depend on developing rational wildlife utilization schemes in areas such as Deux Bal√©s, recognizing the importance of bushmeat, and that giving legal protection to the antelope there would achieve little without other improvements in management.East, Rod, Antelopes: Global Survey And Regional Action Plans: Part 3, West and Central Africa (IUCN/SSC Specialist Antelope Group, 1990), p. 65 The forests lying along some one hundred kilometres of the banks of the Black Volta River are protected within the Deux Bal√©s.Thieme, Michele L., & Robin Abell, Freshwater Ecoregions of Africa and Madagascar: A Conservation Assessment (Island Press, 2005) p. 328.

Mancari, 417 U.S. 535 (1974), was a United States legal case about the constitutionality, under the Fifth Amendment, of hiring preferences given to Indians within the Bureau of Indian Affairs. The Supreme Court of the United States held that the hiring preferences given by the United States Congress does not violate the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.  Background  The appellees were a group of non-Indian employees of the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA). The Appellees brought this action claiming that the employment preference for qualified Indians in the BIA provided by the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934 also known as the Wheeler-Howard Act, 48 Stat. 984, contravened the anti-discrimination provisions of the Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972 and deprived them of property rights without due process of law in violation of the Fifth Amendment. The District Court held that the Indian preference was implicitly repealed by section 11 of the 1972 Act, which prohibited racial discrimination in most federal employment. The court enjoined appellant federal officials from implementing any Indian employment preferences in the BIA. The Supreme Court of the United States granted Certiorari.  Opinion of the Court  The issue in this case was whether the hiring preference policy within the BIA constituted invidious racial discrimination in violation of the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution. The policy of the BIA grants preference at both the hiring and the promotion phase. Given a situation where two individuals are both qualified for a position and one of them is an Indian, the Indian would receive preference over the non-Indian. The District Court found that any hiring preferences previously given by the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934 were implicitly repealed by the Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972, 86 Stat. 111, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of race in most federal employment. The Court found that the purpose of the preference was not racially motivated but motivated by the desire to give \\"Indians a greater participation in their own self-government; to further the Government's trust obligation toward the Indian tribes; and to reduce the negative effect of having non-Indians administer matters that affect Indian tribal life.\\" The goal of the hiring preference was to make the BIA more responsive to the interests of the people it was serving, Indians. The Court found that Congress was well aware that the policy would create disadvantages within the BIA for non-Indians. However, the desire to make the BIA more responsive to Indians as well as creating a program of self-government justifiably outweighed this concern. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the first major piece of legislation to prohibit discrimination in private employment on the basis of race, color, religion, sex or national origin, specifically exempted preferential treatment of Indians. This, the Court said, showed a clear recognition that Indians had a unique legal status, thus giving this hiring preference more justification. The Court noted that it is a rare occasion when Congress will implicitly repeal an action, and that typically Congress must specifically do so. The Court went on to find several reasons that Congress did not intend to repeal the hiring preferences for Indians within the BIA. *First: The exemptions of Indians from the 1964 Civil Rights Act indicated a longstanding policy to give unique legal status to Indians concerning employment on or near the reservation. *Second: Only three months after Congress enacted the 1972 amendments it also enacted two new Indian preference laws. The Court thought it unlikely for the same Congress to take away an Indian preference and subsequently create two more. *Third: Preferences given to Indians have, for many years, been treated as exceptions to Executive Orders forbidding Government Employment discrimination. The 1972 amendments simply codified existing anti-discrimination provisions, and there is no reason to believe that Congress intended to get rid of these preferences that had previously co-existed with broad anti-discrimination provisions in Executive Orders. *Fourth: Repeals by implication are not favored. There is no indication in the legislative history that Congress intended to repeal the preferences previously given to Indians. The court found that the only occasion where repeal by implication is necessary is where two statutes are irreconcilable. This is not the case here. When the court turned to the due process claim it found: The hiring preference given here was not \\"racial discrimination\\" nor was it even a \\"racial\\" preference. The court compared it to the requirement of a Senator being from the state that she represents, or a city council member being required to reside in the area he represents. The Court said, \\"The preference, as applied, is granted to Indians not as a discrete racial group, but rather, as members of quasi-sovereign tribal entities whose lives and activities are governed by the BIA in a unique fashion.\\" Saying also, \\"the BIA is truly sui generis.\\" The Court also noted that this preference was reasonably and directly related to a legitimate nonracially based goal, thus preventing it from violating the Constitution.

Devereaux Octagon House is an historic octagonal house located at 66425 Eight Mile Road in Northfield Township, Washtenaw County, Michigan. The house is one of only three extant octagonal houses in Washtenaw County, and remains in excellent and near original condition. It was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2003. History This plot of land was originally owned by David F. and Caroline M. Crandal, who constructed a log cabin on the premises. In 1856, the land was purchased by Nathan and Eunice Devereaux; the couple settled into the already extant cabin. At some point in the 1850s, Nathan Bartlet Devereaux travelled to Ann Arbor to attend a lecture by Orson Squire Fowler, the leading proponent of octagonal houses. Inspired, Devereaux purchased a copy of Fowler's book, \\"A Home for All; or the Gravel Wall and Octagon Mode of Building. New, Cheap, Convenient, Superior and Adapted to Rich and Poor.\\" In 1864, Devereaux put Fowler's ideas to use and built this house, doing much of the work himself. The resulting building is not a copy of Fowler's plans, but rather Devereaux's own interpretation of Fowler's ideas. Nathan Bartlet Devereaux died in 1897 and passed the house along to his son John Wilson Devereaux. Nathan Devereaux's grandson John Francis Devereaux lived in the house until 1997. As of 2006, it was still being occupied by descendants of Nathan Bartlet Devereaux. Description The Devereaux house is a -story, octagonal frame structure with a hipped roof surmounted with an octagonal cupola. The house sits on a fieldstone foundation, and is symmetrically shaped with eight equal sides. A small utility room is attached to the rear of the structure. The house is clad with white asbestos siding and asphalt shingles on the roof, and there is little ornamentation. The basement level is of post-and-beam construction, while the upper sections of the house is of balloon-frame construction. The front door is slightly askew from the road, through a side of the octagon sited diagonally. The entry is Greek Revival in style with paired thin pilasters on either side of the door, and flanking sidelights above simple paneled aprons. A broad frieze and projecting classical cornice are above the door. The adjacent octagon sides are arranged symmetrically around the entry side, with two tall windows on the lower level and much smaller upper story windows. Interior rooms are generally rectangular in shape, with triangular closet space. The first floor has a kitchen, bedroom, and parlor. Stairs to the second floor arise from the kitchen, and end in a central hall, through which three bedrooms can be accessed. A ladder goes up to the cupola.

The crime remained unsolved until 2001, when Sydney motor industry finance Business Manager, Wayne Butler, was found guilty. It was the first murder in Australia to be solved using DNA profiling. The prosecution relied heavily on DNA evidence and it became a case study for the use of the technique in court. Murder Dinghy Bay on Brampton Island, where police found Tasha Douty's body.Tasha Douty was working as a waitress at the resort on Brampton Island in the summer of 1983. On 31 August, she took the ferry to the nearby town of Mackay for a dental appointment and spent the night there. The following day, she travelled back to the island. Police began searching for Douty when she failed to show up for work on 2 September. It is known that Douty went straight from the ferry to her room to drop off the things she had bought which included presents for her younger son's upcoming 19th birthday. Taking the new red towel she had just purchased she headed to secluded Dinghy Bay. Butler had been following her but lost her at this time. Unfortunately, he knew her destination and asked a member of staff for directions. It is estimated that she reached the beach at about 10.40 but when the 11 o'clock plane flew in, she was no longer on the beach. She was found in scrub behind the beach, her body covered with the red towel which had blood and semen on it. Douty's clothes and personal possessions, including a handbag, were missing and were never found.. She had been beaten on the head with a stone. Investigation There were no witnesses to the crime and no confession was forthcoming. Police set about interviewing more than 300 guests and visitors on the private island. The Queensland government offered a $30,000 reward for information leading to a conviction, but no-one came forward to claim it. Witnesses on the ferry back from Brampton Island on 1 September reported overhearing an argument between a couple in which a woman complained that she had been left alone for several hours on the island, and the man was heard to say that he did not realise the island was so large. However, the police were unable to identify the couple in question. A breakthrough then came when a man told Queensland police \\"I think I know that man who was having an argument with his wife on the Brampton Island ferry when that woman was murdered. He's my brother Wayne and he lives in Sydney\\". Wayne Butler was originally arrested in 1988 for Douty's murder, but was released because of insufficient evidence. Butler's wife divorced him and in October 1997, went to a police station in Sydney and told officers, \\"My ex-husband has committed a murder. He killed a girl on a beach in Queensland. I couldn't say anything while we were married. Now we're divorced and I want you to know the truth\\". Although Butler had long been a suspect, it was not until DNA testing techniques were advanced enough to establish the probability that the semen stain on the towel was his, that he was charged. TrialConviction= Butler was tried for the murder in 2001. His former wife, Vija Samite Duffey, told the court that on the day of Douty's murder, Butler had been away for four hours. She said that this was not unusual and his behaviour was not different on his return. The court was also told that DNA evidence had confirmed that semen stains on the red towel covering Douty's body came from Butler and that the chances of another person having the same profile were 1 in 23 √ó 1015. Dr Kary Mullis, who won a Nobel Prize for his work on DNA replication, advised the defence throughout the trial, but was not called to testify. The defence suggested that the DNA evidence had been contaminated in the laboratory, but the claim was rebutted by the prosecution after they demonstrated that this was not possible. Butler was not called to give evidence. He was found guilty by the jury after only 90 minutes of discussion, after which Supreme Court Judge Justice John Helman jailed Butler for life without the possibility of release on parole, saying: \\"For this savage crime you will spend the rest of your days in captivity. Parole will always be out of the question\\". =Appeals= On 31 July 2001, Wayne Butler unsuccessfully appealed his conviction. His appeal was based on the grounds that the original verdict was unsafe and unsatisfactory, and that the judge failed to uphold the submission that there was no case to answer. Butler was given a second chance to appeal in 2005, lodging a plea for pardon with Governor of Queensland Quentin Bryce. Butler's application was based upon new evidence by forensic scientist and blood group specialist Professor Barry Boettcher, who said, \\"I can't say Wayne Butler is innocent. All I can say is that the laboratory results are wrong.\\" A hearing for the second appeal was due in early 2007.. The appeal was eventually heard by the Court of Appeal in 2009, and it was dismissed on 1 May 2009. Justice Patrick Keane did not regard Professor Boettcher's views as apt to cast doubt on the integrity or competence of John Tonge Centre staff - \\"There has never been any suggestion that the semen found on the red towel might reasonably be thought not to be that of the killer. I am satisfied there is no reasonable doubt Mr Butler's semen was on the red towel\\". McMurdo P and Holmes agreed..

He was a nephew of renowned ophthalmologist Theodor Leber (1840-1917). Alfred Leber is considered to be the founder of German tropical ophthalmology. He studied at the Berlin Eye Clinic under Julius von Michel (1843-1911). In 1910-11 with parasitologist Stanislaus von Prowazek (1875-1915) of the Hamburg Tropical Institute, he was a member of a scientific expedition to Samoa, where he worked as a private lecturer. It was here that Leber discovered the effects on the eye caused by filarial infections by the parasite Wuchereria bancrofti. In 1912 he worked as a senior physician under Arthur von Hippel (1841-1916) at G√∂ttingen. In 1913-14 he took part in the Medizinisch-demographische Deutsch-Neuguinea-Expedition to German New Guinea with physician Ludwig K√ºlz (1875-1938) and painter Emil Nolde (1867-1956). At the outbreak of World War I, he along with writer Max Dauthendey (1867-1918) were unable to return to Germany, and spent the war years in the neutral Dutch East Indies. At Madang, Java he became a director in a hospital for eye and tropical diseases, and it was in Leber's clinic that Max Dauthendey died from malaria in August, 1918. After the war, Leber was unable to procure a position at the University of G√∂ttingen, so he returned to work in Madang. During World War II he spent much of his time interred at a camp for German prisoners in Dehradun, India, and after his release became head of ophthalmology at the Prince of Wales Hospital in Bhopal. In 1952 he became director of the Institute of Ophthalmology at Aligarh Muslim University in Aligarh.

History The brand was named after John Thompson Street Brown Jr., who together with his half-brother George Garvin Brown, opened a wholesale liquor business that later became the Brown-Forman corporation. The brand was originally produced by J.T.S. Brown and Sons in 1855, and ownership of the brand eventually devolved to Heaven Hill, a company founded in 1935. Prior to its destruction by fire in 1996, Heaven Hill had its distillery in Bardstown. After the fire, distilling capacity in the Louisville area was temporarily made available as a goodwill gesture by the Brown-Forman corporation, and Fortune Brands also assisted with some capacity at its Jim Beam distillery. Heaven Hill subsequently opened a distillery called the Bernheim distillery in Louisville (very close to Brown- Forman's distillery), where Heaven Hill's distilling has been conducted since then.

Scenic mountains enclose the village on two sides while a road runs between these mountain ranges. Village children are interested in their education and the government has built two schools, one for boys and the other for girls. In addition to government assistance, Non- governmental organizations (NGOs) and other foreign organizations such as World Vision have contributed to local agricultural and recreational facilities. Every evening and especially on Fridays, many people come from the nearby city to relax and enjoy the fresh air of the village while it is also a popular spot for visitors from overseas to have picnics. Works carried out by the people of the village in conjunction with NGOs include a large garden with different kinds of fruit located in Chap Ghul (⁄ÜŸæ ÿ∫ŸàŸÑ) (\\"left hole or valley\\") and a mountain-based pistachio orchard on the property of local villager Moula Bick (ŸÖŸàŸÑÿßÿ®€å⁄© ), who intends to carry out many other useful projects to improve the welfare and interests of the people of Badghis.

The Millennium line includes several innovative safety features including a positive firing pin block as well as the \\"Taurus Safety Latch\\", a transfer bar safety which prevents firing of the pistol unless the trigger is pulled.

The 1st series featured double-action only triggers and a 10-round magazine capacity. The 2nd series resulted from a complete redesign of the 1st, but retaining the double- action only trigger system. The 2nd series also introduced the 'Taurus Security System' (TSS), the Taurus version of an Integrated firearm locking safety system, as well as the enhancements Taurus categorizes as the Millennium ‚ÄòPro‚Äô package. The 3rd series added single/double-action triggers on several models in lieu of the double-action only of the first two series.

Pro counterparts have now been released for nearly all of the original models. Some features of the Pro line include optional increased magazine capacities, larger and easier to operate controls, a single-action/double-action trigger mechanism on some models with reduced trigger travel and an improved smoother and lighter trigger pull, an enhanced frame, and an improved more ergonometric grip design. Key to the grip upgrade are recesses which Taurus call 'Memory pads', intended to promote a consistent shooting grip from shot to shot. Other Pro improvements include the contrast enhanced Heinie ‚ÄòStraight-8‚Äô sighting system, as well as optional night sights, a loaded chamber indicator which can be felt as well as seen, and a feature labeled 'posi-traction' which consists of an alteration to the number and layout of the slide serrations resulting in an improved gripping surface.\\"Millennium Pro 111 9mm Pistol in Blue Steel\\", Taurus USA Web site ‚Äì product details section.

Model designations Taurus Millennium line model designations consist of 3 digits followed by 1 to 3 characters, which in turn may be followed by an optional third sequence of a dash and 2 digits. The leading three numerals indicate the model's cartridge chambering, for example, number 132 represents .32 ACP chambering, 138 corresponds to .380 ACP, 111 signifies 9 mm Parabellum models, 140 denotes the .40 S & W offering, and 145 indicates .45 ACP chambering. An optional 'P' character trailing the chambering digits indicates whether the pistol is a ‚ÄòPro‚Äô model, and the next 1 or 2 characters denote the slide composition. A ‚ÄòB‚Äô indicates blued steel, the characters ‚ÄôSS‚Äô indicate stainless, and a 'Ti' signifies titanium. The optional final hyphenated number at the end of the model designation (either a -10 or -12) indicates an extended magazine capacity. Thus the model number 111BP-12 would indicate a 9 mm Millennium Pro pistol in blued steel with a 12-round magazine capacity, while model 138SSP-12 designates a .380 stainless steel Millennium Pro with a 12-round capacity.\\"Millennium Pro Pistols\\", Taurus USA Web site ‚Äì products section.

The McDonnell Douglas DC-9 plane PK-GNJ was hijacked on a domestic flight and forced to land at Don Mueang International Airport in Bangkok, Thailand. The hijackers demanded the release of their confederates from Indonesian jails and issued other demands. Three days later, the aircraft was stormed by Indonesian special forces. In the ensuing gunfire, the pilot, one of the Kopassus operatives and three hijackers were killed, while all passengers were rescued. Incident The McDonnell Douglas DC-9, named \\"Woyla\\", was scheduled to take off from Sultan Mahmud Badaruddin II Airport in Palembang, South Sumatra, on Saturday morning, 28 March 1981. The pilot was Captain Herman Rante. The plane departed Kemayoran Airport in Jakarta at 08:00 and was scheduled to arrive at Polonia International Airport in Medan, North Sumatra, at 10:55. After take-off, five men with revolvers stood up from their seats. Some pointed their guns at the pilot, while others patrolled the aisle, monitoring passengers. They demanded the pilot fly to Colombo, Sri Lanka, but the plane did not have enough fuel, so they refueled at Penang International Airport in Bayan Lepas, Malaysia. When they were refueling, the hijackers removed an old lady named Hulda Panjaitan from the plane because she kept crying. Subsequently, the plane took off and landed at Don Mueang Airport in Bangkok. Once there, the hijackers read out their demands. The primary demand was the release of 80 individuals recently imprisoned in Indonesia following the \\"Cicendo Event\\" two weeks earlier, where Islamists attacked a police station in the Cicendo sub-district of Bandung. The hijackers also demanded US$1.5 million, that Adam Malik be suspended from the post of Vice President of Indonesia, and that every Israeli be deported from Indonesia. They also specified the release of one of their comrades at a secret location. The hijackers told Thai police to deliver their demands to the Indonesian government, and threatened to blow up the plane with all the passengers and crew aboard if their demands were not met. The Deputy Commander of the Armed Forces, Admiral Sudomo, immediately ordered the Indonesian Army's Kopassus, to conduct a counter-terrorist raid to rescue the hostages. The commandos borrowed a McDonnell Douglas from Garuda Indonesia that was similar to the hijacked plane for three days to rehearse a raid. The team was armed with new weapons, including Heckler & Koch MP5s. They set off for Thailand using a Garuda Indonesia McDonnell Douglas DC-10. On Monday, 31 March 1981, the team was ready, but the Thai government did not give permission for Indonesian forces to take over the aircraft as it was on Thai territory. In desperation, the Indonesian Strategic Intelligence Chief Benny Moerdani contacted a friend at the CIA station in Bangkok to persuade the Thai government to give permission. The Thai government finally approved the raid with the assistance of the Royal Thai Air Force Security Force Regiment (SFR). On Tuesday, 31 March, the team began the hostage-rescue operation, dividing themselves into three groups: Red Team, Blue Team, and Green Team. The Red and Blue teams were to be at the plane's rear while the Green team was to enter from the back door of the plane. Members of the Thai SFR team were positioned on the tarmac in the event hijackers tried to escape. When the Kopassus team entered the plane, the hijackers were surprised and fired at the team, but three of the hijackers were killed when the team returned fire. One of the Kopassus commandos was shot, probably by his comrades, as was the pilot. The hostages were released unharmed. Two of the hijackers surrendered to Thai commandos, but they were killed by the Kopassus commandos on the plane taking them back to Jakarta. Aftermath Achmad Kirang, the wounded Kopassus team member who was shot in the abdomen, died the following day on 1 April 1981 at Bhumibol Adulyadej Hospital in Bangkok. Captain Herman Rante, the plane's pilot who was shot in the crossfire, also died in Bangkok a few days later. Kirang and Rante's remains were transported from Bangkok to Jakarta, where they were both later interred in Kalibata Heroes Cemetery. The entire Kopassus team, including leader Lieutenant Colonel Sintong Panjaitan, were awarded the Bintang Sakti by the Indonesian government and were promoted. Achmad Kirang was posthumously double promoted.

Plot It is a love story between the prostitute Marina and the unsuccessful artist Alexander, who suffers from a cancer which makes him blind and ill. They are happy for a short period in Italy. Despite Marina's loving care, Alexanders health gets worse and they together commit suicide in the end.  Scandal  It was one of the first German films to break several taboos: nudity, suicide and euthanasia. In the Germany of the 1950s, this caused a lot of negative reactions both by politicians and the Roman Catholic Church. The opposition reached the degree of banning the film and scandalizing it, which paradoxically made it one of the landmarks in the German film history.

He was an Associate Justice of the New Jersey Supreme Court and was the Republican nominee for Governor of New Jersey in 1883. Biography Dixon was born in Liverpool, England on July 6, 1839. His father, also named Jonathan Dixon, came to the United States in 1848 and was followed in 1850 by his family, settling in New Brunswick, New Jersey. He graduated from Rutgers College in 1859 and was admitted to the New Jersey bar in 1862. He moved to Jersey City to practice law in 1865.History of Middlesex County, New Jersey, 1664-1920 (1921). Dixon was associated with New Jersey Supreme Court Justice Gilbert Collins until 1875, when he was appointed to be a Supreme Court Justice by Governor Joseph D. Bedle. He was subsequently reappointed by Governors Ludlow, Green, Griggs, and Murphy.\\"Justice Dixon is Dead\\", The New York Times, May 22, 1906. Accessed June 17, 2008. In February 1880 the socialist leader Joseph Patrick McDonnell, editor of the Labor Standard, was tried for libel after publishing a letter from a brick maker who said of the Clark & Van Blarcom brickyard that the men were overworked and starved, and housed in places no better than pigsties. Dixon presided over the much-publicized trial, earning a reputation for being anti-labor. McDonnell was convicted and sentenced to two months in jail. When he was released on 1 April 1880 he was met by a cheering crowd. Dixon declined to take an active part in politics, and even when New Jersey Republicans nominated him for governor in 1883, he refused to make political speeches, since he felt it would be beneath the dignity of a Supreme Court Justice. McDonnell used the Labor Standard to attack Dixon as anti-labor and anti-union, and threw his support behind Leon Abbett, giving a useful boost to the Democratic candidate. Abbett, also from Jersey City, attacked Dixon for drafting the \\"thieves' charter\\" that deprived the Jersey City Irish of power in 1871. Abbett also criticized Dixon for handing down Supreme Court rulings that were perceived as anti-labor. Abbett defeated Dixon by a margin of 103,856 to 97,047. Biography of Leon Abbet, New Jersey State Library. Dixon continued to serve as Supreme Court Justice until his death. He died in 1906 at his daughter's home in Englewood, New Jersey at the age of 66.

However, more recently, CC has been recommending against the use ported licenses: : As of version 4.0, CC is discouraging ported versions, and has placed a hold on new porting projects following its publication until sometime in 2014. At that point, CC will reevaluate the necessity of porting in the future.  Work  The original, non-localized Creative Commons licenses were written with the US legal system in mind, and the wording of the licenses was sometimes incompatible within the local legislation in countries other than the US, rendering the licenses unenforceable in various jurisdictions. To address this issue, Creative Commons ported the various licenses to bring them into line with local copyright and private law. The porting process involves both translating the licenses into the appropriate languages and legally adapting them to the particular jurisdictions. As of August 2011, the Creative Commons licenses had been ported to over 50 different jurisdictions worldwide. No new ports have been implemented in version 4.0 of the license, which was released on 25 November 2013. Version 4.0 discourages the use of ported versions, and instead acts as a single global license, which can be used without porting.  Country teams  Creative Commons uses country teams inside particular countries to facilitate consultations and discussion with members of the public and key stakeholders in an effort to adapt the licenses to local circumstances, i.e. their jurisdiction. Such country teams usually have a project lead, and may have their own website in addition to their listing on the main Creative Commons website.

The core uses for real estate derivatives are: hedging positions, pre-investing assets and re-allocating a portfolio. The major products within real estate derivatives are: swaps, futures contracts, options (calls and puts) and structured products. Each of these products can use a different real estate index. Further, each property type and region can be used as a reference point for any real estate derivative. ApplicationsSwap= The most basic form of real estate derivative is a swap transaction, in which one investor, or one side, goes long and the other side goes short (finance). An investor would want to execute a swap if they thought that the market, or sector, was likely to appreciate, in which case they would go long. Alternatively, if an investor‚Äôs view was that the market would depreciate from that point, they would go short, or take the other side of that trade. =Options= One can apply options to real estate. A real estate Option is a contract based on a time horizon and an expected property value. It is developed based on financial options contracts and adopted to individual real estate assets. Call With the real estate call option, the property owner can sell an option in exchange for debt-free cash today. Investor, who buys the real estate call option benefits from property price appreciation and price volatility. Put With the real estate put option (selling price decline insurance), the investor can sell an option thus the investor underwrites price decline insurance. The property owner, who buys the option, is protected against price decline of the property. Derivative efficiencies Owning real estate assets is costly, and the transaction costs associated with purchasing commercial real estate can be prohibitive. Typical transaction costs can equal 500 - 800 basis points per transaction. Industry estimates suggest that transaction costs for commercial real estate easily surpass $10‚Äì$12 billion annually. Since the US real estate derivative market is new, the transaction costs are at this point variable. However, based on derivatives in other markets, it is anticipated that the costs will be well below the 500-800 basis points required to invest in actual real estate. Market growth The market for real estate derivatives was long overdue. Real Estate is the only major asset class that only recently developed a derivatives market. According to the Pension Real Estate Association‚Äôs Plan Sponsor Research Report, pension funds allocate approximately 6.0% of their assets to real estate, making it one of the largest investable asset classes, after equities and fixed income. Because of the significant transactions costs involved with investing in real estate, derivatives can improve the efficiency of the market. = USA = The market for US real estate derivatives, while in a nascent stage, made significant progress in 2007. There are now a diverse set of indices and methodologies being used to create and structure real estate derivatives, for both residential and commercial real estate. = UK = In the UK, the market for property derivatives did not begin until 2004. However, since the market‚Äôs inception, the growth has been significant. Through the third quarter of 2007, trades with an outstanding notional value of 7.9 billion pounds have been executed. The U.S. market is still emerging, and has been limited somewhat over the last year by the global credit crunch and uncertain values of mortgage-backed securities. However, the market in the U.S. is now emerging quickly, with over $500 million worth of transactions to date in 2007. = Australia = Taking the AUD 139.5 billion in Australian residential and commercial property sales recorded in 2006, and applying a 1-to-1 derivatives-to-underlying ratio, the potential PD market would be larger than the $89 billion Australian credit derivatives market. A 2-to-1 ratio would make it more active than the $215 billion interest rate options sector, and a 3-to-1 ratio would put it within reach of the $472 billion ASX options industry.

Funny Rap I was followed by Happy New Year (Mandala Works, Taiwan), ROC on Taiwan (Magic Stone, Taiwan), and Hexi de Yewan O A A (Rock Records/Magic Stone, Taiwan). Hexi de Yewan represented a jump from rap music based on Taiwanese society to house music based on aborigines society. Noted as the first mainstream album in Taiwan featuring aboriginal music, each song contains dance music mixed with music sampled from one tribe. Jutoupi's subsequent switch to dance/aboriginal music mixes was not well received by his fan base.
