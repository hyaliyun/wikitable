It is the most prominent of several local private organizations that save dogs from euthanasia by caring for them and finding new families. The program places dogs from animal shelters in the San Francisco Bay Area into foster homes while awaiting adoption. It also treats medical and behavioral problems such as socialization issues, neuters and spays the animals, and provides vaccines, so as to make their animals adoptable. History The organization was founded by Pali Boucher, daughter of a hippie mother and Paul Boucher, a program director of San Francisco radio station KSAN (formerly \\"Jive 95\\"; now 107.7, \\"the Bone\\"). Pali is an HIV victim and former foster child and drug addict whose mother died when she was ten. After being homeless for more than ten years, she adopted an abandoned coonhound puppy from the local dog pound. She named him Leadbelly and lived with him on the street for several more years. After spending six months in jail she then entered the Good Shepherd Gracenter, a women's residential recovery program run by the Roman Catholic order, the Good Shepherd Sisters. She credits the program and her dog with saving her life. In the late 1990s, Boucher began working for Hopalong Animal Rescue, based in Oakland, California. In 2000, while she was a client at the SF/SPCA Animal Hospital, she inspired her veterinarian, Dr. Ilana Strubel, to found Veterinary Street Outreach Services (VET SOS), a Project of the San Francisco Community Clinic Consoritum's Street Outreach Services Program, a private not-for-profit human healthcare agency, where Pali had received care while homeless. VET SOS is mobile clinic that helps homeless people who are unable to care for their pets. In 2001, the year after Leadbelly's death, she started Rocket Dog Rescue and won a Points of Light award for volunteerism. She claims to have rescued 150 dogs in the first year. In 2006, the organization was profiled on Discovery's Animal Planet network in a one-hour documentary, Rocket Dogs. By 2007, the organization had saved approximately 3,000 animals, and was spending $150,000 per year of donated funds on veterinary bills for sick animals. In December 2007, Boucher's home in Bernal Heights burned in a fire, making her homeless once again and killing three dogs, a parrot, and a pigeon for which she was caring. The group has housed most of their dogs in foster homes, and an emergency fund was proposed. In 2014, Rocket Dog Rescue opened its Urban Sanctuary and Adoption Center in East Oakland. In 2017, Boucher and Rocket Dog Rescue were featured in an episode of Cesar Millan's TV series Dog Nation. By 2019, Rocket Dog Rescue had rescued over 10,500 animals and continues to go strong.

Background and education Mears was born in Baltimore, Maryland and attended Baltimore public schools. She received her undergraduate degree in Mathematics at Goucher College, earning a Phi Beta Kappa Key. She received a master's degree from Cornell University in 1924 after completing her thesis on \\"A Special Function of One Variable.\\" She then went on to achieve her doctorate from Cornell in 1927, completing her thesis on the \\"Riesz Summability for Double Series\\" (published in Transactions of the American Mathematical Society in 1928) with thesis advisor Wallie Abraham Hurwitz. Biography on p.412-414 of the Supplementary Material at AMS Career Mears's first job as a college professor was at the Women‚Äôs College of Alabama; she soon left to become an associate professor of mathematics at Pennsylvania State College, and then joined The George Washington University in 1929. At George Washington University, Mears was known for her popularity among both her students and fellow faculty members. She was considered by the university‚Äôs President as \\"one of the greatest teachers of mathematics in the entire country.\\" During her first year at The George Washington University, Mears taught as an assistant professor of Mathematics in the Columbian College of Arts and Sciences. Her office could be found directly on campus at 2033 G Street. At the beginning of her career at GW, Mears was the only woman in the Mathematics department, which included seven other professors. Additionally, it was reported that she was paid substantially less than her male co-workers. Mears earned the title of being a master teacher. According to the criteria set by the Columbian College of Arts and Sciences, Mears earned this title due to her excellent teaching skills, and her contributions in both research and the Mathematics Department. Among the many classes that she taught were Advanced Calculus, Introduction to Analysis, Introduction to Infinite Series, and Fourier Series and Spherical Harmonics. In 1955, George Washington University awarded her an Alumni Citation for twenty-five years of distinguished service. In 1958, the University of California selected her as one of ten female mathematicians to work on a project studying creativity. In 1962, she became a member of an examining committee, which focused on selecting doctoral dissertations in mathematics for the University of Allahabad in India. Mears specialized in the findings of definitions and values assigned to various infinite series of numbers. An \\"infinite series\\" is an endless series of numbers, each succeeding the other that is a certain amount lesser or greater than the proceeding one. An example set of an infinite series includes is 1 + ¬Ω + ¬º etc. in which the definition of the series can be defined as the number two. As a result, Mears created several theorems about these definitions, many of which provided truth for many practicing mathematicians, engineers, chemists, physicists, and astronomers. One of her most popular theorems, called the Norlund Mean can be explained through absolute regularity, the summability of Cauchy products, and inverse properties. Awards Mears' participation in professional, honorary, and civic organizations included a professional membership in the American Math Society, and in the American Math Association. Her various honorary memberships included the Washington Academy of Science, Phi Beta Kappa (1927), Phi Kappa Phi (1927), and Sigma XI (1924). Additionally, she held several fellowships at Cornell University during the years 1925 to 1927. Mears also published several articles and book reviews in leading mathematical journals. Students Mears helped Janos Edvard Hanson and Joseph Blum earn their Ph.D.s from the George Washington University.PhD's Awarded by the Department of Mathematics, The George Washington UniversityJoseph Blum Papers, American University Joseph Blum earned his Ph.D. in 1958 following his completion of his dissertation on Banach Spaces Functionals and Matrix Summability Method. Two years later, Mears would also aid Janos Edvard Hanson in earning his Ph.D. in 1960, after writing his final dissertation on Linear Sequence Spaces, which permit omission and adjunction and have Finite Dimension Modulo Convergence. Legacy Mears was named Professor Emerita of Mathematics in 1965. A professor emeritus or emeritus professor is a title that may be given to a full professor who retires in good standing. According to the American Council on Education it is typically awarded for \\"long and distinguished service\\". She is considered not only one of The George Washington University‚Äôs greatest mathematicians, but also one of the finest and most active mathematicians in the United States of America. Mears died on December 3, 1995. Selected publications References Further reading * *Blum, Joseph. Banach Space Functionals and Matrix Summability Methods.

Most hours begin with world and national news from Fox News Radio. During NFL football season, KNSS-AM-FM carry Kansas City Chiefs broadcasts. History (For a history of the 1240 AM signal, see KFH.) KNSS is one of Kansas' oldest radio stations, signing on the air on May 26, 1922, although it began experimental broadcasts in March of 1922. Its call sign was originally WEAH.Broadcasting Yearbook 1935 page 32 On June 23, 1923, the station was sold to the Wichita Board of Trade. During a period of nearly two years, the Rigby Gray Hotel Company Corporation (operator of the Lassen Hotel) gradually took over the ownership, with the final sale taking place on April 30, 1925. The hotel company changed the call letters to KFH, standing for \\"Kansas' Finest Hotel.\\" At 9:45am, February 14, 1926, the first radio broadcast under the call letters KFH was made. The Wichita Eagle, a local newspaper, purchased 50% of KFH on October 1, 1929. KFH became a Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS) affiliate on October 8, 1929. KFH carried the CBS line up of dramas, comedies, news, sports, soap operas, game shows and big band broadcasts during the \\"Golden Age of Radio.\\" In the 1930s, it began broadcasting on 1300 kilocycles with 1,000 watts. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) authorized an increase in daytime power to 5,000 watts on May 28, 1935. In 1941, with the enactment of the North American Radio Broadcasting Agreement (NARBA), the station switched to its present day frequency of 1330 kHz.Broadcasting Yearbook 1943 page 96 Ownership remained under the control of the hotel company until June 5, 1963, when the FCC approved the transfer of the station license to Aeschlayer & Reynolds of Dallas, Texas. The new owner retained the station for less than five and a half years and sold KFH to Phil and Nancy Kassebaum, operating under the corporate name \\"KFH Radio, Inc.\\" on November 1, 1968. (Nancy Kassebaum was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1978.) On July 1, 1994, the Kassebaums sold it to Pourtales Radio Partnership. Pourtales did not retain ownership very long. The company signed a letter of intent to sell KFH to Triathlon Broadcasting on Friday, March 24, 1995 and completed the sale on June 2, 1995. The station was in turn sold to Entercom on February 23, 2000.Broadcasting & Cable Yearbook 2001 page D-177 KFH carried a talk radio format from the 1990s until 2002, when it shifted most of its political talk shows to 1240 KNSS. KFH added a simulcast on 98.7 FM, displacing smooth jazz KWSJ. The FM station switched its call sign to KFH-FM. On August 30, 2004, the KFH call sign was relocated to AM 1240. On that date, AM 1330 became KNSS. The new call letters reflected the station's news-talk format. The call sign represents both KaNSaS and NewS Station. The station's studios were originally located at North Woodlawn and East 21st in Northeast Wichita. On May 20, 2015, the studios moved to the Ruffin Building at 9111 East Douglas, formerly the Pizza Hut corporate headquarters. KNSS began simulcasting on KNSS-FM 98.7 MHz on October 12, 2016. Prior to then, the 98.7 frequency was KFH-FM, a simulcast of 1240 KFH. KFH-AM-FM were network affiliates of ESPN Radio. 1240 KFH continues as a sports radio station on its own, now with an FM translator station at 97.5 MHz.

His first wife was the daughter of the Reverend William Black, a Methodist minister. Biography John was a successful merchant in Nova Scotia, carrying on part of the family business started by his father and uncle. He was a member of the 13th General Assembly of Nova Scotia for Shelburne, which ran from 1826-1830. He was expelled from the assembly during that session for making allegations about a fellow member and refusing to retract them. His battle with the legislature was carried out to a great degree in the press making him a popular hero and a well known Nova Scotian. A subsequent stand with the Tories during the \\"Brandy Dispute\\" of 1830 made him unpopular enough to make his future attempts at re-election unsuccessful. On April 30, 1835 he married Eliza Ann Mercein, from this marriage there were two issues, a son, Alexander Barry and Mary Mercein Barry. John Alexander Barry was fascinated by different area Indians, which is believed he traded with early in his merchant career, he became popular by his lectures, principally to Halifax audiences, on the customs, artifacts, and chiefs of the Micmac and other North American Indians. His greatest notoriety came by way of an unprecedented divorce suit brought by Eliza Ann Mercein Barry in the 1840s for the custody of her daughter since the court would not have committed her son to her under the law, however she won custody.(Rose, John Carter,Jurisdiction and Procedure in Federal Courts, United States - 1922' - Civil procedure) It is thought that living in Nova Scotia trying to raise four daughters by John's first marriage as well as her own two away from her parents in New York and in light of John's indifference to his family took her daughter and returned to New York. Eliza's father was a Methodist minister in New York. His son, died in early adulthood in Oregon City, Oregon. His daughter, Mary Mercien Barry, married Joseph Ferry Andrews; their son Roger Fuller Mercein Andrews was the chairman of the Mackinac State Park Commission and the Mackinac Island News during the 1940s.

Early postal service Jamaica was the first British colony to establish a post office.Rossiter, Stuart & John Flower. (1986) The Stamp Atlas. London: Macdonald, p. 148. Gabriel Martin was appointed postmaster on 31 October 1671, shortly after British possession of the island was confirmed. Martin carried mail via posthorse between St. Jago and Passage Fort for several years, then disappeared from the record. In the 1680s, sea captain James Wale secured the support of the Earl of Rochester to set up a post office (against the wishes of Jamaican governor Molesworth), but the service seems to have been stillborn, and not until 1705 was a statute (9 Anne) created to legally establish a postal service (in several islands of the West Indies) and allow the postmaster to charge a fee for the delivery of mail. Letters were carried by a packet service until 1711, then the postal service lapsed again until re- established by Governor Nicholas Lawes in 1720. The local planters typically preferred to entrust their letters directly to merchant ship captains, and considered the charging of fees by postmaster Edward Dismore to be tantamount to extortion. Matters came to a head in 1755, when a select committee examined the finances of the postal system, but Dismore continued as postmaster into the 1780s, eventually establishing some two dozen post offices across the island. Stamps begin 1 Penny blue of the first issue, numeral cancel. British stamps were used from 8 May 1858 in Kingston and from November 1858 at other offices. Until 1860, the postal service under the control of Great Britain, despite repeated efforts by Jamaican authorities to take over. Soon afterwards, British stamps were no longer accepted, and De La Rue was commissioned to produce stamps for Jamaica, featuring a laureate profile of Queen Victoria. The first issue consisted of five values ranging from one penny to one shilling, each with a different frame, inscribed \\"JAMAICA POSTAGE\\", and were watermarked with a pineapple design. They were first issued on 23 November 1860. Additional stamps in the series appeared through the end of the century. In 1863 four letter boxes were placed around Kingston. Inland delivery was increased from twice/week to three times per week in 1868. Mail carriage was originally via mule, then via railroad in the 1860s, then back to roads due to difficulties with the trains, not switching back to railroad until the railways were improved in the late 1870s. Jamaica joined the Universal Postal Union on 1 April 1877. In 1887, the Legislative Council resolved to use a common stamp design for both postage and revenue purposes, and in 1889 Jamaica issued three key plate stamps inscribed \\"POSTAGE & REVENUE\\", with the value tablet in a different color. 20th century A 1938 4d stamp of Jamaica. In 1900, Jamaica's first pictorial stamp featured a view of Llandovery Falls. Originally intended as a commemorative stamp marking the adoption of Imperial Penny Postage in 1889, it was too long delayed, and is considered a regular stamp. Originally issued in red, it was redesigned and issued in red&black; the next year. For unknown reasons, Jamaica did not adopt a profile of Edward VII upon his accession. Instead, beginning in 1903, new stamps featured the coat of arms of the colony. Following a special petition in 1910, Edward VII was recognized posthumously on a two-pence gray stamp issued 3 February 1911. Stamps depicting George V were more timely, first appearing in 1912. A pictorial series in 1919 included twelve stamps, ranging from the Jamaica Exhibition of 1891 to various statues and scenery. The series was not commemorative, but was a result of repeated requests by local philatelists to governor Leslie Probyn. The next definitive series was issued for George VI in 1938, with low values being a profile of the king alone, and the higher values including scenes of various local industries. An issue with new scenes and a full-face portrait of George VI marked the granting of self- government in 1944, although it was not issued until August 1945. A set of four stamps with historic scenes marked the 300th anniversary of British control in 1955, followed in 1956 by a series of 16 stamps depicting flora, fauna, and local scenery. Independence A 1956 stamp of Jamaica overprinted for Independence in 1962. Upon independence in 1962, the 1956 stamps were overprinted \\"INDEPENDENCE\\" and \\"1962\\". In 1964, a set of three depicted Miss World Carole Joan Crawford; they were soon followed by a new series of 16 with various designs. Only the one-pound value included a portrait of Queen Elizabeth; from independence on, the Queen was rarely included in designs.

Like other coralroot orchids, the plant takes its name from its coral-shaped rhizomes. It has an erect stem about tall that may be red, pink, purple, or yellow-green to almost white. The leaves lack chlorophyll and are reduced to colourless scales that sheath the stem. The plant also lacks roots, and relies upon parasitism of fungi for sustenance. The stem is topped by a raceme of 15 to 25 orchid flowers. Each flower is an open array of sepals and similar-looking petals that may be pink or yellowish and have darker pink or maroon stripes.

Mne dvadtsat let) is a 1965 drama film directed by Marlen Khutsiev. It is Khutsiev's most famous film and considered a landmark of 1960s Soviet cinema. The film was originally entitled Zastava Iliycha (known in English alternately as Ilyich's Gate or Lenin's Guard), but it was heavily censored upon completion, trimmed to half its original length, retitled and withheld from release until 1965. A restored 3-hour version was released in 1989, and is sometimes referred to by the original title. Synopsis The film follows the recently demobilized Sergei, a young man who returns to his Moscow neighborhood after two years of military service. We see the aspirations and realities of his tightly-knit group of friends, as well as the everyday lives of other Soviet citizens. Cast * Valentin Popov as Sergey Zhuravlyov (as V.

Selyanskaya) * Aleksandr Blinov as Kuzmich (as Sasha Blinov) Style I Am Twenty is notable for its often dramatic camera movements, handheld camerawork and heavy use of location shooting, often incorporating non-actors (including a group of foreign exchange students from Ghana and famous poets, among them Yevgeny Yevtushenko) and centering scenes around non-staged events (a May Day parade, a building demolition, a poetry reading). Filmmakers Andrei Tarkovsky and Andrei Konchalovsky both play small roles in the film, as do Rodion Nakhapetov and Lev Prygunov. The dialogue often overlaps and there are stylized flourishes that echo the early French New Wave, especially Fran√ßois Truffaut's black and white films. The screenplay, co-written by Gennady Shpalikov, originally called for a film running only 90 minutes, but the full version of the film runs for three hours. Production and censorship I Am Twenty began production in 1959, Marlen Khutsiev > Biography during the de-Stalinization period of the Khrushchev thaw, when Soviet society experienced several years of unprecedented freedom of speech. By the time the film was finished, the thaw was waning and the film's openly critical view of Stalinism was deemed unacceptable, as was its portrayal of the lives of everyday Soviet youth worrying about money and jobs and listening to Western music. At a speech in March 1963, Khrushchev personally attacked the film and denounced Khutsiev and his collaborators for \\"[thinking] that young people ought to decide for themselves how to live, without asking their elders for counsel and help.\\"Russia: Marlen Khutsiev's Mne dvadtsat' let (1961).

They had some success with their song \\"Youth of America\\" appearing in the hit film Scream, as well as a contribution to The Last Supper‚Äù soundtrack with a cover of Paul McCartney‚Äôs \\"Jet\\". They were formed by guitarist/singer/songwriter Joey Ammo and drummer Mike Benway and signed to TVT Records in 1995. With two CD albums and two soundtrack contributions they broke up in 1997. History The Boston band was formed in the early 1990s after a chance meeting in a Roslindale, MA bar between Ammo and Benway. They rented a rehearsal studio, began funding some recording projects and started setting up bookings. Eventually they hired local manager Jeff Hudson. Hudson successfully shopped the recordings to contacts at TVT Records in 1995 with their tape ‚ÄúPrincess‚Äù, their contribution to ‚ÄúBoston Rock n' Roll Anthology Vol. 18‚Äù and especially the release of their self-produced, full-length CD, \\"Bliss\\" and soon they had a recording contract. Founding bassist Frank Barrientos left the band, replaced by guitarist/bassist/backing vocalist Jim Dennis. They were joined shortly thereafter by bona fide bassist Joseph F. McCarthy Jr. and Dennis moved from bass to guitar, his forte. The new quartet went on tour in support of a TVT re-vamping of ‚ÄúBliss‚Äù. Hudson was fired as manager and was replaced by the TVT nominee, Camille Barbone. ‚ÄúBliss‚Äù was not as successful as they had hoped. Jim Dennis left amid rising tension in the wake of his expanding creative influence over Birdbrain's sound. Thus Birdbrain returned to being a rock trio. Benway quickly covered backup vocals at a show that weekend at the Rathskellar in Boston, Ammo resurrected his original, jangly, three-piece sound heard on the original demo's, and McCarthy brought a good nature and sharp wit that helped to buoy the band personally through these tough times. Benway had negotiated initial contract support from TVT to start a second album late in 1996. They had a slew of songs ready to choose from and the label poured over $200,000 into the production, well beyond the $30,000 required by the contract. The trio spent weeks in pre-production and recording at the spa-like Long View Farm Studios (MA). They rented a good deal of choice vintage gear, hired producer Tim Patalan and got mixing and post-production work from Jack Joseph Puig at Electric Lady Studios (NY), as well as mastering with Howie Weinberg. This plush treatment was largely due to the intense advocacy of A&R; Tom Sarig (Sarig moved on to a successful national A&R; post the next year.) By February 1997, ‚ÄúLet's Be Nice‚Äù was finished. With a disappointing performance from manager Barbone, and Ammo having problems with illness, and no record distribution in place Benway refused to tour. This disagreement over Benway's management decision created conflict. Barbone began working secretly to secure trademarks for Ammo and to develop a paper trail to create the appearance that Benway had resigned. This business maneuvering ran to artistic matters when Barbone recruited her former client for the tour, metal drummer Lance Cole, who can be seen \\"stick-synching\\" to Benway's tracks in the video for \\"Youth of America\\". The band toured a year later. Cole never recorded with the band, and never truly gelled with Ammo and McCarthy. The ensuing tour was cut short by low morale over Benway‚Äôs banishment and Ammo‚Äôs continuing problems with medical issues, as well as alcohol and drug addiction. Barbone resigned, and TVT dropped the band. Finally things had hit rock bottom and they disbanded in 1997. The band had some success with ‚ÄúLet's Be Nice‚Äù, especially with the single \\"Youth of America\\" which Wes Craven chose to feature in his successful horror film ‚ÄúScream‚Äù and TVT promoted the song as the single and lead track on the soundtrack album. (Sadly, although the song was heard by hundreds of millions worldwide Barbone failed to parlay this into national success for the band. The label had negotiated to have the band's logo included on all print advertising for the movie, but Barbone countermanded this, feeling it was risky.) One year later, the song was used also in the movie Masterminds. ‚ÄúLet's Be Nice‚Äù was nominated for Best Indie Album in the 1997 Boston Music Awards. Barbone attended the ceremony representing another band that had also been nominated. Ammo had been naturally invited. Benway had harangued the organizers to get his ticket. Thus all three of them, Benway, Ammo and Barbone, sat in the audience while Paula Cole, who swept the awards that year, attributed her success to her drummers influence. Years later TVT Records went on to be sold in its entirety to digital media outlet The Orchard. Birdbrain‚Äôs TVT videos ‚ÄúConfession‚Äù and ‚ÄúYouth of America‚Äù can be viewed on YouTube and Yahoo! Music. ‚ÄúBliss‚Äù and ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs Be Nice‚Äù can still be purchased many places on line such as Amazon. Ammo and McCarthy both still keep a low-profile activity in the Boston music scene today. Benway lives a successful personal life.

California Coast University's bulletin states that it \\"does not require formal, on-campus residence or classroom attendance\\" because it is an online-only school accredited by the Distance Education and Training Council. DETC specializes in the accreditation of online-only institutions and is a recognized accrediting body of the Council for Higher Education Accreditation. Wong did receive the engineering degree from California Coast University on 27 August 1984, nearly 21 years before the CCU was accredited by the DTEC in January, 2005; however, before DEAC accreditation, California Coast University had full state approval of all academic programs from the State of California which made the degrees legal and academically legitimate nearly everywhere in the world.

Working for his United States Marine Corps handler Corporal Dustin J. Lee in the Iraq War, he was wounded in an attack that killed Lee, and subsequently awarded an honorary Purple Heart. Military working dog Lee and Lex were stationed in the military police department at Marine Corps Logistics Base Albany, with Lex having deployed to Iraq previously with a different handler. Lee had adopted his previous canine, Doenja, after the dog was retired. They were detached to deploy in late November 2006 as an explosive detection and patrol team for 3rd Reconnaissance Battalion, then part of Regimental Combat Team 6. On March 21, 2007, while at a Forward Operating Base in Iraq, they were hit by a 73 mm SPG-9 rocket attack. Lee was mortally wounded, while Lex sustained shrapnel wounds. Despite his own wounds, Lex refused to leave Lee and had to be dragged away for corpsmen and other medics to attempt treatment. After returning to the United States in April, he fully recovered from his wounds at Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune after a twelve-week rehabilitation. He returned to MCLB Albany on July 6 in a full working capacity, although some shrapnel remained lodged in his back, which veterinarians did not remove to avoid causing permanent damage to his spine. Adoption Lee‚Äôs parents, Jerome and Rachel Lee, appealed to the military to adopt Lex. An online petitionPetition to adopt Lex was created by Lee's family, and the case gained national media attention. Congressman Walter B. Jones of North Carolina's 3rd congressional district (which includes Camp Lejeune) assisted the Lee family with the release and adoption of Lex. Although the United States armed forces do not generally release military working dogs prior to retirement age due to certain requirements (due to ), there existed a provision to existing law that allows for early retirement of dogs under certain situations, created to allow a wounded Air Force dog handler to adopt her partner before retirement in 2005. The legal provision was enacted and Lex was released from active service to be adopted by the Lee family. Headquarters Marine Corps made a formal request to the Air Force working dog program managers at Lackland Air Force Base in November, which was approved on December 6. Lex was released from five years of active service and turned over to the Lee family at a ceremony at MCLB Albany on December 21, 2007, under national media spotlight. He was 8 years old at the time. Afterward, Lex began to visit VA hospitals to comfort wounded veterans and assist in their recovery process. On February 16, 2008, the Military Order of the Purple Heart Chapter #566 presented Lex with a commemorative Purple Heart at a ceremony held at the Air Force Armament Museum at Eglin Air Force Base. On September 24, 2008, the American Kennel Club announced that Lex won the seventh Law Enforcement AKC Award for Canine Excellence. On March 19, 2010, MCLB Albany's base dog kennel was named in honor of Lee, with Lex in attendance. After his adoption, Lex struggled with mobility issues due to his injuries and approximately 50 pieces of shrapnel that remain in his body, despite treatment at Mississippi State University's College of Veterinary Medicine. On November 16, 2010, Lex began treatment at Georgetown Veterinary Hospital with a course of Vet-Stem stem cell regenerative therapy, with assistance from the Humane Society of the United States and Kentucky Congressman Ed Whitfield. Death Lex died on March 25, 2012 as a result of cancer.

It is informally known as The Vase or The Boomerang due to its shape. Robert Shiller, a Nobel Prize winning economist, proposed an alternative name as ‚ÄúThe Tummy.‚Äù https://www.telegraph.co.uk/property/buy/one- blackfriars-an-exclusive-look-inside-the-vase-londons-newest/ https://londonist.com/2016/04/the-boomerang-london-s-newest-oddly-named- skyscraper-rising-high The development is made up of a 52-storey tower of a maximum height of 170 m and two smaller buildings of six and four storeys respectively. Uses include residential flats, a hotel and retail. In addition, a new public space will be created. The site was formerly occupied by the headquarters of Sainsbury's supermarket. Original planning and design Initially promoted by the Beetham Organisation, the tower was originally proposed at , with 68 storeys, but was eventually scaled down after concerns about its impact on the rest of London. A revised planning application for a , 49-storey tower was submitted on 30 October 2006. Although 57 m shorter than before, this would still make it one of the tallest buildings in the city, similar in height to the Gherkin and Tower 42 in the City of London. According to the architect Ian Simpson, the unusual shape of the building was inspired by Timo Sarpaneva's classic Lansetti glass vase from 1952.Kalin, K.: Mainostoimiston 15-vuotias l√§hettitytt√∂ huomasi, ett√§ Suomi-designin suuri nimi seuraa h√§nt√§: Marjatta Sarpaneva kertoo poikkeuksellisella intensiteetill√§ el√§m√§st√§ muotoilun sis√§piiriss√§. Helsingin Sanomat, 11.9.2020. A public observation gallery was to have been situated on the upper two floors, offering panoramic views across the capital. The original plan would have featured a 5-star hotel and luxury apartments, each with their own internal conservatory space. However, a number of affordable homes were also be included as part of the scheme in a separate building on Rennie Street. Despite a number of objections - from English Heritage, Royal Parks, Lambeth Council, Westminster City Council, local residents and ward councillors ‚àí the tower was given initial planning permission by Southwark Council on 24 July 2007. The Mayor of London was in favour, and Lambeth Council wanted ¬£180,615 of Section 106 money in compensation. The Dubai-based Jumeirah hotel chain signed up as anchor tenants. In March 2008, the tower was called in for a Public Inquiry by Secretary of State Hazel Blears. After the inquiry, Blears announced that she endorsed the recommendation of planning inspector John Gray that both schemes should be granted planning permission. Change in ownership The project was placed into administration by The Royal Bank of Scotland in October 2010 following a breakdown in relationships in the project partnership.Skyscraper News, Beetham Race To Save Tower Plans, 24 March 2011 The site was purchased by Berkeley Group‚Äôs St. George subsidiary in October 2011, leading to the renewed expectation that the tower would be built. In January 2013 it was announced that the building was to go ahead and be built with some minor revisions Second planning application and design One Blackfriars under construction in April 2017 In May 2012 St George filed a new planning application for the site for the construction of three buildings: a virtually identical 50-storey tower as the original application along with a 6-storey building (The Rennie Street Building) and a 4-storey building (The Podium Building). The application was granted in October 2012. The tower provides 274 private flats, however the viewing lounge on the 32nd floor received widespread criticism for revoking the promise of public access, when in reality it costs ¬£50 per visit, and ¬£30 per hour for residents and companies only in the local postcode. Critics pointed out that the public viewing area was the fundamental reason why the council permitted the development without social housing. The council have refused to release the information in relation to those transactions. The number of flats includes 13 studio flats, 78 one bedroom, 120 two bedroom, 56 three bedroom, 6 four bedroom and 1 triplex. Southwark Council's Affordable SPD states that affordable housing in applicable developments should be located on the development site or exceptionally off site or through an in lieu payment. Southwark accepted the applicant's explanations of why an in lieu payment would be appropriate, the value of which was agreed at ¬£29m. The cost to the developer of the provision of the public viewing lounge has been calculated at ¬£5.5m (based on foregone revenue on lost floor space for two medium-sized flats). Construction A single storey marketing building was constructed during 2012 in the north east corner of the site and is due to be used for one year. As of October 2013 a three-storey marketing building is being constructed in the south eastern corner of the site and is due to stand for five years whilst the rest of the buildings are being completed. The ground- breaking ceremony took place in October 2013. The site topped out in spring 2017, and was completed in 2018.  Marketing  View from The Shard In January 2015 a sales and marketing video for the development was swiftly ridiculed on social media and reported by the professional media, and was promptly withdrawn.

After gaining independence, the United States grew westward, crossing the Appalachian Mountains with the admission of new states and then doubling in size with the Louisiana Purchase in 1803. The only means of transportation at the time between the coastal states and interior lands remained on water, by canoe, boat (e.g. keelboat or flatboat) and ship, or over land on foot and by pack animal. Recognizing the success of Roman roads in unifying that empire, political and business leaders in the United States began to construct roads and canals to connect the disparate parts of the nation.  Background  After its victory in the American Revolutionary War, the fledgling United States became sovereign over an area stretching along the Atlantic seaboard from New Hampshire to Georgia, and as far inland as the Mississippi River, encompassing an area exceeding that of any western European nation of the time. While the coastal trade was relatively developed, the nation possessed limited transportation and communication lines with its interior, other than advantageous interior river systems and their interconnecting portages. For the new lands in the Northwest Territory, the Congress of the Confederation set precedent with the Northwest Ordinance concerning ownership of the lands, with known transportation routes as \\"common highways and forever free.\\"s:Northwest Ordinance. Art. 4:\\"The navigable waters leading into the Mississippi and St. Lawrence, and the carrying places between the same, shall be common highways and forever free, as well to the inhabitants of the said territory as to the citizens of the United States, and those of any other States that may be admitted into the confederacy, without any tax, impost, or duty therefor.\\" The need for internal improvements of these internal natural resources was widely recognized at the time. The preliminary report of the Inland Waterways Commission in 1908 provides a description of the early development of transportation and communication infrastructure: \\"The earliest movement toward developing the inland waterways of the country began when, under the influence of George Washington, Virginia and Maryland appointed commissioners primarily to consider the navigation and improvement of the Potomac; they met in 1786 in Alexandria and adjourned to Mount Vernon, where they planned for extension, pursuant to which they reassembled with representatives of other States in Annapolis in 1786; again finding the task a growing one, a further conference was arranged in Philadelphia in 1787, with delegates from all the States. There the deliberations resulted in the framing of the Constitution, whereby the thirteen original States were united primarily on a commercial basis ‚Äî the commerce of the times being chiefly by water.\\"Introductory note to Section 17, [portions of] the Gallatin Report (1808) Toll roads Highways in the USA circa 1825 Early toll roads were constructed between some commercial centers and were owned by joint-stock companies that sold stock to raise construction capital, such as the Lancaster Turnpike Company of Pennsylvania in 1795. In 1808 Secretary of the Treasury Albert Gallatin's Report on the Subject of Public Roads and Canals suggested that the federal government should fund the construction of interstate toll roads and canals. While transportation needs were universally recognized, many Anti-Federalists opposed the federal government assuming such a role. The British coastal blockade in the War of 1812, and an inadequate internal capability to respond, demonstrated the United States' reliance upon such overland roads for military operations as well as for general commerce. Construction on the westward National Road began in 1815 at Cumberland, Maryland, and it reached Wheeling, Virginia by 1818; by 1824 private tollways connected Cumberland eastward with commercial and port cities. Further westward extensions were constructed to Vandalia, Illinois, but financial crisis ultimately prevented its planned western extension to the Mississippi and Missouri Rivers. Nevertheless, the road became a primary overland route over the Appalachian Mountains and the gateway for the surge of westward-bound settlers and immigrants. Canals USA canals circa 1825 County of Hampshire, Massachusetts Canal companies had also been chartered in the states, and like turnpikes these early canals were constructed, owned, and operated by private joint-stock companies. The first to complete this work was the Proprietors of the Locks and Canals on Connecticut River, which was chartered on February 23, 1792 with the signature of Governor John Hancock. By 1795 the Proprietors had completed the South Hadley Canal, the first navigable canal to be completed in the United States. * Continuing their work, the Proprietors turned their attention to the Turners Falls Canal to the north, which opened in 1798. Many other canal ventures existed at this time but of all the canals projected for construction, only four additional had been completed by the outbreak of the War of 1812: the Dismal Swamp Canal in Virginia, the Santee Canal in South Carolina, the Bellows Falls Canal in Bellows Falls, Vermont and the Middlesex Canal in Massachusetts. After the war, New York authorized construction of the Erie Canal in 1817. Proposed by Governor of New York De Witt Clinton, the Erie was the first canal project undertaken as a public good to be financed at public risk through the issuance of bonds. When the project was completed in 1825, the canal linked the Hudson River to Lake Erie via 83 separate locks and over a distance of . This bold bid for the western trade to their north alarmed the competing merchants of Philadelphia, since the completion of the National Road also threatened to divert much of their traffic south to Baltimore. In 1825, the legislature of Pennsylvania grappled with the problem by projecting a series of canals to connect Philadelphia with Pittsburgh in the west and with Lake Erie and the upper Susquehanna to the north. The success of the Erie Canal spawned a boom of canal building around the country; over 3,326 miles of man-made waterways were constructed between 1816 and 1840. Small towns like Syracuse, New York, Buffalo, New York, and Cleveland, Ohio located along major canal routes boomed into major industrial and trade centers, while exuberant canal building pushed some states like Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Indiana to the brink of bankruptcy. Political differences The United States government had funded and constructed improvements along its coastline beginning with the founding of the United States Army Corps of Engineers during the revolution, and many politicians wanted them to contribute to construction of works \\"of a civil nature\\" as well. Before 1800, the Corps supervised the construction of coastal fortifications, but they also constructed lighthouses, helped develop jetties and piers for harbors, and carefully mapped the changing navigation channels. Although temporarily downsized following the war, the Corps was reestablished in 1802 and began constructing and repairing fortifications in Norfolk and New Orleans. The fortification appropriations proliferated during the five years of diplomatic tension that preceded the War of 1812; these substantially expanded the system of fortifications protecting New York Harbor and convinced the commanders of the British navy to avoid attacking that strategic location. Following the war, the United States soon developed an expanded system of more modern fortifications to provide the first line of land defense against the threat of attack from European powers.The Beginnings to 1815 , Corps of Engineers Outside of defense issues, however, federal power over domestic \\"internal improvements\\" away from the coasts and among the states did not gain political consensus. Federal assistance for internal improvements evolved slowly and haphazardly ‚Äî the product of contentious congressional factions and an executive branch generally concerned with avoiding unconstitutional federal intrusions into state affairs.Improving Transportation , United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) In his first message to Congress, Federalist President John Adams advocated for construction of roads and canals on a national basis and for the establishment of observatories and a national university. Later, in 1806, Democratic-Republican President Jefferson also had recommended many internal improvements for Congress to consider, including the creation of necessary amendments to the Constitution to allow themselves such powers. Adams did not share Jefferson's view of the limitations of the Constitution. In much alarm Jefferson suggested to Madison the desirability of having Virginia adopt a new set of resolutions, founded on those of 1798, and directed against the acts for internal improvements. The magnitude of the transportation problem was such that neither individual states nor private corporations seemed able to meet the demands of expanding internal trade. As early as 1807, Albert Gallatin had advocated the construction of a great system of internal waterways to connect East and West, at an estimated cost of $20,000,000. These improvements would generally be upon public lands under the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal government, not internal State lands. However, the only contribution of the federal government to internal improvements during the Jeffersonian era was an appropriation in 1806 of two percent of the net proceeds of the sales of public lands in Ohio for the construction of a national road, with the consent of the states through which it should pass. By 1818 the Cumberland Road was open to traffic from Cumberland, Maryland to Wheeling, West Virginia. In 1816, with the uneven experiences of the war quite evident, the national aspects of the problem could not be ignored. Even non-federalist President James Madison invited the attention of Congress to the need of establishing \\"a comprehensive system of roads and canals\\". Soon after Congress met, it took under consideration a bill drafted by John C. Calhoun proposing an appropriation of $1,500,000 for internal improvements. Because this appropriation was to be met by the moneys paid by the National Bank to the government, the bill was commonly referred to as the \\"Bonus Bill\\". But on the day before he left office, Madison vetoed the bill because he felt it was unconstitutional. Having less regard for consistency, the House of Representatives recorded its conviction, by close votes, that Congress could appropriate money to construct roads and canals but did not have the power to construct them. The only direct aid of the national government for internal improvements remained various appropriations, amounting to about $1,500,000 for the Cumberland Road. As the country recovered from financial depression following the Panic of 1819, the question of internal improvements again forged to the front. In 1822, a bill to authorize the collection of tolls on the Cumberland Road was vetoed by President James Monroe. In an elaborate essay, he set forth his views on the constitutional aspects of a policy of internal improvements. Congress might appropriate money, Monroe admitted, but it might not undertake the actual construction of national works nor assume jurisdiction over them. For the moment the drift toward a larger participation of the national government in internal improvements was stayed. The situation would change dramatically two years later, however, with Supreme Court rulings that would resolve the related constitutional questions with some finality. Initial resolution In March 1824 the Supreme Court issued a landmark decision in Gibbons v. Ogden, ruling that the power to regulate interstate commerce was granted to Congress by the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution. The Court went on to conclude that Congressional power extends to the regulation of all aspects of commerce, overriding state law to the contrary. In the Presidential campaign of 1824, Speaker of the House Henry Clay, the foremost proponent of the 'American System', pleaded for a larger conception of the functions of the national government. He called attention to provisions made for coastal surveys and lighthouses on the Atlantic seaboard and deplored the neglect of the interior of the country. Senator and war-hero Andrew Jackson voted for the General Survey Act, as did Secretary of State John Quincy Adams, who left no doubt that he did not support the narrow views of his New England region on this issue. William H. Crawford felt the constitutional scruples being voiced in the South, and followed the old expedient of advocating for a constitutional amendment to sanction national internal improvements. Shortly thereafter, Congress passed two important laws that would set a new course concerning federal involvement in internal improvements. In April Congress passed the General Survey Act, which authorized the president to have surveys made of routes for roads and canals \\"of national importance, in a commercial or military point of view, or necessary for the transportation of public mail;\\" this is sometimes referred to as the first \\"Roads and Canals\\" Act. It authorized the survey of waterways to designate those \\"capable of sloop navigation.\\" The second act, \\"An Act to Improve the Navigation of the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers,\\"Timeline: Development of US Inland Waterways System , Coosa-Alabama River Improvement Association, Inc. was passed in May; it appropriated $75,000 to improve navigation on the Ohio and Mississippi rivers by removing sandbars, snags, and other obstacles ‚Äì the second act is often called the first rivers and harbors legislation. The president assigned responsibility for the road, canal and waterway surveys as well as the navigation improvements to the Corps of Engineers, marking marked the beginning of its continuous involvement in domestic civil works. In 1826 Congress expanded the workload of the Corps of Engineers and the pace of improvements. The new legislation authorized the president to have river surveys made to clean out and deepen selected waterways and to make various other river and harbor improvements. It was also the first legislation of this type to combine authorizations for both surveys and projects, thereby establishing the pattern for future work. Some political differences did remain. In March 1826 the Virginia general assembly declared that all the principles of their earlier resolutions applied \\"with full force against the powers assumed by Congress\\" in passing acts to further internal improvements and to protect manufacturers. That the John Quincy Adams administration would meet with opposition in Congress was a foregone conclusion.

Plastic clothing has existed almost since the creation of flexible plastic, particularly rain-protection garments made from waterproof fabrics. Fashions during the 1960s included plastic clothing such as PVC miniskirts and PVC raincoats. PVC raincoats were often brightly coloured, initially as a road safety feature for children, but later as a fashion item. They were far lighter and cheaper than rubberized mackintoshes or woven gabardine raincoats, and could also be made transparent or translucent. There was great enthusiasm at the time for the use of plastic and paper garments as futuristic clothing. Modern clothing commonly uses flexible plastic materials, in the form of both flexible plastic sheeting and plasticized fabric. Rigid plastic components are also used to replace components which would have formerly been made of metal, bone, rubber, or other materials, for example in the form of buttons, shoulder pads, collar stiffeners and zip fasteners. Plastic components are used extensively in footwear. Plastic materials are also commonly used in protective clothing. Plastic clothing is not very suitable for exercise in warm conditions. It produces high relative humidity close to the skin which retards vaporisation of moisture from the skin's surface, reducing or in some cases preventing evaporative cooling. As with other plastic items, plastic clothing is generally not biodegradable and its disposal can lead to plastic pollution. Plastic clothing has also become the subject of fetishistic interest, in a similar way to rubber clothing; see PVC clothing and PVC and rubber fetishism.

The game involves using cars to fight opponents in action-styled battles, with role-playing video game game mechanics. It combined vehicular combat with action RPG elements in a similar manner to the earlier 1985 game Autoduel based on Car Wars, and later 2006 MMO game Auto Assault. Gameplay Gameplay of Car Battler Joe. The player, taking the role of 16-year-old Joe, must earn money by battling to buy parts for his car to make it stronger. The battles are fought in 16-bit Mode 7-style. Development The game was developed by Ancient, with joint publishing by Victor Interactive Software in Japan and Natsume in the United States. Known in Japan as Car Battler Go, Natsume secured the North American publishing rights for the game, changing its name and originally scheduled its release in the summer of 2002. Composer Yuzo Koshiro was involved with creating the funk music for the game. It was shown at Nintendo Space World in 2001. In 2015, the game was re-released for the Wii U's Virtual Console. Reception Car Battler Joe received \\"generally favorable reviews\\" according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. It was well received by Nintendo Power, which called it a \\"one-of-a-kind adventure\\" due to its combination of driving challenges and \\"RPG depth\\". Before it was playable, Marc Nix of IGN was excited about its premise, as well as the developer attached to it. In his review, he called its gameplay \\"hectic\\" and its controls well-designed. He also enjoyed the Mode 7 graphics. However, he found the sound to be less desirable, calling it \\"busy\\" but also \\"lacking punch\\". It was the 87th most anticipated game for IGN's readers as of January 3, 2003. Electronic Gaming Monthly praised the car customization, commenting that without it, it would be both mediocre and not as deep. GameSpot's Frank Provo called it \\"weird and unique\\", and may not suit some people's tastes. However, he found an abundance of variety and personality to it. In his preview of the game, GamePros Pong Sifu found the gameplay unique and the graphics \\"delightful\\". In his review, he commented that while the story was weak and the concept unoriginal, it was \\"easily one of the most fun action RPGs on the portable system\\". RPGFan's Neal Chandran found it fun and worth a shot, noting that even with its flaws, its \\"charm and heart\\" won him over. GameSpy's Zach Meston called it \\"unexpectedly entertaining\\", praising its customization and music and sound effects. However, he criticized the aiming system and storyline, the latter described as \\"bare-minum\\". Retrospectives on Car Battler Joe were also positive towards the game. Outlets such as GamesRadar and Den of Geek listed it as one of the best games for the Game Boy Advance.

This ion channel is formed on the outer mitochondrial membrane in response to certain apoptotic stimuli. MAC activity is detected by patch clamping mitochondria from apoptotic cells at the time of cytochrome c release. Members of the Bcl-2 protein family regulate apoptosis by controlling the formation of MAC: the pro-apoptotic members Bax and/or Bak form MAC, whereas the anti-apoptotic members like Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL prevent MAC formation. Once formed, MAC mediates the release of cytochrome c to the cytosol, triggering the commitment step of the mitochondrial apoptotic cascade. Depletion of MAC activity is accomplished pharmacologically by specific compounds, namely Bax channel inhibitors and MAC inhibitors. Either by knocking down MAC's main components or by its pharmacological inhibition, the end result is prevention of cytochrome c release and apoptosis.

History Verona needed an opera house, so the Accademia Filarmonica di Verona decided in the early 18th century to build a theatre worthy and large. Work began in 1716 and lasted 13 years. Finally, inauguration was on the evening of January 6, 1732, with the pastoral drama La fida ninfa by Antonio Vivaldi, a libretto by Scipio Maffei. The opera season became famous, and the performances led society events. But on January 21, 1749, fire eventually spread in the theatre. Rebuilt, the theater was re- dedicated in 1754 with the opera Lucio Vero by Neapolitan composer Davide Perez. The opera had a limited success. Corsican in the 18th century, during the French invasion, a long series of celebrations were held in the theater, such as the Cantata per la Santa Alleanza (\\"Cantata for the Holy Alliance\\") of Gioachino Rossini.

On the tragic night of February 23, 1945, the theater collapsed under the Anglo- American bombing. The Academy Philharmonic announced that it would try to rebuild the theatre exactly as it had been before. The proceedings lasted a long time: the theatre was inaugurated again in 1975, with the opera Falstaff by Antonio Salieri. The theatre still hosts opera, ballets and concerts seasons.

Wellman and starring Glenn Ford and Janet Blair. The film is a biopic of the early U.S. aviation pioneer John Joseph Montgomery. Gallant Journey depicts his efforts to build and fly gliders, from his childhood through to his death in 1911. The chief stunt pilot for the film was Paul Mantz. Plot When Father Dick Ball (Charles Kemper) in San Diego, California, recalls his childhood friend, John Joseph Montgomery (Glenn Ford), he recounts the story of the first American to ever fly a glider in 1883. As early as 1879, John told his girlfriend Regina Cleary (Janet Blair) about his dreams of flying, although his family was very much opposed to this idea and considered him a fool. Regina believed in him, and secretly supported his work, until the first test flight in 1883, which was successful. John named his flying machine an \\"aeroplane\\". John's prominent father, Zachary Montgomery, who had become Assistant Attorney General of the United States, was keen on keeping his reputation intact. When he received news of his son's endeavors, he told him to stop his foolishness and continue his clergy studies instead. Father Ball became interested in John's work and supported his research and experiments. Another priest, Father Kenton (Arthur Shields), turned out to be an aviation enthusiast, and helped John with his inventions, arranging a job for him at a Santa Clara workshop. John continued his work for a few years, and built several model aircraft, preparing for a full-scale test flight. The only thing standing in his way is a medical condition making him dizzy and causing him to collapse. He is told by a doctor that he will never be able to fly safely suffering from this illness. John is disappointed, but his confidence is renewed when he encounters the parachute enthusiast and performer Dan Mahoney, who offers to pull the glider up in the air with his hot air balloon. The two fathers help John to complete a successful test flight with his new glider. Unfortunately his poor finances prevent him from pursuing his passion for flying any longer, even though many people show their interest in his work. A series of misfortunes and unfortunate events serve as additional discouragement for John, when Dan crashes and dies during a test flight, and an earthquake destroys his glider. Still John manages to scrape together $25,000 by selling his valuable belongings. He marries Regina, but is later dragged into court by a man who claims to be the rightful owner of an object John sold to get his money. The lengthy trial consumes all of John's money, but the judge rules in his favor at the end. John decides to give flying one more go and builds his own new glider design. He decides to fly it himself. In mid-air he gets a dizzy spell, loses control and crashes to the ground. He dies from his injuries a few hours later. Cast * Glenn Ford as John J.

The locations in use were Malibu, Del Monte and the movie ranch at Lasky Mesa, California.\\"Original print information: 'Gallant Journey'.\\" Turner Classic Movies. Retrieved: June 8, 2016. Wellman had a passion for flying which was expressed in a number of his films including Wings (1927) which won the first Academy Award for Best Picture, Young Eagles (1930), Central Airport (1933), Men with Wings (1938) and Thunder Birds (1942). Gallant Journey had its beginnings with the San Diego Junior Chamber of Commerce which had obtained the film rights to a biography on John Montgomery.Pendo 1983, p. 131. A number of realistic gliders and balloons were built for the film. A total of 11 gliders that reproduced Montgomery's original three gliders were built. In an attempt to duplicate the balloon launch of a glider at altitude, the stunt nearly was disastrous when the balloon suddenly flew uncontrollably up to 16,000 ft before the test pilot was able to control the gas release valve and bring the balloon back down to the intended 4,000 ft. The sequence was then shot safely.Pendo 1983, p. 132. The test pilots discovered that the original designs produced for the film that carefully followed the authentic Montgomery designs had to be redesigned in order to ensure safety and stability in flight. The redesigned gliders flew so well that they qualified for a Civil Aviation Authority license to fly. A series of model gliders were also created for use in Gallant Journey. Reception Gallant Journey had its world premiere at San Diego, California on September 4, 1946. with its full national release on September 24, 1946.

In his review for The New York Times, Bosley Crowther considered the film Wellman's \\"vanity project\\": \\"... Mr. Wellman got himself together, helped to write, directed and produced a film called 'Gallant Journey,' intended to acclaim that daring man. But a look at the finished product, which came to Loew's Criterion yesterday, leads one to suspect that Mr. Wellman was quite as cuckoo as Montgomery was thought to be. For this curiously ill-constructed picture about a man who was crazy to fly goes bumping around in clumsy circles and ends up in a miserable heap.\\"Crowther, Bosley. \\"Movie review: The screen; Soaring Aimlessly.\\" The New York Times, October 10, 1946.

Overall, the reviewer said \\"‚Ä¶I think it makes sense for everyone to browse the Amazon store before hitting the 'buy' button on iTunes.\\"Amazon MP3 vs. Apple iTunes: Where Should You Shop? A 2007 study by Eliot Van Buskirk of Wired News's \\"Listening Post\\" blog investigated whether Amazon MP3 was watermarking tracks with personally identifiable information. Van Buskirk quoted an Amazon spokesperson as saying, \\"Amazon does not apply watermarks. Files are generally provided to us from the labels and some labels use watermarks to identify the retailer who sold the tracks (there is no information on the tracks that identifies the customer).\\" The study concluded that although tracks may be watermarked to indicate that they were purchased on Amazon MP3, there is no data to indicate which specific customer purchased a given MP3 file.Some of Amazon's MP3 Tracks Contain Watermarks This observation reflected Amazon's policy at the time.Some Of Amazon's MP3 Tracks Contain Watermarks Watermarking By 2011, however, the policy had changed and certain explicitly labeled tracks embed \\"Record Company Required Metadata\\" including, among other information, unique identifiers:GagaGate, DRM and How To Cripple The CloudRecord Company Required Metadata > Embedded in the metadata of each purchased MP3 from [Universal Music Group] > are a random number Amazon assigns to your order, the Amazon store name, the > purchase date and time, codes that identify the album and song (the UPC and > ISRC), Amazon's digital signature, and an identifier that can be used to > determine whether the audio has been modified. In addition, Amazon inserts > the first part of the email address associated with your Amazon.com account > Music downloaded during the temporary promotional time period of trial > membership will be blocked from access if the membership isn't continued. Amazon Music Player The Amazon Music player (formerly branded Cloud Player) is integrated with the digital music Prime and Unlimited streaming services, as well as the music store for purchases (on most platforms). The players allow users to store and play their music from a web browser, mobile apps, and desktop applications, Sonos (United States only), Bose (United States only) and other platforms such as certain smart TVs. Amazon Music Player accounts get 250 tracks of free storage; however, music purchased through Amazon MP3 store does not count towards the storage limit. Once the music is stored in Amazon Music, a user can choose to download it to one of the Android, iOS, or desktop devices using Amazon Music application. Music is uploaded via the Amazon Music player for PC and Mac. Previously Amazon offered the Amazon MP3 Uploader which was an Adobe AIR application. Amazon Music allows 10 devices (computer, browser, mobile, etc.) to be authorized. Customers can deauthorize their old devices via a web interface.Authorizing Your Device Originally bundled with Amazon Cloud Drive was the music streaming application called Cloud Player which allowed users to play their music stored in the Cloud Drive from any computer or Android device with Internet access. This was discontinued. Amazon Music for PC was launched in May 2013 as a downloadable Windows application for playing music outside a web browser. The OS X version of Amazon Music was released in October 2013. On December 8, 2015, Amazon Prime Music became available on Denon¬Æ Electronics HEOS by Denon wireless sound systems, adding a new streaming outlet for music and entertainment enthusiasts. On October 12, 2016, Amazon Music Unlimited was released in the United States. Music Unlimited is a full-catalog unlimited streaming service, available as a monthly or annual subscription. It is billed in addition to, and available without an Amazon Prime account. The service later expanded to users in the United Kingdom, Germany and Austria on November 14, 2016. =Reception= Much commentary on Amazon Music at launch focused on its legality, since Amazon launched the service without the approval of the record labels. Amazon's official statement was \\"Cloud Player is an application that lets customers manage and play their own music. It's like any number of existing media management applications. We do not need a license to make Cloud Player available.\\" Technology website Ars Technica noted that this is \\"seemingly logical\\" since users are uploading and playing back their own music, so the licenses users acquired from the original purchase apply to the Cloud Player in the same way they apply to transferring and playing music from an external hard drive or digital audio player. Techdirt commented that the Cloud Player is \\"just letting people take music files they already [have], and allowing them to store and stream them from the internet. Why should it require an extra license to let people listen to music they already have?\\" Record labels reacted in shock to the Cloud Player's launch, insisting that licenses were needed for this type of service. Intellectual property lawyer Denise Howell stated that \\"the legality of cloud storage and remote access to items already purchased make intuitive sense\\", but given the record labels' reaction and track record of legal action against online music services, warned that it will likely take \\"definitive and hard-fought judicial pronouncements\\" to settle the issue.

Styles and Tomko are former tag team partners in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) who were a part of two factions together, Christian's Coalition and the Angle Alliance. In addition to being involved in many a headline match due to their associations with Christian Cage or Kurt Angle, Styles and Tomko are notable in history for their run as TNA World Tag Team Champions. Stopped at 184 days, it stood for three years as the longest run in the history of that championship, and second longest of all tag title runs (only to America's Most Wanted's 250-day sixth reign with the NWA World Tag Team Championship while TNA was still using that title) in the history of the company, until Beer Money, Inc., in the midst of their fourth reign, pushed it back a spot in both categories on July 13, 2011. History =Formation= By early 2007, after Tomko's then-recent arrival reprising his WWE role as Christian Cage's enforcer resulted in Christian regaining the NWA World Heavyweight Championship, Christian would expand his leadership into a full coalition to enforce his reign. While Scott Steiner would officially come on board as Cage's \\"consultant\\", recently turned villain A.J. Styles would align himself with Christian on occasion. Styles and Tomko, however, would have yet to interact, as Styles' appearances alongside Christian came without Tomko present. Immediately following Destination X 2007, the champion Christian and Kurt Angle were informed by TNA management director Jim Cornette that they would each be captaining five-man teams to compete in a Lethal Lockdown cage match at the upcoming pay-per-view Lockdown. In the upcoming weeks, Christian's Coalition, which had somewhat broken down by Destination X, officially formed for the second time in as many months under the name Team Cage, also including Abyss and Steiner along with Styles and Tomko (the latter whose rejoining finally united the duo), while Team Angle went on to consist of four recent rivals of the Team Cage members (Angle included) and Jeff Jarrett. At the match itself, Team Angle won when Jarrett hit Abyss with a thumbtack-loaded guitar and let Sting make the pin to become number one contender to Cage's title. From there, the collective would systematically betray and destroy Abyss, and eventually Scott Steiner and Tomko's trust issues would cause Steiner to leave to team with his brother Rick, all of which in effect left only Styles and Tomko to carry on together behind Cage as Christian's Coalition. =Growing Feuds= Tension would develop between Styles, Tomko, and Cage heading into the King of the Mountain match at Slammiversary, which all three men were in qualifying for. On May 31, 2007, Styles had originally been scheduled to face Jeff Jarrett in a qualifying match, but since Jarrett couldn't appear due to his wife's death, Tomko was put in his place. Styles defeated Tomko thanks to \\"botched\\" interference from Christian Cage, causing tension between Tomko and Cage, later resolved on the June 7 episode. On the June 14, 2007 episode of Impact, Styles and Tomko showed that they were once again a united front, helping Cage defeat Abyss by disqualification to get into King of the Mountain after Abyss hit him with a steel chair. The group came out empty-handed at Slammiversary, and Styles and Tomko lost to Sting and Abyss in a tag team match at the following pay-per- view, Victory Road. After being attacked by Judas Mesias and the Robert Roode- assisted Coalition, Sting and Abyss overcame Styles and Cage to secure a contract for an Abyss vs. Christian match at Hard Justice 2007 with the help of the TNA debut of \\"The Punisher\\" Andrew Martin to counteract Tomko's Coalition enforcer role. On the Impact! prior to Hard Justice, Jim Cornette announced that Christian's Coalition would take on Abyss, Sting and Andrew Martin in a Doomsday Chamber of Blood match, a barbed wire steel cage match in which a person could only be pinned once they were bleeding, at Hard Justice in which the wrestler who scores the pinfall for his team in the match would receive the next title shot at the TNA World Heavyweight Championship. At Hard Justice, Styles was pinned by Abyss as the Coalition lost. Styles and Tomko next accompanied Christian in his feud with Samoa Joe over who the \\"real World Heavyweight Champion\\" was. =TNA World Tag Team Champions= At No Surrender, Styles and Tomko won a ten-team Gauntlet Match to become the number one contenders for the TNA World Tag Team Championship at Bound for Glory against the team of Adam \\"Pacman\\" Jones and Ron Killings; Styles started the match against his former tag team partner Christopher Daniels (and would align with him against various opponents during the match), survived the entire over-the- top elimination portion, and even picked up the winning pinfall for himself and Tomko. At Bound For Glory, Styles and Tomko defeated Killings and Rasheed Lucius \\"Consequences\\" Creed, Pacman's surprise substitute, for the TNA Tag Team Titles. At this point they were still solidly Christian's enforcers in his feud with Samoa Joe and later his Fight for the Right Tournament efforts, but were also branching out on their own and establishing their act as a tag team, even becoming somewhat popular with the audience despite their villainous status. After retaining the tag titles against the Steiner Brothers at Genesis, Styles and Tomko came out during Christian's number one contendership ladder match with Kaz right as Cage was about to win, despite his specific instructions not to. This distracted Cage, costing him the match. Immediately afterwards, they assisted Kurt Angle in retaining his TNA World Heavyweight Championship, officially joining Kurt and his wife Karen in the Angle Alliance. The hopeless dreamer Styles and major skeptic Tomko from then on would attempt to be part of both the Angle Alliance and the Christian Coalition, despite the clashing egos and animosity between Christian and the Angles. It was implied during that time that Karen, who'd been shown on-screen to have a seducing effect on A.J. on occasion, conned him into thinking this union was possible. On the December 6, 2007 Impact!, when Cage's leadership- conditioned attempt to follow Robert Roode into accepting Angle's offer to join the group backfired after one match and led to his betrayal at the hands of Angle and Roode, Styles tried in vain to hold the assailants back by himself as Tomko walked away from the situation. At that point, Cage was out of the Alliance, but Styles and Tomko's status was unknown regarding both the Alliance or the Coalition. On the following episode of Impact! Cage was again attacked by Angle and Roode but this time an upset looking Styles just watched from the ring apron. In following weeks, Tomko made it clear to Styles that they needed to choose sides, and while Styles was indecisive, Tomko firmly established his own foothold in the situation by leaving both the Coalition and the Alliance on the January 3, 2008 episode of Impact!. Styles later succumbed to Karen's seductions once again and chose to join Angle at the Final Resolution pay-per-view by helping Angle retain the TNA World Championship against Cage. Following Final Resolution, Angle and Styles continued to try to recruit Tomko, only to be rebuffed each time, eventually leading to Tomko attacking Angle after he insulted Tomko's wife over Karen and appearing to side with Christian leading up to the title rematch between Angle and Cage. At Against All Odds, Tomko and Styles surprisingly showed no signs of conflict in their defense of the Tag Team Titles, and in the end Tomko cost Cage the championship again in the main event. He subsequently joined the Angle Alliance on the next Impact!, his reasoning being simply because there was strength in numbers and he was tired of years of yet-incompletely- fulfilled promises of stardom under Christian Cage. At Destination X, the Angle Alliance faced the makeshift \\"Unlikely Alliance\\" consisting of the vengeful Christian, Samoa Joe, and Kevin Nash. The Angle Alliance fell as Tomko tapped out to Joe that night. The next Thursday on Impact!, Tomko was announced the captain of the villainous Lethal Lockdown team. Tomko and his pre-recruited teammate Styles would enlist Team 3D and James Storm in the coming weeks, only to lose to Christian's team of Nash, Rhino, Sting, and Matt Morgan. On the April 17, episode of Impact! Styles and Tomko finally lost the TNA World Tag Team Championship to Super Eric and Kaz. Afterwards they complained to Jim Cornette about the match, and in the end Super Eric and Kaz were stripped of the championships due to Super Eric being unable to realize he and Eric Young (who was slated as Kaz's partner) were one and the same. The Deuces Wild tournament was organized, but Tomko had been suspended by TNA (due to no-showing a TNA Fanfest Event - his absence was explained in the storyine as having been injured in a shoot fight). Therefore, Styles competed in the tournament alongside Super Eric. =Falling outs= On the May 22, 2008 episode of Impact!, after Tomko interrupted an interview to interrogate Styles about teaming with Super Eric, Styles quit the Angle Alliance, including his team with Tomko, in a fit induced by Styles having faced many pointed fingers in recent weeks mainly pertaining to his relationship with Karen. From there, Tomko would align with Kurt Angle and characters such as Booker T, Team 3D, and The Beautiful People in a loose collective self-identified as \\"the Bad Guys\\". That same night, and the following week, Angle, Booker, Team 3D and Tomko ended the show by viciously attacking Styles (and Cage in the second week), marking the official disbandment of Styles and Tomko as a tag team. Tomko departed TNA in July 2008, appearing once against Samoa Joe on the way out, while A.J.'s rivalry with Kurt Angle would continue for over a year, most notably through his constant role in resistance efforts against the Main Event Mafia. On the December 17, 2009 edition of Impact!, the newly-reigning World Heavyweight Champion Styles and Tomko teamed with Angle, Bobby Lashley, and Abyss, and came out victorious in a 10-man tag team match - Tomko's official return match with TNA after over a year away - when Styles pinned Brutus Magnus of the British Invasion. This loose alliance wouldn't last, however, as Tomko later revealed himself to have been the masked man in black assaulting A.J. for months after Bound for Glory. He did it to score his former partner's attention and a title shot, which he successfully gained but lost.

He was head of the army group in the military intelligence service of the exile Norwegian High Command in London during the Second World War, and thus was one of the founders of the Norwegian Intelligence Service. He served as a military attach√© in Stockholm and Helsingfors during the 1950s, and was commander-in-chief in Central Norway from 1964 to 1971. From 1971 to 1974 he was Land Deputy of the Allied Forces Northern Europe, i.e. the Norwegian representative in the NATO military command for Northern Europe. As such he was the highest-ranking Norwegian in the NATO command structure at the time. Background He was born and grew up in Vienna, Austria-Hungary as the son of the Norwegian Consul-General in Vienna, Thorleif (von) Paus, and a Viennese mother of Jewish descent, Gabrielle (\\"Ella\\") Stein. On his father's side he belonged to the Paus family and he was named for his grandfather, the steel industrialist and banker Ole Paus (who was a first cousin of Henrik Ibsen). During his childhood the family name was officially spelled von Paus in Austria-Hungary, although the family sometimes used the spelling de Paus. The particle von in the country was a privilege of the Austro-Hungarian nobility and foreigners deemed to be of equivalent status; his father had moved to Vienna as a consular official and been registered under that name by the foreign ministry. The particle was banned by law in Austria in 1919, and after he had moved to Norway he was known as Ole Paus, as the family did not use a particle in Norway. He was the father of the singer Ole Paus. Career He graduated from the Theresianum in 1929. He subsequently moved to Norway at the age of 19. After learning Norwegian, he attended the Norwegian Military Academy and graduated as an officer in 1932. He graduated from the Norwegian Military College in 1938, from the Senior Officers' School in the United Kingdom in 1947, and attended the NATO Defence College in Paris in 1963.\\"Paus, Ole Otto,\\" Hvem er Hvem?, 1973, p. 440 During the Second World War, he joined the exile Norwegian High Command in London, where he served in the military intelligence service as head of the army group, in succession to Paal Frisvold.

Background There had been some discussion of merging KCRC, which was also government-owned, and the MTR to make the territory's transport system more efficient. The MTR Corporation Limited (MTRCL) backed such a merge while the KCRC opposed the plan. In March 2004, the Hong Kong Government officially encouraged the two companies to merge. On 11 April 2006, the Hong Kong Government officially announced the details of the proposed merger. Under the non-binding Memorandum of Understanding the Government has signed with KCRC, KCRC would grant a Service Concession to the MTRCL to operate the KCR system, with an initial period of 50 years. The KCRC would receive a one-time upfront payment of HK$4.25 billion, a fixed annual payment of HK$750 million and a variable annual payment based on revenues generated from operation of the KCR system. In addition, MTRCL would make a payment of $7.79 billion for the acquisition of property and other related commercial interests. The railway lines the KCRC operated were less profitable than the MTRC, and the KCRC was less active in property development. It was widely considered that the Government's choice was to avoid being criticised for selling assets of the KCRCwhich it wholly ownedto MTRCL at an underpriced level. Leasing the operation right of the KCR system to the MTRCL could avoid actually selling the KCRC. On 2 December 2007, the Chinese name of the MTRCL was changed to () after being granted the Service Concession while the English name will remain unchanged. (Comparing with the Chinese version) (Comparing with the Chinese version ) The KCRC is now a holding company of the KCR system, without actual railway operations. The merger was approved by shareholders of the MTRCL on 9 October 2007. The merger is effective for 50 years. This also resulted in changing the system's Chinese name from \\"Âú∞Èêµ\\" (\\"Subway\\") to \\"Ê∏ØÈêµ\\" \\"(Hong Kong Railway\\"). Fare reductions All adult Octopus Card holders would be the first to benefit from the merger.Railway Merger Proposal in Hong Kong Gets Green Light, Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in United States.

The battle began as the first B-29 Superfortresses rolled off the production lines of the massive new Boeing factory on the prairies near Wichita, Kansas.Note: All B-29s built at Wichita carried the suffix BW, e.g.: B-29-5-BW. The Boeing B-29 Superfortress was a significant advance in aviation technology, which came with a multitude of problems to be resolved before it was suitable for combat operations. When the B-29 was ordered into production, the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor had not yet taken place and the first flight of the XB-29 prototype was still over a year away. On 6 September 1941 the US Army Air Corps (soon to be the US Army Air Forces) placed its initial production contract for 250 B-29s, built mainly in Wichita, KS. Background In early 1941 the Boeing Wichita factory (which was intended to become one of the main assembly plants for \\"Project 345\\") was building PT-13D & N2S-5 \\"Kaydet\\" biplane trainers for the USAAF and the USN respectively, as well as B-17 control surfaces: the plant needed massive expansion to build the new bomber. On June 24, 1941, new ground was broken for what was to become \\"Plant II\\", which was to be completed in January 1943. New equipment was already being installed by Boeing six months before final completion. Also needed was a whole army of factory workers: people were recruited from all over Kansas and neighboring states. Accommodation for all of them needed to be found. Few of them had any experience in aircraft assembly and a large scale training program was required: they were expected to build a new type of aircraft. At the same time as the new factory was being built the USAAF started forming the foundations of four \\"Bombardment Groups\\" (the 40th, 444th, 462nd, and 468th BGs.) Together they made up the 58th Bombardment Wing (58th BW), which was the first operational unit to take the B-29 into combat from as yet un-built bases in China. A fifth BG, the 472nd was also formed as an operational training unit: this Group stayed in the U.S. and was disbanded in April 1944. ; With its new wing design, new type of remote controlled armament, pressurized crew stations, and powerful new Wright R-3350 radial engines (with new, 16 ft (4.88 m) diameter, slow-turning Hamilton Standard propellers), the B-29 project was unprecedented in the history of aviation: from inception, to drawing board and mass production took three years, at a time when such a design should have taken five years just to become a prototype. Instead the engineering design, production, and testing were being undertaken simultaneously, with all of the expected and unexpected problems, starting from the time the first XB-29 (41-1002) took to the air on 21 September 1942. The USAAF under General Hap Arnold envisaged thousands of B-29s, and they wanted at least 175 of them as soon as possible. The Wichita factory started producing components, then a run of 14 YB-29s in early 1943, before starting on building production aircraft by the autumn.Note: YB aircraft were near production standard, built to test the airframe and components. Soon after the fatal crash of the second prototype USAAF Colonel Harman came up with a plan to coordinate the process of working the \\"bugs\\" out of the new aircraft, especially the engines. The objective was to take control of the entire B-29 program of production, aircraft modification, flight tests, and training. Approval for \\"B-29 Special Project\\" came directly from President Roosevelt, who had been advised by General Arnold. In spite of this directive the B-29 program was to run into trouble.Birdsall 1981 The battle By Mid January 1944, 97 B-29s had been built by Wichita. Unfortunately only 16 of these were flyable with most of them grounded at \\"Modification Centers\\" The Modification Centers were Bechtol, McCone, and Parsons airfields, near Birmingham, Alabama and the Bell B-29 plant at Marietta, Georgia. or on the 1,626,100 sq ft (151,070 sq m) parking/delivery apron at the Wichita plant pending urgent modification. The basic design of the B-29 was sound, but significant shortcuts had been taken in the rush to get it into service, causing numerous defects and quality problems. The Boeing-run organization, which should have been getting the B-29s ready for battle, collapsed under the strain. The biggest headaches were caused by the new R-3350 engines, which were constantly overheating.Note: After the crash of the second prototype (41-1003) into a factory building in Seattle, resulting from in-flight engine fire, General Hap Arnold ordered an investigation, which found numerous problems with the basic engine design. These were never fully resolved and the B-29 was to continue to suffer from overheating engines for the rest of the Second World War. Other problems arose with defective pressure seals around the cockpit windows and sighting blisters, which needed precise fitting to avoid leakage. Also causing problems were the sighting systems (four analog computers)Note: Four gunners in a fully armed B-29 were able to control the four gun turrets using sighting computers in two pressurized crew compartments. The tail gunner, in a pressurized compartment under the rudder was only able to control his guns.B-29 remote control gunnery system for the remote controlled defensive armament, as well as the turrets themselves. Then came electrical failures, caused by faulty Cannon plugs, which supplied connections throughout the ten miles (16 km) of wiring in each B-29. Sub- standard glass in the cockpit transparencies meant the pilots had problems due to the distortion. A minor \\"beef-up\\" was found to be needed on the wing structures. Along with the main problems constant alterations to other components were needed as the Army changed requirements and as updated components from external suppliers replaced those already in use. Finally, in June 1942 an extra complication was added when it was decided to use the Boeing-Wichita plant to build 750 CG-4 Waco gliders. As a result, the first production B-29s that rolled off the lines at Wichita were virtually hand built. It was discovered that there were some surprising weight differences from one plane to the next: this was caused by commercial weight tolerances in raw materials and because of the cumulative effects of small tolerances in the assembly process. =General Hap Arnold's demands= Boeing Wichita B-29 assembly line. When General Arnold visited the Wichita Plant on 11 January 1944 he wanted 175 combat ready B-29s for the XX Bomber Command. As he was shown around the assembly lines he picked out the 175th fuselage section and signed it commenting: \\"This is the plane I want. I want it before the First of March.\\"Note: Rolled out on 28 February 1944 this B-29 became the Gen. H. H. Arnold Special with the 468th BG. Ironically it was to force-land in Vladivostok USSR and became one of the pattern aircraft for the Tupolev Tu-4. When he discovered two months later that no B-29s were actually combat ready, and that some had been sitting waiting for parts for two months or more Arnold was livid. In March 1944 General Bennett Meyers was given full authority to act under Arnold's name to get the B-29s modified and combat ready. Specialist USAAF ground crew and technicians were called in from all over the country and 600 workers were pulled from the Wichita assembly lines. Subcontractors were told to stop all work on non-B-29 components until they had fulfilled their commitments. With the thermometer often reading below zero the 1,200 technicians who had gathered at the Wichita factory and the Modification Centers were being asked to modify each bomber inside and out. First, the wings needed to have some of the plating removed, the required \\"beef-ups\\" were added, and then each piece of skin riveted back in place. At the same time, the cowl flaps, which controlled airflow through and around the troublesome engines, were being modified. Each piece of glass installed in the nose had to be pulled out and replaced with new distortion free panes. After that, the pressurization had to be rechecked: 75 B-29s in total needed new glass. Internally every electrical plug had to be removed, disassembled, and resoldered ‚Äì a total of 586,000 connections in completed aircraft, plus those on the assembly lines and in wiring harnesses ready for installation. A lot of the work was being done in the middle of the frequent snow-storms: it was so cold crews could only work for 20 minutes at a time, with most of the jobs requiring delicate handling. =Wright Duplex Cyclone engines improved= One major challenge was pulling all of the Wright R-3350-23 Duplex-Cyclone radial engines out of already completed B-29s and modifying them to R-3350-23A \\"war engine\\" standard. This entailed disassembling and rebuilding the engines with added baffles to accelerate the airflow over the cylinders, new exhaust valves with improved metallurgy, new rocker arms (drilled with small holes, to allow better oil flow, rather than solid), and modified nose casings and engine sumps, again to improve oil flow. In sub-zero temperatures the work was arduous, especially when it came to struggling with stiff and brittle fuel and oil lines and hard-to-reach clamps, bolts, and screws. Other necessary modifications, apart from those already described, were replacing the rudders with strengthened units, all main landing gear tires were replaced, and the main gear leg structures reinforced. APQ-13 radar sets had to be fitted. Finally, long range fuel tanks were installed in the bomb bays. After about five weeks of exhausting work the first combat-ready B-29s started taking off on the first leg of the long journey to China. General Arnold had won the \\"Battle of Kansas\\" and was getting his 175 combat-ready Superfortresses. References =Bibliography= * Phillips, Ed. \\"Boeing's Battle of Wichita\\".

The elevation of Sierra City is , and the town is situated in the canyon of the North Yuba River on California State Route 49, twelve miles northeast of the county seat of Sierra County, Downieville. The population was 221 at the 2010 census. History Before the California Gold Rush, only Native Americans had ventured into the area, which lies northwest of Lake Tahoe on the western slope of the Sierra Nevada, and which lay between areas inhabited by Maidu, Nisenan, and Washo peoples (Pre-Contact Tribal Map). The area is now part of the Tahoe National Forest. A settlement was established in 1850 by Philo A. Haven and Joseph Zumwalt, who were also involved with the settling of Downieville (Sinnott). In the Winter of 1852-53, however, an avalanche of snow destroyed the settlement, which was not rebuilt for several years. Ferdinand, Gustav, and Christian Reis purchased several mining claims near the Sierra Buttes and began to resettle Sierra City, which had a peak population of 3,000 during the decade after gold was discovered in California (1849). Numerous hard-rock gold mines were developed on both sides of the North Yuba River Canyon near Sierra City. These include the Colombo Mine, the Independence Mine, the Keystone Mine, the Monumental Mine, the Great Sierra Buttes Mine, and the William Tell Mine. The Monumental Nugget, weighing over 106 pounds avoirdupois, was recovered in September 1869. Placer mining was also practiced and continues today on the banks of the North Yuba. On February 10, 1963, Alec M. Ostrom of Sierra City discovered a nugget weighing 8 troy ounces while placer mining (Sinnott.) Historic buildings Historic buildings that remain in Sierra City include the two-story brick Busch Building, which the Wells Fargo Company occupied in the 19th century, and the Masonic Lodge, both of which sit on the town's main street, which is Highway 49. The town hall, a log structure, was built after World War II, and a new post office, dedicated in 1969, features stone work in which antique mining implements, including an ore-car, are embedded. The Bigelow House, a Victorian structure, is situated near the town's southwestern limits. The cemetery contains gravestones dating back to the 1860s. Recent times Today the town-limits signs list Sierra City's population as 225. The main industry is tourism. None of the nearby hard-rock mines are in operation, but the Kentucky mine just outside the town limits now houses a mining museum. In the summer months, fishing in the North Yuba and its tributaries and in nearby alpine lakes is popular, as is mountain-biking, placer-mining, and hiking. A cluster of sheer rock peaks known as the Sierra Buttes (Latitude: 39.59351, Longitude: -120.64105), 7,818 feet high, is just 1.6 miles from Sierra City and towers over the town. Many trails cross the area, and the Pacific Crest Trail crosses the flanks of the Sierra Buttes some 2,000 feet above the town. Wild Plum Campground is a little more than a mile away on Haypress Creek. The nearest public school is 12 miles away in Downieville.

CVT's mission is to heal the wounds of torture on individuals, their families and their communities, and to end torture worldwide and it has won the APA International Humanitarian Award from the American Psychological Association Since its founding in 1985, CVT has: * Rehabilitated over 30,000 survivors through direct healing. * Engaged in post-conflict community building after some of the world's deadliest wars, working in Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Democratic Republic of Congo, Jordan and Kenya. * Pioneered research in torture survivor rehabilitation to better understand the effects of torture and how best to heal survivors. * Led efforts to end the practice of torture by the US government, including President Obama's executive order banning torture and cruel treatment. CVT provides care for survivors at its healing center in St. Paul, Minnesota and at projects in Jordan, the Dadaab refugee camps in Kenya, Nairobi, Kenya, Uganda and in northern Ethiopia working with Eritrean refugees. It has an office in Washington D.C. The Center for Victims of Torture is a 501(c)(3) organization that is recognized by the Charities Review Council, the American Institute of Philanthropy, and Charity Navigator for its well-managed use of donations.  History  CVT was founded as a result of actions by Minnesota Governor Rudy Perpich. Gov. Perpich directed a committee of human rights experts to research various initiatives to support human rights in Minnesota. The most ambitious proposal from this group was a rehabilitation center for survivors of torture. Governor Perpich embraced the idea. He appointed a task force which traveled to Copenhagen, Denmark, to visit the first treatment center in the world, the Rehabilitation Center for Torture Victims (today known as DIGNITY - Danish Institute Against Torture).Leduc, Daniel (October 18, 1987). \\"Torture: Innovative Centers Help Heal Broken Bodies, Spirits\\". The Ledger (Lakeland, Florida). Retrieved via Google News, 2019-09-08. The task force recommended that such a center be established in Minnesota. = A Home for Healing = CVT was founded in 1985 as an independent, nongovernmental organization. For the first two years care was provided at the International Clinic of St. Paul Ramsey Medical Center. In 1987, CVT moved to a more home-like, less institutional setting that would feel welcoming to survivors. Today, CVT provides care from the St. Paul Healing Center. The house was designed to meet the needs of torture survivors, with domestic furnishings, large windows and rooms with rounded or angled corners to create an environment much different from the stark, square rooms with glaring lights that most torture survivors experienced. = Expanding Healing Services = CVT's international work began in Bosnia and Croatia in 1993. During the war, CVT psychotherapists traveled to the region to train care providers in the specialized treatment of torture survivors. In 1995, CVT began working with centers in Turkey to strengthen the skills of medical professionals and nongovernmental organizations that work with survivors. In 1999, CVT launched its first international direct healing program working with Sierra Leonean refugees in Guinea, West Africa. They provided direct mental health counseling to refugees who were suffering from torture and trauma due to the multiple conflicts in the region. CVT psychotherapists also trained residents of the refugee camps as paraprofessional psychosocial peer counselors ‚Äì peer mental health counselors ‚Äì who continue to support a local mental health network after the program finished in 2005. = Supporting Rehabilitation Services for Survivors = CVT has launched a number of training initiatives to build more resources for appropriate and sensitive care of torture survivors. CVT provides training and technical assistance to torture survivor rehabilitation centers in the United States through a program called the National Capacity-Building project (NCB) and abroad through its project Partners in Trauma Healing (PATH). Training initiatives are designed to build a network of healing professionals where few exist, and for those who participate in a CVT training project to continue providing healing services long after CVT leaves a country. = Advocating for Survivors = CVT established a presence in Washington D.C. in 1992, with a volunteer representing CVT. At the time, CVT learned that the United States was withholding funds pledged to the United Nations Voluntary Fund for Victims of Torture, an agency that provides financial support to torture survivor rehabilitation centers worldwide. CVT worked with faith-based groups and the human rights community to secure the release of nearly $400,000 ‚Äì at the time, the largest contribution in the history of the UN Fund. Since then, CVT continued to cultivate bipartisan support for healing survivors of torture. The Torture Victims Relief Act, originating with former Senator Dave Durenberger (R-MN), authorizes federal support for torture survivor rehabilitation programs in the U.S. and abroad. As a result of TVRA, since 2000 the United States has been the world's largest donor to torture survivor rehabilitation. In 1998 CVT organized domestic centers into the National Consortium of Torture Treatment Programs and provides training on advocacy and building constituency. In addition to seeking financial support for torture rehabilitation, CVT collaborated with the National Religious Campaign Against Torture and Evangelicals for Human Rights to advocate against the use of torture by the U.S. government since September 11, 2001. = Torture Survivor Rehabilitation =  International Healing Services  CVT provides direct care to torture survivors in areas of the world where few mental health resources are available. Working in refugee camps and areas where conflict has devastated entire communities, CVT trains local community members to meet the mental health needs in their communities for the long term.  Healing Survivors of Torture and War  CVT provides counseling and community mental health activities to adults and children who suffered torture and war trauma. Most survivors receive small group counseling. These small groups meet weekly for about ten weeks, and, depending on the nature of the trauma, might be divided into different populations including adults, children, men and women, girls and boys. Survivors with severe trauma symptoms receive private individual counseling, with many joining small group counseling when they are able. CVT international healing projects help an average of 1,600 torture and war trauma survivors each year. Survivors receiving care from CVT are followed closely to measure their healing. CVT research consistently report significant decreases in mental health symptoms such as anxiety and depression, as well as decreases in somatic (physical) symptoms. Survivors also express more hope for the future and better relationships after receiving help from CVT.  Training Peer Counselors  In addition to providing direct mental health services, CVT trains members of the community and the refugee population to be skilled group counselors, advocates, educators and trainers. The goal is to develop mental health resources where none existed before. These paraprofessional mental health counselors undergo an intensive orientation and basic training period. Then they participate in small group counseling sessions with a professional psychotherapist experienced in torture and trauma recovery. Throughout their work with CVT, they receive ongoing professional training and daily mentoring with a professional psychotherapist modeling, observing and giving feedback after every counseling session and activity. Former counselors trained by CVT have been hired by the International Criminal Court, the Special Court for Sierra Leone and other organizations where extensive mental health expertise is required.  Community Awareness  CVT conducts training and awareness-raising activities in the local communities, including teachers, religious and local leaders to help them understand the effects of torture on individuals and communities. CVT initiates non-counseling activities such as sports, games, drama, art and play therapy to engage the whole community in the healing process and reach out to survivors who could benefit from CVT services. Every year, thousands of community members learn of CVT through these activities.  Culturally Sensitive Care  A hallmark of CVT's international healing services is the combination of contemporary Western psychotherapy approaches with culturally appropriate methods of healing. This approach was adopted in its first international healing initiative in Guinea, where CVT psychotherapists and the peer counselors included ritual, storytelling and song in the healing process. That practice continues by adapting counseling to incorporate culturally appropriate traditions, concepts and customs into the healing process. The psychotherapists are highly skilled trauma therapists who have worked in culturally diverse environments. CVT international healing projects are funded by the State Department Bureau of Population, Refugees and Migration, the European Union, the United Nations Voluntary Fund for Victims of Torture, and USAID and the American people. = Minnesota Healing Services = In Minnesota all healing services are provided on an outpatient basis at CVT's St. Paul Healing Center. The Center is located in a renovated Victorian home to create a comfortable and welcoming environment. Each survivor works with a team of specialists who provide: * Medical treatment, including psychiatric services and referrals to specialists as needed * Nursing care to help monitor physical conditions and facilitate referrals to specialists * Psychotherapy with a psychologist, marriage and family therapist or clinical social worker * Social services to connect survivors with other organizations and basic needs, and to provide case management to reduce the need for more intensive interventions such as hospitalization * Massage, occupational and physical therapies to increase mobility and relieve physical pain For survivors who don't speak English, interpreters play an integral role in the healing process. = Stages of healing = Torture is an attack on all aspects of a person's life. Its effects reach beyond the individual to the family and the community. As part of the holistic healing approach, survivors in Minnesota receive individual and group counseling. The counseling addresses individual situations while helping survivors learn how to trust and rebuild relationships for a more fulfilling life. CVT's healing teams guide survivors through three stages of healing: * Safety and Stabilization: re-establishing health and trust; discussing legal resources and processes; ensuring clients have housing, clothing, food and medical care. * Grief and Mourning: working through what happened. * Reconnection: getting back to community and life purpose and developing and repairing relationships with friends and family. Support Services When a survivor is ready to reconnect with the community, volunteers provide important support services, such as teaching survivors how to read a bus schedule and navigate public transportation, tutoring survivors in English, accompanying survivors on visits to a museum, library, concert, coffee shop or grocery store. = Training =  National Capacity Building Project  The National Capacity Building Project (NCB) focuses on building networks of rehabilitation centers and service providers, fostering knowledge- sharing and relationship-building among colleagues in the field, and providing expert professional training and technical assistance. Training for torture treatment professionals focuses on: * Clinical skills and best practices * Organizational development and fundraising * Program management * Data collection and program evaluation  HealTorture.org  HealTorture.org serves as a rich repository of information related to torture survivors and their treatment and healing. Through webinar trainings, professional journal articles and publications, bibliographies, treatment manuals, and other online resources, the site hosts a wealth of valuable information intended for psychologists and various therapists, social workers, physicians and nurses, lawyers, and administrators. The website also serves as a portal to other centers and organizations that work with and support survivors of torture.  New Tactics in Human Rights  New Tactics in Human Rights Project is an education program providing resources relating strategies and tactics that can be used by people who seek to advance human rights. These resources have been used by activists in panel discussions, by over 60 local groups for both technical and financial help and for training programs. New Tactics is a project of the Center for Victims of Torture started in 1999. New Tactics identifies its efforts as focused on three areas: \\"creating and sharing information and materials\\", \\"training and mentoring\\" and \\"building an online community\\". Resources are organized around analysis of potential solutions rather than that of specific issues, geographic regions or target groups that allow activists to clearly recognize the unique elements of their situation, and to seek approaches that have worked elsewhere and apply them to new regions or issues. This technique may also improve activists‚Äô ability to combine diverse tactics into complex strategies. =Methods= In person training such as regional workshops in which activists train each other in tactics they have used and develop \\"tactical portfolios\\" of practical tools for applying new tactics. Seven workshops have been held, the most recent in Liberia in February 2007, focusing on post-conflict tactics for rebuilding civil society. Publications including the book New Tactics in Human Rights: A Resource for Practitioners, which offers a conceptual framework for thinking strategically and tactically to promote human rights, and gives dozens of examples of innovative tactics, categorized by the strategic situation in which they were used. Other publications include the Tactical Notebook Series (Liam Mahoney, series editor) created by participants from the regional cross- training workshops, that provide first-person, detailed information on the use of a tactic and how it may be adapted to other situations. New Tactics developed \\"Tactical Mapping\\" a methodology to help identify the relationships surrounding a human rights abuse, and the points in which the system can be interrupted or transformed, ranging from highly local, personal relationships (e.g., the perpetrator's professional associations) to international institutions (e.g., the United Nations). It allows a coalition of advocates to see where each is working on the system, and where there are gaps that need to be addressed, either by creating new tactics or finding new allies. Online presence, the New Tactics website has been recognized as a resource for human rights activists. The website provides access to a searchable database with 49 \\"Tactic Case Studies\\" and \\"over 190 specific and successfully implemented human rights tactics and peer-to-peer dialogs with human rights practitioners in more than 130 countries.\\" The project's website also includes online discussion courses, tools for sharing and networking and a monthly discussion, named \\"Tactical Dialog\\", of a featured tactic (examples include: unarmed accompaniment; engaging the media; or using historical sites to spark discussion of current issues). New Tactics also publishes an e-newsletter highlighting specific tactics and information for inspiring innovation and the blog InterTactica by Philippe Duhamel.  PATH Project  Partners in Trauma Healing (PATH) creates a network of rehabilitation professionals who provide intellectual and emotional support for the difficult work of providing healing services to torture survivors. PATH works with ten centers focusing on three areas: mental health treatment and healing, monitoring and evaluation, and organizational development.

Plot summary The book is a mystery thriller set inside an alternative history in which the United Kingdom made peace with Adolf Hitler in 1941. In 1949, Britain has slid into fascist dictatorship. When a bomb explodes in a London suburb, Scotland Yard Inspector Peter Carmichael is assigned to the case. He finds a web of conspiracy and a plot to murder both Britain's new Prime Minister and Adolf Hitler during the latter's Friendship visit to London. Carmichael's professional ethics became compromised during a previous case involving the aristocratic and political establishment, which may affect his ability to handle the case at hand. Life is complicated for Viola Lark as well; she abandoned the upper-class environment of her family and lost touch with her five very different sisters (who are inspired by the real-life Mitford sisters) when she chose to become an actress. Viola is given the role of a lifetime and has hard decisions to make since she becomes caught up in family politics.

Following the success that Continental Copters had enjoyed in converting Bell 47 airframes into specialized agricultural machines as the El Tomcat, the firm embarked on a project of creating a turbine-powered equivalent by converting a Bell 206. Like the El Tomcat, the Jet-Cat was to be only a single-seat aircraft with a fuselage radically reconfigured from its original design. The Jet-Cat was also equipped to carry slung loads. Work began in 1976, but was soon interrupted in favour of a similar project to transform a Bell 204. Development of the Jet- Cat resumed the following year, and the aircraft (registration N9097T) made its first flight early in 1978.

The Society was an offshoot of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, and from its beginnings it was a rather elite organization. The Society was named after Abraham Gottlob Werner, a German geologist who was a creator of Neptunism, a theory of superposition based on a receding primordial ocean that had deposited all the rocks in the crust.Scholarly Societies Project , Wernerian Natural History Society.

Robert Jameson, Regius Professor of Natural History at the University of Edinburgh, was the founder and life president of the Society. In 1800, he spent a year at the mining academy in Freiberg, Saxony, where he studied under Werner.

More than twelve of Jameson's papers on geology and mineralogy were published in these volumes, and he also contributed some on zoology and botany. Proceedings after 1839 were published in Jameson's Edinburgh New Philosophical Journal. The Society hosted many of the notable scientists of its day. Decline There were no meetings from 1850‚Äì1856, which coincided with the decline of Jameson himself. It was eventually decided to close the Society down and dispose of its assets, and it finally closed on 16 April 1858.

From 1849, he was a full member of the Saint Petersburg Academy of Arts.  Biography  Mokritsky was born in August 1810, in Pyriatyn, Poltava Governorate, modern day Ukraine.Mokrytsky, Apollon. Encyclopedia of Ukraine, vol. 3. (1993) His early art education was completed at the Nizhyn Lyceum of Prince Bezborodko, under the supervision of Kapiton Pavlov. After this, he studied at the St. Petersburg Academy of Art between 1830 and 1839, under Alexey Venetsianov and later with Karl Briullov. A year after completing his studies, he worked in Ukraine and visited Italy. Around 1850, he was appointed \\"an academician of painting\\"Spirit of Ukraine: 500 Years of Painting. Winnipeg Art Gallery. 1991, pg. 192 . at the Moscow School of Painting, Sculpture, and Architecture. He preferred to work in portraiture, representing \\"the Biedermeier school of uncontrolled Realist art which exhibited romantic overtones\\". Artist's Wife is one example of this style. Others include portraits of Yevhen Hrebinka (1840) and Nikolai Gogol, a self- portrait (1840), and numerous Italian landscapes. He is known for the significant role he played in the life of Taras Shevchenko, Ukraine's national poet and artist, who was born a serf. He introduced Shevchenko to the Russian and Ukrainian intelligentsia: artists Karl Briullov and Alexey Venetsianov, poet Vasily Zhukovsky, writer Yevhen Hrebinka, intellectuals Panteleimon Kulish, Vasyl Hryhorovych and others.

A mechanical swather A swathe (: rhymes with \\"bathe\\") or swath (: rhymes with \\"cloth\\") is the width of a scythe stroke or a mowing-machine blade, the path of this width made in mowing or the mown grass or grain lying on such a path. The mower with a scythe moves along the mowing-edge with the uncut grass to the right and the cut grass laid in a neat row to the left, on the previously mown land. The swathe width depends on the blade length, the nature of the crop and the mower but is usually about 1.5 metres wide. Mowing may be done by a team of mowers, usually starting at the edges of a meadow then proceeding clockwise leaving a series of staggered swathes and finishing in the middle.http://www.motherearthnews.com/homesteading-and-livestock/how-to-use-a- scythe-zmaz81mjzraw.aspx The mower swings the scythe steadily in long, left handed arcs ending in front of the mower and depositing the cut grass neatly to the left. The mower takes a small step forward and repeats the motion, proceeding with a steady rhythm, stopping at frequent intervals to hone the blade. The correct technique has a slicing action on the grass, cutting a narrow strip, leaving a uniform stubble on the ground and forming a regular windrow on the left. The scythe has generally been replaced by machinery such as the swather pictured, or combine harvester which still leaves a swathe to its left but is very much wider than the scythe. Early in the introduction of machinery it was still necessary for mowers with scythes to open up a swathe wide enough to take the machine before it could start  Swath width  By analogy, Swath width also refers to the width of any repetitively cut or treated strip. For example, the strip of the Earth‚Äôs surface from which geographic data are collected by a moving vehicle such as a satellite, aircraft or ship in the course of swath mapping. The longitudinal extent of the swath is defined by the motion of the vehicle with respect to the surface, whereas the swath width is measured perpendicularly to the longitudinal extent of the swath. Swath width is also cited in the context of sonar specifications. It is measured and represented in metres or kilometres. Swath width of a satellite.

Early life and career Edwin M. Watson was born on December 10, 1883 in Eufaula, Alabama. Raised in Virginia, he was the son of a businessman in the tobacco industry. He attended the United States Military Academy at West Point, among contemporaries George S. Patton and Jonathan Wainwright. Watson entered with the Class of 1906 on June 16, 1902 but was discharged for a deficiency in mathematics on April 9, 1903. He was readmitted as a plebe on August 23, 1903 but resigned in the middle of his third class year on December 29, 1904. He re-entered the Academy as a member of the third class in August 1905 and graduated in the Class of 1908. His classmates gave him the nickname \\"Pa\\" for his precociously-parental ways and wisdom. He was commissioned a second lieutenant in the Infantry. He served overseas twice, in the Philippines and Mexico, before he was transferred back to the United States in 1915. There, he gained his first experience with presidential service by acting as a junior military aide to President Woodrow Wilson. Shortly after America‚Äôs entry into the First World War in April 1917, Watson requested an active duty assignment with the American Expeditionary Force that was heading for the front in France. He served there for the remainder of the war, earning the US Army Silver Star and the Croix de Guerre from the French government. He remained in France for the Paris Peace Conference to write the Treaty of Versailles, which formally ended the First World War. There, he again worked for the adoption of President Wilson‚Äôs Fourteen Points to guide the postwar world. Association with Roosevelt He would continue this pattern of service until becoming Senior Military Aide to the newly-inaugurated President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1933. He helped Roosevelt navigate the bureaucracy of the War Department and the Army, especially during the crucial years prior to America‚Äôs entry into the Second World War. He was also appointed the President's Appointments secretary in 1938 after the illness of the previous secretary, Marvin H. McIntyre, prevented him from continuing with his duties, managing access to the President and dictating the tenor of his daily schedule. Watson lived with his wife, the professional pianist Frances Nash Watson, on a Virginia estate called Kenwood. The land, just beyond Monticello, was once owned by Thomas Jefferson, and the estate house was designed by Roosevelt's cousin, the celebrated architect William A. Delano. Watson and Roosevelt were personally close above and beyond their close professional ties, and Roosevelt adopted Kenwood as his \\"Camp David\\" during his presidency and retreated there on several occasions for vacation. The guest cottage was built in 1940-41 for Roosevelt, but he stayed there on only one occasion, preferring the social activity of the main house. On subsequent visits, including four days in June 1944 while he was awaiting the Normandy invasion, Roosevelt slept in the front bedroom of the main house. Mrs. Watson later bequeathed Kenwood to the University of Virginia, which, in turn, has leased the property to the Thomas Jefferson Foundation. Watson and Roosevelt's son James were the ones who enabled Roosevelt to stand and to walk on the occasions when he did. Roosevelt had to wear steel braces. Watson and James would on those occasions support him on his left arm. By virtue of his proximity to the President, Watson was present at some of the defining moments of the Second World War. These included a meeting about the Einstein‚ÄìSzilard letter, which would eventually lead to the creation of the Manhattan Project, and Roosevelt's agreement to the Atlantic Charter alongside British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, providing a framework for those values that would guide the postwar world. He was in constant contact with Generals Dwight D. Eisenhower and Douglas MacArthur and Admiral Chester W. Nimitz. He attended the Teheran Conference, where the first of the negotiations between Roosevelt, Churchill, and Soviet Premier Joseph Stalin took place. Although in poor health, he attended the Yalta Conference in February 1945 as well, where the Big Three negotiated for the future of Europe. On the return voyage, he suffered a fatal cerebral hemorrhage and died at sea. Watson was buried with full military honors in Arlington Cemetery with the President in attendance. The President himself died two months later in April. The War Department, in recognition of his service, posthumously awarded him the Distinguished Service Medal, which was presented by President Harry Truman and by Eleanor Roosevelt to his widow, Frances Nash Watson.

He had two noted brothers, mathematician Carl Gottfried Neumann (1832‚Äì1925) and economist (1835‚Äì1910). In 1855 he obtained his doctorate from Albertina Universit√§t K√∂nigsberg, where one of his instructors was Hermann von Helmholtz. He performed post-graduate studies in Prague, and in Berlin under Rudolf Virchow (1821‚Äì1902). From 1866 until 1903 he was in charge of the Pathological Institute at Konigsberg. Neumann was awarded honorary degrees from the Universities of T√ºbingen (1898) and Geneva (1914).

He coined the term myelogeneous leukemia, (today's acute myeloid leukemia), and described in 1882 the law of dissemination concerning yellow and red bone marrow: \\"Again, it was Neumann who provided us with the classic statement. In 1882, he enunciated the rule governing the development of yellow marrow. In effect, he recognized a phenomenon that is sometimes referred to us as \\"Neumann's law\\". It states that at birth all bones that contain marrow contain red marrow. With age, the blood producing activity contracts toward the center of the body, leaving the more peripheral bones with only fatty marrow. For about 50 years, students of the marrow did not know what to make of this phenomenon\\"Tavassoli, M.: Bone Marrow: The Seedbed of Blood, in Wintrobe, M.M: Blood, pure and eloquent.

First announcement: Bone Marrow is the bloodforming organ: 1868-10-10 Beside, you find the first announcement of the bone marrow as blood forming organ. Translation: In the so-called red bone marrow of man as well as the rabbit, one can regularly find, in addition to the well known marrow cell, certain other elements which have not been mentioned until now; namely nucleated red blood cells, in every respect corresponding to embryonic stages of the red blood cells. Also is the marrow rich in fat, the same cells are present but in lower quantity and their number decreases parallel to the decrease in the number of marrow cells and the increase in the number of fat cells (see above \\"Neumann-Law\\"). It is possible, to trace the origin of these elements in the blood of the marrow cells The high content of colorless elements in the blood of the marrow makes it likely that these is a migration of contractile marrow cells into the vessels. A thorough description of my observations will be published. In 1869, Neumann described the \\"lymphoid marrow cell\\" in the bone marrow.Neumann, E.: √úber die Bedeutung des Knochenmarks f.d. Blutbildung, Ein Beitrag zur Entwicklungsgesch. der Blutk√∂rperchen, Archiv f. Heilkunde 10 (1869) 68-102 (Wagners Archiv) \\"It is evident, that a continuing transformation of lymphoid cells into coloured blood cells takes place in the bone marrow during the whole life\\" (Neumann 1869 and B.P., p.19). This \\"lympoid marrow cell\\" forms not only the erythropoiesis but it is capable (in itself) to self regeneration: \\"In order of the size differences of the lymphoid marrow-cells, we will be able to suppose that a permanent fluctuation will take place in the bone marrow\\" (Neumann 1869 and B.P. p.30). Until 1912 Neumann called the stem cell \\"lymphocyte\\", \\"great lymphocyte\\" or \\"lymphomyeloblast\\". Since that time, he declared: \\"The different forms of all blood cells happening in the blood, the lymph-organs and in the bone marrow are all descendants of the great- lymphocytic stem cell.\\" (Neumann 1912, also B.P., page 313). \\"In which way this stem cell completes itself again and again, whether exclusively by a mitotic division or also from other cells particularly from cells of the mesenteric tissue, may be discussed\\" (Neumann 1912, also B.P. page 313). Neumann was advocate of the Unitarien Point of View: All blood cells shall be descended from this post embryonic stem cell. As it is well known, a quarrel broke out between dualists and unitarians (Paul Ehrlich). Neumann's farsightedness demanded a stem cell culture for the completion of the quarrel: \\"Perhaps a final decision will only arrive, if it possible, to isolate the individual colourless cells and to study its life events in vitro culture for some time, as Robert Koch demonstrated with the bacteria\\" (Neumann 1912, B.P., p. 329).

New York, 1983, p.64 \\"Neumanns discovery was announced in the form of a preliminary report (10.10.1868). The promised thorough description appeared the next year in an extensive article (1869). In the interim, two communications appeared in Italian and were soon translated in the Centralblatt (late 1868 and late 1869). They were both by G.Bizzozero, Turin. ‚Ä¶ Of the two, Neumann was a more persistent student of the subject. He continued his work on the marrow, and toward the end of the century produced other classic contributions. Among his \\"firsts\\" were the identification of leukemia and of pernicious anemia as diseases of the marrow. He coined the term myelogeneous leukemia. Like Immanuel Kant, Neumann preferred to remain a lifelong citizen of Koenigsberg, where he taught and worked almost all his life on blood production and blood pigments. His superb literary taste, reflected in his masterful German writings, provides the profile of a German scholar in the classical sense. ... Despite the intensity of the search, Neumanns observations did not catch on easily. His ideas were received with the same skepticism with which Immanual Kant's Critique of Pure Reason had been greeted almost a century before. Neumann was supported by Bizzozero and by Claude Bernard, but there were also Pouchet and Hayem to repudiate him and Robin to accuse him of adding to the confusion by postulating yet another theory. Georges Hayem wrote an entire book in repudiation of Bizzozero. The preface of this book, despite a hauhty tone, is but a -lamentoso- for plausible theories that were about to sink. Later, in reference to Hayem, Jolly deplored the \\"unfortunate\\" influence that did not permit Neumann's theory to be accepted universally for about 20 years\\" 1985:Wintrobe, M. : Hematology, the Blossoming of a Science; a Story of Inspiration and Effort.

Greyman are an Australian breed of beef cattle developed in Queensland in the 1970s, specifically to suit the Queensland environment, by combining the outstanding genetic characteristics of both the Murray Grey and Brahman breeds. These cattle carry between 25% and 75% of Murray Grey blood, with the remainder made up of Brahman. This allows breeders the option of being able to select for optimal performance specific to the region and environmental conditions. Thus, Greymans can be bred with a greater emphasis on Brahman content in the tropical country, or with a higher percentage of Murray Grey blood to suit the southern states. Their sleek coats varying in colour from dark grey to a silver, the Greyman are natural polls and have a dark skin pigmentation that is not susceptible to skin or eye problems in severe climates. Greyman cattle offer breeders natural tick resistance, good mothering ability, drought and heat tolerance and efficient feed conversion. They are among the breeds that have been GeneSTAR tested positive for carrying copies of marbling and tenderness genes. Greymans were originally recorded within their own society, but the Greyman Society and its Herdbook were absorbed into the Murray Grey Beef Cattle Society in the mid 1990s, as part of the Murray Grey Composite Register.

The family held appanages in the valleys of Aragvi and Tedzami in the eastern province of Kakheti. The dynastic name Abuletidze (literally, \\"sons/descendants of Abulet\\") is derived from a male name Abulet. A person with this name appears as a commander under the Georgian king David IV (r. 1089-1125). He was among those nobles who recovered the fortress of Samshvilde from Seljuk Turks in 1110. Later, Abulet was a governor of Ani in 1124. He is last heard of in 1130. The Abuletisdze's loyalty to the crown was not permanent, however. In the early 12th century, they were among the most powerful vassals and rivals of the kings of Georgia. Thus, already in the reign of David IV, Dzagan Abuletisdze is reported to have defied the royal authority, but was eventually to take refuge at the Shio- Mghvime Monastery which surrendered him to the king. Dzagan's brother Modistos was a catholicos of the Georgian Orthodox Church, and was removed from this position by the same king.Lordkipanidze, Mariam (1987; translated and edited by George B. Hewitt), Georgia in the XI-XII centuries, p. 81, Ganatleba (Online version). We next hear of Abulet's son Ivane and grandson Kirkish (Tirkash) who served as the commanders of Georgian troops in Armenia, but subsequently plotted the murder of King Demetrius I, probably to place the king's half-brother Vakhtang on the throne. The king was timely warned and survived. He had Ivane murdered in 1132, while Kirkash fled to the Seljukid sultan of the Shah-Armenid state centered at Akhlat. The sultan enfeoffed him with Arsharunik whence he launched several raids into Georgia. Kirkish was eventually captured and cast into prison by Demetrius. When Demetrius was temporarily overthrown by his son David V, was restored to favor and granted the office of amirspasalar of which the rival Orbeli clan was dispossessed by the new king. Demetrius, once restored to the throne shortly thereafter, again gave the post to the Orbeli.Robert Bedrosian, \\"Amirspasalar\\", in: Joseph Reese Strayer (1983), Dictionary of the Middle Ages, p. 235. Scribner, . Yet, the members of this family remained among the high nobility of Georgia, and were titled as eristavt-eristavs. One of them, Dzagan featured prominently in the Mongol capture of Baghdad in 1258, and returned with a substantial wealth of booty through which he acquired the village of Angroini and donated it to the Shio-Mghvime Monastery. Later in the 13th century, the family went in decline. By 1405, their fiefdom in Kakheti had passed to a branch of the Abazasdze.

It uses the trademarked \\"Malibu Model\\" of treatment, which allows patients more freedom and privatized treatment. Overview The company was started by Richard Rogg. Elements Behavioral Health now owns Promises. The Company is supported by Frazier Healthcare, a venture capital firm. Promises is not licensed to provide physician or medical services. In 2004, the state of California cited the organization for providing medical services, administering TB tests and having doctors conduct physical exams. Promises stopped the practice as a result. The Company is also known to make significant financial contributions to the campaigns of government officials who oversee their treatment center license. Elements was sued in the spring of 2016 by United Healthcare for insurance fraud on urinalysis testing. Case 9:16-cv-80649-RLR The case is being heard by a Federal Court in Palm Beach County, Florida. The lawsuit prompted Frazier Healthcare to install its own CEO and terminate the employment of many staff members in Element's upper management. This included some in the HR Department, the VP, and CFO. Since 2013, there have been at least two known drug overdoses while in treatment. One patient died on the premises and the other later at the hospital. For its treatment method, Promises uses the term \\"Malibu Model\\" which it registered in 2004 as a service mark. The Malibu Model differs from traditional models by allowing patients more liberty and providing privatized treatment, in contrast to regular rehab involving peer groups, never leaving the facility, and limited visitors. The Malibu Model has come under criticism, with some critics claiming the model prioritizes the rehabilitation of public relations rather than addiction treatment.Rehab - Is Rehab a Publicity Tool for Public Figures? As of 2014, the fee for a one-month stay is $57,000 which must be paid in advance and is non-refundable if the client leaves or is expelled prior to completion of the stay. According to the Los Angeles Times, the no-refund policy has prompted a number of lawsuits. These remaining funds may be available to the client should they decide to return to the facility.The trouble with rehab, Malibu-style, Los Angeles Times, October 9, 2007 Promises' clientele has included actress Lindsay Lohan singer Britney Spears, writer and comedian Harris Wittels, musician Ville Valo and musician Marilyn Manson. In late 2017, Elements closed the California Promises locations after being grossly mismanaged. After a series of executive decision-making blunders, the facilities were no longer able to hold a profitable census.

The tower was designed by Vincent Kling & Associates and completed in 1972. The building was demolished in 1999, as a result of damage of a fire that began on February 23, 1991. The fire began on the 22nd floor and raged out of control for hours. An investigation of the fire, led by the Office of the Fire Marshal of the City of Philadelphia with assistance from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives' (ATF) national investigative response team, determined the blaze started after linseed oil‚Äìsoaked rags ignited. Philadelphia firefighters fought the blaze, but struggled due to a lack of power in the skyscraper and insufficient water pressure from the building's standpipes. Three firefighters died in the twelve-alarm fire after becoming disoriented by heavy smoke. Firefighting efforts inside One Meridian Plaza eventually were abandoned, due to fears the structure would collapse. The fire was only brought under control once it reached the 30th floor, which was one of the few floors that had automatic sprinklers installed. Ten sprinklers held back the fire until it started burning itself out and was finally brought under control almost a full day after it started. The blaze seriously damaged the building, destroying eight floors and damaging neighboring buildings. For eight years after the fire, One Meridian Plaza sat vacant and damaged‚Äîin the center of Philadelphia's business district. The building was caught in litigation between the owners and the insurance company over how much the insurers would pay the owners and how repairs or demolition would proceed. Businesses near the empty high-rise closed or moved and the city sued the owners to do something with the building. After lawsuits were settled, the building was declared a total loss and began to be dismantled in 1998. Building One Meridian Plaza was a 38-story high-rise office building designed by Vincent Kling & Associates. Construction on the tower began in 1968, was completed in 1972 and approved for occupancy in 1973. Built at the corner of 15th Street and South Penn Square in Center City, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the $40 million high-rise was built adjacent to the Girard Trust Building, now the Ritz-Carlton Philadelphia, and the front faced Philadelphia City Hall across the street. It was formerly named Three Girard Plaza (see below). The rectangular building was long and wide and contained . Of the 38 floors, 36 were occupiable and 2 were mechanical floors. The structure also had 3 underground levels. The building's structure was composed of steel and concrete and the facade was a granite curtain wall. There were two helipads on the roof. The building's eastern stairwell connected the building to the adjacent Girard Trust Building, known as Two Girard Plaza. At one point there were plans to build a structure to the south of the building that would share one of the elevator banks in the high-rise, but nothing came of the plans mainly because the two sites had different owners. On the northwest corner of the property is a bronze sculpture called \\"Triune.\\" Designed by Robert Engman the abstract sculpture was not damaged in the 1991 fire and was still there in 1999. The following year the builders of The Residences at The Ritz-Carlton announced that they were considering demolishing the sculpture. In the end the statue was retained and still stands at the location it was originally installed at as of 2014. When One Meridian Plaza was built Philadelphia was enforcing a building code from 1949 that made no distinction between high-rises and other buildings. In 1984 Philadelphia adopted new codes that required automatic sprinkler systems in all new buildings. At the time of construction, sprinklers were only built on the service levels below ground. In 1988 plans were put in place to have automatic sprinklers placed throughout the building by November 1993. By 1991 four floors were completely protected by sprinklers and three other floors were partially protected. The sprinklers had been installed during floor renovations at the request of tenants and the building's owners had plans to install more as other floors were renovated. The high-rise was originally known as the Fidelity Mutual Life Building, named for Fidelity Mutual Life Insurance Co. who developed the building in a joint venture with Girard Bank. The high-rise was the tallest building built in Philadelphia since the early 1930s. Girard Bank sold its share of the property, which was also known as Three Girard Plaza, to Fidelity Mutual Life in 1982. Fidelity Mutual Life, which had moved its offices out of the building to Radnor Township, Pennsylvania earlier that year, subsequently sold the building to E/R Partners in 1983. A joint venture of the Rubin Organization and Equitable Life Assurance Company of America, E/R Partners bought the property for $143 million. In 1989 a Dutch pension fund, Algemeen Burgerlijk Pensioenfonds, paid $120 million to enter E/R Partners with a sixty-five percent stake in the building. In 1984 Three Girard Plaza became the Three Mellon Bank Center after Girard Bank was bought by Mellon Bank, and in 1990 was renamed again to One Meridian Plaza after Meridian Bank replaced Mellon Bank as the lead tenant. Another major tenant was Comcast, who made of One Meridian Plaza its corporate headquarters in 1989. Fire On February 23, 1991, at about 8:23 PM, a fire began on the 22nd floor of the building. It was a Saturday night and there were only three people in the building at the time, an engineer and two security guards. Workers had been refinishing woodwork in a vacant office earlier in the day and workers left a pile of rags soaked in linseed oil on the floor. The linseed oil oxidized and generated enough heat to ignite the rags, which then set fire to other solvents nearby. Smoke detectors did not cover the entire floor and by the time the fire alarm went off the fire was already well established. After the fire alarm sounded in the building the engineer went up to the 22nd floor to investigate. When the elevator reached the 22nd floor the engineer found heavy smoke and heat that prevented him from reaching the elevator controls he needed to return to the lobby. The engineer escaped after radioing to a security guard in the lobby to recall the elevator using fire safety controls there. The second security guard was on the 30th floor when the alarm went off and used the stairwell to get to the ground floor. The lobby guard returned a call to the alarm monitoring service, which had called when the alarm initially went off to confirm that there was a fire, but never called the Philadelphia Fire Department. The first call came from someone on the street who saw smoke coming from the building. During the first 911 call, at about 8:27 PM, the alarm company alerted the fire department to the fire. Engine 43 was the first firefighting unit to arrive at the scene and reported seeing heavy smoke and flames in one of the windows. As firefighters started fighting the fire it had grown with flames breaking through windows and lapping up the side of the building. =Problems= Firefighters began experiencing problems before they even reached the fire. By the time firefighters reached the 11th floor the building had lost power after the heat from the blaze damaged electrical cables. The emergency generator never began producing electricity, and despite efforts to restore power the building was without electricity for the entirety of the event. This forced firefighters to work in darkness and without the aid of elevators. In addition, the transformers that provided power to the neighboring Girard Trust Building were in the basement of One Meridian Plaza. The transformers were eventually shut down due to water accumulation in the basement and firefighters directing water streams from that building had to do so without the aid of elevators. Firefighters were again hampered when it was discovered the pressure relief valves on the standpipes were improperly adjusted when installed in the building. The Philadelphia Fire Department nozzles allowed nozzle pressure while One Meridian Plaza's pressure relief valves were giving less than discharge pressure, which was not sufficient to fight the fire. It was several hours into the fire before a technician who could adjust the valves arrived at the scene. The area around the building was cleared of pedestrians and firefighting personnel because of falling glass and debris. The falling debris was dangerous for firefighters because they often had to cross the perimeter around the building to enter and leave the high- rise. Hose lines stretched into the building were damaged by falling debris and one firefighter was struck by debris and seriously injured while tending to the lines. =Lost firefighters= { style=\\"float:right; margin:1em; width:25em; border:1px solid #a0a0a0; padding:10px; background:#f5f5f5; text- align:left;\\" - style=\\"text-align:center;\\" Victims - style=\\"text- align:left;\\" Captain David P.

Chappell, age 29 } During the second hour of the fire it spread onto the 23rd and 24th floors. Heavy smoke was building up in the stairwells and a captain and two firefighters from Engine 11 were assigned to go to the top level to ventilate the stairwell. The three firefighters went up a center staircase from the 22nd floor and soon radioed that they were disoriented by heavy smoke on the 30th floor. There were attempts to direct the firefighters through the radio, and soon after the captain requested permission to break a window for ventilation, which was followed by a message that the captain was down. Permission to break the window was given and a search and rescue effort was initiated. Search teams were sent from the lower floors and searched the 30th floor, but did not find the missing firefighters. The teams then moved onto the upper levels where one team got lost on the 38th floor and ran out of air in their self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA). That team was rescued by a search team that had been placed on the roof by a helicopter. Rescue attempts continued until helicopter operations were suspended due to heavy smoke and thermal drafts caused by the blaze. Using a searchlight the helicopter crew searched the exterior of the building and at 1:17 AM February 23, the helicopter spotted a broken window on the 28th floor located in an area that could not be seen from the street. At about 2:15 AM a rescue team was sent to the spot and found the three missing firefighters unconscious and out of air in their SCBAs. The firefighters were taken to a medical triage set up on the 20th floor. There were attempts at resuscitation, but they were unsuccessful and the firefighters were pronounced dead. =Fire companies on scene= *1st/Box Alarm Assignment - Box 495 - 15th & Chestnut Streets Squirt 43, Engine 1, Engine 20 (Water Supply-LDH) Engine 11 (3 firefighter line of duty deaths from this company) Ladder 9, Snorkel 5 Medic 7 Battalion Chief 5, Battalion Chief 4 *2nd Alarm Assignment: Squirt 8, Engine 10, Engine 24, Engine 44, Engine 13 (Lobby Control) Ladder 23, Ladder 1 Medic 13 Battalion Chief 3 (Lobby Officer), Battalion Chief 11 Division (Deputy) Chief 1 Air Unit 2 *3rd Alarm Assignment: Engine 49 (Water Supply-LDH), Engine 40 (Water Supply-LDH), Engine 60 Battalion Chief 1 Chemical Unit 1, Chemical Unit 2 *4th Alarm Assignment: Engine 5 (Water Supply-LDH), Engine 29, Engine 16, Engine 3 (Water Supply-LDH), Engine 34 (Water Supply-LDH) Snorkel 2 Medic 21B, Medic 25B Battalion Chief 8 Air Unit 1 *5th Alarm Assignment: Engine 33, Engine 27, Engine 53, Engine 25 Ladder 11 Car 1 (Chief of Department) Light Wagon 1 *6th Alarm Assignment: Engine 12, Engine 22, Engine 50 (Water Supply-LDH), Engine 59 Medic 3 ES-10 (Decontamination Trailer) *7th Alarm Assignment: Squirt 57, Engine 63, Engine 14, Engine 28 (Water Supply- LDH) *8th Alarm Assignment: Engine 61 (Water Supply-LDH), Squirt 9, Engine 56, Engine 41 Ladder 13 Medic 16, Medic 1 Battalion Chief 2, Battalion Chief 10 Car 6 *9th Alarm Assignment: Engine 38, Engine 66, Engine 45, Engine 68 Ladder 18, Tower Ladder 6 Battalion Chief 1102 (Call-Back for Battalion Chief 2) *10th Alarm Assignment: Engine 72, Engine 18, Engine 7, Engine 2 Ladder 25 *11th Alarm Assignment: Engine 71, Engine 35, Engine 103 (Reserve), Engine 119 (Reserve) *12th Alarm Assignment: Engine 125 (Reserve), Engine 181 (Reserve), Engine 36, Engine 52 (Water Supply-LDH), Engine 180 (ARFF-Reserve-LDH), Engine 19 (Water Supply-LDH) Ladder 14 Rescue 1 (reactivated company for incident) Medic 15, Medic 14 Battalion Chief 13, Battalion Chief 9 Division (Deputy) Chief 1A =Fire's end= As the fire was going into its sixth hour it had spread up to the 26th floor. With inadequate water pressure coming from the standpipes, firefighters stretched hoses up the building's stairwells to help fight the fire. While hoses were being taken up to the fire a sprinkler technician arrived to fix the water pressure. This improved the hose streams, but the fire had engulfed several floors and could not be contained with just hoses. By 7:00 AM, almost eleven hours into the fire, firefighters were able to get control of the fire on the 22nd through 24th floors, but the fire was still out of control on the 25th and 26th floors and was spreading upwards. Structural damage observed inside the building by firefighters and consultations with a structural engineer led to fears that the damaged floors might collapse. At 7:00 AM an order to evacuate the building was issued by Fire Commissioner Roger Ulshafer, and the building was completely evacuated by 7:30 AM. After the evacuation, the only fire suppression efforts left were water streams being directed to the building from the neighboring Girard Trust Building and One Centre Square. The fire's spread only stopped when it reached the 30th floor, which was the first fire-affected floor to have automatic sprinklers. Ten sprinklers extinguished the fire on the 30th floor and prevented continued spread. Contained by the automatic sprinklers and running out of fuel, the fire was declared under control at 3:01 PM. The fire lasted over nineteen hours, destroyed eight floors, and killed three firefighters and injured twenty-four. Twelve alarms were called, which brought fifty-one engine companies, fifteen ladder companies, eleven specialized units, and over three hundred firefighters. The fire caused an estimated US$100 million in direct property loss. After the fire By February 26 city officials had determined One Meridian Plaza was not in danger of collapse. There was structural damage to horizontal steel beams and floor sections on most of the fire damaged floors. Under extreme fire exposure the beams and girders sagged and twisted and cracks appeared in the concrete floors. However, the overall structure was stable and able to support the weight of the building. Thermal expansion of the steel frame caused some of the granite panels to be dislodged from the building's facade. The streets and buildings around One Meridian Plaza were closed and cordoned off. The 20-story Morris Building and several three-story shops behind One Meridian Plaza on Chestnut Street were damaged by falling debris and sat unused for years until they were demolished in 2000. The neighboring Girard Trust Building, then called Two Mellon Plaza, experienced extensive water damage forcing the closure of the building. A bank in the building reopened a month later but the rest of the tower remained vacant for years. The roads around the building were closed for months after the fire, including a portion of two of Philadelphia's major streets, Broad and Market. The removal of the uninhabitable One Meridian Plaza from the real estate market and the sudden relocation of the building's tenants to other offices in Philadelphia took of real estate off the market. The city's office vacancy rate was 14.3 percent at the end of 1990; in the two months after the fire, the vacancy rate lowered to 10.7 percent. On December 18 Mayor Wilson Goode signed a law requiring every nonresidential building tall or taller have sprinklers installed by 1997. An estimated three hundred buildings in the city were affected by the law. =Vacant \\"eyesore\\"= In the years after the fire One Meridian Plaza stood in the middle of Philadelphia vacant. The fate of the building was undecided as the building's owners and its insurer, Aetna, prepared for litigation on how to proceed with repairs, who would control those repairs, and at what cost. E/R Partners proposed deconstructing the building to its 19th floor, then rebuilding from there. Aetna claimed that girders above the 19th level could be repaired and used, cutting $115 million in repair costs from the owner's $250 million estimate. Aetna also proposed taking over the reconstruction. E/R Partners spent $50 million securing One Meridian Plaza and up to $500,000 a month on security guards, utilities, and inspections by engineers while the building stood empty. Lawsuits on behalf of 16 people and businesses claiming losses as a result of the blaze were filed shortly after the fire, in 1991. In February 1995, a $15 million agreement was reached to reimburse workers and businesses affected by the fire. While not admitting any liability, the $15 million minus legal fees was paid by E/R Partners and was meant for uninsured losses for businesses and workers in One Meridian and the surrounding damaged buildings. The burned, empty tower was declared \\"eyesore of the year\\" and an embarrassment to the city by The Philadelphia Inquirer in 1994; the editorial said the feeling was heightened after One Meridian Plaza could be seen in the background in the film Philadelphia. The fire left the area a commercial void; most major stores in the area closed and property values fell. Neighboring property owners, such as the owner of the damaged buildings behind One Meridian Plaza, were waiting for a decision on the future of the building before going through with their own development plans. In 1996, the City of Philadelphia sued E/R Partners, asserting that One Meridian Plaza was an environmental hazard and should be demolished or repaired. =Deconstruction= In March 1997 E/R Partners settled with Aetna, receiving around $300 million. After the legal issues were settled E/R Partners announced the building would be dismantled. With the announcement of the demolition the city dropped its lawsuit against the owners. Unable to implode the building because of the building density of the area, E/R Partners began an eighteen-month, $23 million process to dismantle the building. Early in the process, which began in 1998, the owners hoped someone would buy the property as is or with the damaged portion of the structure removed, but that hope was soon abandoned. The process was finished in 1999. At the time of the demolition it was the third tallest habitable building ever razed and is currently the seventh, ranking after the World Trade Center's twin towers, the Singer Building, and the original Seven World Trade Center in New York, the Morrison Hotel in Chicago, and 130 Liberty Street in New York. Replacement The site of One Meridian Plaza was bought by the Arden Group in 2000. The site was converted into a parking lot as construction on a new building was held up in a zoning feud with the neighboring site, 1441 Chestnut Street. 1441 Chestnut Street was the site of the Morris Building and other smaller buildings that sat behind One Meridian Plaza. The feud between Arden Group's CEO Craig Spencer and 1441 Chestnut Street developer Mariner Commercial Properties, Inc. CEO Tim Mahoney began in 2003.\\"Developers' high-rise condo clash settled\\" Philadelphia Business Journal; American City Business Journals; March 9 2006. Spencer and Mahoney settled their dispute in March 2006 and construction on One Meridian's 48-story replacement, the Residences at the Ritz-Carlton began in May. The Residences at The Ritz-Carlton opened in January 2009. A memorial was unveiled on October 21, 2009 at the skyscraper honoring the three firefighters who died in the fire. The memorial features three bronze firefighter helmets atop a marble base with the firefighters' names on it. It sits in an empty area between the condo building and the adjacent hotel along the south side of South Penn Square across from the SW corner of Dilworth Park.

It has also been called Casa Grande Creek. Course Adobe Creek rises on the west flank of Sonoma Mountain. It descends initially to the south, passing west of Petaluma Reservoir and flowing under Manor Lane. Just east of Petaluma Adobe State Historic Park, it bends toward the southwest and crosses Adobe Road. From there, the creek follows Casa Grande Road, crossing under the road twice as it winds in and out of Adobe Creek Golf Club, crosses Ely Boulevard, and runs along the eastern edge of Del Oro Park. It flows under Lakeville Highway (State Route 116) at milepost 36.19, crosses South McDowell Boulevard, and enters the Petaluma River about southeast of the U.S. 101 bridge. Watershed Adobe Creek drains an area of about . Its headwaters lie in Lafferty Ranch, a parcel of land owned by the City of Petaluma since 1995. Lafferty Ranch has been proposed for a wilderness park, but is not accessible to the public. Petaluma Reservoir (which formerly provided water for the city of Petaluma) is located in the Adobe Creek watershed. Ecology Adobe Creek 2007 Steelhead Trout Biosurvey In 1983 a high school student group organized by school instructor Tom Furrer founded United Anglers of Casa Grande High School to restore Adobe Creek stream habitat and to see if they could restore steelhead trout (Oncorhyncus mykiss) populations. At that time Adobe Creek was considered a \\"dead stream\\" and was a dry, littered riverbed most of the year, although tiny steelhead trout could be found in occasional shallow, drying pools. The students hauled truckloads of trash out of the creek and planted thousands of Coast Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) and willow (Salix) trees to shade and cool the waters. They successfully lobbied Petaluma City Hall officials to re-open Lawler Dam, which was hardly used and kept water from the creek much of the year. In October 1992 Adobe Creek was restored as a free-running stream for the first time in eight decades. The next year, hundreds of steelhead fingerlings were counted in Adobe Creek and the native steelhead population has recovered without restocking. Genetic analysis has proved that the steelhead trout (Oncorhyncus mykiss) that spawn and rear in the Petaluma River watershed are wild, not hatchery, stock. In 1990, five Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) returned to spawn in Adobe Creek, the first time documented in a century. In 1993 the organization constructed a salmon hatchery at the high school. In 1996, the creek was the subject of a habitat restoration project which built a step pool near Adobe Road for the benefit of migratory fish. In 2001, students studied the creekbed during low summer flows, and made the scientific discovery that Steelhead fry spend the summer in the creek substrate, re-emerging when flows become reestablished. In 2002, a record 74 Chinook salmon return to spawn along with native Steelhead trout who continue to use the creek annually. Bridges At least six bridges span Adobe Creek: * Manor Lane crosses north of Adobe Road on a concrete slab built in 1960. * Casa Grande Avenue crosses the creek twice:  first ( south of Adobe Road) on a concrete culvert built in 1970  and again ( north of Ely Road) on a concrete culvert built in 1970 and reconstructed in 1991. * Ely Boulevard crosses southeast of Casa Grande Avenue on a concrete continuous slab built in 1984. * Sartori Drive crosses southeast of Casa Grande Avenue on a concrete continuous slab built in 1976. * State Route 116 crosses at milepost 36.19 on a concrete continuous slab built in 1954 and reconstructed in 1997.

He had two battalions each of the 6th Light, and the 39th, 69th and 76th Line Infantry Regiments.Smith, p 381 Bock's dragoons charged a square belonging to a battalion of the 6th Light. The French held their fire too long. Their volley killed a number of horsemen, but a mortally wounded horse carrying a dead dragoon crashed into the square like a battering ram.Keegan, p 154 The horse fell, kicking wildly, knocking down at least six men and creating a gap in the square. Captain Gleichen rode his horse into the gap, followed by his troopers. The square broke up and most of the men surrendered.Beamish, p 81ffOman, p 101 A second square farther up the hillside was soon charged. Shaken by the first square's disaster, the men flinched when the dragoons rode into them. Soon the men in the second square were running for their lives, except those who surrendered. Foy quickly pulled back the rest of his troops. Anson's horsemen mopped up the battlefield. Results Foy lost 200 killed and wounded, and 1,400 captured. Bock lost 54 killed and 62 wounded. The very high proportion of killed to wounded was due to the \\"deadly effect of musketry at the closest possible quarters.\\"Oman, p 102 Another authority gives 52 Germans killed, 69 wounded and 6 missing and 1,100 total French casualties. Commentary Garcia Hernandez as it is today. The aerial photo on the left - taken from south to north- shows the Gamo brook on the upper edge of the village. The road starting from the village, toward north, to the Almar River behind the hills of La Serna, is from where Wellington obsverved the battle. The center image was taken from the Heights of Altos de La Serna. The photo shows the narrowness of terrain between the town and hills, which forced the two King's German Legion regiments to charge in echelones (steps) rather than in line. Picture on the right shows the old country road with old bridge that crossed the Gamo brook - Anson's brigade crossed this bridge coming from south (from the left in the picture). The heights of the Altos de La Serna are on the right background The breaking of a steady square was a rare event. A French infantry battalion in square formed up in a bayonet-studded hedgehog either 3-ranks or 6-ranks deep. (A British square was 4-deep.) If a square stood its ground without flinching and fired with effect, it could withstand the best cavalry. When infantry squares were broken by cavalry in the Napoleonic Wars, it was usually because: * the infantry were of poor quality * the infantry were tired, disorganized or discouraged * it was raining, making it difficult for the infantry to fire effectively, and wetting their gunpowder * the infantry fired a poorly aimed volley * the infantry waited too long to fire At Garc√≠a Hern√°ndez, the last event occurred with the first square, leading to the extraordinary accident of a mortally wounded horse and rider smashing into the square making a gap which was then exploited by the following cavalry. The second square likely panicked at the extraordinary sight of the first square being torn apart. Literature * Beamish, N. Ludlow.

This was West's last film under her Paramount contract, after which she went on to make My Little Chickadee (1940) for Universal Pictures and The Heat's On (1943) for Columbia Pictures. Plot In turn-of-the-century New York City, con artist Peaches O'Day (West) gets into trouble with the law for trying to sell the Brooklyn Bridge, but Jim McCarey (Lowe), a police captain, likes her enough that he lets her off with a promise from Peaches to leave town. She hatches a scheme instead with the wealthy Van Doon (Winninger) and butler Graves (Butterworth) to perform as a singer, calling herself Fifi, disguised in a black wig. Quade (Lloyd Nolan), a chief of police with political ambitions, makes a pass at \\"Fifi\\" and is rejected. In anger, he orders the club closed. Capt. McCarey refuses and becomes Quade's rival, even persuaded to run against him for mayor. Before giving a speech at Madison Square Garden during the campaign, McCarey is kidnapped. He escapes just in time and the publicity is helpful in his election victory. It turns out that Peaches planned the whole thing, resulting in a romantic relationship with the new mayor of New York.

During his career he had two spells with both Southampton and Reading, as well as playing for Watford. Playing career Andrews was born in Reading and attended the University of Reading where he trained as a teacher. He joined Reading F.C. in October 1909 and was relegated from the Southern League First Division at the end his first season. However they were promoted as champions Second Division in 1911. In the summer of 1912 he moved to the south coast to join Southampton, who had just appointed a new trainer in Jimmy McIntyre. Due to the lack of funds following George Swift's spending spree in the previous season, McIntyre was only able to sign three new players; the only successful recruit was Andrews, whose signing from Reading was \\"one of the best moves of McIntyre's managerial career\\", as Andrews went on to become the \\"Saints\\" most consistent forward in the three seasons leading up to the First World War, as well as being an expert penalty taker. He started off well scoring eight goals in the first 17 games, before the goals dried up after Christmas 1912 and he finished the season with nine goals, one behind leading scorer Percy Prince. He was more consistent the following season, where he was now playing alongside Arthur Dominy; he scored twelve goals and missed only one league game. In the final pre-war season he contributed eleven goals of which eight were from penalties. Described by Holley & Chalk in \\"The Alphabet of the Saints\\" as a \\"clever and able forward who could play in all the front positions\\" he was a noted penalty taker converting all but two of the 22 penalty kicks he took, gaining a reputation as \\"a man who could hit the ball harder, and more accurately, with his left foot than any other player in the game\\". During the First World War, Andrews joined the 5th Battalion Wiltshire Regiment, where he served in the Middle East rising to the rank of Regimental Sergeant Major. After the war, he signed for his first club Reading in July 1919. During the 1919‚Äì20 season he was part of the last Southern League representative XI, playing in a fixture against Corinthians. At the end of the 1919‚Äì20 season Reading, along with most of the Southern League clubs, formed the Third Division of the Football League. Andrews spent the first season of the new division with Reading before returning to Southampton in August 1921. During his second spell at Reading, Andrews formed a \\"exciting partnership\\" with Jimmy Carr on the left-wing, which was to be briefly re-created at Southampton a few years later. In his first season back at The Dell he helped the Saints to the Third Division South title. By now the goals were few and far between and, although his enthusiasm carried him through another two seasons, he was no longer a first choice player, losing out firstly to Joe Clark for much of the 1922‚Äì23 season and then to Henry Johnson the following season. On 17 February 1923 he was drafted in as goalkeeper for a match at Port Vale when Tommy Allen was taken ill; he acquitted himself well as the game finished goalless. He played his final match for Southampton at Blackpool on 24 November 1923. During his two spells with Southampton he played 180 games in all competitions, scoring 40 goals of which exactly half were from penalties. In August 1924 he joined Watford on a free transfer. He made 38 league appearances for the club, as well as a further two in the FA Cup, playing as either an inside forward or left winger. He finished the 1924‚Äì25 season joint top scorer alongside Fred Pagnam with six league and one FA Cup goals. However, he was released by Watford at the end of the season. After retiring from the game in 1925, he returned to Southampton where he took up a career as an insurance salesman. He became an outstanding bowls player and won honours at county level. He died in January 1969, shortly after his 80th birthday.

It includes an investigation of the effects of infection, inflammation and immune factors on testicular function. Two unique characteristics of testicular immunology are evident: (1) the testis is described as an immunologically privileged site, where suppression of immune responses occurs; and, (2) some factors which normally lead to inflammation are present at high levels in the testis, where they regulate the development of sperm instead of promoting inflammation.  History of testicular immunology  * 460-377 BC Hippocrates described testicular inflammation associated with mumps * 1785 Hunter and Michaelis performed transplant experiments in domestic chickens * 1849 Berthold transplanted testes between roosters and showed maintenance of male sex characteristics only in birds with successfully grafted testes * 1899-1900 Sperm recognized as immunogenic (will cause an autoimmune reaction if transplanted from the testis into a different area of the body) by Landsteiner (1899) and Metchinikoff, (1900) * 1913-1914 Human testis transplants performed by Lespinasse (1913), and Lydson (1914) who performed a graft on himself! * 1954 Discovery that sperm autoantibodies contribute to infertility, * 1977 Billingham recognized that the testis is site of immune privilege Immune cells found in the testis Immune cells of the human testis are not as well characterized as those from rodents, due to the rarity of normal human testes available for experiment. The majority of experiments have studied the rat testis due to its convenience: it is of relatively large size and is easily extracted from experimental animals. = Macrophages = Macrophages are directly involved in the fight against invading micro- organisms as well as being antigen-presenting cells which activate lymphocytes. Early studies demonstrated the presence of macrophages in the rat testis Testicular macrophages are the largest population of immune cells in the rodent testis. Macrophages have also been found in the testes of humans, guinea pigs, hamsters, boars, horses and bulls. They originate from blood monocytes which move into the testis then mature into macrophages. In the rat, testicular macrophages have been described as either ‚Äúresident‚Äù or ‚Äúnewly arrived‚Äù from the blood supply. It is likely that most of the adult population of testicular macrophages in adult rats are a result of very rapid proliferation of early precursors that entered the testis during postnatal maturation Testicular macrophages can respond to infectious stimuli and become activated (undergo changes enabling the killing of the invading micro- organism), but do so to a lesser extent than other types of macrophages. An example is production of the inflammatory cytokines TNFŒ± and IL-1Œ≤ by activated rat testicular macrophages: these macrophages produce significantly less TNFŒ± and IL-1Œ≤ than activated rat peritoneal macrophages. Aside from responding to infectious stimuli, testicular macrophages are also involved in maintaining normal testis function. They have been shown to secrete 25-hydroxycholesterol, a sterol that can be converted to testosterone by Leydig cells. Their presence is necessary for the normal development and function of the Leydig cells, which are the testosterone-producing cells of the testis. = B-Lymphocytes = B-lymphocytes take part in the adaptive immune response and produce antibodies. These cells are not normally found in the testis, even during inflammatory conditions. The lack of B-lymphocytes in the testis is significant, since these are the antibody-producing cells of the immune system. Since anti-sperm antibodies can cause infertility, it is important that antibody-producing B-lymphocytes are kept separated from the testis. = T-lymphocytes = T-lymphocytes (T-cells) are white blood cells which take part in cell-mediated immunity. They are often found within tissues where they can be activated by antigen-presenting cells upon infection. They are present in rat and human testes, where they constitute approximately 10 to 20% of the immune cells present, as well as mouse and ram testes. Both cytotoxic T-cells and Helper T cells are found in the testes of rats. Also present in the testes of rats and humans are natural killer cells and Natural killer T cells have been found in rats and mice. = Mast cells = Mast cells are regulators of immune responses, particularly those against parasites. They are also involved in the development of autoimmune diseases and allergies. Mast cells have been found in relatively low numbers in the testes of humans, rats, mice, dogs, cats, bulls, boars and deer. In the mammalian testis mast cells regulate testosterone production. There are two lines of evidence that restriction of mast cell activation in the testis could be beneficial during treatment of inflammatory conditions; (1) In experimental models of testicular inflammation, mast cells were present in 10-fold greater numbers and showed signs of activation, and (2) Treatment with drugs which stabilize mast cell activation has proved beneficial in treating some types of male infertility. = Eosinophils = Eosinophils directly fight parasitic infections and are involved in allergic reactions. They have been found in relatively low numbers in the rat, mouse, dog, cat, bull and deer testes. Almost nothing is known about their significance or function in the testis. = Dendritic cells = Dendritic cells initiate adaptive immune responses. Relatively small amounts of dendritic cells have been found in the testes of humans, rats and mice. The functional role of dendritic cells in the testis is not well understood, although they have been shown to be involved in autoimmune orchitis during animal experiments. When autoimmune orchitis is induced in rats, the dendritic cell population of the testis greatly increases. This is likely to contribute to testicular inflammation, considering the well-established role of dendritic cells in other types of autoimmune inflammation. =Neutrophils= Neutrophils are white blood cells which are present in the blood but not normally in tissues. They move out from the blood into tissues and organs upon infection or damage. They directly fight invading pathogens such as bacteria. Neutrophils are not found in the rodent testis under normal conditions but can enter from the blood supply upon infection or inflammatory stimulus. This has been demonstrated in the rat after injection with bacterial cell wall components to produce an immune reaction. Neutrophils also enter the rat testis after treatment with hormones that increase the permeability of blood vessels. In humans, neutrophils have been found in the testis when associated with some tumors. In rat experiments, testicular torsion leads to neutrophil entry into the testis. Neutrophil activity in the testis is an inflammatory response which needs to be tightly regulated by the body, since inflammation- induced damage to the testis can lead to infertility. It is assumed that the role of the immunosuppressive environment of the testis is to protect developing sperm from inflammation. Immune privilege in the testis Sperm are immunogenic - that is they will cause an autoimmune reaction if transplanted from the testis into a different part of the body. This has been demonstrated in experiments using rats by Landsteiner (1899) and Metchinikoff (1900), mice and guinea pigs. The likely reason for this is that sperm first mature at puberty, after immune tolerance is established, therefore the body recognizes them as foreign and mounts an immune reaction against them. Therefore, mechanisms for their protection must exist in this organ to prevent any autoimmune reaction. The blood-testis barrier is likely to contribute to the survival of sperm. However, it is believed in the field of testicular immunology that the blood-testis barrier cannot account for all immune suppression in the testis, due to (1) its incompleteness at a region called the rete testis and (2) the presence of immunogenic molecules outside the blood-testis barrier, on the surface of spermatogonia. Another mechanism which is likely to protect sperm is the suppression of immune responses in the testis. Both the suppression of immune responses and the increased survival of grafts in the testis have led to its recognition as an immunologically privileged site. Other immunologically privileged sites include the eye, brain and uterus. The two main features of immune privilege in the rat testis are; * a diminishment in the activation of testicular macrophages by infections such as bacteria, and * a defect in the activation of T-cells when antigen is presented to them, leading to the absence of an adaptive immune response to sperm in the testis. It is also predicted that the high level of inflammatory cytokines in the testis contributes to immune privilege. =Immune privilege in rodents and other experimental animals= The existence of immune privilege in the testes of rodents is well accepted, due to many experiments demonstrating prolonged, and sometimes indefinite, survival of tissue transplanted into the testis, or testicular tissue transplanted elsewhere. Evidence includes the tolerance of testicular grafts in mice and rats, as well as the increased survival of transplants of pancreatic insulin-producing cells in rats, when cells from the testes (Sertoli cells) are added to the transplanted material. Complete spermatogenesis, forming functional pig or goat sperm, can be established by the grafting of pig or goat testicular tissue onto the backs of mice - however, immunodeficient mice needed to be used. =Immune privilege in humans= The presence of immune-privilege in the human testis is controversial and insufficient evidence exists to either confirm or rule out this phenomenon. * Evidence for human/primate testicular immune privilege: Sperm are protected from autoimmune attack, which when it occurs in humans leads to infertility. Local injury of seminiferous tubules caused by fine-needle biopsies in humans does not cause testicular inflammation (orchitis). Furthermore, human testis cells tolerate early HIV infection with little response. * Evidence against human/primate testicular immune-privilege: In transplant experiments, primate testes fail to support grafts of monkey thyroid tissue. Human testis tissue transplanted into the mouse elicited an immune response and was rejected, however, this immune response was not as extensive as that against other types of grafted tissue. =How does the testis suppress immune responses?= How the testicular environment suppresses the immune response is only partially understood. Recent experiments have uncovered a number of biological processes that most likely contribute to immune privilege in the testes of rodents: * 1. Experiments in the rat have shown that Sertoli cells can help protect from graft rejection. These cells were isolated from the testis, then added to transplants of the insulin-producing cells of the pancreas (islets of Langerhans), resulting in increased graft survival. Molecules released by the Sertoli cells are predicted to protect the graft. * 2. It is likely that the testicular environment itself is inhibiting the activation of T-cells, in order to protect the developing sperm which are immunogenic. The fluid present in the testis is a potent inhibitor of the activation of T-cells under laboratory conditions. * 3. The diminishment of the testis inflammatory response is likely to result from relatively low levels of inflammatory cytokines released by activated testicular macrophages. Since protection of developing sperm is so important to the survival of a species, it would not be surprising if more than one mechanism were in use. Immune factors regulate normal testis function Curiously, the testis contains factors such as cytokines, which are usually only produced upon infections and tissue damage. The cytokines interleukin-1Œ± (IL-1Œ±), IL-6 and Activin A are found in the testis, often at high levels. In other tissues, these cytokine would promote inflammation, but here they control testis function. They regulate the development of sperm by controlling their cell division and survival. Other immune factors found in the testis include the enzyme inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and its product nitric oxide (NO), transforming growth factor beta (TGFŒ≤), the enzyme cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and its product prostaglandin E2, and many others. Further research is required to define the functional roles of these immune factors in the testis. The effects of infections and immune responses on the testis =Mumps= Mumps is a viral disease which causes swelling of the salivary glands and testes. The mumps virus lives in the upper respiratory tract and spreads through direct contact with saliva.Mumps In-Short. Prior to widespread vaccination programs, it was a common childhood disease. Mumps is generally not serious in children, but in adults, where sperm have matured in the testis, it can cause more severe complications, such as infertility. =Sexually transmitted diseases= Gonorrhea is a sexually transmitted disease caused by the bacteria Niesseria gonorrhea which can lead to testicular pain and swelling. Gonorrhea also infects the female reproductive system around the cervix and uterus, and can grow in the mouth, throat, eyes and anus.Gonorrhea - CDC Fact Sheet. It can be effectively treated with antibiotics, however, if untreated, gonorrhea can cause infertility in men. Chlamydia is caused by the sexually transmitted bacteria Chlamydia trachomatis which infects the genitals. It more commonly affects women, and if untreated, can lead to pelvic inflammatory disease and infertility.Chlamydia - CDC Fact Sheet. Serious symptoms in men are rare, but include swollen testicles and an unusual discharge from the penis. It is effectively treated with antibiotics. =Antisperm antibodies= Antisperm antibodies (ASA) have been considered as infertility cause in around 10‚Äì30% of infertile couples. ASA production are directed against surface antigens on sperm, which can interfere with sperm motility and transport through the female reproductive tract, inhibiting capacitation and acrosome reaction, impaired fertilization, influence on the implantation process, and impaired growth and development of the embryo. Risk factors for the formation of antisperm antibodies in men include the breakdown of the blood‚Äëtestis barrier, trauma and surgery, orchitis, varicocele, infections, prostatitis, testicular cancer, failure of immunosuppression and unprotected receptive anal or oral sex with men. =Testicular torsion= Testicular torsion is a condition of physical twisting of the testis which results in cutting off the blood supply. It leads to damage that, if not treated within a few hours, causes the death of testicular tissue, and requires removal of the testis to prevent gangrene, and therefore can cause infertility. =Autoimmune orchitis= Orchitis is a condition of testicular pain involving swelling, inflammation and possibly infection. Orchitis can be caused by an autoimmune reaction (autoimmune orchitis) leading to a reduction in fertility. Autoimmune orchitis is rare in humans, compared to anti-sperm antibodies. To study orchitis in the testis, autoimmune orchitis has been induced in the rodent testis. The disease starts with the appearance of testicular antibodies, then movement of macrophages and lymphocytes from the blood stream into the testis, breaking of the physical interactions between the developing sperm and Sertoli cells, entry of neutrophils or eosinophils, and finally death of the developing sperm, leading to infertility. =Inflammation models in the rodent= Experiments in rats have examined, in fine detail, the course of testicular events during a bacterial infection. In the short term (3 hours) multiple inflammatory factors are produced and released by testicular macrophages. Examples are prostaglandin E2, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), TNFŒ± and IL-1Œ≤, although at lower levels than other tissues. Non-immune cells of the testis such as Sertoli cells and Leydig cells also able to respond to bacteria. During a bacterial infection, testosterone levels and the amount of testicular interstitial fluid are reduced. Neutrophils enter the testis about 12 hours after infection. Importantly, there is damage to the developing sperm, which start to die under severe infections. Despite all the data on the effects of bacteria on normal testis parameters, there is little experimental data regarding its effect on rodent fertility. =Other diseases where testicular inflammation can be a symptom= Testicular inflammation can be a symptom of the following diseases: Coxsackie A virus,eMedicine - Orchitis varicella (chicken pox) human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), dengue fever,\\"Internal Medicine in World War II - Dengue\\" by Richard B. Capps, M.D. Epstein Barr virus-associated infectious mononucleosis, syphilis, leprosy, tuberculosis.

It is one of the oldest institutions of higher learning in Ukraine. It was originally established as the Nizhyn Lyceum of Prince Bezborodko; since then it has changed its name for several times. Currently, it consists of seven faculties and about 8,000 students study there.  History  The chronicle of higher school in Nizhyn dates back to 1805, when Count I. Bezborodko, in reply to his request, received the tsar's permission for the construction of a Gymnasium in Nizhyn. On 25 July 1805 the Russian senate adopted a resolution on founding Prince Bezborodko's Gymnasium of Higher Learning in Nizhyn. The main building of the gymnasium was designed in the style of classical architecture by a famous 19th-century architect, Luigi Rusca. After I. Bezborodko's death in 1815 the construction of the gymnasium was continued by his grandson, O. Kushelyov-Bezborodko, who later became its honoured administrator. Prince Bezborodko's Gymnasium of Higher Learning was opened for studies on 4 September 1820. The gymnasium focused on the Humanities and it was initially an educational establishment for the sons of the gentry. Its nine-year programme offered a classical education with instruction in Religion, Classical and Modern Languages, Geography, History, Physics and Mathematics, Political Economy, Military Science and the Arts. The first director was Vasyl Kukolnyk, an outstanding scholar, Doctor of Law, Philosophy, Arts. He taught Chemistry, Technology and Agriculture, Physics, the Roman Law etc. During the 200 years of the existence of the Higher School in Nizhyn it has changed its role several times: Prince Bezborodko Gymnasium of Higher Learning (1820-1832), Technical (Physics and Mathematics) Lyceum (1832-1840), Law School (1840-1875), Prince Oleksandr Bezborodko Historical- Philological Institute (1875-1921), Nizhyn Institute of People's Education (1921-1934), Nizhyn Gogol State Pedagogical University (1998-2004). On 15 October 2004 it became Nizhyn State University named after Mykola Gogol.–°–∞–º–æ–π–ª–µ–Ω–∫–æ –ì.–í., –°–∞–º–æ–π–ª–µ–Ω–∫–æ –û.–ì. –ù—ñ–∂–∏–Ω—Å—å–∫–∞ –≤–∏—â–∞ —à–∫–æ–ª–∞:—Å—Ç–æ—Ä—ñ–Ω–∫–∏ —ñ—Å—Ç–æ—Ä—ñ—ó.-–ù—ñ–∂–∏–Ω,2005.-420—Å.

The university comprises 31 chairs: Teaching Techniques, English Language, English Philology, etc. There are postgraduate departments in 10 specialties; Lyceum; Two educational-methodological centres in Pryluky and Novhorod- Siversky; Preparatory department; Post-diploma education. At present, there are 8,500 students: 3,500 students are full-time and 5,000 are extramural.G.Dudka and V. Yareshko Nizhyn Higher School. - Nizhyn, 2005. - 39 c.  Campus  The university campus is on the bank of the Oster river right in the centre of Nizhyn. There are five academic buildings. The most significant is the main building called the Gogol building. The memorial plaque over the entrance says \\"Gogol studied here: 1821-1828\\". Being one of the first students of the Nizhyn Gymnasium, Gogol became an outstanding writer. Over the plaque the university motto reads \\"Labore Et Zelo\\" (\\"By work and diligence\\"). In front of the main building is Gogol Square with a memorial to the victims of World War II. To the left of the main building is the monument to Count Bezborodko, the founder of the institution. It was unveiled in 1990 owing to the efforts of its former rector academician F. Arvat. The new academic building of the university was erected in 1970 to mark the 165th anniversary of its foundation and the 150th anniversary of its opening. The four-storey construction hosts the university administration and Social and Humanitarian, Physics and Mathematics faculties. In front of the new academic building there is a monument to the teacher, which is the first in Ukraine. The university park, the Count's Park, behind the university buildings, is 200 years old. On the campus there are two more academic buildings for the students of Culture and Arts, Nature and Geography departments. Next to the administrative building you will see two dormitories, canteen, and sportsground.  Collections  = Gogol Museum = The Gogol Museum is the oldest university museum. It was opened in 1909 on centenary anniversary of Gogol. The main aim of the museum was to elucidate for the present generations Gogol's life and his creative work of the Nizhyn period. The materials are arranged on 15 stands of the two museum rooms. The exhibits include the portraits of Gogol's parents, painted by the 19th-century artists, photocopies of the teachers and the Gymnasium students' portraits, their progress lists, textbooks and training aids of that time. = University museum = The university library is a unique book collection, which dates back to 1820. In 1899 a separate library building was erected in Gogol Street. During the Gymnasium's transformation the library funds were accumulated in various ways. Much work in the formation of the book funds was done by its librarians: professors K. Shapalynsky, I. Landrazhyn, M. Solovyov, and D. Aman. Nowadays the library boasts over 1 million books and periodicals. The library has the Museum of Rare Books, the Gogol Research Centre, five reading halls for 600 readers. = The Museum of Rare Books = The Museum of Rare Books boasts over 100,000 volumes of rare books. About 2,000 books are exhibited in its two halls. Among them are the ancient editions of the 16th-18th centuries such as the Iliad and Odyssey by Homer, Eneid by Vergil, Grammar by Meletius Smotrytsky, Arithmetic by Leonty Magnitskyy, etc. The museum was opened in 1985. The great contribution to the work of it was done by the famous philologist H. Vasylkyvsky.

Filiga changed his last name from McNichol to his mother's maiden name of Filiga. Playing career In 2007, Filiga was labelled by his manager as \\"the next Sonny Bill Williams\\". Cronulla won a bidding war in late 2007 for Filiga, committing to a A$600,000 contract over three years. Filiga, previously a Bulldogs junior playing for the Chester Hill Hornets, didn't make his debut in first-grade in 2007 as he spent most of the season sidelined with chest and foot injuries. In 2008, the first year of his three-year Cronulla contract, Filiga's NRL appearances were limited by his form. He spent only 11 minutes on the field in the NRL, playing off the bench in a match against Penrith in round 13. Cronulla Sharks released Filiga on \\"compassionate grounds\\" in April 2009. It is estimated that Filiga's 11-minute NRL career cost Cronulla per minute. Filiga then went to play for the Wentworthville Magpies, who are the feeder club for the Parramatta Eels NRL Side.

Their native language was Thanjavur Marathi. Venkoji was the founder of the dynasty.  Maratha conquest of Thanjavur  Following the demise of Chola rule in the 13th century (specifically around 1279), the Thanjavur area came under the rule of the Pandyas and then, following the invasion of Malik Kafur, it fell into disorder. Pandya nadu very quickly reasserted their independence and forced the Delhi Sultan to flee Thanjavur. Soon afterwards, however, they were conquered by the Vijayanagara Empire. The Emperor appointed his trusted Kin, who belonged to the Telugu Balija caste as Governors (Nayakas) of Madurai and Tanjavur. An internal family squabble between Chokkanatha Nayak of Madurai Nayak dynasty and his uncle Vijayaraghava Nayaka of Tanjavur, let to a war, and eventually defeated Thanjavur. The rule of the Thanjavur Nayaks lasted until 1673 when Chokkanatha Nayak the ruler of Madurai invaded Thanjavur and killed its ruler, Vijayaraghava. Chokkanatha placed his brother Alagiri on the throne of Thanjavur, but within a year the latter threw off his allegiance, and Chokkanatha was forced to recognise the independence of Thanjavur. A son of Vijaya Raghava induced the Bijapur Sultan to help him get back the Thanjavur throne. In 1675, the Sultan of Bijapur sent a force commanded by the Maratha general Venkoji (alias Ekoji) to recapture the kingdom from the new invader. Venkoji defeated Alagiri, and occupied Thanjavur. He did not, however, place his protege on the throne as instructed by the Bijapur Sultan, but seized the kingdom and made himself king. Thus began the rule of the Marathas over Thanjavur.  Maratha kings  = Venkoji = Venkoji, a half- brother of the Maratha king Shivaji, was the first Raja of Thanjavur from the Bhosale dynasty. It is believed that he took over the administration of Thanjavur in April 1674 and ruled until 1684. During his reign, Shivaji invaded Gingee and Thanjavur in 1676‚Äì1677 and made his brother Santaji the ruler of all lands to the north of the Coleroon. During the last years of his reign, Venkoji also allied with Chokkanatha of Madurai to repulse an invasion from Mysore. = Shahuji I = Shahuji I was the eldest son of Venkoji and he ascended the throne at the age of twelve. During his reign, the Mughals occupied the Coromandel coast and Tiruchirapalli and forced him to pay tribute. Shahuji was a patron of literature. During his reign, there were frequent skirmishes and battles with the Raja of Madurai and Ramnad for control of the border lands. = Serfoji I = Serfoji I was a younger son of Venkoji and he ruled from 1712 to 1728. His rule was marked by regular warfare and disputes with the Madurai Nayak. = Tukkoji = Tukkoji, a younger brother of Serfoji I, ruled Thanjavur from 1728 to 1736. His reign witnessed the invasion of Chanda Sahib and he is credited with having repulsed a Muslim invasion of Madurai. = Pratapsingh = A period of anarchy followed the death of Tukkoji and came to an end when Pratapsingh came to the throne in 1739. He ruled until 1763. He allied with Muhammad Ali, the Nawab of the Carnatic, and aided the British East India Company against the French East India Company in the Carnatic Wars and the Seven Years' War. He was the last king to be addressed to be the Directors of the British East India Company as \\"His Majesty\\". In 1762, a tripartite treaty was signed between Thanjavur, Carnatic and the British by which he became a vassal of the Nawab of the Carnatic. = Thuljaji = Thuljaji was a very weak ruler and the last independent ruler of Thanjavur. In 1773, Thanjavur was annexed by the Nawab of the Carnatic who ruled till 1776. The throne was restored to him by the Directors of the British East India Company. But his restoration came at a heavy price as it deprived him of his independence. = Serfoji II = Thuljaji was succeeded by his teenage son Serfoji II in 1787. Soon afterwards, he was deposed by his uncle and regent Amarsingh who seized the throne for himself. With the help of the British, Serfoji II recovered the throne in 1798. A subsequent treaty forced him to hand over the reins of the kingdom to the British East India Company, becoming part of the Tanjore District (Madras Presidency). The district collectorate system was installed thereafter to manage the public revenues. Serfoji II was however left in control of the Fort and the surrounding areas. He reigned till 1832. His reign is noted for the literary, scientific and technological accomplishments of the Tanjore country. = Shivaji = Shivaji was the last Maratha ruler of Thanjavur and reigned from 1832 to 1855. He was a weak and feeble prince with barely any authority. As his first wife did not have any male heir, the Queen adopted her nephew, and the adoption took place after the Maharaja's (Shivaji I) death in 1855. The British did not accept this adoption and Thanjavur was annexed by them as per the provisions of the Doctrine of Lapse.  Literature  Interior of Durbar Hall, Thanjavur Maratha palace The Thanjavur Maratha Rajas favoured Sanskrit and Telugu to such an extent that classical Tamil began to decline. Most of the plays were in Sanskrit. Venkoji, the first ruler of the Bhonsle dynasty composed a 'Dvipada' Ramayana in Telugu. His son Shahuji was a great patron of learning and of literature. Most of the Thanjavur Maratha literature is from his period. Most of them were versions of the Ramayana or plays and short stories of a historical nature. Sanskrit and Telugu were the languages used in most of these plays while there were some Tamil 'koothu' as well. Advaita Kirtana is one of the prominent works from this period. Later Thanjavur rulers like Serfoji II and Shivaji immersed themselves in learning and literary pursuits when they were dispossessed of their empire. Serfoji built the Saraswathi Mahal Library within the precincts of the palace to house his enormous book and manuscript collection. Apart from Indian languages, Serfoji II was proficient in English, French, Dutch, Greek and Latin as well.  Administration  The king was assisted in the administration of his country by a council of ministers. The supreme head of this council of ministers was a Mantri or Dalavoy. The Dalavoy was also the Commander-in-chief of the Army. Next in importance at the court was a Pradhani or Dewan also called Dabir Pandit. The country was divided into subahs, seemais and maganams in the decreasing order of size and importance. The five subahs of the country were Pattukkottai, Mayavaram, Kumbakonam, Mannargudi and Tiruvadi.  Economy  The ruler collected his taxes from the people through his mirasdars or puttackdars. They were collected right from the village level onwards and were based on the agricultural produce of the village. Rice was one of the primary crops in the region and the land used for cultivation was owned by big landlords. It was Anatharama Sashtry who proposed collecting taxes to improve conditions for the poor. No foreign trade was carried out. The only foreign trade in the country was carried out by European traders who paid a particular amount of money as rent to the Raja. The currency system used was that of a chakram or pon (1 chakram = one and three-fourths of a British East India Company rupee). Other systems of coinage used were that of pagoda (1 pagoda = three and a half Company rupees), a big panam (one-sixth of a Company rupee) and a small panam (one-thirteenth of a Company rupee).

It serves Catholic members of Romania's Armenian community living in Transylvania. Overview At the end of the 17th century, Transylvania's Armenians converted to Catholicism, with the town of Gherla becoming the seat of their bishop. A key role in this process was played by the missionary Oxendius VƒÉrzƒÉrescu, who was named bishop in 1690 by Pope Alexander VIII and served until his death in 1715. Subsequently, leadership of the community fell to the Latin Rite Bishop of Transylvania. B√°lint Kov√°cs, \\"Armenii √Æn Transilvania (de la stabilirea lor √Æn secolul XVII p√¢nƒÉ √Æn secolul XX)\\", at the Alba Iulia Archdiocesan Archive site Like the Romanian Greek-Catholic Church, the Armenians accepted basic Catholic principles while preserving their traditional rites and officiating liturgies in the Armenian language. By the time of the Union of Transylvania with Romania in 1918, many of the region's Armenians had undergone Magyarization. According to the terms of the 1927 Concordat between Romania and the Holy See, the country's Armenian Catholics were recognised as a standalone diocese, \\"Ordinariatul Armeano-Catolic\\" , at the Ministry of Culture and National Patrimony, Under-Secretariat for Culture and Religious Affairs; accessed January 8, 2011. formally set up on June 5, 1930.\\"Ordinariate of Romania, Faithful of Eastern Rite (Armenian)\\" at Catholic-Hierarchy; accessed 1 February 2011.\\"Ordinariato per i cattolici di rito armeno residenti in Romania\\" in Annuario Pontificio 2012 (Libreria Editrice Vaticana ), p. 1032 After 1948, with the onset of the Communist regime, the ordinariate had an unclear status in civil law, as it was no longer recognised by the authorities; but, from the point of view of the Catholic Church, the ordinariate continued to exist and to be in the care of Father Zolt√°n Lengyel, apostolic administrator since 1939.Annuario Pontificio 1964 (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 1964), p. 738 Its status changed in 1964, when a papal decree entrusted the pastoral care of the members of the ordinariate to the Bishop of Alba Iulia. The successive editions of the Annuario Pontificio from 1965 to 1991 continued to list the ordinariate, but mentioned nobody as its ordinary or even as its apostolic administrator. Although the Romanian Secretariat of State for Denominations says that in 1991 the title of ordinary was given to the Archbishop of Alba Iulia, Lajos B√°lint, the Holy See's Annuario Pontificio shows that the apostolic administrator appointed in that year for the ordinariate was instead Gy√∂rgy Jakubinyi, then an Auxiliary Bishop of Alba Iulia,Annuario Pontificio, editions 1992-1994 and that he retained that position after his elevation to Archbishop of Alba Iulia in 1994.Annuario Pontificio, 1995 and later editions\\"Archbishop Gy√∂rgy-Mikl√≥s Jakub√≠nyi\\" at Catholic-Hierarchy; accessed 1 February 2012. The Holy See's action in 1991, occurring after the fall of the Communist regime, was taken without requesting recognition by the Romanian Government. At the end of 2013, the ordinariate had one parish each in Gherla, Gheorgheni, DumbrƒÉveni and Frumoasa, with members living elsewhere in Transylvania as well, for a total of 666 members served by four priests, an average of 166 Catholics per priest.

He has previously played for the Canberra Raiders and the St. George Illawarra Dragons in the NRL. McCrone played for the Country Origin side between 2012 and 2014. Early and personal life McCrone was born in Temora, New South Wales, Australia. He played his junior football for the Temora Dragons and represented the Country Rugby League at a junior level. He is qualified as an electrician. Brother in law of rugby league star Ryan Hinchliffe Early career McCrone started his professional career with the Canberra Raiders but failed to break into the first-grade team in two seasons. He was signed by the Penrith Panthers in 2007, following coach Matthew Elliott from Canberra to Penrith, before returning to Canberra at the end of the 2008 season without having appeared in the NRL. First-grade career He moved to the Canberra Raiders in 2009, making his first NRL appearance in April at Halfback. McCrone was demoted from the side at the beginning of the 2010 NRL season, relegated to Canberra's feeder club Souths Logan. By the end of the 2010 season, he had returned as the Raiders' regular halfback, forming a combination with Terry Campese to lead the team to a six-match winning streak, landing the Canberra club in the finals before being knocked out by the Wests Tigers. McCrone re-signed with Canberra through to the end of the 2012 NRL season. In the 2011 NRL season, McCrone scored 9 tries and played five-eighth for the majority of the year due to Terry Campese being injured. As a result, the Canberra club signed Matt Orford from the Super League but used rookie Sam Williams instead for most of the year to partner McCrone in the halves. Demoted to the New South Wales Cup for most of 2015, McCrone was named at five-eighth in their 2015 Team of the Year. On 12 October 2015, McCrone signed a two-year contract with the St. George Illawarra Dragons starting in 2016.

Oothukkaadu about 7 km from Thirukarugaavoor, where the famous shrine of Goddess Garbha Rakshaambigai is located. Temple The main deity of Oothukkaadu village is Lord Veda Naarayanar flanked by goddesses Sridevi and Bhudevi on either side. The temple gained popularity after the discovery of the panchaloha idol of Kaalinga Narthana Perumaal from the temple tank. It is believed that sage Naaradha witnessed the Kaalinga Narthanam that Lord Krishnaa performed in front of the divine cows Nandini and Patti, children of Kaamadhenu. Sage Naaradha prayed to Krishnaa to remain in the village in the dance posture and bless the devotees. Hence it is believed that Lord Krishnaa remained in the dancing posture in Oothukkadu. The idol of Sri Kaalinga Narthana Perumaal within the inner sanctuary of the temple is about 2.5 ft high. Lord Krishnaa, portrayed as a five-year-old boy, is seen dancing with His left foot on the serpent's head and his right leg in the air. Krishna is depicted holding the tail of the serpent with His left hand and showing Abhaya Mudra with His right hand. It is so intricately sculpted that one can insert a thin piece of paper between the Lord's left leg and the head of the serpent. According to the temple Bhattachaarya, the beauty is that the weight of the Lord's body rests on the left hand that holds the serpent's tail. One can also see the scars on the right leg of Lord Krishna formed due to the violent beating from Kaalinga's tail. The shrine has gained fame as a \\"Parihaara Sthalam\\" for \\"Raahu Dosham\\" and \\"Sarpa Dosham.\\" The shrine is also visited by devotees who pray for quick settlement of marriage alliances and birth of offspring. Songs associated with the temple Mahaakavi Venkatasa Subbhayyar, popularly known as Venkata Kavi, who lived in the 17th century CE spent his entire life in front of the thulasi mada composing a number of melodious songs in praise of this deity. Due to the extreme devotion of Sri Venkata Kavi to the Lord, he is believed to be a reincarnation of Sage Naaradha who witnessed the Lord's dance in the village. Some of the famous songs of Venkata Kavi are: \\"Swaagatham Krishna\\", \\"Alai Paayudhe\\", \\"Aadaadhu Asangaadhu Va Kannaa\\" and \\"Thaaye Yasodha\\".Legend meets art here, The Hindu, 16 October 2015 Others are \\"Paal Vadiyum Mukham\\", \\"Asaindaadum mayil\\", \\"Enna Punniyam\\". The starting verses of some of these songs can be found on the temple walls. It is believed that Lord Krishnaa appeared in person and danced to these melodies. Lord Krishnaa also performed the entire Kaalinga Nartthanam for the pleasure of Sri Venkata Kavi.  Directions and temple hours  The temple is close to Kumbakonam. It is on the way to Aavoor from Kumbakonam about 1 km from the main road. The directions to the temple are clearly on the Kumbakonam-Aavoor- Thirukkarukaavur road. The temple hours are from 10 a.m. to 12 noon and from 5 p.m. to 7.30 p.m. Special puja is performed every month on the day of Rohini, birth star of Lord Krishnaa.

The commune is cut almost in half by the E40 Dresden- Krak√≥w-Lvov International Road, a railway line and, in the near future, the A-4 highway. The international Krak√≥w-Balice airport is 40 km away. The area contains flat fields and meadows of the Raba river valley in the north, including the Niepo≈Çomice Forest (Puszcza Niepo≈Çomicka); and a mountainous area in the south, within visual range of the Beskid Wyspowy mountain range, and in good weather, also the Tatra and Pieniny mountain ranges. History Considering the historical attractiveness, Bochnia Commune belongs to the most interesting districts in the Lesser Poland (Ma≈Çopolska). Early settlements dating back to the prehistoric domain of Vistulians (Wi≈õlanie) flourished in two neighboring centers: ≈Åapczyca and Che≈Çm. ≈Åapczyca (in Latin referred to as: Labscicia et cum sole - ≈Åapczyca with salt) was mentioned in Cardinal Idzi's edict of 1105 as the property of the Tyniec Benedictine Monastery. ≈Åapczyca is a village of the longest unwritten history in the region, one of the oldest villages in southern Poland and also one of the most significant early settlements in the Bochnia region. There are some traces of a medieval fortified castle (grodzisko) which enjoyed its magnificence from the 9th through 11th centuries. A site of the greatest historic value is a gothic church founded by King Casimir the Great (Kazimierz Wielki) in 1360 as an expiatory gift. Since 1849 pilgrimages from Bochnia to the ≈Åapczyca historic church are held annually in order to commemorate the town's miraculous salvation from an epidemics of cholera. Monachus - the Patriarch of Jerusalem is the author of a document dated 1198, confirming that a magnate - Mikora of the Gryfit Family - donated the Che≈Çm village to the Friars of the Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulchre of Jerusalem based at Miech√≥w along with the feudal dues (dziesiƒôcina - the tenth part of a serf s income due to the feudal lord), village fair and even 'karczma' - the local inn. Salt - the greatest natural wealth of the region - was discovered in consequence of their activities and, in effect, led to the foundation of the town of Bochnia operating in compliance with Magdeburg law from 1253. Since 1999 the Parish Museum of the Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulchre (Bo≈ºogrobcy) has been operating at Che≈Çm. Its founder and custodian is the parish priest of the local church under the invocation of St. John the Baptist - Rev. Antoni Tworek. The most valuable exhibits are gold and silver embroidered chasubles dating from the 17th through 19th centuries, a monstrance and an alms-box dating from the 17th and 18th centuries. Some of the exhibits are stored at the local belfry. Since 2004 the museum has been acting as the premises of the \\"Che≈Çm\\" Art Gallery. Every year a great outdoor event is organized at Che≈Çm - Wianki ≈öwiƒôtoja≈Ñskie (floating wreaths on the Raba river on St. John's Eve), which combines some elements of pagan beliefs with the Christian tradition of St. John's holiday. In the northern part of the commune's territory, at Bess√≥w, some traces of early settlements dating back to the 4th and 5th centuries AD were preserved - some pottery and primitive smelting furnaces used for iron metallurgical processing and primitive farm tools production. In the 1970s numerous sensational archeological discoveries were made re, which turned the village into a researchers' \\"El Dorado\\". According to a legend, some Tartar warriors who invaded Poland during the Crimean 13th century settled at Cerekwia. Brze≈∫nica is another very old village (first chronicled in 1242). It is situated in the eastern part of the commune's territory. From 1242 onwards it enjoyed municipal rights for a few years. According to a legend, St. Stanis≈Çaw of Szczepan√≥w, then the Bishop of Cracow, was persecuted by King Boleslaus the Bold and had to escape from Krak√≥w. City residents refused to give him water and accommodation. Having spent the night on a haystack, he raised his hands to heaven, prayed and hit the ground with his truncheon. Since that time, a spring of cristal clear water, regarded as 'miraculous' by the local people, has been gushing at the site. Other historic localities are: Krzy≈ºanowice, Nieszkowice, Bogucice, Pogwizd√≥w and Stanis≈Çawice situated at the fringe of the Niepo≈Çomice Virgin Forest (Puszcza Niepo≈Çomicka). The forest was first mentioned in a document of 1242, where it was referred to as \\"the K≈Çaj Forest\\" (Las K≈Çaj). In 1393 it was referred to as \\"the Niepo≈Çomice Forest\\" (Las Niepo≈Çomicki), and in 1441 the name \\"Niepo≈Çomice Virgin Forest\\" (Puszcza Niepo≈Çomicka) was used for the first time. The name \\"niepo≈Çomicka\\" derives from an old Polish word \\"niepo≈Çomny\\" which denoted something hard, unbreakable or indestructible. Throughout Poland's history the forest belonged to me State Treasury. For years it was an excellent hunting area used by the Polish kings. A forest trail called \\"the Royal Route\\" was used by the hunting kings, penetrating deep into the forest: Casimir the Great (Kazimierz Wielki), Ladislaus Jagie≈Ç≈Ço (W≈Çadys≈Çaw Jagie≈Ç≈Ço), Sigismund the Old (Zygmunt Stary), Sigismund Augustus (Zygmunt August), Stephen Bathory (Stefan Batory) or Augustus III of Saxony (August III Sas). Big game was hunted for at the time: bear, wild pig, aurochs, moose, deer, bison and wolf. During the partitions, 'work at the foundations' characterized the localities neighboring Bochnia. Most of their inhabitants contributed to the restitution of Poland's sovereignty with their military effort and the sacrifice of their lives. An obelisk in the centre of ≈Åapczyca is memorial to the personage of J√≥zef Chwa≈Çkowski, who was killed in the January Uprising of 1863. The history of Gaw≈Ç√≥w is also extremely interesting. Until 1945 he village had been inhabited by former German colonists and their descendants who settled there after the first Partition of Poland. Until World War II, at the neighboring Majkowice village, there had even been a German school. Another fact worth attention, is that the Polish and German communities coexisted here for one and a half century in full harmony and mutual respect. During World War II the region of Bochnia experienced many tragic events. On 10 September 1939 the region's biggest battle took place at the fringe of fringe Niepo≈Çomice Virgin Forest (Puszcza Niepo≈Çomicka). Over 50 soldiers of the Krak√≥w Army (Armia Krak√≥w) were killed in the strife. Another local drama was shooting by the Germans of over 500 Jews at Baczk√≥w - by way of liquidation of the Bochnia's ghetto as of 25 August 1942. Today the monuments at the fringe of the forest testify to the fact. The Pilots' Monument erected at Nieszkowice Wielkie reminds us of the heroic \\"Liberator\\" team, who were killed on their attempt to help the fighting soldiers of the Warsaw Uprising. On the eve of the Liberation Day, in January 1945, Germans pacified the Grabina village and shot many residents. Tourism =Via Regia Antiqua= The most interesting tourist trail of Bochnia Commune is the ancient royal route 'Via Regia Antiqua'. This historic trail is a section of the Amber Route also referred to as the Royal Route. As early as the 12th century it served the function of a transport and trade artery linking Europe with Rus and Hungary. Merchant caravans used to pass the way with wagons loaded with Bochnia's salt, Flandrian cloth, Baltic amber, copper and Hungarian wine. Also princes' or kings' retinues, heading for the capital city in the nearby Krak√≥w could be encountered there. The Route proceeds from Bochnia via two ancient localities of ≈Åapczyca and Che≈Çm and, lastly, Moszczenica characterized with wild landscape. Formerly, fine vineyards were spreading across the area, which is commemorated by the name of the local hill - \\"Vineyard\\" (Winnica), preserved until today. This unique route allows the visitor to admire simultaneously the panorama of the Raba River Gorge, the Niepo≈Çomice Virgin Forest (Puszcza Niepo≈Çomicka) as well as the Beskid Wyspowy and Tatras mountain ranges. Numerous interesting sites are situated at the Route: \\"A gothic church at ≈Åapczyca, dating from 1340, founded by King Casimir the Great (Kazimierz Wielki) - according to a legend - as a penance for his love affair with Esther (Esterka) - a beautiful Jewish girl from Kazimierz. Until 1733 the temple had served the function of a parish church. At the beginning of the 19th century the temple was closed down and partly devastated by plunderers who were looking for treasures there. At present, it functions as a chapel. Originally, it was a double-chamber edifice with stellar vaults (lierne vaults) supported by two pillars - at present replaced with apparent vaults. At the entrance there are pointed-arch portals dating back to the 15th century. The church is encircled by old linden trees (natural monuments). Next to the church there is an 18th-century chamber belfry. Every year in July this beautiful temple is revived, when on the holiday of Our Lady of Mount Carmel a pilgrimage arrives from Bochnia to commemorate the miraculous salvation from the epidemics of cholera in 1849. =Rest and recreational centers= Hospice and Ski-Lift at Wola Nieszkowska The hospice located at the village (10 km away from Bochnia) is situated about 350 meters above sea level. It is open all year long and it has 20 bedrooms, a kitchen, a fireplace room, club-room and also a barbecue and fire spot. Next to the hospice, along the northern slope, of around 500 meters' length, there is a trapeze ski-lift. In winter the ski-slope is illuminated and artificially snowed. One can get there by bus (municipal line No 2), which takes about 15 minutes, or in one's own car. There are two car-parks prepared for tourists: at the top of the hill next to the hospice and at the foot of the hill next to the ski-lift. Indoor swimming pool At Prosz√≥wki, next to the 'Bochnia- Zielona' public road No 965, there is a modern sports and education center, comprising an indoor swimming pool heated by solar collectors (the only facility of this kind in the whole Lesser Poland /Ma≈Çopolska) and a complex of sport fields and tennis courts. In winter an artificially refrigerated ice- rink (the only in the region) and a skate rental agency are open there. The complex also possesses a hotel infrastructure enabling the organization of the so-called 'green school' camps. The swimming pool complex is not a large, but a very modern facility. The main pool, measuring 25m x 12.5m (6 lanes), 1.2m - 1.8m deep, holds a Polish Swimming Federation certificate authorizing the organization of swimming contests there. Varied depth levels enable the organization of swimming classes for beginners and guarantee security to all users. The recreational pool, measuring 12m x 6m, provides good fun and relaxation. It has been equipped with needle bath, particularly useful for rehabilitation purposes. Its warmer water especially attracts the youngest. The rehabilitation pool (jacuzzi) for 12 persons is filled with iodide-bromine brine from the ≈Åapczyca deposit. It also possesses some intensive aqua-massage equipment. A 48 meters' long water slide is an extra attraction. The facility possesses an impressive car-park. Transport by public buses (line 7) from the center of Bochnia. Neptun fishery At Nieprze≈õnia, next to the 'Pogwizd√≥w Sobol√≥w' public road, there is a fishery providing agrotourist services. At the site visitors can enjoy fishing, use aqua bikes or boa; and, in the evening, they can feast on fried Nearby, in the former manor park there conference-recreational center with 50 hotel rooms The renovated Nieprze≈õnia and Zawada manor; houses exemplify perfect harmony of architecture and landscape. Cycling routes The beauty of the 'Bochnia' land can be admired during cycling trips. The following routes are especially worth recommending: -The so-called \\"Upper Highway\\" (G√≥rny Go≈õciniec), proceeding from Bochnia via ≈Åapczyca to Che≈Çm; from where one can admire the Raba River meanders and the Niepo≈Çomice Virgin Forest (Puszcza Niepo≈Çomicka). -The 'Czy≈ºyczka-Berdych√≥w' public road, linking Gierczyce and Pogwizd√≥w, from where a fascinating panorama of the Beskid Wyspowy Mountains and the ancient Via Regia Antiqua route can be observed. -The 'Gorzk√≥w-Brze≈∫nica' loessic gorge, whose unique mood attracts crowds of cyclists and tourists. \\\\- The 'Buczyna- Stradomka' public road descending from Borek Hill (G√≥ra Borek) down a very steep slope. The emotions induced and the beautiful views observed will make the site well-planted in tourists' memory. -The cycling routes around the Niepo≈Çomice Virgin Forest and forest cuttings are excellent sites for cycling sports and biology classes.

Notice the embroidered handkerchief on the belt. Embroidery is an ancient and symbolic tradition in Ukraine. In 513 BC, Herodotus, the famous Greek historian, in describing the invasion of Darius, mentioned that the Thracian-Dacian people who lived in what is now the Balkans and western Ukraine used embroidery to decorate their clothes. Excavations of cities from the 1st century AD have revealed examples of embroidered clothing in the territory of Ukraine. Other early examples of embroideries include pre-Christian goddess motifs, such as Berehynia.Mary B. Kelly. \\"Goddess Embroideries of Russia and the Ukraine\\". Woman's Art Journal, Vol. 4, No. 2. (Autumn, 1983 - Winter, 1984), pp. 10‚Äì13 There are eleventh- century examples of embroidery in the Saint Sophia Cathedral in Kyiv on frescos and miniatures. Many of these early examples have distinct similarities to the local embroidery throughout history. Ukrainian embroidery was an everyday art in the common people's lives until the 19th century, when it became more of a craft. Embroidery was mostly used for the decoration of clothing and fabrics and for the decoration of homes and churches. Embroidered products, especially a rushnyk, are greatly symbolic for a series of ceremonies and rituals of Ukraine. Most embroidery was used for clothing. The primary object of clothing that was decorated with embroidery was the shirt or vyshyvanka. The shirt was mostly decorated with embroidery on the sleeves, and also on the neck, bosom, and the cuffs. Other elements of clothing are also embroidered, including scarves, skirts, aprons, men's caps and trousers, sleeveless jackets, kozhukh and kozhushanka (sheepskin coats), sashes, ochipok, etc. In some areas, bed linens were also embroidered. Aside from clothing, other items decorated with embroidery are towels, tablecloths, bench covers, veils and kerchiefs, and pillowcases. Many of these items are used to decorate the interior of churches, for example a cover for the sacraments or a shroud for icons. According to Mary Doliszny, a Ukrainian-Canadian activist, the Soviet Union's attempts at Russification took a toll on the embroidery of Ukrainians. Because of attempts to destroy the art of Ukrainian embroidery, diaspora Ukrainians worked to document patterns and revive the art. Much of this research was done at the institutes of Ukrainian studies at Harvard University and the University of Toronto. Folk embroidery was symbolic and connected with a great number of beliefs, myths, and superstitions, including beliefs regarding protection and fertility. The lozenge shape is a common motif and represents a sown field and female fertility. In Ukraine, embroidery was developed by womenNicholas Chirovsky. An Introduction to Ukrainian History: Volume I.

Variations  Dissemination pattern Ukrainian embroidery has many variations from region to region, or even village to village. However, most embroidery is generally similar overall for most Ukrainians. Even with these variation, the styles of needlework found throughout Ukraine, when taken together, represent a definite Ukrainian national style of embroidery. Red and black were the most common colors of Ukrainian embroidery.Linda Welters Dress in Europe and Anatolia: Beliefs about Protection and Fertility . Berg Publishers, 1999. Ukrainian folk embroidery is notable for great variety of its techniques. =Central and Eastern Ukraine= White-on-white openwork embroidery of Poltava Region In the Central and Eastern parts of Ukraine, embroidery usually consists of geometric forms and plant ornaments. The color range of the motifs is very delicate and very diverse as to individual details. In the Poltava Region, the colors usually include pale blue, white, light ochre, pale green and gray tones. Poltava products are especially famed for their ‚Äúwhite-on-white‚Äù and openwork embroidery. The red, red-blue (or red-black) color scheme plays an important role in Central- and Eastern-Ukrainian embroidery, as it did throughout almost the whole of Ukraine. =Western Ukraine= Girl from Podillya ca. 1800 by Vasily Tropinin. An example of traditional Ukrainian folk embroidery. In Western Ukraine, especially the Hutsul region, embroidery uses geometric ornament and a sharply contrasting palette. Besides the now widely used cross- stitch, there is still the ornamental needle-weaving stitch called ‚Äúnyzynka‚Äù, which is executed predominantly on the reverse of the fabric and gives a sort of ‚Äútweed‚Äù effect. This is one of the most archaic of traditional Ukrainian stitches that, in combination with the predetermined areas of white background material that peek through the densely laid threads, emphasizes the clear-cut silhouette of the main patterns. In the Lemko region, the oldest embroideries were executed in red and red-blue linear motifs. Over time, other colors, such as blue, green and yellow, were added. costumes In the Boiko region, embroideries varied from simple red-blue geometric motifs in the western reaches of their territory, to wide, densely worked geometric and/or floral patterns in the eastern and southern reaches. Boikos were also well known for their finely embroidered pleated smocking work called ‚Äúbryzhky‚Äù, which were found mainly around the collars and sleeve cuffs of women‚Äôs and men‚Äôs shirts, but also along the top hems of women‚Äôs aprons. The embroideries of Bukovyna are among the richest in all of Ukraine, often combining as many as nine or more colors, including silver and gold metallic thread as well as colored glass beads. It also uses a number of stitches. The needlework of Pokuttya was also rich and intricately executed, and also quite varied. Red was the predominant color in many of the styles of embroidery in this region, usually being worked in thick home-processed wool threads, sometimes with accents of yellow, green and blue added. Although cross-stitch was not uncommon, the older and more traditional technique was that of the so-called ‚Äúcurly stitch‚Äù (quite popular, in fact, throughout many areas of Southwestern Ukraine). In some parts of Pokuttya and neighboring Podillya, wide motifs of intricately worked white-on-white embroidery combined with open work were popular. The embroideries of Podillya were similar in many respects to that of both Bukovyna and Pokuttya, with discreet yet recognizable differences in color scheme, motifs and placement that nonetheless set them apart. In Halychyna, there is a variety of embroidery styles that were specific for individual localities, such that when one sees a piece of embroidery there is no mistaking its origin. =Northern Ukraine= Original folk-costumes of Carpatho-Rusyn Ukrainians. In the northwest and north of Ukraine (including the Ukrainian ethno-historic territory of Poland) needlework traditions have been preserved relatively intact from the oldest of times. Red, as well as red-blue and red-black were the predominant color schemes in the archaic geometric embroideries of these northern regions of Ukraine, executed primarily in dense rows of a horizontal needle-weaving stitch (called ‚Äúzavolikannia‚Äù) that created horizontal bands of patterns reminiscent of weaving. Floral motifs are also popular in the North, using red, red-blue or red-black palette as the needle-woven bands, but in the much more recent technique of cross-stitch.

He was a member of the Winnipeg City Council from 1971 to 1989, originally a member of the New Democratic Party and later as an independent. Councillor Skowron was first elected to the Winnipeg City Council in the 1971 municipal election, for the Talbot Ward in the St. Johns area. He was re-elected in 1974. When Winnipeg's city council was restructured in 1977, Skowron ran in the new division of Elmwood and defeated fellow councillor Ray Brunka, whom he defeated again in 1980, 1983 and 1986. He lost his seat to Lillian Thomas in 1989. Skowron also campaigned for Mayor of Winnipeg in a 1979 by-election, but finished well behind frontrunners Bill Norrie and Joseph Zuken. Skowron was on the right-wing of the New Democratic Party. In 1979, he led council opposition to the introduction of bilingual English and French municipal signs. The signs were introduced to recognize the legal rights of Manitoba's francophone community; Skowron argued that they privileged one particular ethnic group.\\"Debate on French signs inflames city passions\\", Globe and Mail, 14 April 1979, P8. When he ran for mayor later in the same year, he sought but did not receive the provincial NDP's official endorsement. He accused the party of being infiltrated with communists, citing that Communist Joseph Zuken had emerged as the main left-of-centre candidate.\\"Deputy, Communist two top contenders in Winnipeg election\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 20 June 1979, P9.

Hebert, Manitoba's French-Language Crisis: A Cautionary Tale, Montreal and Kingston: McGill-Queen's University Press, 2005, p. 142. Both councillors left the NDP shortly after the 1983 election, and Skowron later affiliated with a centre-right group on council. Since 1989 In 1993, Skowron played a role in having a recreation centre named after former councillor Magnus Eliason.\\"New centre to be named after Eliason\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 15 April 1993. During the same year, Skowron became involved in a controversy involving his friend, councillor Al Golden. Golden had attempted to convince the group Habitat For Humanity to purchase a warehouse owned by Skowron, and used council letterhead in his correspondence. Golden helped to manage the building in question and applied for permits on Skowron's behalf, though he denied any direct ownership. Golden said that he had applied for the documents as a favour to Skowron, whom he indicated had \\"never taken out a permit in his life\\".During the course of the controversy, councillor Glen Murray charged that Golden had successfully recommended the transfer of a building inspector who had created difficulties for Skowron. Golden responded that he only attempted to assist Skowron with an inspector who was not being objective. He denied showing any preferential treatment to Skowron in his capacity as a city councillor.

Skowron was fined $1,000 in 1996, after being found guilty of failing to file his 1993 income-tax return. The judge justified the lenient fine on the grounds that Skowron had not sought to hide or evade taxes. Skowron said that he failed to file his return because a former business partner refused to make financial records available. His lawyer indicated that Skowron was from the \\"old school\\", and believed his return had to be complete before it could be submitted.Allison Bray, \\"Skowron fined on tax charge\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 5 November 1996, A11.

He had been trained in rosemaling by Anders Olsen, an artist whose work was recognized at the Exposition Universelle at Paris in 1893. Lysne immigrated to Stoughton, Wisconsin with his wife in 1907. He specialized in redecorating antique chests and painting large platters. He developed a thriving rosemaling enterprise and taught the art to a select few. His signature piece, the smorgasbord plate, was not an object that typically had been decorated, but Lysne's new form had a pervasive influence.Lysne, Per 1880 - 1947 (Dictionary of Wisconsin History) L√¶rdal Bygdebok II, Espe, Alfred - Hovland, K√•re, (L√¶rdal Kommune, 1990), side 116 The Stoughton Historical Museum has an exhibit devoted to Lysne's work.

Depenheuer studied law in Bonn, where he attained his doctorate in 1985 and his habilitation in 1992. After teaching law in M√ºnster and Halle/Saale, Depenheuer was appointed to the chair for public law and philosophy of law at the University of Mannheim in 1993. In 1999 he assumed the chair for constitutional law, public law and philosophy of law at the University of Cologne. As a musician, Depenheuer was awarded the \\"Diplome de Concert\\" in 1986 at the Schola Cantorum in Paris. He has performed at organ concerts in Germany and at Notre Dame de Paris, Jerusalem, New York City, Singapore and Cracow. He has also edited numerous organ sonatas. Depenheuer's works have become a matter of public interest in Germany after the conservative German Minister of the Interior, Wolfgang Sch√§uble, recommended the lecture of Depenheuer's book Selbstbehauptung des Rechtsstaates () in a 2007 interview. According to a critical review of the book by Gunter Hofmann, the book is centered on the necessity of the state to defend itself in a \\"global civil war\\" in the \\"age of terrorism\\", and refers to the U.S.'s Guantanamo Bay detention camp as a \\"legally permissible response in the fight of constitutional civilisation against the barbarity of terrorism\\". Depenheuer's critics accuse him of promoting the anti-liberal thought of authoritarian theorist Carl Schmitt, who is liberally cited in the book, and of perceiving terrorism as a faceless evil to which state-organised violence is the sole appropriate response. In his defence, Depenheuer stated in an interview that \\"enemy and victim are fundamental categories of politics\\" and referred to \\"some of the constitution's numerous exegetes\\", who disagree with him, as a \\"security risk\\". Since 2015 Depenheuer is workstream leader for the AMU (Agency for the Modernisation of Ukraine), where he contributes his expertise in law.http://www.wallstreet-online.de/nachricht/7637922-amu-team-starts- programme-work  Bibliography  * Selbstbehauptung des Rechtsstaates.

A total of three vessels in the class were built: , and . All were named for New Zealand native birds and were also referred to as corvettes. Design In late 1939, the New Zealand government contracted Henry Robb Ltd, a Scottish shipbuilding firm, to build three naval trawlers for the New Zealand Division of the Royal Navy. These vessels were intended for training naval personnel in seamanship, gunnery skills and minesweeping work. Henry Robb Ltd had built the minesweeping trawlers HMS Basset and HMS Mastiff, in 1935 and 1938 respectively, and this experience influenced the design of the Bird-class vessels. Although similar in appearance to the later minesweeping trawlers, derived from Basset and Mastiff, the Bird-class ships had an extended forecastle. They were slightly larger and more powerful than the Isles-class minesweepers. Indeed, by 1943, the Bird-class ships were referred to as corvettes when official reports were submitted to the New Zealand parliament. Characteristics The ships of the Bird class had a standard displacement of 607 standard tons and when fully loaded displaced 923 standard tons. They were in total length, in length at the keel, had a beam of and a draught of . The main armament was a gun, supplemented with two Hotchkiss machine guns and one twin Lewis machine gun. The ships carried ASDIC and 40 depth charges. Propulsion was through a single-shaft reciprocating steam engine that burned oil, providing a top speed of at . Their design complement was to be between 33 to 35 men, although this increased as the war progressed and the ships were upgraded. Construction The pennant of Kiwi The Bird-class vessels were , and , all named for native bird species of New Zealand. The three Bird-class vessels, designated build numbers 314 to 316, were laid down on 19 March 1940 with the first of them, Moa, launched on 15 April and completed on 19 August 1941. She had been commissioned into the Royal Navy on 12 August. The second and third ships, Kiwi and Tui respectively, were completed on 28 October and 5 December. They were commissioned directly into the Royal New Zealand Navy (RNZN), which had been formed on 1 October 1941. Service history Upon commissioning, each ship worked up in Scotland before being dispatched to New Zealand with the first leg being a North Atlantic crossing as part of an escort to a convoy. They steamed, via the Panama Canal, to the west coast of the United States and then crossed the Pacific with stops at various islands along the way. On arrival in New Zealand, from April (Moa) to August (Tui) 1942, the minesweepers joined the 25th Minesweeping Flotilla. Kiwis transit of the North Atlantic resulted in some damage and she had to have repairs completed in Boston, Massachusetts. =South Pacific duty= The flotilla was offered for service in the South Pacific and this offer being accepted by the commander of South Pacific, Vice Admiral Robert L. Ghormley, went to Noumea. The ships of the flotilla began operations in the Solomon Islands, conducting anti-submarine operations and carrying out escort missions from December 1942. They also disrupted the Japanese supply efforts, destroying a number of landing barges. The ships were considered to have weak defences against attacking aircraft, and they were unofficially up-gunned with Oerlikon guns scrounged from wrecked ships. The wreck of the Japanese submarine I-1, sunk by Kiwi and Moa On 29 January 1943, Kiwi and Moa rammed and wrecked the , which had surfaced off the coast of Guadalcanal after several depth charges had been dropped. Kiwis bow had been damaged and she returned to Auckland for repairs. Once completed she went back to the Solomons but not long after her return to service she suffered damage from a friendly fire incident which necessitated more repairs at Auckland. In April 1943, Moa was sunk when it was attacked while refueling at Tulagi Harbour, by Aichi D3A \\"Val\\" dive bombers. The attack killed five seamen and wounded another 15. One of the wounded was the captain of Moa, Lieutenant Commander Peter Phipps (later Vice Admiral), who had a bomb penetrate the roof of his cabin and pass through the floor where it exploded beneath him. On 19 August 1943 Tui and some United States Kingfisher floatplanes jointly sank the . With her ASDIC, Tui had detected the submarine and depth charged it. Contact with the submarine had then been lost and Tui departed the scene. However, passing Kingfishers directed Tui to the crippled submarine, I-17, which had surfaced some distance away. With her main gun, Tui scored hits on the submarine and these were followed up with depth charges from the Kingfishers. This resulted in the sinking of I-17 with Tui picking up six survivors who confirmed that her earlier depth charge attack had forced the submarine to the surface. As the Japanese abandoned Guadalcanal and withdrew to the north, the flotilla's area of operations moved as well, to around Bougainville. Both Tui and Kiwi returned to Auckland for refits in 1944 during which the previously unofficial 20 mm Oerlikon guns were made a permanent feature of their armament. The flotilla was released from service in the South Pacific in mid-1945 and returned to New Zealand. After the war, both Kiwi and Tui were involved in clearing the Hauraki Gulf of German-laid mines before being deactivated in 1946. =Later service= The ships were recommissioned a few years later, Kiwi in 1949 and Tui in 1952, as training vessels for Navy personnel undergoing compulsory military service and then later for men preparing for service with RNZN frigates in the Korean War. Laid up in 1956, Kiwi was scrapped in Auckland in 1964. After ending her military career and having her armament removed, Tui was used as an oceanographic research ship for a number of scientific institutions. She was scrapped in 1969, having been laid up since 1967.

Details Pilsbury Castle occupied an area of high ground approximately overlooking the River Dove, near the village of Pilsbury.Cox, p.385. The castle was probably originally an Iron Age fortification before being used by the Normans, and the name \\"Pilsbury Castle\\" forms from the Celtic pil, the Saxon bury and the Norman castel, all meaning \\"fortified site\\". In early medieval times, the site would have been located along the River Dove routeway, and would also have overlooked a key crossing point. The Normans built a substantial motte-and-bailey castle on the site, and several theories have been put forward as to when and who did so. One theory is that the castle was built in the years following the Norman conquest of England. The area around Pilsbury was granted to Henry de Ferrers by King William; the area was devastated during the harrying of the North, and the castle may have been built in the aftermath by Henry to establish control. Henry built other castles at Tutbury and Duffield, making Pilsbury part of this set of 11th-century fortifications. An alternative suggestion is that the it was built by Robert de Ferrers or his father, around the period known as The Anarchy for, while the de Ferrers supported Stephen of England, the neighbouring Earl of Chester supported Empress Matilda.Landon, Ash, Payne and Phillips (2006). 1905 plan of Pilsbury Castle The castle itself includes a motte and two bailey enclosures, approximately and across respectively. It had timber defences, ditches and additional flanking earthworks. The castle appears to have been abandoned in subsequent years, and it may be that it was destroyed after William de Ferrers' part in the Revolt of 1173‚Äì74, or it might have become abandoned when the land passed to the Duchy of Lancaster after the sixth Earl was dispossessed. Alternatively, it may simply have become redundant as nearby Hartington grew in importance and the village of Pilsbury became increasingly depopulated. By the 20th century there was little to see except for a mound on a limestone outcrop and the remains of various earthworks. At the beginning of the present century, however, archaeological surveys revealed the foundations of the castle. The site is a Scheduled Ancient Monument.

History  Following the dismal sales of the Rajdoot 350, Yamaha needed to make a comeback product, and the recent success of Suzuki's AX 100 demonstrated the potential of small-capacity motorbikes in India. In November 1985, Yamaha released the RX 100 to widespread acclaim. The appeal came largely from the surprise that its engine could deliver as much power as it did. Race conductors and authorities often double checked the engine by opening the engine block to make sure it was actually 100 cc.With its lightweight body and high power output, the power to weight ratio of the bike made it the best 100 cc bike ever built for mass production, as a result there is still a high demand for it even if almost 30 years has passed since its production. 333x333px The RX 100 was quickly adopted by racers who recognized its potential in drag racing. Various modifications such as expansion chambers, porting, engine tuning, sprocketing and changing wheel sizes () became fairly common. Furthermore, upgrades such as bigger carburetors, air filters, quicker throttle, disc brakes, an additional 5th gear, race pistons, racing CDI systems, upgraded tires and suspension dampening were released, allowing riders to customize their bikes. Tuned RX 100's have completed the so-called standing start quarter-mile in about 14 secondsa respectable figure, considering the much larger BMW-S1000RR 4-Cylinder bike can cover in 10.2 seconds. The bikes was manufactured between 1985 and 1987 and were knock-down kits, (CKD), from Japan and were assembled in India. Only the model produced in Japan had disc brakes. The bikes were sold in Peacock Blue, Cherry Red and Metallic Black stock colors. The only major changes that the bike underwent was upgrading from a 6-volt electrical system to a 12-volt system with the addition of a CDI (capacitor discharge ignition) system for improved ignition and timing. The bike's production lasted from November 1985 ‚Äì March 1996. Stricter emission laws and regulations in India made the continuing production of the RX 100 impossible. The CKD model was then followed by the , RXG, with a taller primary and secondary reduction. It had the same lightened flywheel from the RX 100 that causes a jerky ride. It was replaced by the manufacturer by a heavier flywheel the following year. Then came the RX-Z in 1997, with a new chassis and a shorter wheelbase with the same primary reduction ratio as the RX100 but with a taller final reduction. The RX-Z was launched with sportier bodywork and produced at 6,500rpm. Following the RX-Z, the RX135 was launched in 1998 with the same engine as the RXZ but using the same chassis as the RX 100 or RXG. The RX135 saw a moderate success due to its refined power output and better fuel economy. Finally, in 2000 Yamaha launched the , 7,500rpm RX135 5 speed with a catalytic converter silencer. It failed in the market due to its poor fuel economy and was discontinued after two years. The RX 135 was later recognized as the quickest RX and has a cult status due to its rarity. A 5-speed variant of the RX-Z with front disc brakes also had a limited release in 2001 at a premium price tag. The final variant was a 4-speed RX 135 with a catalytic converter silencer, sporting a fuel gauge and speedometer with white dials which was sold very briefly from 2003 to 2005.  Successors  The Yamaha RX 100 production run lasted from November 1985 to March 1996. The model was followed by the 132 cc RX G, (11.8 BHP). This model was the reply to the stricter emissions controls, which later became the norm. RX G had an economy- minded engine configuration with the ports tuned to increase fuel-efficiency and decrease exhaust gas. However, in the market. The Japanese manufacturers responded in late 1997 with the Yamaha RX-135 and the RX-Z which had a tachometer and a sportier headlamp and body. Both were mechanically the same and the RX-135 received a lukewarm response. The market also saw five-speed versions of the RX-135s and RX-Z. The final variant was a four-speed RX 135 with a small type catalytic converter, sporting a fuel gauge and a speedometer with white dials which was sold very briefly in 2003‚Äì2005.

South Horizons () is a private housing estate located in Aberdeen, Hong Kong at the western end of Ap Lei Chau ( Aberdeen Island), in the Southern District of Hong Kong. Note: the author of this dissertation was a member of the management team of Hutchison Whampoa Group at the time of its publication (see page 115). Developed by Secan Limited,Lands Department: List of Consents to Sell, Consents to Assign and Approvals of Deeds of Mutual Covenant issued from 1/10/1984 to 31/12/1993 a Hutchison Whampoa associate company, it consists of 34 blocks, ranging in height from 25 to 42 storeys, completed between 1992 and 1995.Emporis: South Horizons Census data indicated that South Horizons had a population of 31,496 in 2011 and was the most populated among the private and public estates of the district.2011 Population Census: Fact Sheet for South Horizons in Southern District Council District. For the purpose of the 2011 census, each of the \\"Major Housing Estates\\", among which South Horizons was listed, so it had its own census data entry. Such estates were thus defined: \\"A group of residential buildings developed by the same developer (either in the public sector or in the private sector) in one or more phases in a neighbourhood and with at least 3,000 residents or 1,000 domestic households in 2011.\\" Description South Horizons was built in four phases, with Phase I and Phase IV closer to Ap Lei Chau Estate, a public housing estate in Aberdeen, Hong Kong. The property is currently owned and managed by Hutchison Whampoa Limited. The estate has a total of 9,812 residential units. It has been described as a \\"middle-class estate\\", with a median monthly domestic household income of HK$ 54,300 in 2011. South Horizons covers two of the 17 constituencies of Southern District Council, South Horizons East and South Horizons West. Each of these two constituencies returns one district councillor to the Southern District Council, with an election every four years. South Horizons has been marketed as Hutchison Whampoa's second \\"Garden City\\" project, the first one being Whampoa Garden, completed in Hung Hom in 1991. More than 50 plant species are cultivated there, and a nature trail along the shore features information boards on tree species. In 2004, Phases II to IV received a Silver Award for Landscape Design as part of the Best Landscape Award for Private Property Development.LCSD: Best Landscape Award for Private Property Development, 2004 Awards History Prior to modern development, the land occupied by South Horizons was occupied by hillside and village houses, farmlands, and a sea bay.

The Shell Oil Depot was in operation between 1970 and the late 1980s.Royal Dutch Shell: Our history in Hong Kong In 1973, failure of the foundations of the oil depot led to 3,600 metric tons of heavy marine diesel oil being released into Picnic Bay and Aberdeen Harbour.Legislative Council: LC Paper No. LS80/02-03. Annex II, p.3 Shell replaced its Ap Lei Chau depot, together with another one in Kwun Tong District (current site of Laguna City), by a new site opened in 1991 on the south side of Tsing Yi.Royal Dutch Shell: Looking to the Long Term. The Story of Shell in China, August 2004 Property market A new computer balloting scheme was put to use at South Horizons to determine the order in which prospective buyers could purchase flats. It was advanced by the government and developers alike as a replacement for the first-come, first- served sales system, which resulted in long queues plagued by disorder and triad intimidation, for example a 1990 incident where 1,000 triad-led men descended upon a sales queue at another Hutchison Whampoa development, Laguna City. Police and the Consumer Council stated in 1992 that the new system \\"appeared to be working fairly\\". In 1995, the ownership structure of South Horizons Phase IV (a.k.a. The Oasis): Hutchison Whampoa Properties: 50%, Cheung Kong (Holdings): 30%, and Hongkong Electric Holdings: 20%. The introduction of 7 blocks of The Oasis on the market in 1995 was one of the largest that year and was followed by analysts as an indication of the state of the market. All retail space in the estate is provided at the Marina Square West and Marina Square East shopping centres. Hoping to capitalise on the impending opening of the South Horizons railway station, the Taiwanese owner of Marina Square West (Estate Dragon Group) issued eviction notices to 30 small businesses housed in the shopping arcade. More than 1,000 residents of South Horizons staged a demonstration in 2014 against the plan to transform the arcade into a \\"high-end shopping outlet for mainland tourists\\" in spite of local needs and shopping habits. Facilities Facilities of the housing complex include: * Garden * Harbour-front Promenade * Residents Club (near Phase II) * Playground in every phase * Car Park ;Sports * 3 swimming pools: 1 indoor and 2 outdoor * Outdoor Playground (located in Phase IV) including both football and basketball court * Sports Complex  Indoor: squash, table tennis, badminton, snooker, etc.  Outdoor: golf practice driving range and tennis courts ;Shopping centres Two shopping centres are located in the middle of the complex: Marina Square West (Êµ∑ÊÄ°Ë•øÂïÜÂ†¥), managed by Savills and owned by Estate Dragon Group, and Marina Square East (Êµ∑ÊÄ°Êù±ÂïÜÂ†¥), owned by Hutchison Whampoa. ;Education Clubhouse playgroup: one private playgroup organised and located at the sports complex South Horizons has about five kindergartens.

Case interviews are designed to test the candidate's analytical skills and \\"soft\\" skills within a realistic business context. The case is often a business situation or a business case that the interviewer has worked on in real life. Case interviews are mostly used in hiring for management consulting jobs. Consulting firms use case interviews to evaluate candidate's analytical ability and problem-solving skills; they are looking not for a \\"correct\\" answer but for an understanding of how the applicant thinks and how the applicant approaches problems.Maggie Lu, The Harvard Business School Guide to Careers in Management Consulting, 2002, page 21, During case interviews, interviewers are generally looking for the following skills:Wharton MBA Consulting Club, The Wharton MBA Case Interview Study Guide: Volume I, 1997, * Numerical and verbal reasoning skills * Communication and presentation skills * Business skills and commercial awareness Candidates are often asked to estimate a specific number, often a commercial figure (such as market size or profitability) or determine action plans to remedy a business problem (such as low profitability or decreasing market share). Questions are generally ambiguous and require interviewees to ask questions or make assumptions to make a reasonable, supported argument to their solutions. Candidates are expected to demonstrate reasoning rather than to produce the exact answer.Booz Allen Hamilton A case interview can also be conducted as a group exercise. Here several candidates are given some briefing materials on a business problem and asked to discuss and agree upon a solution. The interviewers normally sit around the exterior of the room as silent observers. They assess candidates' communication and interaction as well as analytical thinking and commercial awareness.

A certificate is often thought of as a solution path within a verification process, which is used to check whether a problem gives the answer \\"Yes\\" or \\"No\\". In the decision tree model of computation, certificate complexity is the minimum number of the n input variables of a decision tree that need to be assigned a value in order to definitely establish the value of the Boolean function f.  Use in definitions  The notion of certificate is used to define semi-decidability: L is semi-decidable iff there is a two-place predicate R ‚äÜ Œ£‚àó √ó Œ£‚àó such that R is computable, and such that for all x ‚àà Œ£‚àó: x ‚àà L ‚áî there exists y such that R(x, y) Certificates also give definitions for some complexity classes which can alternatively be characterised in terms of nondeterministic Turing machines. A language L is in NP if and only if there exists a polynomial p and a polynomial-time bounded Turing machine M such that every word x is in the language L precisely if there exists a certificate c of length at most p(x) such that M accepts the pair (x, c). The class co-NP has a similar definition, except that there are certificates for the words not in the language. The class NL has a certificate definition: a problem in the language has a certificate of polynomial length, which can be verified by a deterministic logarithmic-space bounded Turing machine that can read each bit of the certificate once only. Examples The problem of determining, for a given graph G and number k, if the graph contains an independent set of size k is in NP. Given a pair (G, k) in the language, a certificate is a set of k vertices which are pairwise not adjacent (and hence are an independent set of size k). A more general example, for the problem of determining if a given Turing machine accepts an input in a certain number of steps, is as follows: L = {<, x, w>  does accept x in w steps?} Show L ‚àà NP. verifier: gets string c = , x, w such that c <= P(w) check if c is an accepting computation of M on x with at most w steps c <= O(w3) if we have a computation of a TM with k steps the total size of the computation string is k2 Thus, <, x, w> ‚àà L ‚áî there exists c <= aw3 such that <, x, w, c> ‚àà V ‚àà P See also *Witness (mathematics), an analogous concept in mathematical logic References External links * . * Computational Complexity: a Modern Approach by Sanjeev Arora and Boaz Barak Category:Computational complexity theory ","title":"Certificate (complexity)"},{"id":"14933766","text":"Gmina Che≈Çmiec is a rural gmina (administrative district) in Nowy SƒÖcz County, Lesser Poland Voivodeship, in southern Poland.

In 1809, he married Mary Somaindyke Ryan, the daughter of John Ryan. That same year, he emigrated to St. John's in Newfoundland to join his father-in-law. There he met John Stewart who hired Goff as his agent for his property in Prince Edward Island and he moved to the island the following year. Goff also later became agent for George and Alexander Birnie. He found that the role of land agent left him in a position of permanent financial obligation to his employers. He attempted to profit by other activities, such as operating a flour mill and an emigration office, without much success. In 1813, he was named coroner and clerk of the crown by William Townshend, colonial administrator. Goff also was named a justice of the peace and was appointed high sheriff in 1831.

The pool is typically closed for four months in the colder period of the year - May through August. It was re-opened for the 2011‚Äì12 summer season, having undergoing a major refurbishment during 2011. In 1968, the pool, previously called the new Domain Baths, was renamed in honour of Andrew \\"Boy\\" Charlton, an Australian swimmer who won five Olympic medals during the 1920s. Early years Since the first European settlement in Sydney there have been eleven different bathing establishments in Woolloomooloo Bay. In the early years, the small sandy beach where the Andrew \\"Boy\\" Charlton Pool now stands was reserved for the exclusive use of the military of NSW including the Marines, the New South Wales Corps and any British regiments stationed here. In the 1820s the use of Woolloomooloo Bay by others was increasing. Two hulks, Ben Bolt and the Cornwallis were moored at the swimming place then known as the Fig Tree. Some dressing sheds were also built but the swimming area was not enclosed. The first swimming facility planned for the area was a floating public baths called Robinson's Hot and Cold Baths. Thomas Robinson was granted a lease for the area in December 1829 but construction of the baths took another ten years to complete. Beating Robinson to the jump was the wife of Governor Macquarie's coachman, Mrs Biggs. She opened the first ladies baths, which included a bathing machine, in 1833 on a small flat inlet near the north-western corner of Cowper Wharf. The baths went out of operation in the late 1840s. In November 1843, Robinson's baths reopened after a refurbishment which included deepening the ladies pool and the introduction of a shallow children's area. Warm showers and a towel were also available for all bathers. First swimming races It was in the \\"Gentlemen's Baths\\" that Australia's the first official competitive swimming events took place. On 14 February 1846 two races were held, an open event over (won by W. Redman in a time of 8 min 43 sec) and a event for juveniles. Annual championships were held here for some years afterwards. In 1850 the Fig Tree baths and what was left of Mrs Biggs' women's baths were granted by the Government to Sydney Council with the intention that the Council build new baths on the site. However, with the dismissal of the council in 1853 the project stalled. In 1854 Mrs Macquarie's Road was opened to horse-drawn vehicles improving access to the baths. Towards the end of the 1850s Sydney Council, or \\"Corporation\\" as it was known, built new baths around the wharf at Fig Tree which projected into Woolloomooloo Bay. This brought to three the sets of baths in the bay at this time. In addition to the Corporation Baths was a Ladies Baths (not Mrs Biggs' although near her former site) and a fully enclosed Gentlemen's Baths. Although the Corporation Baths were still there in 1888, more than 30 years later, they were largely unusable because of sewerage discharged into Woolloomooloo Bay. By 1890 there were four baths; the corporation had a ladies and a gentleman's baths and there were also independent ladies and gentleman's baths. In 1901, since the sewer had been diverted to Bondi and no longer emptied into Sydney Harbour at Woolloomooloo, the State Government extended the lease for the baths with Sydney Council. Funding was also provided to remove the haphazard collection of bathing buildings which had accumulated over the years and construct a new baths. These were officially opened in October 1908 and consisted of a fenced swimming area and concrete platform over the old stone one attached to the shore. Another fence provided privacy from the path and there was a timber and corrugated iron change shed. Andrew \\"Boy\\" Charlton Apart from Australia's first swimming races, the most memorable event to take place in the Domain Baths was in January 1924 when Andrew \\"Boy\\" Charlton swam against Arne Borg of Sweden. A crowd of 6,000 came to see him beat Borg over , equal Borg's world record and set a new Australian record. Charlton was already very popular in New South Wales when he took on Borg. At the age of 14 he beat Hawaiian swimmer Bill Harris over setting a new world record in the process. At 15 years of age he beat Olympic swimmer Frank Beaurepaire and won the NSW freestyle title in world record time talking 19 seconds off the old mark. It was his win over Borg, however, that launched him to national stardom. He beat Borg again over and at the NSW Championships. Charlton went on to win the gold medal in the freestyle event at the Paris Olympics later that year and silver in the and events at the 1932 Los Angeles Olympics. His 1924 world record in the Domain baths was the first set there, an achievement which was recognised in January 1968 when, after yet another refurbishment, the pool was reopened and named after him.

Badger Books were published in a number of genres, predominantly war, westerns, romance, supernatural and science fiction. The best-known author of Badger Books is Lionel Fanthorpe, who wrote a large proportion of the supernatural and science fiction titles.Steve Holland, Badger Tracks: Exploring the publications of John Spencer & Co. Underworld Studios, Colchester 1997.Debbie Cross, Down the Badger Hole: R. Lionel Fanthorpe: the Badger years. Wrigley Cross, Portland 1995. History Badger Books SF-58 and SF-61, both dating from 1961 and bearing the byline \\"John E. Muller\\" -- but \\"The Mind Makers\\" is by Lionel Fanthorpe and \\"Alien\\" is by John Glasby. \\"John Spencer\\" was the pseudonym of Samuel Assael (born 1920), who set up his London-based publishing company in 1947. Initially Spencer's output consisted of pulp magazines, mainly in the science fiction genre (with titles like Futuristic Science Stories, Tales of Tomorrow *and Wonders of the Spaceways). However, with the decline of the pulp magazine and rise of the paperback, Spencer switched to paperback publishing in the mid-1950s. He used a number of imprints, including \\"John Spencer\\", \\"Cobra\\" and \\"Badger\\", but the last of these has become the best known. The Badger Books imprint was discontinued in 1967 although Spencer continued to produce a small number of books (often reprints) until the late 1970s. In common with other \\"pulp\\" or mass-market publishers of the time, Badger Books focused on quantity rather than quality. A new title in each of the major genres appeared each month, generally written to tight deadlines by low-paid authors. One of the most remarkable facts about Badger Books is that much of its outputs was produced by just two authors (using a range of house names and other pseudonyms): John Glasby (over 300 novels and short stories) and Lionel Fanthorpe (over 200 novels and stories). The company was based at 131 Brackenbury Road, Hammersmith. It ran on a shoestring with Mr Assael overseeing everything. The accounts were overseen by Assaels partner Maurice Nahum. Employees numbered only three, all young men. One worked in the office with Nahum and the other two packed books. David Andersen (the source of this information) worked for this company between 1961 and 1963 mostly in the office with Maurice Nahum. Genres The bulk of Badger Books' output fell into five genres as follows: *Westerns, published as \\"Lariat Westerns\\" (LW-1 to LW-77) and \\"Blazing Westerns\\" (BW-1 to B-60). Many of these novels appeared under the house name \\"Chuck Adams\\", which was used by John Glasby and others. At least two of the Chuck Adams books, and several of the other western titles, were written by E. C. Tubb, who later became better known as a science fiction author. *War stories (WW-1 to WW-163). Generally set during the Second World War, most of these novels were written by John Glasby using a wide range of pseudonyms. *Romance novels (RS-1 to RS-40). The bulk of these were written by John Glasby under the pseudonym of D. K. Jennings. *Supernatural tales (SN-1 to SN-109). Most of these books were written by Lionel Fanthorpe under a variety of pseudonyms. Unlike the other series (which are all novels), the SN books started out as anthologies of short stories. Novels started to appear as \\"Supernatural Specials\\" with issues 29, 32 and 35, and then all the even- numbered issues from SN-40 onwards. *Science Fiction (SF-1 to SF-118). Like the SN series, the SF books were mainly written by Lionel Fanthorpe, with a few contributions by John Glasby and others. Several of these books appeared under the house name of \\"John E. Muller\\", which was used by both Fanthorpe and Glasby. In addition to these five main genres, there were several other short- lived series such as Crime stories (CS-1 to CS-13) and Spy stories (SP-1 to SP-6). The latter books, dating from 1965 to 1967, were intended to \\"cash-in\\" on the then-current James Bond craze. All six of the Spy books were written by John Glasby under the pseudonym of Manning K. Robertson.

Spiteful words or actions are delivered in such a way that it is clear that the person is delivering them just to annoy, hurt, or upset. When the intent to annoy, hurt, or upset is shown subtly, behavior is considered catty. In his 1929 examination of emotional disturbances, Psychology and Morals: An Analysis of Character, J. A. Hadfield uses deliberately spiteful acts to illustrate the difference between disposition and sentiment. In fiction The Underground Man, in Fyodor Dostoevsky's novella Notes from Underground, is an example of spite. His motivation remains constantly spiteful, undercutting his own existence and ability to live. Spite Victory A \\"spite victory\\" is a strategy that does not account for objective victory and focuses solely on personal satisfaction for spiting the opponent. An example is intentionally parking in a parking slot that is reserved for someone with whom you have a personal vendetta; this would lead to your car's being towed but would generate personal satisfaction knowing you had prevented your enemy from using the slot.

She was principal flautist with the National Youth Orchestra, and then from 1963-75 principal flautist with the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra. She left the RLPO to found Atarah's Band in 1975, a group which sought to improve children's experiences with classical music. Atarah was awarded the MBE in 1980 for her work in this field. During its lifetime, the band played to over three million people. She has guested on several UK television and radio shows, including Pebble Mill at One on BBC TV, The John Dunn Show, Start the Week and Kaleidoscope. In the late 1980s, BBC Radio Three networked Atarah's Music Box, all about children and music. Omnibus devoted a programme to her work, as did Blue Peter and Magpie. Her own television series, Atarah's Music, aimed at primary school children, aired in 1982. Together with Douglas Boyd she published The Right Instrument for Your Child followed by You Can Make Music!. Both books concentrated on helping aspiring music students to choose the best instrument for their particular attributes. Ben-Tovim & Boyd did research with thousands of students over a period of ten years following the successes and failures of these students with regards to their physical, emotional and intellectual attributes, and the instruments which they chose. Her musical stories for little children in Rub- a-Dub-Tub on Sunday mornings ran for over two years. Her radio series have been broadcast on several local independent radio stations including Birmingham's BRMB, Liverpool's Radio City and Radio Merseyside, Manchester's Radio Piccadilly, and Preston's Red Rose Radio. She currently resides in France, where she teaches and holds workshops for budding flautists and clarinetists.

It was the idea of the two countries' former Presidents, Mwalimu Nyerere and Samora Machel. Several design studies and limited construction work were completed in the early 1980s, but the Unity Bridge was not finished due to lack of funds. In 2002 the two national governments made a formal agreement to build a new bridge across the river. The first foundation stones were laid both on Tanzanian and Mozambique sides on October 10, 2005. Construction was initially planned to be finished in 2008. In 2005, Norconsult was awarded the contract for preliminary design and construction supervision of the bridge. It was planned to be about 720 m long. The project was hoped to boost development in Mtwara Region (Tanzania), Cabo Delgado (Mozambique) as well as in the Southern African Development Community region as it is an important component of the Mtwara Development Corridor. It would also shorten the distance along the Cape to Cairo Road. Environmentalists say it will destroy Niassa Reserve in Mozambique which is home to elephant, buffalo, sable and roan herds. The Unity Bridge over the Rovuma River was built by the China Geo-Engineering Corporation and finally inaugurated on 12 May 2010 by the presidents of Mozambique and Tanzania. The rehabilitation of access roads on both sides of the bridge is to be started. A second, smaller bridge, Unity 2, was completed in 2007.

History Bell's Life was founded by Robert Bell, a London printer-publisher. Bell sold it to William Innell Clement, owner of The Observer, in 1824 or 1825, and the paper swallowed up a competitor, Pierce Egan's Life in London and Sporting Guide. From 1824 to 1852 it was edited by Vincent George Dowling, \\"during which time Bell's Life became Britain's leading sporting newspaper, without which no gentleman's Sunday was quite complete\\".Tony Mason, ‚ÄòDowling, Vincent George (1785‚Äì1852)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 29 Dec 2007 Dowling's son, Frank Lewis Dowling, effectively edited the paper during the last year of his father's life, and succeeded him as editor from 1852 to 1867. By the 1860s Bell's Life was facing competition from The Field, The Sportsman, Sporting Life, and The Sporting Times. In 1885 Edward Hulton bought Bell's Life and made it a daily, but in 1886 it was absorbed by Sporting Life.Waterloo Directory of English Newspapers and Periodicals Editorial policy Though Bell's Life is now best known as a racing paper it began life as an anti-establishment general newspaper aimed at the working class. From around 1830 it gave increasing coverage to racing and this soon comprised more than a third of the paper, following general news and followed in its turn by other sporting news (notably boxing but all other sports too). For thirty years it remained the principal source of racing news while its general news with its acid comment, full coverage of scandal and cartoons provides an entertaining picture of Victorian Britain. Bell's problem was that it aimed at both the literate poor and the general sporting public who fall into all classes. It experimented variously with appearing more than once a week and eventually eliminated all its general news, covering sport alone; but the changes came too late.

They can be members of the public, who have received basic training in life- saving interventions such as defibrillation, off duty ambulance staff, or professionals from a non-medical discipline who may be nearby or attending emergencies, such as firefighters or security officers. Community first responders are found in the emergency healthcare systems of Canada, United Kingdom, the United States, Ireland, Israel, Italy (soccorritori), Australia, Singapore and Romania. Role Community First Responders are there to provide assistance to those with a medical emergency, and most importantly to start and maintain the chain of survival in cardiac arrest patients until a fully equipped ambulance arrives. The schemes were originally envisaged for rural areas where emergency medical services response is likely to be delayed beyond the approximate 8‚Äì10 minutes during which a cardiac arrest is likely to become irreversible. The schemes have since expanded to more populous areas, where the benefit of early intervention can still prove life-saving, and the volume of people available to ambulance control assists them with meeting response time targets such as ORCON. Examples of first responders include \\"co- responders\\" (police or fire service), members of staff of a shopping mall or other public place, members of a first aid organisation, lifeguards, community first responders, and others who have been trained to act in this capacity. Employees of the statutory ambulance services may also act as first responders whilst off-duty. Scottish Ambulance Service \\"First Responder\\" vehicle Operations In general, first responders are sent to immediately life- threatening situations such as cardiac arrest. Some ambulance services restrict the type of calls which responders can attend, either through blanket prohibition or by more detailed call screening by the emergency dispatch centre. This is because responders do not necessarily have the levels of training or equipment available to full-time staff, and may arrive on their own, increasing risks. Types of call which responders may not be asked to attend (or be stood down if already en route) include drugs related problems, domestic violence and abusive patients as well as dangerous scenes such as traffic collisions or building sites. In some areas, responders are also not dispatched to paediatric cases, although other areas have this as a main part of their role. Schemes vary in the UK and are mostly managed by the local ambulance service, although some schemes are run externally (such as by St John Ambulance or by commercial entities such as Alton Towers) in association with the ambulance service. The majority of responders are volunteers and take no payment (although in some areas, payments are made for each call, particularly to staff responders) and use their own cars with no mileage recompense. In most schemes, they are expected to drive under normal road traffic laws, and are not permitted to claim exemptions or use blue lights and sirens (as a matter of policy, rather than legal restriction). There are a small number of schemes which have dedicated response cars and responders, who have been fully trained in response driving, respond on blue lights and sirens. In most cases funding for these schemes is from charitable donations from local communities. Training The training is generally first aid-based and at its core but includes extended first aid skills such as defibrillation and oxygen therapy. Other topics include roles & responsibilities, scene safety, communication, patient assessment, management of minor trauma and a range of other medical conditions such as diabetes and strokes. Most schemes also use some further extended skills adjuncts, not normally taught on public first aid courses, such as suction and placement of oropharyngeal airways. There is no nationally agreed standard for the training of community first responders. Some ambulance services choose to use the IHCD First Person on Scene (FPOS) qualification at either basic, intermediate or enhanced levels, however some ambulance services choose to deliver their own syllabus. In most cases, the training takes place over several evenings and/or weekends and involves assessment by a trained paramedic. There may be a period of supervision for new responders including ambulance observation shifts before they are deemed competent to respond on their own. The National Association of Community First Responders was formed in 2014 with the purpose of helping to bring about a national standard for CFRs in the UK.

It is part of the Pennine Alps and is located between the valleys of Anniviers and Zermatt in the canton of Valais. In the latter valley, the Weisshorn is one of the many 4000ers surrounding Zermatt, with Monte Rosa and the Matterhorn. The Weisshorn was first climbed in 1861 from Randa by the Irish physicist John Tyndall, accompanied by the guides J.J. Bennen and Ulrich Wenger. Nowadays, the Weisshorn Hut is used on the normal route. The Weisshorn is considered by many mountaineers to be the most beautiful mountain in the Alps and Switzerland for its pyramidal shape and pure white slopes. In April and May 1991, two consecutive rockslides took place from a cliff above the town of Randa on the east side of the massif, below the Bis Glacier.  Geography  The Weisshorn is situated in the southern canton of Valais, about 25 km southwards from the Rhone between Sierre and Visp. It is the culminating point on the north-south orientated chain separating the Val d'Anniviers to the west and the Mattertal to the east and enclosing the Turtmanntal to the north, the tripoint between these valleys being located just north of its main summit. The Weisshorn faces the slightly higher Dom across the Mattertal, with the village of Randa 3100 metres below these two summits. After the Dom, the Weisshorn is the second- highest Alpine summit situated completely out the main chain and fully within Switzerland. On both sides of the Weisshorn range, the water end up in the Rhone, through the Navizence (west) and the Vispa (east). The Weisshorn and the Dom are only two of the many 4000-metre peaks surrounding the region of Zermatt, along with the Zinalrothorn, the Dent Blanche, the Dent d'H√©rens, the Matterhorn and, second highest in the Alps, Monte Rosa. The Weisshorn has a pyramidal shape and its faces are separated by three ridges descending steeply from the summit. Two of these are nearly in a straight line, one running approximately north and the other south. The third ridge is nearly at right angles to these two, running almost due east. In the compartment between the northern and eastern spurs lies the Bis Glacier (Bisgletscher). It is connected with the summit by long and extremely steep slopes of snow. In the compartment between the eastern and southern spurs lies the Schali Glacier (Schaligletscher). Ranges of steep rocks rise round the whole basin of this glacier, except in one or two places where they are interrupted by couloirs of snow. Finally, on the western side the mountain presents one gigantic face of rocky precipice. This face rises above the Weisshorn Glacier (Glacier du Weisshorn) and the Moming Glacier. The northern spur forks out at a considerable distance below the summit into two branches enclosing the Turtmann Glacier. The eastern branch connects the mountain with the Bishorn (4,153 m), across the Weisshornjoch.Alpine Club (UK), The Alpine journale, volume 1, 1864  Geology  Close-up view from the Barrhorn with the north face of the Bishorn in foreground The Weisshorn is the culminating point of the Dent Blanche nappe, a klippe belonging to the Austroalpine nappes. The mountain is composed of gneisses; the west face is also composed of sedimentary rocks from the cretaceous period.Geologic map of Switzerland 1:500 000, Bundesamt f√ºr Wasser und Geologie, CH-3003 Bern-Ittigen,  Climbing history  The mountain was first climbed on 19 August 1861 by the 29-year-old physicist John Tyndall, with guides J. J. Bennen and Ulrich Wenger. Their itinerary corresponds to the normal route for climbing the mountain today: the east ridge, starting from the Weisshorn Hut.Helmut Dumler,Willi P. Burkhardt, Les 4000 des Alpes, =1860 attempt= The south-east face (the Schaligrat on the left, the east ridge on the right) rising over the Schali Glacier In 1860 an attempt was made by C. E. Mathews by the southern face. He came to Zermatt with Melchior Anderegg, and engaged Johann Kronig as second guide. They slept at the huts of Schallenbergalp and started at half-past one on the morning of 1 July. Crossing the moraine, they walked until they reached a steep and rugged portion of the glacier, which hid the mountain from their view; and rounding this obstruction with some difficulty, they reached the upper portion of the glacier about five o'clock. They saw that the ridges were thickly coated over with fresh snow, and, except a little patch of rock some 700 or below the summit, the whole mass was of brilliant and dazzling whiteness. They decided to try the southern side which seemed less steep and more practicable to Melchior but an avalanche stopped them:Alpine Club (UK), The Alpine journal, volume 1, 1864 :\\"For six mortal hours we toiled up the steep face of the mountain...A great many steps had to be cut, but for the most part we were able to tread out our foot-holds in the snow. About half-past nine the difficulties became much greater - ten or twelve inches of snow rested upon the ice. We could not get safe footing upon it, and my clinometer indicated an angle of 48 or 49 degrees. The necessity of clearing away the snow before the step could be cut in the ice beneath it, made Melchior's work very arduous, and the higher we got the greater the difficulties became. We had to take off veil and spectacles, and use all our eyes, the footholds were so insecure, and this, though the sun was extremely hot and there was not a cloud to be seen. Suddenly the heat of the sun loosened some snow just above us, and down came a little avalanche quite near enough to be exceedingly unpleasant.\\" The guide Kronig asked Mathews to give up the expedition. They turned back and reached Zermatt in the evening, after nineteen hours of walking. They experienced other avalanches on the descent and the eyes of Mathews were severely burnt. =First ascent= Climbers on the east ridge Accompanied by the guides J.J. Bennen, of Laax, and Ulrich Wenger, of Grindelwald, John Tyndall started the ascent from Randa at 1.00 p.m. on 18 August 1861. They had a bivouac and resumed the climb at 3.35 a.m. on the next day. Tyndall was optimistic but the ascent became difficult, he wrote:Fergus Fleming, Killing Dragons: The conquest of the Alps, p. 202, 2002 :\\"Sometimes it was a fair pull upwards, sometimes an oblique twist round the corner of a rock tower; sometimes it was the grip of the finger ends in a fissure and lateral shifting of the whole body in a line parallel to the crack. Many times I found myself with my feet highest and my head lowest.\\" They reached a dangerous thin ridge of snow, little wider than a hand's breadth, with precipices on either side. The guide Bennen trod the snow down and saw that it was firm enough to cross. Tyndall and Wenger followed Bennen, but yet the summit seemed less attainable and they were all tired. However Tyndall steeled himself with patriotic thoughts: :\\"I thought of Englishmen in battle, of the qualities which had made them famous: it was mainly the quality of not knowing when to yield - of fighting for duty even after they had ceased to be animated by hope. Such thoughts helped to lift me over the rocks.\\" After four hours of struggle they reached a sharp ridge of snow and finally arrived to the summit. The return was found to be not much less difficult than the ascent; and they regained Randa at 11 p.m., after about 20 hours of almost constant hard work. =Other ascents= The north ridge seen from the Bishorn, with the Grand Gendarme in the middle The second ascent, in 1862, was made by Leslie Stephen. Starting with Melchior Anderegg and Franz Biener, of Zermatt. It was from a chalet below the Schallenberg Alp, nearly 2 hours lower than Tyndall's bivouac, that Stephen gained the highest point in 9.5 hours, and returned to Randa in 7.5 hours more, reaching Zermatt the same evening. In 1877, another route was opened by W. E. Davidson, J. W. Hartley and H. S. Hoare, with guides P. Rubi, J. Juan and A. Pollinger. After climbing part of the lower south-east face above the Schali Glacier, they reached the Schaligrat (south-west ridge) and continued to the summit. The complete ridge (which was considered too difficult and dangerous in its lower part) was first climbed in 1895 by J. M. Biner, A. Imboden and E. Broome. The south-east face was completely climbed in 1906 by Geoffrey Winthrop Young and R.G. Mayor with the guide Josef Knubel of St. Niklaus in the canton Valais. The west face The glaciated north-east face was first climbed in 1871 by J. H. Kitson with guides Christian Almer and his son. Almer wanted to reach the summit by nine o'clock in the morning while Kitson's wife watched them from the Gornergrat. In fact the difficulties were more serious than expected and they didn't reach the summit before midday. Shortly after, the ascent was repeated by W. A. B. Coolidge and Meta Brevoort. Both expeditions climbed the part of the face below the Grand Gendarme and continued near the north ridge. In 1909 G. W. Young and J. Knubel climbed the face by the central spur. The west face was first climbed in 1879 by G. A. Passingham with guides F. Imseng and L. Zurbr√ºcken. Other routes on the face were opened in 1883 and 1889. The easiest passage on the east face was found in 1890 by G. W. Young, who climbed the spur under the Grand Gendarme with L. and B. Theytaz by a route known as the Younggrat. The summit of the Grand Gendarme on the unexplored north ridge was first reached in 1898. One month later, on 21 September 1898, H. Biehly and H. Burgener made the first complete traverse on the north ridge to the summit from the Bishorn. Bishorn and Weisshorn from the Turtmanntal side In 1888 George Winkler was killed in a fall on the west face. He left Zinal alone on 17 August, without telling others his precise route. The rescue team only found a photo and a hat near an avalanche cone. His body was not found until the summer of 1956, on the Weisshorn Glacier. John Garforth Cockin was also killed making a solo attempt on the south-east face twelve years later. In 1925 Eleonore Noll-Hasenclever, H. Pfann and H. Trier were caught in an avalanche on the north-east face when they tried to reach the east ridge after interrupting their ascent on the north ridge on account of adverse weather conditions. Pfann and Trier survived, but Hasenclever died from asphyxiation.  1983 helicopter crash  An Alouette III helicopter from Air Zermatt crashed on a night flight on the Schali Glacier (south of the peak) on 31 July 1983. The helicopter was carrying the pilot, his assistant and a mountain guide who was searching for two missing alpinists. A false alarm made the pilot try to land the helicopter on the glacier at 3,160 m. All the crew were severely injured but the guide and pilot survived. The two missing alpinists were later found dead.Schlu√übericht der Eidgen√∂ssischen Flugunfall-Untersuchungskommission admin.ch  Climbing routes  All the routes are difficult. The normal route starts from the Weisshorn Hut on the east side and goes along the sharp east ridge. The Weisshorn can be climbed from the Bishorn via the north ridge, departing from the Cabane de Tracuit, above Zinal. The first three hours consist of relatively easy walking across the glacier and lead to the summit of the Bishorn (4153 m). The second part of the ascent is very exposed and takes another five hours, during which the Grand Gendarme must be climbed.

Vaudeville Faust's vaudeville career began at the Casino Theatre with the introduction of a unique cake walk. She teamed with Frank Bernard for this dance in April 1900.\\"This Week's New Bills\\", New York Times, April 29, 1900, pg. 18. In August 1908 she appeared at the Casino Theatre.\\"Behind The Scenes With Five Salomes\\", Syracuse Herald, Sunday Morning, August 30, 1908, pg. 18. During an interview she admitted to being unaware of the Biblical story of Salome. Her rendition of the Salome dance came from what she was told regarding the Wilde play. She said she felt as if she really were the 14-year- old Salome while she was dancing on stage. She experienced both the horror and fascination during her performances. For each appearance Faust danced as if she would never be able to repeat what she was doing. There were a number of other women who presented their versions of the Salome dance in the same era as Faust. Among these were Eva Tanguay, Vera Olcott, and Gertrude H. Hoffman. Faust eventually was in a vaudeville show which featured her as a singer. Marriages She was married twice. Her first husband was Paul Schindler, a musical director, whom she divorced in 1902. Her second husband was singer and comedian Richard Ling. However, in between marriages the beautiful Faust was popular with men. John Barrymore in recalling her is quoted as saying that \\"he used to grab a lotta back\\", this when dancing with the actress and because Faust had a penchant for wearing dresses with large open backs. Death Faust died in January 1910 at a sanitarium on 33 East 33rd Street in New York City. The cause of death was pneumonia which resulted from an operation she had several weeks earlier. Just before she became ill, she played a primary role in The Midnight Sons. She sued Ling for divorce a short while before her death. Faust was engaged to Malcolm A. Strauss, an illustrator, at the time of her death. He resided at 30 West 40th Street, Manhattan. Strauss painted a posthumous portrait of Faust.

He taught in the Department of Philology at the University of the Basque Country, and was a member of the Royal Academy of the Basque Language. He is described as \\"the greatest scholar the Basque language has ever seen.\\"Max W. Wheeler's introduction to the Basque etymological dictionary, p. 9 He is known for the complete reconstruction of Proto-Basque he undertook in the 1950s, as well as the formal demonstration in 1954 that the Aquitanian language was an ancestral form of Basque. Mitxelena was also one of the main participants in the creation of \\"Euskara Batua\\" or Standard Basque. In 1987 he was declared Seme Kuttun of the City of Errenteria, literally 'beloved son'.  Life  = Childhood and adolescence = Mitxelena was born into a family engaged in industrial crafts. When still a child, illness kept him bed-ridden for a long time. This awoke his interest in reading, and also his love for the Basque language. Mitxelena came from a Basque Nationalist family. When he was young, he was affiliated with the Euskal Langileen Alkartasuna and the Basque Nationalist Party, and learnt about the Euskaltzaleak youth movement led by Jose Ariztimu√±o, known as \\"Aitzol.\\" He began working in a factory while continuing his studies, also starting to attend meetings. At this time he became interested in pre-war Basque literature. = War, death sentence, prison = House of Culture of Koldo Mitxelena in San Sebasti√°n When the Spanish coup of July 1936 took place, Mitxelena volunteered to join the Euzko Gudarostea nationalist Basque army. He was taken captive in Santo√±a and was condemned to death on September 7, 1937, but the sentence was commuted to 30 years in prison. He thus came to know the prisons of El Dueso, Larrinaga, and Burgos. In the Burgos prison, he made the acquaintance of many intellectuals and university professors. It was there that Francisco Jord√° (later a professor of archaeology) convinced him to undertake university studies. Difficulties prevented him from doing so until 1948. Two books played a large role in motivating him: the Manual de Gram√°tica Espa√±ola (Manual of Spanish Grammar) by Men√©ndez Pidal and Aguado Bleye's History of Spain. He was released on January 13, 1943, after 5 years, 4 months, and 5 days of prison. = Second imprisonment = Mitxelena returned to Errenteria when he was 27, in ill health. Jose Uranga, an entrepreneur from Errenteria offered him an accounting job in Madrid. He took it immediately, and began engaging in clandestine activities while working. The entire opposition had one hope: that the Allied Forces in World War II would win, and thus cause Francoist Spain to fall. On April 10, 1946, Mitxelena was again arrested for his activities related to the Confederaci√≥n Nacional del Trabajo and the Basque Nationalist Party. Together with this, three important Galicians fell: Ram√≥n Pi√±eiro and the Saco brothers. Mitxelena was sentenced to two years. He was released on January 30, 1948, after passing through a few more prisons: Alcal√°, Oca√±a, Yeser√≠as, and Talavera. = Poverty and intellectual development = In 1948, Mitxelena was once again in Errenteria, but he enrolled in the Faculty of Philosophy and Letters in Madrid, having been encouraged by Francisco Jord√°, his prison mate. The two decades of the 50s and 60s were important for Mitxelena. He underwent a significant intellectual development, but was living on a shoestring and had to work more than one job to make a living. Due to his criminal record, it was not easy to find a stable job. Luckily, a few of his friends were familiar with his worth and skills (Arrue, Tovar, Amor√≥s, Agud, Vallejo‚Ä¶). In 1949 he married Matilde Mart√≠nez de Ilarduya. In 1951, he took part in a strike. = University = In 1954 he was appointed director of the Julio de Urquijo School of Basque Philology, as well as member of the editorial board of the magazine Egan. At the same time, he began giving classes in Salamanca, on the urging of his friend Antonio Tovar. In 1958 he received the Larramendi Chair in Basque Language and Literature at Salamanca University (the first such chair dedicated to Basque in a Spanish university). He received his doctorate in 1959. In 1968, he became professor of Indoeuropean linguistics. This period in Salamanca was to be one of the happiest times in his life, for both Mitxelena and for his family. = Creation of Unified Basque = At the same time as he began giving classes in Salamanca, the Royal Academy of the Basque Language charged him with the great responsibility of unifying the written Basque language, among other things because of the disputes caused by the use of the letter H. His point of view was not the neutral one of a linguist, but also had the input of sociolinguistics in his mind. He clearly saw that it would be necessary to build Unified Basque on the most useful of the central Basque dialects. In the same way, he saw where the future could come from, and knew to connect with the sensibilities had by the young Bascophiles of the time. = Teaching in Paris = One of the famous consequences of the events of May 1968 in France was the decentralization and extension of the university. Between 1969 and 1971, Mitxelena taught comparative Basque linguistics at the Sorbonne as professeur associ√© and charg√© de cours in the √âcole Pratique des Hautes √âtudes. The friendship Mitxelena had with Andr√© Martinet at this time should be mentioned. At the beginning, he would often visit Martinet's house, and he eventually entered into his circle of friends and scientists, as well as into his publishing network. = A multifaceted and acute observer = Mitxelena was a linguist of true calling, and had knowledge of many languages, but beyond that, he was an avid reader of literature, including detective novels. He also had an interest in the cinema, writing many interesting reviews and critiques in Basque. He was asked to be part of many juries at cultural events, and his advice was sought for judgments on the level of education and culture. = In the Basque Country again: Creating the University of the Basque Country = During the period of Spain's political transition and first elections, Mitxelena was still in Salamanca. He nevertheless maintained close ties with the Basque Country and took part in many major events there. One was the creation of the University of the Basque Country (EHU-UPV) and cultural normalization. In his later years, starting in 1978, Mitxelena taught at the EHU-UPV and was active in preparing the first generation of Basque philologists. Mitxelena also spent many years preparing a Basque dictionary. The first volume of the General Basque Dictionary was finally published in 1987, but Mitxelena was unable to see it, as he had died shortly before, in that same year. Later, Ibon Sarasola, who had worked with Mitxelena on the project, continued to lead work on the dictionary, until completing its publication in 2005.  Works  Mitxelena wrote twelve books, 260 articles, and 236 reviews and critiques.

He produced around 200 paintings, 100 drawings and 50 prints before dying of tuberculosis at the age of 30. His restrained, detailed work ranged from self-portraits to landscapes and studies of birds and animals. His work is now exhibited in his native Netherlands in the Museum of Modern Art Arnhem, Museum Belv√©d√®re Heerenveen and Museum MORE Gorssel. Biography Mankes had a reputation as an ascetic living in a kind of self-chosen isolation in De Knipe, Friesland, far from the heart of the country's culture. In reality he was well aware of what was going on, read the leading newspapers and magazines, and was supplied by friends with newspaper clippings and other material. In addition, he had lived in The Hague and (because of his tuberculosis) in Eerbeek, in Gelderland, but preferred to keep an \\"intimate distance\\". A progressive Protestant, in 1915 he married Anne Zernike, the country's first female minister with a doctoral degree. Zernike was a Mennonite; a drawing of her, made by Mankes in 1911, is in the collection of the Fries Museum in Leeuwarden. From 1909 onwards he was financially supported by A.A.M. Pauwels (1875-1952), a tobacco merchant and art collector from The Hague. Mankes' letters to Pauwels, in which he often thanks him for money and material sent to him, take up seven hundred pages (including annotations) and were published in 2012 by the Netherlands Institute for Art History; Pauwels' letters are not preserved. Style and technique He is sometimes categorized as a symbolic realist, though Carel Peeters notes that the abstract qualities of Mankes's work remove him from both symbolism and realism. When working with oil-paints he was able to bring a kind of transparency to the paint especially when he was working with white, which acquired a pearly lustre because of his soft brush strokes. In self-portraits, observers noted, this gave his white skin a rather sickly appearance. Mankes studied and then sketched his subjects (often birds and farm animals) \\"until he knew them by heart, and then painted them from memory\\". One of his favorite animals (he kept it in his room) was an owl, sent to him by his benefactor Pauwels. Mankes used a glazing technique, in which a large number of layers of paint on an opaque base \\"lend a fairytale- like quality to the owl\\".

They played over fifty concerts across England during this period, often as headliners (including one night headlining the Marquee Club) as well as supporting bands like Ancient Rites, Cradle of Filth and Dissection. Musical style Dark Heresy is considered a progressive death metal band. Dark Heresy's 1993 demo Diabolus in Musica was praised for amalgamating \\"well-chosen sprinklings of classic Morbid Angel with a UK death [metal] flair\\", and for mixing thrash \\"with classy chunks of unapologetic metal.\\" Although dismissed by rock music magazine Kerrang! as \\"a widdly Carcass\\", their 1995 album Abstract Principles Taken to Their Logical Extremes was praised by extreme music magazine Terrorizer, who wrote that \\"Dark Heresy's music is not about mind-numbing brutality and dazzling speed, but is about complex and reflective musical structures supporting complex ideas ... while the vocals swing from gruff grunts to choral chants\\", and described Diabolus In Musica as \\"one of the most inventive works from an occultist band.\\" Writing in Isten magazine in 1996, Endre Begby described Dark Heresy as \\"speak[ing] a tonal language very uncommon in death metal\\" and \\"break[ing] out of the fifth and major/minor third patterns.\\" He similarly compared part of Abstract Principles Taken to Their Logical Extremes to Morbid Angel's 1989 debut album Altars of Madness, while noting that other parts are \\"totally flipped out, finding no comparison in modern metal\\", and summing up that Dark Heresy \\"fuck with the very foundation of death metal as we know it\\". Heavy metal and hard rock website Worshipmetal.com agreed with these assessments when revisiting Abstract Principles Taken to Their Logical Extremes in 2017, noting the complex compositions, and adding that Dark Heresy \\"seemed to throw every single idea into the mix, culminating in a bewildering experience that managed to be both beautiful and brutal in the same breath\\", and finding similarities between Dark Heresy's music and that of Carcass, Pestilence, and the Mahavishnu Orchestra, and describing their approach to songwriting as \\"difficult to pin down but ... utterly unique nonetheless.\\" Lyrics Written by vocalist Kola Krauze 1993‚Äì1995, Dark Heresy's lyrics were extremely long and dealt with themes such as Norse and Germanic mythology and paganism, historical themes such as the Middle Ages, and religion and anti-religion. Describing them as \\"many anti-Christian diatribes which are as clever as they are shocking or sardonic\\", Terrorizer magazine claimed that \\"After hearing [Abstract Principles Taken to Their Logical Extremes], you too may seriously question many aspects about the spiritual self\\". Legacy A decade after Dark Heresy had split up, DragonForce's Herman Li said of them, \\"they're the ones everybody knows the name of. You know, loads of people have got a copy of [Abstract Principles Taken to Their Logical Extremes]. They must have beaten a lot of people up.\\" Singer-songwriter Mat McNerney has similarly cited Dark Heresy as an early influence. In 2017, Abstract Principles Taken to Their Logical Extremes was named one of the 10 greatest old school UK death metal albums by heavy metal and hard rock website Worshipmetal.com, whose editor described the album as a \\"lasting legacy\\", and noted that Dark Heresy \\"were a complete anomaly in their ... genre\\".

For the first time in the band's history, they were able to find a settled lineup to back up the band's core- line up of band leader Robert Poss, Susan Stenger and drummer Ron Spitzer, after Karen Higlof and Page Hamilton departed the band following the release of Love Agenda (1989). With Anne Husick and Mark Lonergan replacing them, the band entered their \\"classic line-up\\" and recording The Word and the Flesh in New York City in spring 1990, with Poss acting as producer. The album was the band's \\"tribute to the E chord\\", and is often considered to the band's most accessible album, with a less reverbed guitar sound and more song-orientated approach than before. The final track, \\"Guitar Trio\\" is a work from when Poss and Stenger worked with experimental composer Rhys Chatham in the 1980s. The Word and the Flesh was belatedly released in September 1991 by Restless Records. It originally received mostly positive reviews from music critics from a variety of magazines. Over time, its legacy has been increasingly positive, with one review calling it \\"perhaps the finest hour by the Susans,\\" and in 2014, music journalist Andrew Earles included the album in his book Gimme Indie Rock: 500 Essential American Underground Rock Albums 1981‚Äì1996. Background and recording When Band of Susans formed in New York City in 1986, they consisted of Robert Poss (guitar and vocals), Susan Stenger (bass and vocals), Ron Spitzer (drums), with Susan Lyall (guitar), Susan Tallman (guitar), and Alva Rogers (vocals), and took their name from the trio of Susans then in the lineup. Poss, Stenger, and Spitzer grew up together in Buffalo, New York. After releasing their d√©but album Hope Against Hope (1988), Rogers, Lyall and Tallman quit, and were replaced by Karen Haglof (guitar) and Page Hamilton (guitar). The new line-up recorded the band's second album, Love Agenda (1989), and a Peel Sessions EP that was not released until 1992, but the two new guitarists ultimately quit, with Haglof attending medical school and Hamilton quickly forming the more metal-influenced Helmet.TrouserPress.com :: Band of Susans In 1990, Anne Husick (guitar) and Mark Lonergan (guitar) replaced the two former guitarists, thus creating the band's \\"classic lineup\\". In an interview with The Chicago Tribune, who considered the line-up to \\"so successfully subsume their individual abilities to the group aesthetic,\\" Poss said \\"it's hard to find people who are both talented and restrained. The guitar ethos is this male, masturbatory thing in that if you play guitar and you're good the first thing you want to do is show people how good you are and how much you know. Many virtuoso instrumentalists lack the discipline and focus of knowing when not to play.\\"Veil Of Noise - tribunedigital- chicagotribune The band signed to independent label Restless Records and began work on their third album at the start of the same year. The album was recorded at Platinum Sound Recording Studios in New York City in May and June 1990 with engineer Oz Fritz. As with the band's prior albums, Poss was the sole producer of the album. Chris Gerhinger mastered the album at The Hit Factory, a New York recording studio famous for its clientele. Music The band considered the album to a tribute to the E guitar chord.

It became one of his favorite tracks. The album closes with the thirteen minute \\"Guitar Trio\\", a cover version of the \\"hypnotic, slow-building fugue\\" of the same name by experimental American guitarist and experimental composer Rhys Chatham, which, as the name suggests, was composed for three electric guitars,http://www.rhyschatham.net/g3english/GuitarTrioScore.pdf and suited the band as they had a trio of guitarists. Poss considered Chatham a former mentor, as numerous members of the band began their careers in Chatham's ensembles.Rhys Chatham & Angie Eng At The Kitchen Artist Organized Art According to one commentary, \\"this parallels the way that members of fellow NYC noise rockers Sonic Youth began their careers in Branca's ensembles; Thurston Moore of Sonic Youth did play with Chatham as well.\\" Despite how critics have characterized the album, Poss has retrospectively stated that the album was very much a sonic project instead of a melodic one, and in an interview with Onda Rock, Poss said \\"the melody I've never been entirely concerned. I'm pretty obsessed with texture and architecture of sound. By repetition, the level, space, distortion density. I love the interactions between seals and lines that generate ghost motifs, melodies and subliminal sounds. I like mysterious reasons, buried, the sounds that are fighting against each other to be heard in opposition to the standardization of \\"battery-hand-and everything else subordinate to this\\" that characterizes a large part of rock music, even the same noise-rock. The Word and the Flesh sounds as if the listener's head had been squashed in the middle amplifier, so to speak.\\" Release The album was released in mid-September 1991 by Restless Records in the United States, and by Rough Trade Records in Germany. The album cover, photographed by Geoffrey Notkin, features Poss' red SC-1 guitar, manufactured by G&L; Musical Instruments. His other guitars of the same model had featured on other album sleeves by the band, and in 2009 Poss said that \\"the metonymic significance of my SC-1 reached its zenith when the guitar was used as the central design motif for our Love Agenda, The Word and The Flesh and Peel Sessions CDs.\\"guitarnerd.com.au ¬ª Robert Poss & the G&L; SC-1 Dale Hyatt and Leo Fender provided the band with their G & L guitars, and the latter was a \\"rabid Band of Susans fan.\\" The back cover features a 1960 artwork by Karel Plicka.

Sounds were very favourable, saying \\"this will blow yer fuckin head right off....This is utterly dazzling.\\" Alternative Press called it \\"a feast for the guitar-rock aficionado,\\" whilst Melody Maker called it \\"molten passion.\\" A more mixed review came from Ivan Kreilkamp of Spin, who said \\"a band with a big booming sound must take care not to fall into empty portentiousness. When Thaila Zedek sang for Live Skull‚Äìa group often sharing Band of Susans' Glenn Branca trained New York guitar drone heritage‚Äìshe always managed, with a phrase as simple as \\"It's not really having fun / it's like trying to forget someone,\\" to pin a recognizable emotion to the vast swell of the music. This is a trick Band of Susans doesn't always pull off. The Word and the Flesh suggests a penchant for abstract allegory that the song titles \\"Ice Age\\" and \\"Estranged Labor\\" distressingly confirm. And \\"Sermon on Competition, Part 2,\\" offering the promise of a sense of humor, only delivers \\"Some day I'll make you crawl / some day I'll have it all,\\" sung in the gothic wall of a herald of capitalist doom. No doubt about it, Band of Susans is affected by a bad case of self-importance that undermines its nice big guitar sound.\\" However, he commented that \\"there are exceptions, especially the no-nonsense \\"Now is Now,\\" which achieves real propulsive force and infuses a line like \\"You know she'll always be there when she needs you\\" with bracing sarcasm.\\"Spin volume 7, October 1991.

The rebels killed the local merchant and the local lensmann, whipped their servants and the village priest, and burned down the merchant's house. The rebels were later seized by other Sami, who killed two of the rebels in the process. Two of the leaders, Mons Somby and Aslak H√¶tta, were later executed by the Norwegian government.The Kautokeino Rebellion 1852 (The University of Texas at Austin) Background The incident was connected to a religious revival movement that was inspired by the preacher Lars Levi Laestadius. His teaching, which had great influence on the Sami in Norway at the time, demanded a more spiritually pure lifestyle and abstaining from alcohol. The movement turned more militant as their followers, called Laestadians, saw the Norwegian State Church as too close to the state-run alcohol industry. They formed their own congregations separate from the state church. In a short period of time, a minority of these followers became more militant. They believed their moral authority was greater than that of the state church, and they were later accused of interrupting its services. During this time, the Sami were economically far poorer than the Norwegian settlers in the north, counting wealth in reindeer or other livestock (rather than currency), and they were considered socially inferior to the Norwegians. The local merchant, who sold the local Sami liquor, was a target for the rebellion due to his repeated cheating and exploitation of Sami customers, many of whom were vulnerable alcoholics. Alcoholism was widespread and had been highly destructive to the Sami and their culture during this time. The Laestadians were against the sale and use of liquor. Thus, the Sami were at odds not only with the local priest and merchant but also Norwegian law.Lars Levi Laestadius and the Sami (Samiskt Informationscentrum Aftermath All the men arrested for participating in the revolt - except the two leaders Aslak H√¶tta and Mons Somby (who were beheaded in Alta) - ended up in Akershus Fortress at Oslo.

The rebellion was not a direct response to the forced assimilation policy of Norwegianization that later became an official government policy, but the 1852 rebellion affected the choices made by the new Norwegian state as this policy was implemented.Chronology/Events: Kautokeino Rebellion (Nordic Film History) The opera Aslak Hetta (1922) by Finnish composer, Armas Launis tells the story of the rebellion in somewhat romanticized form.Aslak Hetta: opera (Opera Magazine)  See also  *The Kautokeino Rebellion - 2008 film about the 1852 riots *Environmental racism in Europe  References   External links  * NRK Radio interview Niillas Somby, descendant of Mons Somby November 13, 2008.

After establishing their \\"classic-line up\\" with their previous album The Word and the Flesh (1991), and recording the EP Now (1992), the band aimed for a new, more sonic and experimental direction on Veil, after the more song- centirc approach to The Word and the Flesh. Recording the album in early 1993, Veil shows the band expand the margins of their sound with a more experimental approach. The album was described as \\"smokey\\" by one critic and an \\"epic swell of guitar and noise\\" by another. The album has been said to combine \\"R&B; rhythms with crushed sonic shards,\\" and has been compared to, and is sometimes considered to be shoegazing music. The album was released in July 1993 by Restless Records in the United States and by Rough Trade Records in Germany. It was a critical success, with critics complimenting its sonic and textural sound. Melody Maker said \\"this is the kind of record that puts everything else into perspective\\" and that \\"this is rock at its most liberated and free- flowing,\\"Melody Maker review whilst Creem described the band and their sound unequalled. The band built upon the experimental sound of the album for their following, final album, Here Comes Success (1995). Background and recording After forming in 1986, Band of Susans went through numerous line- up changes to accompany the band's core members, band leader and guitarist Robert Poss, bassist Susan Stenger and drummer Ron Spitzer. After releasing two albums, Hope Against Hope (1988) and Love Agenda (1989), the band settled into their \\"classic line up\\" in 1990, featuring the two guitarists Anne Husick and Mark Lonergan in addition to the core members. That year, they recorded The Word and the Flesh, not released until 1991, which saw a more melodic and less noise-concerned sound than their prior albums. In 1992, the band released the Now EP, which, among its six tracks, included two songs which would subsequently appear on Veil: \\"Pearl of Wisdom\\" and \\"Following My Heart\\".Band Of Susans - Now (CD) at Discogs The two songs were recorded and mixed at Baby Monster Studios, New York City, in July and August 1992. The band recorded the rest of Veil in the same studio in January and February 1993. As with the band's previous albums, Poss produced the album alone, whilst Bryce Goggin engineered the album.

Veil sees a change in direction for the band, showing the band \\"expand the margins of their sound\\" with a \\"far more experimental\\" approach than the band's previous albums. Michael Petitti of Tucson Weekly said the band went in a \\"sonically more ambitious\\" direction on Veil, and described the album as \\"smoky\\" and \\"terse,\\"Attractive Nuisance #2: Band of Susans  We Got Cactus whilst Punk Auction said the album was \\"dense\\" and \\"droning\\".Band Of Susans - The cheapest prices on the hottest Band Of Susans cds, cassettes and vinyl records According to Julie Taraska, writing in The Rough Guide to Rock, Veil \\"supplanted R&B; rhythms with crunched sonic shards,\\" whilst Trouser Press describe the album as containing \\"wavering density and stylistic peregrinations.\\"TrouserPress.com :: Band of Susans They said the album has a lesser focus on songwriting than previous albums and that its sound is close to shoegazing at times. According to Robert Palmer of Rolling Stone, Veil sees the band \\"deliver the songs as well as the sound. Tunes like \\"Mood Swing\\", \\"Not in This Life\\", \\"Trouble Spot\\" and the sublime \\"Blind\\" unfurl sharp, both melodies over stick-in-your-head ensemble riffs. Ron Spitzker's drums spit and snap, and Stenger's basslines provide melodic as well as rhythmic backbone.

Mayhem and transcendence, sweetness and bite: The thought of what these people might accomplish with a more substantial recording budget is almost frightening. According to Greg Kot of The Chicago Tribune, Veil sees the band \\"perfect one of the more distinctive vocabularies in the guitar-band pantheon. Instead of taking on traditional lead and rhythm roles, the three guitarists create a matrix of riffs that interlock and fly apart. Susan Stenger's bass frequently states the melody, while Ron Spitzer's drums knock out precision patterns that mesh with the guitars. There's an intellectual rigor that underpins the music, but it doesn't stifle the passion.

The band is no longer content to let the guitars drone with feral ferocity, instead exploring greater use of dynamics, dissonance, and interplay. Far more experimental in approach than their previous albums, the rewards are revealed with repeated listening as the complexity of the songs' interior structures becomes more transparent.\\" When Onda Rock retrospectively commented that Veil records \\"all sorts of contamination to the point that the distortion seeks to camouflage, distorting, the typical features of rock music,\\" Poss said that the band \\"tried not to repeat twice the same album\\" and said that he thinks Veil \\"show how the Poss-Stenger torque is gained,\\" commenting \\"I thought that we could delve a little 'more in rock music (\\"Pearls of Wisdom\\", for one thing,) while continuing to develop new hybrid music trans-genre. I think you and Susan were mostly interested in extending the vocabulary of that much of the band.

History It lies in the historical region of Cieszyn Silesia. Up to recently it was stated that the village was first mentioned in 1566 as Rudnik, however another documents exists issued by Wenceslaus III Adam, Duke of Cieszyn on 5 November 1608 which retrospectively affirms another document from 1523 that mentioned the village among others obliged to consume ale produced only in Cieszyn. Politically the village belonged then to the Duchy of Teschen, a fee of the Kingdom of Bohemia, which after 1526 became part of the Habsburg Monarchy. After World War I, the fall of Austria-Hungary, the Polish‚ÄìCzechoslovak War and the division of Cieszyn Silesia in 1920, it became a part of Poland. It was then annexed by Nazi Germany at the beginning of World War II. After the war it was restored to Poland.  Geography  Rudnik lies in the southern part of Poland, north-east of the county seat, Cieszyn, west of Bielsko-Bia≈Ça, south-west of the regional capital Katowice, and east of the border with the Czech Republic.

Life and career Born Ann Jacques Hovey in Mount Vernon, Indiana, Hovey was born into a wealthy and prominent family. A descendant of Alvin Peterson Hovey, a Union Army officer during the Civil War and the governor of Indiana from 1888 to 1891, Hovey's mother had been a part of the San Francisco high society scene until marrying Hovey's father, a prominent banker. At the age of seven, Hovey was involved in an automobile accident which caused temporary loss of sight in her left eye. Eventually the injury healed and her sight in the eye returned. She attended \\"Indiana High School\\", and after graduation she pursued a career as a chorus girl. On a minor contract with Warner Bros., Hovey began appearing in films in 1933, her first being as an uncredited chorus girl in 42nd Street with Ginger Rogers and Warner Baxter, which would be Ginger Rogers' breakthrough movie. Hovey's first credited role was in the 1933 film Private Detective, starring William Powell. She appeared in six films that year, two of which were credited. In 1934 she appeared in three films, one of which was credited, but was selected as one of thirteen girls to be \\"WAMPAS Baby Stars\\", the last year that \\"WAMPAS\\" made those selections. In 1935, Hovey appeared in only one film, Circus Shadows, but was still receiving attention due to her \\"WAMPAS Baby Star\\" title. Dark haired and pretty, Hovey eventually caught the attention of studios after appearing in several films as a chorus girl and in minor acting roles, and in 1936 she signed a contract with RKO. That year she appeared in only one film, but it would be her most memorable, placing her in a supporting role to cowboy film star Tom Keene and Joan Barclay in the western The Glory Trail. She would have roles in five films in 1937, three of which were credited; then, in 1938 she would have a minor role in Flirting with Fate, which would be her last. That year she married William Crowell of the Crowell Publishing Company, and retired from acting. Later years and death She and Crowell later divorced, and she married Robert Husey, a press agent, to whom she would remain married until his death. During the mid-1990s, when informed that she was being sought after by fans of her films, Hovey commented, \\"I'm surprised. I never thought I was any good.\\" She and Husey had moved to Arizona, where she was residing at the time of her death, only four days shy of her 96th birthday, on August 25, 2007.

Politically the village belonged then to the Duchy of Teschen, a fee of the Kingdom of Bohemia, which after 1526 became a part of the Habsburg Monarchy. In 1612 Adam Wenceslaus, Duke of Cieszyn bestowed the village upon his hofmeister Margareth Kostlach (Polish: Ma≈Çgorzata Kostlach√≥wna), as a reward for her good service at the ducal court. The gift was also privileged, so that Margareth Kostlach could increase population of Brzez√≥wka. Later also craftsmen settlement was allowed, which was extraordinary for a village as previously it was reserved for a ducal town of Cieszyn. As it can be later inferred, Margareth Kostlach was a lover of the duke, that got pregnant with him, bearing his bastard son Wenceslaus Gottfried. After the Revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire a modern municipal division was introduced in the re-established Austrian Silesia. The village as a municipality was subscribed to the political and legal district of Cieszyn. According to the censuses conducted in 1880, 1890, 1900 and 1910 the population of the municipality grew from 300 in 1880 to 351 in 1910 with the majority being native Polish-speakers (between 99.7% and 100%). In terms of religion in 1910 majority were Roman Catholics (72.1%), followed by Protestants (27.9%). The village was also traditionally inhabited by Cieszyn Vlachs, speaking Cieszyn Silesian dialect. After World War I, the fall of Austria-Hungary, the Polish‚ÄìCzechoslovak War and the division of Cieszyn Silesia in 1920, it became a part of Poland. It was then annexed by Nazi Germany at the beginning of World War II. After the war it was restored to Poland.  Geography  Brzez√≥wka lies in the southern part of Poland, approximately north of the county seat, Cieszyn, west of Bielsko-Bia≈Ça, south- west of the regional capital Katowice, and east of the border with the Czech Republic. The village is situated on the geographical border between Silesian Foothills in the south and Ostrava Basin in the north, approximately above sea level, north-west of the Silesian Beskids. It is drained by several small streams, left tributaries of Piotr√≥wka, in the watershed of Odra. ALthough the name of the village is derived from trees, nowadays it's almost completely deforested.

Sturmgruppen 1944  Jagdgeschwader 4 became one of only three Luftwaffe geschwader to operate the specialised 'bomber-killer' gruppen designated Sturmgruppe. II./JG 4 Sturmgruppe was formed on 12 July 1944 at Salzwedel from I./Zerst√∂rergeschwader 1 (ZG 1) and from elements of Major Hans-G√ºnter von Kornatzki's Sturmstaffel 1. The gruppe was equipped with the modified and heavily armoured FW 190A-8/R2. While the heavily armoured fighters proved effective against the heavy bombers of the USAAF, they proved vulnerable to the numerous escort fighters and hence suffered heavy losses. III./JG 4 was also formed in July 1944 from III./ZG 1 in Rotenburg. In common with other fighter units engaged in Reichsverteidigung operations the Geschwader were sported unique coloured rear fuselage banding markings in mid 1944, with differing color combinations unique to each wing. JG 4's marking was a black- white-black band on the rear fuselage. On 11 September 1944 II.(Sturm)/JG 4 escorted by III. Gruppe intercepted a USAAF bombing raid near Chemnitz. Attacking the 100th and 95th Bomb Groups the Geschwader claimed some 13 destroyed bombers. Intercepted by the 339th and 55th Fighter Groups JG 4 was severely mauled, and lost 21 pilots killed and 9 more were seriously injured during the mission. In October 1944 IV./JG 4 was formed from elements of II./JG 5 in Finsterwalde, equipped with the Messerschmitt Bf-109G and K. On 2 November the Sturmgruppe, in conjunction with IV./JG 3, intercepted American bomber formations in the Leipzig area. II./JG 4 attacked the 457th Bomb Group and destroyed nine B-17s, although the gruppe lost 16 FW-190s out of 22 committed to the massed US fighter escorts.

Apart from for II.(Sturm)/JG 300, heavy losses meant the Sturmgruppen had virtually ceased to exist by late November 1944, and with the transfer to Babenhausen in December 1944 the remnants of II./JG 4 would carry out the same fighter and ground attack operations as their sister units for the rest of their existence, and would not claim another heavy bomber.'Luftwaffe Sturmgruppen', Weal, page 106 In early 1945 II.

During Operation Bodenplatte on 1 January 1945 JG 4, along with all other units taking part, again took very heavy losses. With 75 JG 4 aircraft tasked with various targets, including an attack on Le Culot airfield, I, II and IV gruppen were hit by heavy anti-aircraft fire and the massed formation became scattered and therefore impossible to co-ordinate an effective attack, with only 12 or so aircraft locating or attacking any intended objective. Overall, some 26 fighters were lost and 6 damaged; with nearly half the participating aircraft lost, JG 4 suffered the highest percentage losses of all the units taking part in the operation.'Bodenplatte-The Luftwaffe's Last Hope', Manrho& P√ºtz, page 188 By late January 1945 JG 4 was deployed in Guben-J√ºterbog until the end of the war in May.

By early February 1945 II.(Sturm)/JG 4 were located at Neuhausen under Major Gerhard Schroeder in defence of Cottbus. Although nearly 400 vehicles were claimed destroyed, losses during the month inevitably emasculated the unit, with some 57 aircraft lost, with 26 pilots killed or missing and 14 wounded.The Last Year for the Luftwaffe, Alfred Price, page 142 I./JG 4 was dissolved during March 1945 and the remustering of the unit personnel as infantry followed. Elements of JG 4 flew their last sorties against the Soviet armies and air forces around Berlin and in late April 1945 the unit withdrew to the Schleswig-Holstein area and disbanded on 8 May 1945.

Featuring many of Britain's top jazz musicians, and arranged by big band arranger Harry South, it marked a departure from Fame's R&B; hits with the Blue Flames. The record peaked at number 9 on the national albums chart in the UK. The album includes cover versions of songs by King Curtis and James Brown, as well as compositions written by Fame (credited under his real name, Clive Powell). While its commercial performance paled against his previous releases, Sound Venture earned Fame artistic credibility and resulted in a joint tour with American jazz musician Count Basie. Elvis Costello, in a 1999 interview for Mojo magazine, described the impact the album made on him: > In 1966 I was 12 and already a big Georgie Fame fan.

He wrote 17 books and more than 290 other publications, mostly on schizophrenia and behavioral genetics, and created the first academic program on behavioral genetics in the United States. He won awards such as the Hofheimer Prize for Research, the highest award from the American Psychiatric Association for psychiatric research. Lastly, Gottesman was a professor in the psychology department at the University of Minnesota, where he received his Ph.D. A native of Ohio, Gottesman studied psychology for his undergraduate and graduate degrees, became a faculty member at various universities, and spent most of his career at the University of Virginia and the University of Minnesota. He is known for researching schizophrenia in identical twins to document the contributions of genetics and the family, social, cultural, and economic environment to the onset, progress, and inter- generational transmission of the disorder. Gottesman has worked with researchers to analyze hospital records and conduct follow-up interviews of twins where one or both were schizophrenic. He has also researched the effects of genetics and the environment on human violence and variations in human intelligence. Gottesman and co-researcher James Shields introduced the word epigenetics‚Äîthe control of genes by biochemical signals modified by the environment from other parts of the genome‚Äîto the field of psychiatric genetics. Gottesman has written and co-written a series of books which summarize his work. These publications include raw data from various studies, their statistical interpretation, and possible conclusions presented with necessary background material. The books also include first-hand accounts of schizophrenic patients and relatives tending to them, giving an insight into jumbled thoughts, the disorder's primary symptom. Gottesman and Shields have built models to explain the cause, transmission, and progression of the disorder, which is controlled by many genes acting in concert with the environment, with no cause sufficient by itself.  Background  Gottesman was born in Cleveland, Ohio, in 1930, to Bernard and Virginia Gottesman (n√©e Weitzner), who were Hungarian‚ÄìRomanian Jewish immigrants. He was educated at Miles Standish Elementary and a public school in Cleveland's Shaker Heights. After leaving school, Gottesman joined the United States Navy, where he was given a scholarship and the rank of midshipman, and was assigned to the Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps at the Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago. He first specialized in physics but changed to psychology, receiving his B.S. degree in 1953. Gottesman did his graduate work at the University of Minnesota, which then patterned its clinical psychology program on the Boulder model, which emphasized research theory and clinical practice. He joined the graduate program in 1956 after three years with the Navy, supported by the Korean War G.I. Bill. He began investigating personality traits in identical and fraternal twins who had filled out the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI). His Ph.D. thesis, submitted to Psychological Monographs, was rejected before a review on the grounds that the nature‚Äìnurture issue it addressed had already been settled in favor of nurture. On appeal, the thesis was reviewed and accepted for publication. Gottesman began his career at Harvard University as a social relations and psychology lecturer. This non- tenure-track position ended after three years. Then he worked with researcher James Shields at the Maudsley‚ÄìBethlem hospital complex in London, using its twin registry to analyze traits of identical and fraternal twins at the lab of Eliot Slater, whom Gottesman met in Rome at the Second International Congress on Human Genetics in 1961.Bertelsen 2011, p. 11 After his return to the University of Minnesota in 1966, Gottesman created a program on behavioral genetics, the first in the U.S. In 1972‚Äì1973 he received a Guggenheim fellowship to work with K.O. Christiansen in Denmark. In 1980 he left to join the Washington University School of Medicine, then moved to the University of Virginia in 1985, where he started the clinical psychology training program. Gottesman continued vising London and collaborating with Shields, with whom he co-wrote a series of books.After spending 16 years at the University of Virginia, Gottesman retired from an active role after 41 years of research, but continues research part-time in psychology and psychiatry. From 2011 till his death, Gottesman was a professor with an endowed chair in adult psychiatry and a senior fellow in psychology at the University of Minnesota; a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the Academy of Clinical Psychology, and the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences at Stanford University; a Guggenheim Fellow for 1972‚Äì1973 at the University of Copenhagen; an emeritus in psychology with a chair endowment at the University of Virginia; and an honorary fellow at the London Royal College of Psychiatrists. He has advised 35 graduate students, and an annual lecture on behavior and neurogenetics has been established in his name by the University of Virginia. Gottesman was married to Carol Applen, whom he wed on December 23, 1970; they had two sons. Gottesman died June 29, 2016.  Scientific contributions  = Studies on schizophrenia and psychopathology = Gottesman first studied the genetics of schizophrenia on a large scale using the Maudsley‚ÄìBethlem register of twin admissions for 16 years. Later he worked on psychiatric genetics and genomics. In his Twin Cities MMPI study, part of his Ph.D. thesis, Gottesman found high levels of inheritance in the scales related to schizophrenia, depression, anti-social personality disorder, and social introversion. Genes strongly influenced social introversion and aggressive tendencies. This led to further studies on personality traits of identical twins such as the Minnesota Study of Identical Twins Reared Apart. Analyzing the results of the Maudsley‚ÄìBethlem study, Gottesman and Shields devised the multi-element, polygenic causation model for schizophrenia by modeling schizophrenia diagnoses using the recently introduced liability- threshold model. The book that summarized and expanded on the study, Schizophrenia and Genetics: A Twin Study Vantage Point, argued that schizophrenia is a product of several genes acting together, and introduced the techniques of precise analysis in the field of behavioral genetics.Gottesman and Shields introduced terms such as \\"reaction ranges/surface\\", \\"endophenotype\\" and \\"epigenetic puzzle\\" into the behavioral sciences. The threshold model hypothesized that both genetic and environmental risks combined to produce schizophrenia, and pushed an individual into a diagnosable condition when their influence grew strong enough. The reaction range concept is the idea that the genes and the environment control behavior, but with separate upper and lower limits on the strength of that control in each case, a concept now part of basic psychology. Before the study, the prevailing opinion was that schizophrenia originated from bad parental relationships. The researchers showed identical twins were more likely to either have or not have schizophrenia together, concluding the disorder was the \\"outcome of a genetically determined developmental predisposition\\". The Maudsley‚ÄìBethlem study also hypothesized that schizophrenia was caused by a mixture of many small traits working together. These endophenotypes could be used for diagnosis. Endophenotypes have been interpreted as a link between genes and the final behavior, acted on by the environment and chance elements, with biochemical and epigenetic influences changing the genome but not being passed on to children. Molecular-biological studies in genetics have referred to endophenotypes to explain genetic causes of psychopathology. The researchers also examined how schizoids, those with mild, schizophrenia-like personality disorders, were linked to schizophrenics. Gottesman and Shields extended the term to classes of mild psychological disorders in twins and relatives of schizophrenics. The researchers had hypothesized that schizoida in a twin was how a schizophrenia carrier gene, one in a non-schizophrenic still passing on a genetic risk, expressed itself. The twin study did not confirm this. In the Denmark study, the researchers evaluated the extent to which genes underpin psychopathology. Their twin studies of criminality found that a genetic disposition to poor self-control caused both identical twins to become felons, or to not become felons. They also studied identical twins who were discordant for schizophrenia, where one twin was schizophrenic and the other not, and found children of such twins had equal genetic vulnerability to the disease. A later study in the mid-1980s, resulting in a paper awarded the Kurt Schneider Prize, concluded that children of identical twins were at higher risk than those of fraternal twins, indicating the non-schizophrenic identical twin passed on a latent genetic disposition, even if it had not been expressed through schizoida. The Denmark study introduced the concepts of \\"unexpressed genotypes\\"the latent genetic risk, and \\"epigenetic control\\"the biochemical regulation of how genes work, into the new field of behavioral genetics. = Studies on delinquency and violence = Gottesman's multifactorial model applied to alcoholism In a 1989 review of the research on juvenile delinquency and violence, Lisabeth DiLalla and Gottesman found delinquency could be transitory or continuous, and genes contributed more to the continuous type. In 1991 the same authors published a critique of the then-prevalent idea of antisocial behavior being transmitted through generations by child abuse alone in antisocial families. They stated that a review by Cathy Spatz Widom and the studies she cited had missed an element: children maltreated in families might have been targets because their genes might have influenced them into committing antisocial acts and attracting such treatment from parents. Gottesman was one of the presenters at the 1995 conference at the Aspen Institute in Maryland on how strongly genes controlled a person's leaning toward violence and crime. Gottesman presented results from studies on the influence of genes in criminality, stating that identical twins separated at birth were likely to show similar levels of criminal behavior. This concordance indicated that genes influenced such behavior. He did point out that behavioral patterns were strongly influenced by the environment and not set by genes alone. The conference, funded by the National Institutes of Health, was contentious, with detractors arguing that such studies would lead to minority groups, more likely to be criminals because they had lower social status or were poor, being targeted with gene therapy for violence. Protesters disrupted the conference and swarmed into the auditorium. Gottesman reasserted his belief that scientists should proceed with the research, not waiting for humanity to become ethical enough not to misuse it. = Work on IQ = In 1972, Gottesman was called before the United States Senate by senator Walter Mondale to discuss the then 15-point IQ gap separating African Americans and white Americans. Gottesman testified that genes influenced IQ, but only in conjunction with elements such as schooling, money, and nutritious food from childhood onwards. According to Eric Turkheimer, Gottesman \\"was certainly the most prominent behavior geneticist to refuse to sign\\" the editorial Mainstream Science on Intelligence, which supported a racialist view of intelligence. In 2003, he and colleagues published a study showing that heritability was higher for IQ differences within high socioeconomic status (SES) people than among low SES people, i.e., genes influenced differences between children's test scores more among high SES than among low SES children. = Humanistic views = Gottesman researched and published on the abuse of genetic research in Nazi Germany, and provided expert testimony in a Chinese human rights case involving schizophrenia in the family. His scholarly books on schizophrenia also highlighted the human costs of the disorder. In Schizophrenia Genesis: The Origins of Madness, he provided chapters in which patients describe their experiences of the disease, and those of their families. He opposed the Nazi- associated Pioneer Fund, which funded some of his colleagues. Gottesman emphasized that genetics influences patients' behavior in concert with the family, social, economic, and cultural contexts. Gottesman also highlighted random events as an important \\"third element\\" determining behavior and what unfolds as apparent destiny. In his writings, he reflected that the interaction between these elements is known only at the level of probabilities, and not as fixed and precise quantities.  Books  Gottesman authored nine books, all related to schizophrenia and psychiatric genetics. = Schizophrenia and Genetics: A Twin Study Vantage Point = Gottesman and Shields published Schizophrenia and Genetics to document their twin-study research at the Maudsley Hospital in London, the work that in part earned them the Hofheimer Prize for Research, the highest award for psychiatric research from the American Psychiatric Association. The study expanded on an earlier one by Eliot Slater at the same hospital, covering 24 identical and 33 fraternal twins, with at least one from every pair a schizophrenic being treated at the hospital between 1948 and 1964. This study was one of eleven such in the contemporary literature, and the book detailed the methodology and analytic detail differentiating it from the others. Chapters on methodology comprise a third of the book's core. Identical and fraternal twins were classified using fingerprints and blood groups. Follow-up interviews were recorded to monitor the progress of their patients (the probands) and their twins, some schizophrenic and others not. Two psychological teststhe MMPI and the Object Sorting Test (Goldstein Scheerer Test of Concept Formation)were used to measure mental traits and functioning. Case summaries were prepared by the Scandinavian psychiatrist Erick Essen-Moller, and these were sent, with data on identical-or-fraternal-twin status and diagnosis-of-schizophrenia removed, to six judges from the U.S., U.K. and Japan. The judges independently evaluated whether the patients were schizophrenic. Results of studies comprise another third of the core of Schizophrenia and Genetics. The data showed that genes made a person likely to develop schizophrenia under environmental pressures. The study was not designed to find the genes responsible, but the authors hypothesized there would be several acting in tandem.Contextual elements responsible could not be identified, though some, such as an overly protective mother, birth order, natal weight, and social and economic elements were ruled out. Gottesman and Shields found roughly half of identical twins had a shared schizophrenic or non-schizophrenic status, but only one-eleventh of fraternal twins had such a shared diagnosis. MMPI scales coincided among identical twin pairs but not among fraternal twin pairs. The Object Sorting Test showed no useful relations. Those meeker than their twins were more liable to develop schizophrenia where their genes already put them at risk. The book presents case histories of all the twin-pairs studied and the raw data from the analyses. Its last chapters put the results in the context of existing studies, and presented a new theory and model to explain the causes and continuance of the disorder. The environmental aspects the researchers checked drew on existing literature, and multiple judgments were pooled to both compare and mutually cancel differing criteria for diagnosing schizophrenia. The theory in the book was that many genes work together to dispose a person to the disorder under certain environmental pressures. The model provided no specific therapeutic insight, but was useful as a guideline for further study. = Schizophrenia: The Epigenetic Puzzle = Schizophrenia: The Epigenetic Puzzle outlined the approaches, conclusions and models Gottesman used in his study of schizophrenia. He co-wrote the book with James Shields, who died before it was published. The book introduces methods for diagnosing schizophrenia in a research setting, taking into account national differences in how the disorder was defined, debunked myths such as the mother transmitting schizophrenia, and introduced the concepts of the threshold model and the reaction range. The book provided a tutorial on genetics to make the material self-contained. Family, adoption and twin studies were investigated to determine the ways vulnerability to the disorder changed with genetic similarity to the patient. Together they supported the presence of a genetic contribution to the cause and the progress of schizophrenia. Contextual elements such as birth problems and stressful incidents were also analyzed to help the authors build a combined model to explain the disorder. The researchers analyzed populations to determine the role of genes using simplified mathematical models of the influence of genes and the environment on each other, and with no biochemical signal of the disorder to guide them. Rue L. Cromwell, writing in PsycCRITIQUES, wrote that this approach lacked rigor. The role of genes was less emphasized in the results, with a heritability of 70%, than in earlier studies by Kallman. The researchers investigated neuroanatomy, and specifically the neurotransmitter dopamine, as a possible route by which genes influence the functioning of the brain to produce the symptoms of the disorder. The authors investigated autism and psychiatric disorders among children, but found little relation to adult schizophrenia or genetic influence. They also covered the social implications of the disease, concluding that most schizophrenics were poor because the disorder eroded their resources and abilities. A chapter was devoted to social issues, violence, illnesses, death rates, sexual aspects, and the ability to father or bear children affecting schizophrenics. The authors provided data on the chance of relapse after an episode of the disorder. The book covered new methods and new models for studying schizophrenia. Because the disorder had no unanimously accepted diagnostic criteria, the researchers asked six clinicians and three colleagues to provide their analyses on the reports on 120 twins, and found an agreement of 86% among the clinicians. Averaging the criteria of the clinicians produced a set close to that of Manfred Bleuler, who had adapted it from Emil Kraepelin. = Schizophrenia Genesis: The Origins of Madness = Schizophrenia Genesis: The Origins of Madness, written in 1991, won the William James award from the American Psychological Association. It extensively reviewed how science has looked at schizophrenia. The book presented a vulnerability/diathesis‚Äìstress model to explain the causes of the disorder and a many-cause, many-gene model to explain how it is passed from parents to children. The book has been translated into Japanese and German. Schizophrenia Genesis was written for both the lay person and the clinical professional, and provides data, methods of interpreting the data, and an introduction to genetic analysis as used to analyze role of inheritance in behavior. The book also contains accounts of schizophrenics, with an artist depicting own suffering, saying, \\"I know ... it is craziness when every laugh is about me ... newspapers suddenly contain cures ... sparkles of light are demon eyes.\\" Schizophrenia Genesis starts with the history of schizophrenia. Gottesman takes the view that schizophrenia is a disease of the industrial world. because it is not mentioned in the Bible, by the ancient Greeks, the ancient physicians, or authors including Shakespeare. He saw it first mentioned by physicians in 1809 and by Balzac in a short story in 1832, showing minimally the disorder had by then been recognized as such. In 1896, Kraepelin defined its symptoms, and his student Ernst R√ºdin began a genetic study of its transmission in 1916.} The book noted that schizophrenia existed across cultures and its rates had stayed steady for fifty years. A chapter was devoted to criteria for determining schizophrenia, with Gottesman preferring those developed by Bleuler to those in the American Psychiatric Association‚Äôs Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (version III-R), the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9) and Kurt Schneider‚Äôs method. Diagnosis was based on the ways a person spoke and acted, and the standard measures were hallucinations, delusions, emotional apathy, jumbled thought, and sudden changes in a person. Gottesman mentioned a disparity in schizophrenia diagnosis after World War II across the Atlantic, when U.S. psychiatric diagnoses quadrupled those of British psychiatrists. Family studies on schizophrenia were reviewed. That the disorder runs in families did not suggest it was genetically inherited, since cultural transmission occurs from parents to children. Twin and adoption studies were presented as the standard methods to disentangle contributions from genes and the environment. Gottesman used a computer-based method for calculating the odds of becoming schizophrenic based on the many causes. The book examines the problems caused by schizophrenia for relatives of patients and for society at large, larger- scale ones exemplified by the eugenics policies of states such as Nazi Germany. Two final chapters cover molecular biology and neuroanatomy briefly. Newer methods of behavioral genetics being researched at the time of publication, such as linkage analysis which used the likelihood of neighboring genes being inherited together, were not covered.  Committees and organizations  Gottesman is or has been: *an attendee at the Society for the Study of Social Biology 1967 conference at Princeton University which laid the groundwork for the Behavior Genetics Association (BGA); *president-elect and program chair of the BGA in 1976; *American Psychological Association (APA) member from 1958, and a fellow since 1975; *a fellow of the American Psychiatric Association; *a fellow of the American Psychological Society; *the vice-president of the Society for the Study of Social Biology for 1976‚Äì1980; *the president of the Behavior Genetics Association in 1976‚Äì1977; *member of the American Society of Human Genetics; *the president of the Society for Research in Psychopathology in 1993; and *a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

It was written for Cathy Berberian, with whom Berio was married from 1950 to 1964, and is scored for mezzo-soprano and 17 instruments. It was first performed on 27 April 1972 in Lisbon in the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation Grand Audit√≥rium by Cathy Berberian with Orquesta Gulbenkian, conducted by the composer. Synopsis In the piece a singer‚Äîwho is, in Berberian's description, not a singer who gives a recital but an actress-singer who plays the role of a singer who gives a recital ‚Äîenters the stage to find that the pianist who is to accompany her hasn't arrived. Accompanied by an off-stage harpsichord she starts her recital with a performance of Claudio Monteverdi's \\"Lettera amorosa\\" and \\"Lamento della ninfa\\" but stops to look for the pianist. She then begins a long spoken monologue that is interrupted by over forty, often very brief musical fragments taken from Berberian's repertoire, including works Berio had written for her voice in earlier years, Avendo gran disio and Epifanie.

The castle is the property of the commune and has been listed since 1962 as a monument historique by the French Ministry of Culture.Ministry of Culture: Ch√¢teau  History  A fortified camp existed at Montignac in the 9th century, during the Norman invasions. The castle is located at the crossroads of two important roads, the Via Agrippa from Saintes to Lyon where it crosses the Charente, and Via Chaussada from P√©rigueux to Poitiers. The castle was built and rebuilt several times in the 12th and 13th centuries. It was then a fief of the bishop of Angoul√™me. Guillaume II, Count of Angouleme obtained from the bishop of Angoul√™me, the fief and right to build a castle, with the stones of the Andone Castrum.Ch√¢teaux, manoirs et logis : La Charente, √©ditions Patrimoine et M√©dias, 1993, 499 p. (), p. 63 In the 12th century, ownership of the castle was disputed between Gerard de Blaye, helped by the lords of Saintonge and Poitou, and Vulgrain II of Angouleme, supported by the Duke of Aquitaine. The latter was able to resume building and in 1140 he built the square keep and the walled enclosure. The round towers dates to the 13th century. Renaud II, Lord of Pons, held the castle of Montignac, in the right of his wife Marguerite, lady of Montignac, the only child and heiress of Taleyrand, Lord of Montignac. Montignac passed to the Lusignan family in 1218, when Hugh X of Lusignan asserted the right to the castle of his wife, Isabella, heiress of Anoul√™me. In 1243, he bequeathed the castle to his son, Guillaume de Lusignan. In 1350, it was in the hands of Pierre II d'Amboise, viscount of Thouars, before being bought by La Rochefoucauld family on 13 January 1399. Montignac became a barony in the 15th century and was preserved by the La Rochefoucaulds until the French Revolution. The remains of the castle were dismantled around 1840 and the chapel dedicated to Saint-Marie was destroyed between 1940 and 1950.Jules Martin-Buchey, G√©ographie historique et communale de la Charente, edited by the author, Ch√¢teauneuf, 1914-1917 (reprinted Bruno S√©pulchre, Paris, 1984), 422 p., p. 247  Architecture  Inside the keep Of the enceinte, there remain the gateway with a portcullis and two round towers on top of an escarpment, the western part of the enceinte and a round tower. The present fairground corresponds to the lower courtyard. A 13th century watercolour shows that there were also two towers covered by \\"pepperpots\\". The priory of Saint √âtienne, dating from 1030, was demolished in 1960 and its stones were partly used to rebuild the keep. The latter forms an imposing structure from which the view extends across the valley of the Charente River.

For many years he captained sailing boats on Hamburg's two lakes, the Binnenalster and the Au√üenalster, but in the middle of the 1860s he went to Micronesia on behalf of Hamburg shipping owner and merchant Johann Cesar VI.

Since each type may be exemplified by multiple tokens, there are generally more tokens than types of an object. For example, the sentence \\"A rose is a rose is a rose\\" contains three word types, \\"a\\", \\"rose\\", and \\"is\\"; and eight word tokens of those types, \\"a\\", \\"rose\\", \\"is\\", \\"a\\", \\"rose\\", \\"is\\", \\"a\\", \\"rose\\". The distinction is important in disciplines such as logic, linguistics, metalogic, typography, and computer programming. Overview The sentence \\"they drive the same car\\" is ambiguous. Do they drive the same type of car (the same model) or the same instance of a car type (a single vehicle)? Clarity requires us to distinguish words that represent abstract types from words that represent objects that embody or exemplify types. The type‚Äìtoken distinction separates types (abstract descriptive concepts) from tokens (objects that instantiate concepts). For example: \\"bicycle\\" represents a type: the concept of a bicycle; whereas \\"my bicycle\\" represents a token of that type: an object that instantiates that type. In the sentence \\"the bicycle is becoming more popular\\" the word \\"bicycle\\" represents a type that is a concept; whereas in the sentence \\"the bicycle is in the garage\\" the word \\"bicycle\\" represents a token: a particular object. (The distinction in computer programming between classes and objects is related, though in this context, \\"class\\" sometimes refers to a set of objects (with class-level attribute or operations) rather than a description of an object in the set, as \\"type\\" would.) The words type, concept, property, quality, feature and attribute (all used in describing things) tend to be used with different verbs. E.g. Suppose a rose bush is defined as a plant that is \\"thorny\\", \\"flowering\\" and \\"bushy\\". You might say a rose bush instantiates these three types, or embodies these three concepts, or exhibits these three properties, or possesses these three qualities, features or attributes. Property types (e.g. \\"height in metres\\" or \\"thorny\\") are often understood ontologically as concepts. Property instances (e.g. height = 1.74) are sometimes understood as measured values, and sometimes understood as sensations or observations of reality. Some types exist as descriptions of objects, but not as tangible physical objects. One can show someone a particular bicycle, but cannot show someone, explicitly, the type \\"bicycle\\", as in \\"the bicycle is popular.\\". Such use of typologically similar yet different semantic properties appear in mental and documented models, and are often referenced in everyday conversation.  Typography  In typography, the type‚Äìtoken distinction is used to determine the presence of a text printed by movable type:Brekle, Herbert E.: Die Pr√ºfeninger Weiheinschrift von 1119. Eine pal√§ographisch-typographische Untersuchung, Scriptorium Verlag f√ºr Kultur und Wissenschaft, Regensburg 2005, , p. 23  Charles Sanders Peirce  :There are only 26 letters in the English alphabet and yet there are more than 26 letters in this sentence. Moreover, every time a child writes the alphabet 26 new letters have been created. The word 'letters' was used three times in the above paragraph, each time in a different meaning. The word 'letters' is one of many words having \\"type‚Äìtoken ambiguity\\". This section disambiguates 'letters' by separating the three senses using terminology standard in logic today. The key distinctions were first made by the American logician- philosopher Charles Sanders Peirce in 1906 using terminology that he established.Charles Sanders Peirce, Prolegomena to an apology for pragmaticism, Monist, vol.16 (1906), pp. 492‚Äì546. The letters that are created by writing are physical objects that can be destroyed by various means: these are letter TOKENS or letter INSCRIPTIONS. The 26 letters of the alphabet are letter TYPES or letter FORMS. Peirce's type‚Äìtoken distinction, also applies to words, sentences, paragraphs, and so on: to anything in a universe of discourse of character-string theory, or concatenation theory. There is only one word type spelled el-ee-tee-tee-ee-ar,Using a variant of Alfred Tarski's structural-descriptive naming found in John Corcoran, Schemata: the Concept of Schema in the History of Logic, Bulletin of Symbolic Logic, vol. 12 (2006), pp. 219‚Äì40. namely, 'letter'; but every time that word type is written, a new word token has been created. Some logicians consider a word type to be the class of its tokens. Other logicians counter that the word type has a permanence and constancy not found in the class of its tokens. The type remains the same while the class of its tokens is continually gaining new members and losing old members. The word type 'letter' uses only four letter types: el, ee, tee, and ar. Nevertheless, it uses ee twice and tee twice. In standard terminology, the word type 'letter' has six letter OCCURRENCES and the letter type ee OCCURS twice in the word type 'letter'. Whenever a word type is inscribed, the number of letter tokens created equals the number of letter occurrences in the word type. Peirce's original words are the following. \\"A common mode of estimating the amount of matter in a ... printed book is to count the number of words. There will ordinarily be about twenty 'thes' on a page, and, of course, they count as twenty words. In another sense of the word 'word,' however, there is but one word 'the' in the English language; and it is impossible that this word should lie visibly on a page, or be heard in any voice .... Such a ... Form, I propose to term a Type. A Single ... Object ... such as this or that word on a single line of a single page of a single copy of a book, I will venture to call a Token. .... In order that a Type may be used, it has to be embodied in a Token which shall be a sign of the Type, and thereby of the object the Type signifies.\\" ‚Äì Peirce 1906, Ogden- Richards, 1923, 280-1. These distinctions are subtle but solid and easy to master. This section ends using the new terminology to disambiguate the first paragraph. :There are 26 letter types in the English alphabet and yet there are more than 26 letter occurrences in this sentence type. Moreover, every time a child writes the alphabet 26 new letter tokens have been created.

Biography =Early life and career= The daughter of Mr. and Mrs. P. H. Greear, Barclay was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota. A 1923 newspaper item reported that she was \\"a singer and player\\" whose bird imitations had been broadcast on radio. Her family moved to California when she was still a child due to her mother's wishing to escape the cold climate of the north. Moving to Hollywood to pursue acting, Barclay received her first role at the age of 12, which was credited with her billed as Geraine Greear, in the 1927 film The Gaucho, starring Douglas Fairbanks and Lupe V√©lez. It was her only silent film. In 1930, still billed as Geraine Greear, she had a minor role in King of Jazz. From 1932‚Äì35 she had thirteen uncredited film roles. She was the leading lady opposite Tom Tyler in the 1936 Western film Ridin' On. =Career in B-movies= In 1936, Barclay's career changed for the better when she began starring in westerns opposite some of Hollywood's leading cowboy stars, including Tom Tyler, Hoot Gibson, and Tom Keene. Her first western starring role was opposite Tom Tyler in Ridin' On, followed by Feud of the West alongside Hoot Gibson, Glory Trail with Tom Keene, and Men of the Plains with Rex Bell, all in 1936. That year she received roles in other B-movies that were not westerns as well, including the 1936 crime drama Prison Shadows, which starred Lucille Lund and Edward J. Nugent, and the action/adventure film Phantom Patrol starring opposite Kermit Maynard. From early 1936 to 1939, Barclay had both starring and supporting roles in 35 films, almost all of which were B-movies, mainly westerns, serials, or cliffhangers. Most had her playing the role of the heroine opposite the film's hero. During the latter part of the 1930s she starred alongside such cowboy stars as Slim Whitaker, Tim McCoy, Ben Corbett, Tex Fletcher, Bob Baker and also rejoined Edward J. Nugent in the 1937 adventure film Island Captives. Joan Barclay in Amateur Crook (1937) =Later years= By 1940, Barclay was working steadily, averaging better than six films per year. From 1940 to 1945 she appeared in thirty four films. However, by 1943 she had begun receiving more and more uncredited roles, a trend which would only increase with time. In 1944 she appeared in six films, four of which were uncredited. In 1945, she starred in the Charlie Chan mystery The Shanghai Cobra. It would be her last film.http://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/joan_barclay/biography/ Personal life Barclay married three times, with two children by her second marriage, to Leroy Hillman, whom she wed on July 2, 1945, in Las Vegas. Her last marriage was to George Sullivan, with whom she remained until his death. The couple eventually settled in Palm Desert, California. Death Barclay died in Palm Desert, California, on November 22, 2002, aged 88.

The Jellyfish and Bow Tie models are two attempts at modeling the topology of hyperlinks between web pages. Models of web page topology =Jellyfish Model= The simplistic Jellyfish model of the World Wide Web centers around a large strongly connected core of high-degree web pages that form a clique; pages such that there is a path from any page within the core to any other page. In other words, starting from any node within the core, it is possible to visit any other node in the core just by clicking hyperlinks. From there, a distinction is made between pages of single degree and those of higher order degree. Pages with many links form rings around the center, with all such pages that are a single link away from the core making up the first ring, all such pages that are two links away from the core making up the second ring, and so on. Then from each ring, pages of single degree are depicted as hanging downward, with a page linked by the core hanging from the center, for example. In this manner, the rings form a sort of dome away from the center that is reminiscent of a jellyfish, with the hanging nodes making up the creature's tentacles. =Bow Tie Model= The Bow Tie model comprises four main groups of web pages, plus some smaller ones. Like the Jellyfish model there is a strongly connected core. There are then two other large groups, roughly of equal size. One consists of all pages that link to the strongly connected core, but which have no links from the core back out to them. This is the \\"Origination\\" or \\"In\\" group, as it contains links that lead into the core and originate outside it. The counterpart to this is the group of all pages that the strongly connected core links to, but which have no links back into the core. This is the \\"Termination\\" or \\"Out\\" group, as it contains links that lead out of the core and terminate outside it. A fourth group is all the disconnected pages, which neither link to the core nor are linked from it. The Bow Tie model has additional, smaller groups of web pages. Both the \\"In\\" and \\"Out\\" groups have smaller \\"Tendrils\\" leading to and from them. These consist of pages that link to and from the \\"In\\" and \\"Out\\" group but are not part of either to begin with, in essence the \\"Origination\\" and \\"Termination\\" groups of the larger \\"In\\" and \\"Out\\". This can be carried on ad nauseam, adding tendrils to the tendrils, and so on. Additionally, there is another important group known as \\"Tubes\\". This group consists of pages accessible from \\"In\\" and which link to \\"Out\\", but which are not part of the large core. Visually, they form alternative routes from \\"In\\" to \\"Out\\", like tubes bending around the central strongly connected component.

The name Denbury means burh of the men of Devon, and the hill fort was probably re- occupied some time after the Romans left England and before the Norman conquest: it may have been used by the British as a centre of resistance against the Saxons, or it may have been occupied by the Saxons themselves.

The company operated bus services in five counties (Cheshire, Lancashire, West Riding of Yorkshire, Derbyshire and Staffordshire) through a combination of growth and the acquisition of other bus companies, such as the takeover in 1924 of the Mid-Cheshire Motor Bus Company Limited, which brought new operations in Northwich and Flixton. The company also operated express coach services to London, North Wales and Yorkshire. North Western had garages in: * Altrincham: Oakfield Street * Biddulph: Whalley Street * Buxton: Bridge Street *Castleton, Back StreetSome Castleton history page 9 * Glossop: York Street * Macclesfield: Sunderland Street * Manchester: Hulme Hall Road * Matlock: Bakewell Road * Northwich: Chester Way * Oldham: Clegg Street * Stockport: Charles Street * Urmston: Higher Road * Wilmslow: Church Street Preserved Bristol K5G ECW in Cheetham Hill Road, Manchester The company later became part of the National Bus Company, which eventually split it between its neighbouring subsidiaries; its depots in Stockport, Oldham, Glossop, Altrincham and Urmston areas were transferred to the SELNEC PTE in 1972. The remaining depots and services in Cheshire were transferred to Crosville, however the services originating from Warrington, to Altrincham on the direct route service 37 via Lymm Church and the indirect route service 38 via Dunham Massey, and the route to Urmston, service 42, were jointly licensed with Warrington Corporation. In practice Warrington only operated jointly with Crosville on the 37. Warrington Corporation had enjoyed a good relationship with North Western and the municipality's Wilderspool Causeway depot provided an outstation for two North Western buses, a driver and two conductors, who came under the companies depot at Northwich. Crosville exclusively ran the 38 and 42, largely because these less frequent services were interworked and required specially adapted single decker buses to cope with the low height canal bridge at Dunham Massey on the 38. The buses in question had been transferred from Selnec Cheshire Bus Company to Crosville's Warrington depot for this purpose. The depots in Buxton and Matlock were transferred to Trent Motor Traction. North Western kept hold of its Manchester depot for its remaining express coach services, but the company was renamed as National Travel (North West) Limited in 1974.

The company operated between 1986 and 1998. History In the lead up to the privatisation of the National Bus Company, in 1986 the government stipulated that the larger business units be split to boost competition. Thus Ribble Motor Services whose operations stretched across North West England from Cumbria to the East Lancashire/West Yorkshire borders and Greater Manchester to West Lancashire/North Merseyside was one such company, and in the summer of 1986 its Merseyside - Aintree and Bootle, West Lancashire - Skelmersdale and Greater Manchester - Wigan depots were transferred to a new company, North Western Road Car Company. The North Western Road Car Company name had previously been used by a National Bus Company subsidiary based in Stockport with operations in Cheshire, Derbyshire, South-East Lancashire and what became Greater Manchester until it was split up with parts being absorbed by Crosville Motor Services, Ribble Motor Services, Trent Motor Traction and the SELNEC PTE in 1974.SELNEC's price Commercial Motor 17 March 1972 page 30 The new North Western was based in Bootle, later moving to Aintree with a new livery of red and blue separated by a grey diamond stripe replacing NBC's poppy red.NW Mersey move Commercial Motor 9 March 1989 page 22 Drawlane ownership On 16 March 1988, North Western was to sold to the Drawlane Group,Hansard House of Commons 18 April 1988 which in 1992 was restructured as British Bus.North Western Road Car flies National Bus Company nest Commercial Motor 24 March 1988 page 17 Prior to this North Western had been expanding - the most notable being the introduction of high frequency minibus services to areas of Liverpool/Merseyside like Kensington, Wavertree, Old Swan, West Derby, Broadgreen/Knotty Ash/Dovecot and Huyton which traditionally were not part of Ribble's operating territory and had seen a decline in service provision from former PTE/NBC operators Merseybus and Crosville in particular after Crosville closed its Liverpool depot after an industrial dispute in February 1987. Many expected Merseybus to retaliate against North Western, but it was under siege from new companies like Fareway and Liverline (see later) who began extensive operations in North/South Liverpool. This allowed North Western's competitive moves to pass unchallenged and further expansion in Liverpool seemed likely. However the next opportunity for expansion came with the troubled Crosville Motor Services. Crosville acquisition Crosville Motor Services like Ribble had seen its English and Welsh operations - now Crosville Cymru, split and after abandoning Liverpool (see above) what remained of Crosville in Cheshire and in particular the Wirral was unprofitable due to increased competition not only from Merseybus but also from Staffordshire based Potteries Motor Traction (PMT) which was in a phase of expansion and began a new operation on the Wirral branded as Red Rider as well as new entrants like Busman Buses, CMT Buses, Gold Star and Wirral Bus. Crosville was sold by NBC in 1988 to American banking consortium ATL but ATL's acquisition of Crosville was thought to be a short term move for them to sell the company on for a profit and indeed ATL did sell Crosville on to Drawlane in the autumn of 1989. Initially Drawlane claimed it wanted to develop Crosville and by the end of 1989. a brighter 1980s style green/cream livery and Crosville logos was introduced. However these operations bordered not only North Western's but those of Midland Red North which was also owned by Drawlane and in 1989, Drawlane absorbed the Crosville operations at Runcorn, Warrington and Winsford into North Western with those at Crewe and Macclesfield becoming part of Midland Red North.Drawlane splits CMS Commercial Motor 2 November 1989 page 17 Additionally the Crosville depots at Rock Ferry, Chester and Ellesmere Port were sold by Drawlane to PMT who maintained Crosville fleetnames albeit with PMT's red/yellow livery.PMT snaps up last of Crosville Commercial Motor 8 February 1990 page 29 Bee Line, Amberline and Liverline In September 1989, Drawlane purchased Greater Manchester-based Bee Line Buzz Company from Stagecoach.Companies House extract company no 2405437 Arriva Manchester Limited formerly Bee Line Buzz Company LimitedBee Line Buzzspreads wings Commercial Motor 5 October 1989 page 18 Bee Line used high frequency minibuses and was a major competitor for former PTE operator GM Buses. After the Drawlane takeover Bee Line became a subsidiary of North Western who retained Bee Line branding but began to refocus the service network more towards the south of Greater Manchester with conventional sized vehicles replacing most of the minibuses. In the spring of 1993, British Bus, acquired Crosville Cymru from National Express, who in 1989 had purchased Amberline, a Liverpool-based operator.Competition Commission report 1996 paragraphs 3.5 to 3.7 This proved a good move for North Western as Amberline's South Liverpool operations were consolidated further when British Bus acquired of one of Liverpool's three medium-sized independents Liverline Travel Services in the spring/summer of 1993. Liverline were one of the newcomers to the bus industry and like with Bee Line in Manchester North Western retained the Liverline branding for this mostly South Liverpool operation. Cowie Group and consolidation In August 1996, North Western's parent British Bus, was acquired by the Cowie Group.Cowie Group plc and British Bus Group Limited: A report on the merger situation Competition Commission 31 October 1996 Along with much of the bus industry it was to enter a period of consolidation which saw it acquire further bus operators in the North West of England which included: *Little White Bus - acquired in 1994/95 and an operator of minibus services in the West Lancashire towns of Ormskirk and Skelmersdale *Lofty's - acquired in 1994/95 although they were based some distance away from North Western's core operations in Mickle Trafford, near Chester *South Lancashire Transport - acquired in 1997 was one of the major independent operators in the Merseyside town of St Helens *Star Line Travel- acquired in 1994/95 was a Knutsford based operator who had built up a substantial network of services in Altrincham and Sale - exactly within the operating area of North Western's Bee Line subsidiary *Wigan Bus Company - acquired in the summer of 1995 and one of the major independent operators in the town In 1995, North Western also entered into a series of gentleman's agreements with other bus companies in the North West of England. The first of these was to share Merseyside's bus market with its largest operator, MTL, from which wasteful competition would be eliminated by co-ordinating the services. The second was a direct consequence of its acquisition of the Wigan Bus Company. GM Buses North had some peripheral services linking Wigan and Leigh to St Helens and Warrington and decided to pass these routes to North Western's Wigan Bus in return for North Western giving up its town-based services in Wigan. These and other agreements were subject to a 1995/96 Monopolies & Mergers Commission study which found MTL, GM Buses North/South, North Western and other Merseyside bus operators guilty of collusion, and in breach of fair trade in all the parties involved were fined accordingly. Warrington bus war In January 1995, North Western considerably expanded their Warrington operations. A large fleet of Plaxton Pointer bodied Dennis Darts were drafted into North Western's Warrington depot. Warrington Goldlines - later renamed Warrington Gold Line - along with MTL's Lancashire Travel duplicated the service network of local authority owned Warrington Borough Transport (WBT) with high frequency copy- cat services. This tactic had previously been employed by Stagecoach when its Stagecoach Ribble and Stagecoach Busways subsidiaries flooded Lancaster and Darlington with similar high frequency operations that in turn put Lancaster City Transport and Darlington Corporation Transport out of business. It was thought the Cowie Group/North Western and MTL to a lesser extent were using these tactics to acquire and/or put out of business WBT. However the people of Warrington remained fairly loyal to WBT who campaigned for them to support the 'locally owned' company. WBT also began competing services in Cheshire and Merseyside to irritate North Western and to a lesser degree MTL who were the first to retreat from Warrington in the summer of 1996. A few months later a peaceful agreement was reached with WBT which saw North Western considerably scale down Warrington Gold Line. Mid-90s re-branding and Arriva North Western Leyland National with Skelmersdale branding at Ormskirk, 1998. In 1994, North Western replaced their post deregulation red, blue and silver stripe livery with a new red and blue livery with the associated Bee Line and Liverline having a similar yellow and red and light and dark blue schemes. White was later added to Liverline's livery and a minibus livery of mainly white with blue relief was added. With acquisitions and competitive changes within the company North Western began to trade under different brandings and company names including: *Bee Line - in Greater Manchester *City Express - used from 1995 on a new fleet of Plaxton Verde bodied Dennis Lances that North Western introduced on inter-urban services including H5 Warrington - Liverpool, X5 Runcorn - Liverpool and X30 Chester - Runcorn - Warrington *City Plus - used from 1995 on a new fleet of East Lancs EL2000 bodied Dennis Darts based at Bootle for cross city services 82 Speke - Liverpool City Centre - Netherton and 86 Garston - Liverpool City Centre - Thornton *Dee Line - a re- branding of the acquired Lofty's company (see above) *Little White Buses - a branding used from 1994/95 on minibus services in the West Lancashire area *Leigh Line - a short-lived branding used from 1996 on services in the Leigh area following North Western's acquisition of local operator Heatons Travel, Leigh to Warrington services were moved to this section *Liverline - in Liverpool *No Fuss Bus- a short lived operation which began in the spring/summer of 1997. It used white liveried Leyland Nationals with low fares on popular Liverpool service 86 Garston - City Centre akin to Stagecoach Manchester's Magic Bus concept *North Western - used as a fleet name for all un-branded vehicles/operations *Premier - a branding used from 1995 on services linking Altrincham to Warrington *Runcorn Bus Ways - in the summer of 1994 some of the North Western vehicles based at Runcorn depot were branded Runcorn Busway, in 1995 the entire Runcorn operation was renamed Runcorn Bus Ways although no major changes or expansion of the service network occurred. *Skelmersdale - a branding used from 1997 onwards on a new fleet of Northern Counties Paladin bodied Scania L113s based at Skelmersdale depot *Warrington Gold Line - used from 1995 on a network of competitive services in Warrington (see above) *Star Line - used for the former Star Line Travel services generally in and around Altrincham *Vale Line - village services around the Northwich area, in similar livery to Star Line services *Wigan Bus - used from 1996 on former Wigan Bus Company and North Western inter-urban services in/around Wigan, this operation mostly comprised a new fleet of Wright Axcess- Ultralow bodied Scania L113s North Western increasingly became a secondary fleet name to these brandings and in the summer of 1995, a new yellow, red and blue livery was introduced fleet-wide except for City Express which used white instead of yellow. South Lancashire Transport was one notable exception to this re-branding as North Western acquired this company in the autumn of 1997. In November 1997, the Cowie Group was renamed Arriva, with North Western rebranded in 1998. North Western Road Car Company became Arriva North West, the Bee Line operation becoming Arriva Manchester and Liverline became Arriva Merseyside.Companies House extract company no 1990871 Arriva Merseyside Limited formerly Merseyside Transport Limited References External links *Flickr gallery Category:Defunct companies based in Liverpool Category:Historic transport in Merseyside Category:1986 establishments in England Category:1998 disestablishments in England Category:Former bus operators in Merseyside Category:British companies disestablished in 1998 Category:British companies established in 1986 ","title":"North Western Road Car Company (1986)"},{"id":"14935011","text":"Josephine Hill (October 3, 1899 - December 17, 1989) was an American actress of the silent era.

Indeed, if a country has alkaline, asphalt, sticky, sulfurous waters, it is most likely to have oily springs. Only, their scarceness makes this fact miraculous.\\" In 1743, a Captain Woodruff of a British merchant company remarked that 36 Ogurdjali families resided on the island. They had 26 large boats and some oil wells. Prior to 1917, the Moscow Society, Cheleken-Dagestan Society, Kuzmin and Co, Bostondjoglo, South Caucasian Mining Society, and Second Moscow Group were among established Russian oil companies.

Bin Laden also belonged to the Wahhabi sect and was hence a follower of Ibn Abdul Wahhab Najdi. He subscribed to the Athari (literalist) school of Islamic theology. To effectuate his beliefs, Osama bin Laden founded al-Qaeda, a Sunni Islamist militant organization.Scheuer, Michael, Through Our Enemies' Eyes: Osama Bin Laden, Radical Islam & the Future of America (2003, Brassey's Inc. ); p. 110. In conjunction with several other Islamic leaders, he issued two fatwas‚Äîin 1996 and then again in 1998‚Äîthat Muslims should fight those that either support Israel or support Western military forces in Islamic countries, stating that those in that mindset are the enemy, including citizens from the United States and allied countries. His goal was for Western military forces to withdraw from the Middle East and for foreign aid to Israel to cease as it reflected negatively on Palestinians. Sharia Following an extreme form of Islamism, Bin Laden believed that the restoration of God's law will set things right in the Muslim world. He stated, \\"When we used to follow Muhammad's revelation we were in great happiness and in great dignity, to Allah belongs the credit and praise.\\" He believed \\"the only Islamic country\\" in the Muslim world was Afghanistan under the rule of Mullah Omar's Taliban before that regime was overthrown in late 2001. Differences with Wahhabi Ideology Bin Laden's connection with contemporary Wahhabi Islam is disputed. Some believe his ideology is different in crucial ways. While modern Wahhabi doctrine states that only political leaders can call for jihad, bin Laden believed he could declare jihad. Modern Wahhabism forbids disobedience to a ruler unless the rule has commanded his/her subjects to violate religious commandments. Furthermore, the basic goals of bin Laden are different to contemporary Wahhabists. Bin Laden was most interested in \\"resisting western domination and combating regimes that fail to rule according to Islamic law,\\" while Wahhabism focuses on correct methods of worshiping God, removing idols, and ensuring adherence to Islamic law. On the other hand, some believe bin Laden \\"adopted Wahhabi terminology\\" when they called America \\"the Hubal of the age\\", since Hubal was a stone idol and idolatry (shirk) was the primary Wahhabi sin. Jihad Jihad, a common Arabic word meaning to ‚Äústrife or struggle,‚Äù is referred to in the Qur'an to indicate that Muslims must be willing to exert effort in the cause of God, using their wealth and themselves. It refers to the internal struggle to be a better Muslim, the struggle between good and evil. In a January 2004 message Bin Laden called for the establishment of provisional underground ruling councils in Muslim countries to be made up of \\"ulema, leaders who are obeyed among their people, dignitaries, nobles, and merchants.\\" The councils would be sure \\"the people\\" had \\"easy access to arms, particularly light weapons; anti-armored rockets, such as RPGs; and anti-tank mines\\" to fight \\"raids\\" by \\"the Romans,\\" i.e. United States. His interviews, video messages and other communications always mentioned and almost always dwelt on need for jihad to right what he believed were injustices against Muslims by the United States and sometimes other non-Muslim states,Messages to the World, (2005), p.xix, xx, editor Bruce Lawrence the need to eliminate the state of Israel, and to force the withdrawal of the U.S. from the Middle East. Occasionally other issues arose; he called for Americans to \\"reject the immoral acts of fornication, homosexuality, intoxicants, gambling, and usury,\\" in an October 2002 letter.Oct. 6, 2002. Appeared in Al-Qala'a website and then the London Observer Nov. 24, 2002. Grievances against countries =East Timor= In his November 2001 statement, Osama bin Laden criticized the UN and Australian \\"Crusader\\" forces for ensuring the independence of the mostly Catholic East Timor from the mostly Muslim state of Indonesia. =India= Bin Laden considered India to be a part of the 'Crusader-Zionist-Hindu' conspiracy against the Islamic world.Terrorism in India and the Global Jihad , Brookings Institution, November 30, 2008 =Saudi Arabia= Bin Laden was born in Saudi Arabia and had a close relationship with the Saudi royal family, but his opposition to the Saudi government stemmed from his radical ideology. The Saudi decision to allow the U.S. military into the country in 1990 to defend against a possible attack by Saddam Hussein upset bin Laden, although he was not necessarily opposed to the royal family at this time or going to war with Iraq and even offered to send his mujahedeen from Afghanistan to defend Saudi Arabia should Iraq attack, an offer which was rebuked by King Fahd. From his point of view, \\"for the Muslim Saudi monarchy to invite non-Muslim American troops to fight against Muslim Iraqi soldiers was a serious violation of Islamic law\\". Bin Laden, in his 1996 declaration entitled \\"Declaration of War against the Americans Occupying the Land of the Two Holy Places\\", identified several grievances that he had about Saudi Arabia, the birthplace and holy land of Islam. Bin Laden said these grievances about Saudi Arabia: Bin Laden wanted to overthrow the Saudi monarchy (and the governments of Middle Eastern states) and establish an \\"Islamic Republic\\" according to Shari'a law (Islamic Holy Law), to \\"unite all Muslims and to establish a government which follows the rule of the Caliphs.\\" =Soviet Union= In 1979, bin Laden opposed the Soviet Union invading Afghanistan and would soon heed the call to arms by Afghan freedom fighters. Bin Laden would use his own independent wealth and resources to get Arab fighters from Egypt, Lebanon, Kuwait and Turkey to join the Afghans in their battle against the Soviets. While bin Laden praised the U.S. intervention early on, being happy that the Afghans were getting aid from all over the world to battle the Soviets, his view of the U.S. soon grew sour, stating \\"Personally neither I nor my brothers saw evidence of American help. When my mujahedin were victorious and the Russians were driven out, differences started...\\" After two years into the Soviet war, bin Laden headed to Sudan to continue his work as a construction engineer and an agriculturalist, building bridges alongside some of the people he had fought alongside during the war. =United Kingdom= Bin Laden believed that Israeli Jews controlled the British government, directing it to kill as many Muslims as it could. He cited British participation in 1998's Operation Desert Fox as proof of this allegation. The profound statements from Bin Laden is a reference to Britain's involvement on the creation of the Jewish state in 1948 on the former Mandatory Palestine. =United States of America= Bin Laden's stated motivations of the September 11 attacks include the support of Israel by the United States, the presence of the U.S. military in the Saudi Arabian borders, which he considered to be sacred Islamic territory, and the U.S. enforcement of sanctions against Iraq. He first called for jihad against the United States in 1996. This call solely focused on U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia; bin Laden loathed their presence and wanted them removed in a \\"rain of bullets\\". Bin Laden's hatred and disdain for the U.S. were also manifested while he lived in Sudan. There he told Al-Qaeda fighters-in-training:Wright, The Looming Tower, p. 187 In order to fight the US, apart the military option, he also called for asceticism as well as economic boycott, as during this August 1996 speech in the Hindu Kush mountains: Grievances against the United States In his 1998 fatwa entitled, \\"Jihad Against Jews and Crusaders\\" bin Laden identified three grievances against the U.S.: Bin Laden criticized the United States in a \\"letter to the American people\\" published in late 2002, and further outlined his grievances with the United States in a 2004 speech directed towards the American people.

Killing of non-Islamic believers According to bin Laden's ideology, non- Islamic believers may be deliberately killed in support of jihadism. This position evolved from an earlier, less violent one. In a 1998 interview, he alleged that in fighting jihad, \\"we differentiate between men and women, and between children and old people,\\" unlike hypocritical \\"infidels\\" who \\"preach one thing and do another.\\"Messages, (2005) p.70.

Laughlin about the future of an expanding universe first published in 1999.website shows book content copyrighted by Fred.C.Adams and Gregory Laughlin and All Rights Reserved. retrieved 21/09/2011  Book contents  The book The Five Ages of the Universe discusses the history, present state, and probable future of the universe, according to cosmologists' current understanding. The book divides the timeline of the universe into five eras: the primordial Era, the Stelliferous Era, the Degenerate Era, the Black Hole Era and the Dark Era. In addition to explaining current cosmological theory, the authors speculate on what kinds of life might exist in future eras of the universe. The speculation is based on a scaling hypothesis, credited to Freeman Dyson, the idea being, that all other things being equal the rate of metabolism‚Äîand therefore rate of consciousness‚Äîof an organism should be in direct proportion to the temperature at which that organism thrives. The authors envision life forms completely different from the biochemical ones of Earth, for example, based on networked black holes.  Ages  The time scales treated in the book are sufficiently vast, that, the authors find it convenient to use scientific notation. They refer to the \\"nth cosmological decade,\\" meaning 10n years after the Big Bang. In what follows, n refers to the cosmological decade. =Primordial Era= The Primordial Era is defined as \\"‚àí50 < n < 5\\". In this era, the Big Bang, the subsequent inflation, and Big Bang nucleosynthesis are thought to have taken place. Toward the end of this age, the recombination of electrons with nuclei made the universe transparent for the first time. The authors discuss the horizon and flatness problems. = Stelliferous Era = The Stelliferous Era, is defined as, \\"6 < n < 14\\". This is the current era, in which matter is arranged in the form of stars, galaxies, and galaxy clusters, and most energy is produced in stars. Stars will be the most dominant objects of the universe in this era. Massive stars use up their fuel very rapidly, in as little as a few million years. Eventually, the only luminous stars remaining will be white dwarf stars. By the end of this era, bright stars as we know them will be gone, their nuclear fuel exhausted, and only white dwarfs, brown dwarfs, neutron stars and black holes will remain. In this section, Olbers' paradox is discussed. = The Degenerate Era = The Degenerate Era is defined as \\"15 < n < 39\\". This is the era of brown dwarfs, white dwarfs, neutron stars and black holes. White dwarfs will assimilate dark matter and continue with a nominal energy output. As this era continues, the authors hypothesize that protons will begin to decay (violating the conservation of baryon number given by the Standard Model). If proton decay takes place, the sole survivors will be black holes. If so, life becomes nearly impossible as planets decay. = Black Hole Era = The Black Hole Era is defined as \\"40 < n < 100\\". In this era, according to the book, organized matter will remain only in the form of black holes. Black holes themselves slowly \\"evaporate\\" away the matter contained in them, by the quantum mechanical process of Hawking radiation. By the end of this era, only extremely low-energy photons, electrons, positrons, and neutrinos will remain. = Dark Era = The Dark Era is defined as \\"n > 101\\". By this era, with only very diffuse matter remaining, activity in the universe will have tailed off dramatically, with very low energy levels and very large time scales. Electrons and positrons drifting through space will encounter one another and occasionally form positronium atoms. These structures are unstable, however, and their constituent particles must eventually annihilate. Other low-level annihilation events will also take place, albeit very slowly. Essentially, the universe will eventually turn into a void of nothingness.

It is situated in the centre of the city of Bergen, just east of the head of the V√•gen bay. The church is located at the intersection of the streets Kong Oscars gate and Nedre Korskirkeallmenning. It is one of the churches for the Bergen domprosti parish which is part of the Bergen domprosti (arch-deanery) in the Diocese of Bj√∏rgvin. The large stone church was built in a cruciform style around the year 1150 using designs by an unknown architect. The church seats about 600 people. History The oldest part of the church dates back to the second half of the 12th century. The first church on the site was built around the year 1150. Holy Cross Church was first mentioned in Sverris saga from 1185. At the time of construction, the church was situated on the shore of V√•gen, probably marking the southern border of settlement in Bergen. The name refers to the True Cross (and not to its cruciform plan), and is rendered in English as \\"Holy Cross Church\\" or \\"Church of the Cross\\". This is because it was, as one of only a handful Norwegian churches, in possession of a relic from the True Cross. This relic was later stolen by the Danish king, along with several other relics from all over the country, during the Reformation. Holy Cross Church was damaged in the fires of 1198, 1248, 1413, 1582, 1623, 1640 and 1702; the church originally had two towers, but one was destroyed in the 1582 fire and never rebuilt. It was originally built with straight rectangular plan. The church got its cruciform plan when transepts were added around 1615-1623. The church was a parish church for Holy Cross Church parish in central Bergen from 1320 until 2002. In 2002, several urban parishes in central Bergen were merged to form the \\"Bergen domkirke\\" parish. At the same time, Holy Cross Church ceased to be a regular parish church. It was given over to the Church City Mission (), and is now a special church in the urban parish. The church is an \\"open church\\" that is staffed every day so that people can experience silence or participate in the lighting of candles, conversation, community, attending church services, or listening to music. The Church City Mission focuses a lot on social work among the urban neighborhood as well as religious outreach.

Most frequently compared to Northern Soul and 1960s era girl-groups, the band formed in 2005 while the members were all still in school. They were signed to Wichita Recordings. The band consisted of five people from Stockholm. Their name derived from the Led Zeppelin song \\"Dancing Days\\" pitched by the band's bassist, Mimmi. History Two of the band members completed school as late as summer 2008, and they received a lot of publicity during 2007, including being featured in NME and on MTV2. They were also nominated for the Best Swedish Act prize at the MTV Europe Music Awards 2007. The band has played many gigs in their native Sweden as well as in the United Kingdom and Germany. They released a 5-track EP in Sweden before being signed by UK label Wichita Recordings, who released a self-titled single in October 2007 (described as \\"Blondie backed by The Attractions\\", and \\"The Slits rehearsing with Bow Wow Wow whilst breaking in a new drummer\\" ), with a second single, \\"Hitten\\". Their debut full-length album In Our Space Hero Suits was released on 6 October 2008, preceded by a single Home Sweet Home on 29 September. The band was chosen personally by Belle & Sebastian to perform at their second Bowlie Weekender festival presented by All Tomorrow's Parties in the UK in December 2010. A second album, Daydreams & Nightmares was released in 2011. The band made a number of festival appearances in the summer including Glastonbury finishing with Popaganda in Stockholm on 27 August. Four days after this performance, the band announced on their website that the group would be 'put to bed for a while'.

He is the creator of the John Wilson Orchestra and Associate Guest Conductor of the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra. Education Wilson was born in Gateshead, Tyne & Wear. He attended Breckenbeds Junior High School in Low Fell, then Heathfield Senior High School in Gateshead (now closed). In the late 1980s he studied music at A-level at Newcastle College, where he conducted a variety of ensembles including a 96-piece orchestra and choir for a concert version of West Side Story. He wrote and directed his own pantomime during this period and he also conducted for many local amateur dramatic societies. Later he attended the Royal College of Music, first as a percussionist, and later studying composition and conducting. During this time he won the institution's Tagore Gold Medal for outstanding academic excellence. Career In 2004 Wilson was appointed the music director for the Hollywood feature film Beyond the Sea, a biopic of the life of Bobby Darin starring Kevin Spacey. In 2007 he conducted the BBC Concert Orchestra in a BBC Proms concert of British film music, followed in 2009 by conducting his own orchestra (the John Wilson Orchestra) in their Proms debut, a celebration of MGM Musicals, and made a further appearance in the 2010 Proms celebrating Rodgers & Hammerstein. He made a further Proms appearance in the 2011 season, entitled \\"Hooray for Hollywood\\", featuring his orchestra with the Maida Vale Singers and soloists. In 2012 he and his orchestra gave another two performances at the BBC Proms. The first was a complete reconstruction of My Fair Lady which was broadcast on radio, the second was a tribute to the composers and arrangers of \\"The Broadway Sound\\" shown on BBC Two. The John Wilson Orchestra has now appeared in every Proms season since 2009, with a semi-staged version of Rodgers & Hammerstein's Oklahoma! being the 2017 Prom. In recent years, Wilson has focused on conducting orchestras and operas, beginning the latter with a series of performances of Ruddigore for Opera North in early 2010. He has conducted the London Symphony Orchestra, notably for the UK premiere of Mark-Anthony Turnage's H√•kan, a concerto for trumpet and orchestra. He has also conducted the Philharmonia, the Swedish Radio Symphony Orchestra, the Glyndebourne Touring Opera, Sydney Symphony Orchestra, CBSO, and regularly conducts BBC Philharmonic Orchestra. In July 2017, he made his debut with the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra in Amsterdam, performing a program of works by Leonard Bernstein and appeared at the Proms conducting the BBCSSO in his role of Associate Guest Conductor. He held the position of Principal Conductor Designate of the RT√â Concert Orchestra from 1 January 2014, until December 2016. Wilson took up the position of Associate Guest Conductor of the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra in September 2016. Wilson has made numerous recordings, both with his own orchestra and as guest conductor, including an ongoing series of discs of music by Aaron Copland, with the BBC Philharmonic, for Chandos Records. In 2018, John Wilson reformed the Sinfonia of London to undertake a series of recordings, beginning with a recording of Korngold's Symphony in F Sharp for Chandos Records. He is a patron of The British Art Music Series along with James MacMillan and Libby Purves. Wilson is also an arranger and orchestrator and has produced a number of orchestrations for film, radio and television. In 2000 he orchestrated Sir Richard Rodney Bennett's incidental music for a BBC production of Gormenghast. This scoring won the Ivor Novello Award for Best Film Score. Wilson orchestrated and conducted Howard Goodall's score for the 2002 BBC film The Gathering Storm about the life of Winston Churchill. Wilson's interest in historical film scores has led to his restoring a number of classic film scores and he is currently reconstructing the orchestrations of all the major MGM musicals, especially those by Conrad Salinger.Ivan Hewett, \\"John Wilson's plea for 'light music'\\", 24 June 2009, The Daily Telegraph Many of the original film scores were destroyed by MGM in 1969, and left only the short scores or piano scores, which Wilson used as a guide when reconstructing. He described in an interview that \\"transcribing music from the soundtrack is an incredibly laborious process and sometimes it's very, very slow going. The cyclone sequence from The Wizard of Oz took forever. I remember spending a whole Sunday doing three or four seconds' worth of music, so complex is that scene, with notes flying all over the page!\\"Chuff Media (2011). \\"That's Entertainment: A Celebration of the MGM Film Musical\\".

They are recognized by the Colombian authorities as one of the Afro-Colombian ethnic groups under the multicultural policy pursued since 1991. Demographics In 2005, the Raizal were 57% of the 60,000 inhabitants of the San Andr√©s y Providencia Department, according to official statistics, but other sources claim they are now a minority population in the archipelago because of migration from and to mainland Colombia. Raizals are of pure African descent or mulattoes of African and British descent. The Raizal community in the mainland is represented by the Organizaci√≥n de la comunidad raizal con residencia fuera del archipi√©lago de San Andr√©s, Providencia y Santa Catalina (Orfa, based in Bogot√°).website: Organizaci√≥n de la Comunidad Raizal con Residencia Fuera del Archipi√©lago  Self-determination  In 1903, the local Raizal population of the Providencia and Santa Catalina Islands rejected an offer from the United States to separate from Colombia and to imitate Panama. Towards the late 1960s, separatist movements became active in the archipelago. The first separatists, an underground movement, were led by Marcos Archbold Britton, who addressed a memorandum to the United Nations asking for the inclusion of the archipelago in the list of colonized territories. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) paid a private visit to the archipelago shortly afterwards, arousing suspicion in mainland Colombia. The second movement, which started in the late 1970s, grew stronger in the following decade, and culminated in the creation in March 1984 of the Sons of the Soil Movement (S.O.S.), openly claiming the right to self- determination. Since 1999, another organization, the Archipelago Movement for Ethnic Native Self-Determination for the Archipelago of San Andr√©s, Providence and Santa Catalina (AMEN-SD),website: Archipelago Movement for Ethnic Native Self-Determination for the Archipelago of San Andr√©s, Providence and Kethlena a radical separatist movement led by Rev. Raymond Howard Britton, has demanded the creation of an independent state. There are now, according to a document from the Colombian government, two trends among the Raizals: a radical one, the Pueblo Ind√≠gena Raizal, represented by the Indigenous Native Organizations, among whom Amen, Barraca New Face, Infaunas (a Rastafarian- inspired group of farmers and fishermen), Ketna (Ketl√´nan National Association) and the SOS Foundation, and a more moderate one, Comunidad Raizal (Native Foundation and Integraci√≥n B√°sica) led by former governors who are friends of the Colombian establishment, mainly Felix Palacios, Carlos Archbold and Alvaro Archbold N. The latter group is understandably more ready to participate in bipartite institutions set up by the Colombian authorities. On April 28, 2002, the Raizal people signed a declaration of self- determinationhttps://www.urosario.edu.co/jurisprudencia/catedra-viva- intercultural/Documentos/DeclaracionAutodeterminacionRaizal.pdf and asked the Colombian government and the International Court of Justice for a major recognition of their autonomy and for appropriate resources to improve the quality of life in the island.

Wilson was born and raised in Minneapolis, Minnesota, moving to Los Angeles, California after her high school graduation. Ironically, she had no interest in acting and had moved to Los Angeles due to an urge to travel. Note: Fraternity House is an alternate title of The Age of Consent. In 1930, she began working as a secretary and applied at several employment agencies. She received a job at RKO Pictures, and for two years she worked there as a secretary. She often took notes for director Gregory La Cava; she was noticed by the executive in charge of casting and offered a screen test for La Cava's upcoming 1932 film The Age of Consent. She won one of the two lead coed roles, opposite Richard Cromwell. Her performance in the movie received good reviews. The same year, she was selected as one of the WAMPAS Baby Stars, along with future Hollywood legend Ginger Rogers and Gloria Stuart. She starred opposite some of Hollywood's biggest names, including Harold Lloyd, Richard Dix, Tom Keene, Preston Foster and Will Rogers. She appeared in 20 films between 1932 and 1937. In 1936, she had married scriptwriter Lewis R. Foster, whom she had met while filming the 1934 movie Eight Girls in a Boat. Foster won an Oscar for his script for Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, released in 1939 and starring James Stewart and Jean Arthur, based on Foster's book The Gentleman from Montana. She was asked to test for the part of Melanie Hamilton in the epic movie Gone with the Wind, which she did, but she did not win the role, its being awarded to Olivia de Havilland. She starred in only two films after the marriage after which she retired from acting to devote time to her family. She returned to acting only once, in an uncredited role in the 1943 film Whistling in Brooklyn. She and Foster remained together and raised a family of two children. Foster died in 1974. Dorothy never remarried and was residing in Lompoc, California at the time of her death on January 7, 1998.

South Africa, 1820‚Äì1836  He was born in Yorkshire in 1811 and emigrated to the Cape Colony with his parents as 1820 Settlers. They were allocated land at Riviersonderend near the mission station of Genadendal, but resettled at Assegaaibosch in the Langkloof. He left South Africa for Australia to acquire road-building experience.  Australia, 1836‚Äì1843  White was appointed assistant surveyor by the colonial government in New South Wales. He surveyed land at Emu Plains for a town after the convict farm closed in 1832. White arrived in Port Macquarie in August 1836, and is believed to have established the first vineyard in the Hastings River region of Australia in 1837. It was known as \\"Clifton\\", a name which has been retained for the area to this day, and was located on land purchased near Settlement Farm, a stone's throw from the Pacific Ocean. As a surveyor, White was responsible for the siting of a new road from Port Macquarie westwards to the New England district, but in 1837, became involved in a dispute with the stipendiary magistrate, William Nairn Gray. White accused Gray of altering the line of a road that White had marked out, so as not to cross land owned by Major Archibald Clunes Innes, a wealthy landowner. Gray in turn accused White of using Government men and animals on his land at \\"Clifton\\". The acting governor, Colonel William Snodgrass, dismissed the charges against Grey as frivolous. An enquiry held in Port Macquarie in 1839 resulted in White's dismissal from government service. His efforts at rescinding this judgement were unsuccessful, despite an 1842 petition supporting him, being submitted by a large number of settlers. White sold his vineyard and some of the land to William Stokes in 1839.  South Africa, 1843‚Äì1866  In 1836, Charles Collier Michell, Surveyor-General of the Cape Colony, had reconnoitred Cradock Pass and had been horrified by its steep gradients and poor condition. In 1843, he proposed that convict labour be used to build a road along an entirely new route over the Outeniqua Mountains. In due course this was approved by the colonial secretary, John Montagu, and work was started in 1844, with H. O. Farrel as superintendent of the project. The work turned out to be beyond him, and in his place Montagu appointed White, a qualified surveyor, who had recently become Road Inspector. Some 250 convicts were used to carry out the demanding work of constructing the new road. The project was eventually completed after four years' work at a cost of ‚Ç§35,799 and opened to traffic in December 1847, with the ceremonial opening taking place on 19 January 1848, and John Montagu personally attending. Montagu Pass served as the main road over the Outeniquas for more than 100 years and it was only with the completion of the Outeniqua Pass in 1951 that this old pass became no more than a scenic route. Montagu suggested that the tiny roadcamp and village that grew at the foot of the mountain be named \\"White's Village\\" in honour of Henry Fancourt White, but this was subsequently changed to \\"Blanco\\". \\"Blanco House\\", White's residence, was started in 1859, in the style of a Cotswold Mansion, but White suffered major financial setbacks in 1860, dying in 1866, and was buried in the grounds of St. Mark's Cathedral in George. His wife died shortly after and her grave is next to his. His son, Ernest Montagu White, bought back the property in 1903, and renamed the house \\"Fancourt\\" in memory of his father, and his grandmother's maiden name. He commissioned skilled craftsmen to refurbish the manor house, using yellowwood, stinkwood and blackwood to restore its former grace. Ernest, a philanthropist and successful businessman in his own right, funded the building of a road from George to Wilderness and stained glass windows in St Mark's Cathedral. He was to die tragically on 10 April 1916, together with his sister, after a meal of poisonous mushrooms. Today Fancourt is a provincial heritage site rand operates as a hotel and golfing estate. White also engineered the road from George to Great Brak River, the mountain pass from Port Elizabeth over the Zuurberg Mountains, and Howieson's Poort pass just west of Grahamstown. A difference of opinion with fellow engineer Woodford Pilkington, son of the Colonial Engineer, led to his leaving the Roads Board in 1853, and entering politics. He briefly served as the member for Algoa Bay. White was elected to the Parliament of the Cape of Good Hope when it was first formed in 1854, in which, together with Jock Paterson, he represented Port Elizabeth. He did not serve for long, but was known for his characterful sketches of his fellow MPs.  References  * Leon Nell.

It serves the Haverhill/Reading Line. It is located at Lincoln and High Streets on the western fringe of Reading's central business district. The station's historic depot building was built in 1870 by the Boston and Maine Railroad. The station was the terminus of the line from 1959 until the re-extension to Haverhill station in 1979. Architecture and history Reading station on an early postcard An SPV-2000 demonstrator vehicle at Reading in 1978 The Boston and Maine Railroad Extension from Wilmington Junction to Boston was completed in 1845, with intermediate stops including Reading. A new station building was constructed in 1870. The depot is located southwest of the tracks, at the junction of Lincoln and Prescott Streets. It is a long rectangular building with Queen Anne styling, with paneled pilasters at the corners and between the bays, and large knee braces that help support the wide overhangs of the hip roof. The north (track-facing) facade has seven bays, alternating windows (4) and doors (3). One of the windows is a projecting bay with a band of narrow and tall windows, whose upper sash has colored lights. The station was purchased by the town in 1960, and was briefly used as a museum of railroad history. The MBTA purchased the Haverhill Line in 1973, intending to replace commuter rail service with extended Orange Line subway service between Oak Grove and Reading. The new Reading/128 terminus would have been located outside the downtown area just south of Route 128, rather than at the current downtown location. Ultimately, the extension was not built past Oak Grove due to rising costs, and commuter rail service was kept on the corridor. The station was later rebuilt around 1991 with a mini-high platform on the inbound side for accessibility. The second track, removed decades earlier, was not rebuilt; the outbound platform was repaired, but a second mini-high platform was not built.

Career  His NHL career began in 1987. McGeough was one of the last NHL officials to officiate games without wearing a helmet on the ice. In the 2006‚Äì07 season, McGeough was forced by the NHL to wear a helmet on ice, as it was the first season which dictated all on-ice officials had to do so. After officiating 1,083 regular season games, 63 playoff games, and the 2006 Stanley Cup Finals, his final career regular season game was the Anaheim Ducks ‚Äì Los Angeles Kings contest on April 5, 2008. In retirement he began helping the NHL bring up new referee recruits from the American Hockey League and was named to the Saskatchewan Hockey Hall of Fame in 2013. Mick was the older brother of NHL-player Jim McGeough, formerly of the Pittsburgh Penguins and the Washington Capitals, as well as ex-Canadian Junior football player and coach, Tim McGeough.  Controversies and other incidents  After giving up the game-winning goal to the Ottawa Senators' Rob Zamuner during Game 3 of first round of the 2000 Stanley Cup Playoffs, an irate Toronto Maple Leafs goaltender Curtis Joseph charged after McGeough to argue that goaltender interference should have been called. Joseph then stumbled and bumped the referee to the ice. A misconduct penalty was called on Joseph, but he was not ejected from the game, and the NHL later decided not to suspend him. In a regular season game between the Dallas Stars and the Edmonton Oilers on November 4, 2006, with the Stars up 3-2 with 4.1 seconds left in regulation, McGeough waved off what would have been a game-tying goal by Edmonton's Ales Hemsky, ruling that Oilers' centre Shawn Horcoff had made a glove pass prior to Hemsky touching the puck. Replays however clearly showed there was no infraction. The Stars ended up winning the game, as angry fans at Rexall Place littered the ice with debris. The NHL later admitted that the call was wrong, but also fined Oilers head coach Craig MacTavish US$10,000 for his post-game comments in which he said that McGeough's call was \\"retarded\\" and that he should be suspended. During a regular season game between the Ottawa Senators and the St. Louis Blues on March 20, 2007, there were two controversial calls late in the third period that both disallowed a game-tying goal by the Blues. At 3:14 of the third period, Ottawa goaltender Martin Gerber appeared to have stopped a shot by St. Louis' Brad Boyes. Replays later showed that the puck actually crossed the goal line before Gerber pulled it back to smother it, but play was immediately resumed without a video review. It was only after 33 seconds of play later that the timekeeper blew the horn to signal a video review. McGeough then admitted that the goal should have counted, but he could not reverse the call due to Rule 78.6 which states that a goal cannot be awarded once the play has resumed. The second disputed goal occurred with 2:18 left in the game: the Blues' David Backes appeared to have scored in the same manner, with the puck entering the net before Gerber pulled it back. But McGeough disallowed the goal, ruling that Backes pushed Gerber's glove across the goal line with his stick after the goaltender had possession of the puck.  Death  On the morning of November 18, 2018, McGeough was admitted to the hospital in Regina, Saskatchewan with early signs of a stroke. After his condition worsened, McGeough sought a consultation with a neurosurgeon in Saskatoon to remove clots at the back of his brain. After it was determined the damage was ultimately irreversible, he returned home to spend his remaining days with his family and to \\"go on his own terms\\". Four days later, on November 23, it was announced by his family that McGeough had been removed from life support and died late that night at the age of 62. In the 2018-19 NHL season, referees honoured McGeough by wearing a jersey arm patch with the word ‚ÄúMICK‚Äù.

The Broadcasting Yearbook notes it was founded by five partners on September 14, 1963. Rensselaer is about south of Chicago in Jasper County, Indiana.https://www.google.com/webhp?source=search_app&gws;_rd=ssl#q=distance+from+chicago,+illinois+to+rensselaer,+indiana WRIN airs a classic country format using the classic country format provided via satellite from Westwood One. According to Standard Rate and Data service, the daytime only Class D radio station would cover Jasper, White, Newton, Benton and Pulaski counties. No other radio stations were located in any of these counties. WRIN is important because, other than the local newspaper, The Rensselaer Republican it was the only local media for more than 10 years. Today, other local radio media exists in Earl Park, Monticello, Kentland, and Winamac, all within the original coverage of WRIN. History FCC records show that among the investors, James Caperelli (a trucking company owner from Chicago Heights, Illinois), his wife, also James Caperelli Jr, Anthony DiCarlo Jr. (son-in-law to Caperelli), and Bob Becker, an employee of the other radio stations owned by Caperelli and DiCarlo. These people earlier started WCGO in 1959, Chicago Heights, Illinois. Early employees of WRIN were Sports director Bob Hayes, Ted Hayes (now at WKVI, Knox, Indiana), Rev. Harry McCorkel (news director), Neal Nussbaum, Larry Nudelman (afternoon announcer), Charles \\"Norm\\" Miller (now on staff at the FCC), Weekend announcers Ron Hickman, Joe Shank, and Tom Jurek, who started as an announcer, later owner/manager. Program schedules note that the 7:30 morning news round-up was a popular daily broadcast. Local minister and news director Harry McCorkel developed this local news program, bringing his reel to reel tape recorder to many local meetings. The program prospered with seven local annual advertisers, Earl Butz, Paul Harvey, and NBC Radio. Many local features gave WRIN a \\"hometown\\" feel. They included local birthdays and anniversaries, pet patrol, \\"local names making news\\" also a \\"local talent\\" feature, where area people played instruments, sang, and displayed their entertainment ability, many trivia quizzes, a daily \\"music battle\\" where two pop songs faced off, and people voted by phone for their favorite, \\"the voice of the people\\" where you could express your opinion on a daily topic, and always emphasis on local happenings, including sporting events. WRIN annually covered the Jasper, Newton, White, Pulaski and Benton county fairs, doing live remote broadcasts from each location. The station also covered local elections for those same counties. Farm programs, including market reports, dotted the schedule, with more emphasis on farm news early morning, noontime, and when the market closed. Local farmer Wally Laird contributed to the local farm information, bringing many local guests to the airwaves. Information included \\"grain elevator reports\\", featuring corn, wheat and bean prices from ten local grain elevators. Radio consultants told Jurek that WRIN was successful because there was sparse local competition, and the Chicago radio stations have never served Northwest Indiana very well. It was a \\"natural\\" to attract national farm advertisers like Pioneer Seed Corn and John Deere Tractors. Also, this region is quite isolated, due to \\"far away\\" geography and \\"low\\" population, as well as rural culture rather than \\"big city\\" culture from Chicago. The Gary/Hammond (North) area was an industrial and bedroom community area while the Lafayette (South) was a college and manufacturing area that was very culturally different from the five very rural counties served by WRIN. WRIN featured \\"Compu Weather\\" reports four times every hour. Since Rensselaer is in \\"tornado alley\\" local sponsors lined up to advertise on this important feature. The station also aired a two-hour daily talk show \\"Sound Off\\" that Bob Becker hosted, featuring listener phone calls, many local issues and very conservative politics. Hosting Sound Off eventually led politically conservative Bob Becker to a sponsored journey to Viet Nam. WRIN also featured Trading Post and Harry Martin's Rural Radio Network. Saturdays featured American Top 40 in the morning, the Texaco Metropolitan Opera radio broadcasts, Chicago Symphony Orchestra, Notre Dame football, Chicago Cubs and Bears games, Bob Gaskin's Saturday afternoon Gospel Music program, and featured 1940-1970's middle-of-the-road music during the week. Sundays were mostly devoted to religious programming sign-on to sign off. The exception was the late morning Chet Gulinski Polka Show. WRIN featured many local ministers and national religious programs like Words of Hope, Jimmy Swaggart, Kenneth Copeland, The PTL Club, the 700 Club, and The Lutheran Hour. Local Sunday programs included First Baptist Church with Cal Eastwood, Bethany Calls and Bethany Church service with Harry McCorkel, St. Augustine Church Catholic Mass, First Reformed Church in DeMotte, the Wheatfield Full Gospel Tabernacle, and many others. Jurek also bought the local FM station, (WJCK), and changed the call letters to WLQI (Lucky Radio). As WJCK, the station was started by John Felthouse, a retired broadcast engineer from WBBM, Chicago. Felthouse mostly tracked beautiful music albums until he sold to Thom Brown, who had previous radio management experience with Group W Westinghouse Broadcasting. Under Brown, the WJCK format was \\"country music.\\" When Jurek purchased the station and changed the call letters to WLQI, the format became \\"adult hits\\" briefly using Drake-Chenault syndication. From 1973-1985 Tom Jurek hosted the \\"WRIN Morning Wake up Show\\" that (according to Arbitron radio ratings) had the largest share of the local listening audience. Harry McCorkel, Rick Klingaman, Doug Booth and others served as News Director. Local news was broadcast from 7:30-8:40, Noon-12:20, and following NBC radio Network News nearly every hour. By January 1977, Becker died. Jurek bought controlling shares and, according to accounting records, the station prospered even more. FCC Records show that Jurek had a construction permit to begin an FM station in Winamac, Indiana. That frequency became a religious format station. Later, with Annie Rose, Jurek developed a frequency for a \\"Merrillville, Indiana radio station, then, sold it to investors who moved it to Portage, Indiana, where the station exists today. In 1985 Jurek sold WRIN, WLQI and the Winamac permit to John Balvich, Brothers Broadcasting, who has operated the stations since.

In 1929 he moved to England at the age of 19 and took part in an apprenticeship in English Electric Works in Stafford. In 1931 he applied to join the Communist Party of Great Britain which prompted the MI5 to open a file on him. Eventually he became the party's leader in Stafford.http://libfiles.nipissingu.ca/HDI/Theses%20&%20Dissertations/not%20yet%20catalogued/an%20irish%20communist%20and%20M15%20contraintelligence.pdf Spy Goold-Verschoyle became a Soviet spy after visiting his brother Neil in Moscow.http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/northern_ireland/6759483.stm He was said by MI5 to be a \\"na√Øve supporter\\" of the Soviet Union; unaware that he was being used to courier messages for the NKVD while he lived in London.

He was also a courier for Dmitri Bystrolyotov In 1936 he traveled under an assumed name to Moscow to undergo wireless training. Previously he had worked as a technician. He fell in love with a German Jewish refugee, Lotte Moos, and took her to Moscow against orders, falling foul of his Soviet masters. He was then sent to the Spanish Civil War (Barcelona) on the condition that he broke off all contact with Lotte. However he disobeyed this order. He is mentioned in Walter Krivitsky's memoir 'I Was Stalin's Spy and Karlo Stajner's memoir 7000 days in Siberia. Arrest During his stationing in Spain he got in trouble over his personal views. He disliked what he perceived as the Soviet Army taking control of Spanish areas without consulting the Spanish and the surveillance and punishment of ideological deviance by the Soviets. His letters to his family in Ireland reveal a growing sympathy for the anti-Stalinist Workers' Party of Marxist Unification (POUM). In April 1937, he was asked to report to Barcelona harbour to repair a ship's radio. When he embarked he was escorted to the radio cabin and the door was locked behind him and he was left in there with two Komsomol members. who were also kidnapped.7000 Days in Siberia by Karlo Stajner page 51 He had in effect been kidnapped and when the ship arrived in USSR he was immediately transferred to the Lubyanka (KGB) prison in Moscow.

Biography  Ofer was born in the Chorostk√≥w shtetl in Poland (today in Ukraine) in 1922, and immigrated to Mandatory Palestine in 1933. He went to High School in Jerusalem and studied in the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. In 1937 he joined the Haganah and in 1942 he was among the founders of Kibbutz Hamadia. In 1944 he was one of the founders of the Young Leadership in Mapai and among of founders and first Director of HaKfar HaYarok. In the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, he served in the Israeli Navy as a lieutenant colonel, and was the first commander of the Eilat Naval Base. In 1952, he was elected Secretary of Mapai in Tel Aviv District. In 1958, he joined the Agriculture Ministry, established the Poultry Council and became Deputy Director General for Economic Affairs. In 1964, he was a member of the delegation that conducted negotiations with the European Community and at the end of that year he was appointed General Manager of \\"Ashdod Company\\". In 1965, he was elected to the Tel Aviv City Council and was Deputy Mayor of Tel Aviv from until 1967, when he was appointed Managing Director of \\"Shikun Ovdim\\". In 1969, he was elected to the 7th Knesset for the Alignment. He is known for his amendment to the election law, initiated along with Gahal's Yohanan Bader, which adapted the D'Hondt method, effective since the 8th Knesset. In 1973, he was appointed Minister of Housing by Yitzhak Rabin. = The scandal = In November 1976, Yigal Laviv, a correspondent of the weekly Haolam Hazeh who had also been involved in airing the charges against Asher Yadlin, gave the police information on 30 different matters raising suspicions of offenses committed by Ofer, including allegations of embezzlement in Shikun Ovdim funds in favor of the party. The police examined Laviv's charges, but came to the conclusion toward the end of the year that they were not substantiated, leading Ofer to expect that an official statement clearing him would soon be made. However, Attorney General Aharon Barak decided to continue with the investigation based on a new testimony. On 31 December, however, a witness in the Yadlin affair sent the police a statement which raised more questions for investigation, and various rumors were published about possible charges. On 2 January, Prime Minister Rabin and Justice Minister Zadok assured Ofer that everything possible would be done to expedite the inquiry. On January 3, his body was found in his car on a Tel Aviv beach. In a suicide note, Ofer said he was innocent, but did not have the strength \\"to bear any more.\\" He was reported to have been particularly depressed by the lack of support from his political associates. Rabin delivered the eulogy at Ofer's funeral. Speaking to the country's political elite at a crowded service in Tel Aviv, Rabin recalled how Ofer had come to him to discuss the accusations in what turned out to be their final meeting. \\"Your words still ring in my ears,\\" the Premier said. ' 'Yitzhak,' you told me, 'believe me, I am not guilty of any transgressions.' I replied to you, Avraham, that I, Yitzhak Rabin, wholly trust in your innocence.\\" The succession of scandals led Rabin's opponents to charge that he lacked the ability to lead, and in the 1977 elections the Alignment indeed lost. After his death, the charges were dropped and Ofer's guilt was never proven. Today, his suicide is often seen as a display of civil servant shame that is missing in contemporary Israeli politicians.
