The complex phenomenon of memory is explored by combining evidence from many areas of research. New technologies, experimental methods and animal experimentation have led to an increased understanding of the workings of memory. Human subjects MRI of the human brain. It is usually desirable to study memory in humans because we have the ability to subjectively describe experiences, and have the intellect to perform complex and indirect tests of memory. Lesion studies allow us to reduce the neural mechanisms of memory, and results from finely constructed psychological tests can help us make inferences about how memory works. Neuropsychologists attempt to show that specific behavioural deficits are associated with specific sites of brain damage. The famous case of HM, a man who had both his medial temporal lobes removed resulting in profound amnesia, illustrates how brain damage can tell us a lot about the inner workings of memory. One of the fundamental problems with studying human patients who have already acquired brain damage is the lack of experimental control. Comparisons usually have to be made between individuals; exact lesion location and individual differences cannot be controlled for. =Item list memory tasks= Ebbinghaus Hermann Ebbinghaus began the scientific study of human memory with this treatise On Memory is 1885.Ebbinghaus, H. (1885/1913). On memory: A contribution to experimental psychology. New York: Teachers College, Columbia University. Ebbinghaus experimented on himself by testing his own ability to memorize lists of randomly arranged syllables presented at regular pace of 2.5 syllables per second. He would record how long it took him to memorize a list of syllables and also how quickly he would lose the memorization. With this data, he traced learning and forgetting curves. Ebbinghaus also collected data on his ability to memorize at different times of the day and under different conditions. His work later influenced G.E. M√ºller who continued the tradition of lists of items to conduct memory experiments on human subjects and using behavioral data to develop models of memory.M√ºller, G. E., & Pilzecker, A. (1900). Experimental contributions to memory theory. Zeitschrift f√ºr Psychologe Eganzungsband, 1, 1-300 The two most common types of memory studied using these methods are recognition and recall. Recognition Recognition memory is the ability to judge whether or not the cued item was previously presented on the list usually with a yes or no response. This memory is akin to the type of memory used for police line-ups. The particular task described used to be called \\"item recognition\\". Scientists study the rates of hits (correct \\"yes\\" responses) related to the rates of false alarms (incorrect \\"yes\\" responses) with statistical analysis to develop theories on how the recognition judgement is stored and retrieved. These theories are then developed into memory models. Recall Recall memory is the ability to retrieve stored information either by being cued by a particular associated item or without an associated cue. The first is called cued recall and the second is called free recall. In cued recall the participant studies a list of paired items and then is presented one half of those pairs and must recall the associated other half. A common additional task is to have the participant learn a new set of associations with the cued items and study the amount of interference from prior association occurs. These experiments help to develop theories on how we learn associations and what conditions affect that learning. Free recall does not use item pairs. Instead participants study a list of items and then recall that list in the order that they retrieve the items from memory. In these experiments the data is drawn from the order in which items are recalled and the inter-response times. This data is used to develop models of memory storage and retrieval. =Children= Humans are extremely dependent on memory for survival as we are dependent on our ability to identify and remember a wide range of material in order to learn and function, which is why the capability for memory is developed at a very young age. Memory in children is displayed in simpler ways than in adults due to lack of verbal communication and mental capabilities, and therefore the testing methods are similar but are modified to suit age specific abilities. Observational and experimental methods are used to test children's memory by documenting either their physical actions, emotional (facial) response or attention/ focus, depending on the age (ability) of the child and the type of task provided. An older child can provide answers to both verbal and non-verbal tests to more complex tasks in a more detailed and accurate way and therefore produce more direct data. The change of methods according to age is necessary for several reasons particularly because memory ability expands at certain stages of childhood and can be influenced by biological advances and environmental experience. From birth, children use observational (imitation) and auditory learning styles with increasing ability to remember complex sequences and concepts. The rapid growth in ability to retain information is partly due to the increase of myelin, which increases the speed of impulses between neurons, especially in the visual and auditory cortexes which become myelinated very early in the development processes.Shaffer, D., & Wood, E., & Willoughby, T. (2005). Developmental Psychology: Childhood and Adolescence. The amount of myelination has a direct effect on the speed of information-processing and in turn the speed and strength at which we are able to remember things. Understanding of contexts and relationships as well as memory strategies such as chunking and learning of schemas can also influence the strength of memories and therefore must be considered when choosing a method of testing. Action oriented memory A well known study used to show early signs of recall memory, examines 3 month old infants behavior with mobiles.Rovee-Collier, C.K. (1997). Dissociations in infant memory: Retention without remembering. Osofsky Ed. Handbook of Infant development. The experiment entailed tying a string on a colourful mobile to the infant's foot, so that kicking would cause the mobile to move, pleasing the baby. After the initial training, it was shown that a week later the infants kicked in order to produce movement. Two weeks later the infant resumed the kicking behavior after a short reminder session where they watched the mobile moving (unattached to their foot). This experiment showed a recognition of the mobile, as well as recall (after one week), and cued recall (after 2 weeks). Recognition and recall are two essential aspects of memory; these are particularly useful in children since verbal reporting of memory may not be available yet or as reliable when testing very young participants. At the age of approximately 9 months some infants are able to reproduce some simple actions they observe up to 24 hours after witnessing them.Meltzoff, A.N. (1951). Imitation of televised models by infants. Child Development. The reproduction of behaviors such as choosing one object over another or repeatedly placing an object in a certain spot is a type of situational memory test used to identify the child's level of memory capability. Deferred imitation, the ability to reproduce behaviour without cuing, can be seen and tested near the age of 18‚Äì 24 months. Children become able to replicate more complex events with greater detail, from memory.Piaget, J. (1951). Play, Dreams and imitation in childhood. Jean Piaget, a child development psychologist, conducted a study testing the cognitive and memory abilities of children around 2 years of age. These tests were conducted using objects presented to the child followed by their removal from sight. This causes very young infants to believe the object no longer exists. At approximately 8‚Äì12 months, children will look for the missing object and this display shows memory, as well as a comprehension that it still exists when it is not directly seen. This led to the theory of object permanence which demonstrates the stage at which memory and cognitive development have reached the level of mental representation.Piaget, J. (1954). The Construction of reality in the child. Facial recognition Recognition of a motherly face. A child as early as 7 days old can shows signs of facial expression imitation such as tongue or lip protrusion and opening of their mouth.Meltzoff, A.N., & Moore, M.K. (1977). Imitation of facial and manual gestures by human neonates. Science. There is some debate as to whether this is a voluntary or reflexive action though the ability to imitate demonstrates the infants ability to encode the image and imitate it. Evidence of facial memory over longer delays can be seen in children as early as 2‚Äì3 weeks old. Changes in behavior such as crying less and smiling more shows evidence for recognition of a familiar face. Recognition can also be shown with habituation, the process of attending a familiar stimuli less in preference for a new one. This can be seen as early as 5 months of age in several forms including auditory and visual identification. In a study of 8-10 month infants, both familiar objects/faces and newly presented ones were introduced at different intervals and time delays. Looking time and first looks were recorded, and the results indicated habituation and memory recall.Hashiya, & Kazuhide, & Morimoto, & Reiko. (2005). Memory for Faces in Infants: A Comparison to the Memory, International Conference on Development and Learning. False memories Accuracy of memory is an important factor when studying memory in children as it has been demonstrated that children's memory more susceptible to suggesting and implanting of false memories than adults. In a study on preschoolers, using a questionnaire method in a yes/no and multiple choice format, the result of forcing an answer in response to a controlled situation differed according to question style.Peterson, C., & Grant, M. (2001). Forced-choice: Are forensic interviewers asking the right questions? The children showed a preference to saying ‚Äòyes‚Äô to ‚Äòno‚Äô and showed an equal preference for the multiple choice (when neither were correct), neither are an ideal test for memory accuracy in children. The Criterion-Based Content Analysis (CBCA)Stellar, M. (1989). recent developments in statement analysis. Credibility assessment. is designed to decipher truthful from false memories in children and is a part of the Statement Validity Analysis (SVA) which consists of structured interviews, systematic analysis of verbal statements and statement validity checklist. This is a comprehensive protocol that tests the reliability of a child witness's memory of an event or situation which relies on the assumption that false memories are of weaker quality then truthful and accurate memories. Recognition memory in a legal setting is also different in children than in adults. In a meta-analysis study a line-up style test was used for a child witness to identify a culprit among other suspects.Pozzulo, J.D., & Lindsay, R.C.L. (1998). Identification accuracy of children versus adults: A meta- analysis. Law and Human Behavior. The results show that children over the age of 5 were able to identify a culprit (when the culprit was present) at a comparable rate to adults but children up to age 14 produced far greater number of false identifications when the culprit was not present. It was speculated by Pozzulo & LindsayPozzulo, J.D., & Lindsay, R.C.L. (1999). Elimination lineups: an improved identification procedure for child eyewitnesses. Journal of Applied Psychology. that false positives were caused by an inability to produce correct absolute judgments (recall) while relative judgments (recognition) are more successful. =Technologies= High resolution fMRI of the human brain. Cognitive neuroscience aims to reduce cognition to its neural basis using new technologies such as fMRI, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and Magnetoencephalography (MEG) as well as older methods such as Positron emission tomography (PET) and Electroencephalography (EEG) studies. Due to the correlational designs used in fMRI, many scientists have coined this up and coming field as the new phrenology in the sense that techniques such as fMRI rely heavily on complex statistics. Type 1 errors can lead scientists to draw premature and incorrect causal relationships if improper designs are used. =Ethics= Human subject research must be carefully designed as to not have any adverse effects on the subject, and not impose on their rights as a human being. Neurological procedures that intentionally lesion the brain are illegal, and therefore those who have already obtained brain damage must be studied. The study of brain damaged patients has its drawbacks, however case studies of brain injured patients has greatly improved our understanding of the neural basis of memory. All subjects (or their legal representative) must have a clear understanding of the experimental procedure, including any potential dangers to themself, and be in a right state of mind to express consent to the researcher before any tests can be started. The American Psychological Association uses a strict ethical code concerning research in psychology. =Experimental designs= A major complication that is raised in memory research is its fallible nature in humans. Having the ability to recall memories does not necessarily mean they are accurate. Our ability to store and process what is going on around us relies on memory being a constructive, fallible process. The technologies explained above may show areas of activation associated with certain behaviors, but without any idea of lesion location, it is difficult to pinpoint exactly what part of the brain relates to which behavioral deficits observed. Neuropsychologists have created various tasks designed to assess specific types of memory so that inferences about lesion location can be drawn from poor performances on these tests. Neuropsychological tests can aid us in understanding specific types of memory associated with specific sites of brain damage. Corsi block tapping An assessment of visual-spatial memory involves mimicking a researcher as he/she taps nine identical spatially separated blocks. The sequence starts out simple, usually using two blocks, but becomes more complex until the subject's performance suffers. This number is known as the Corsi Span, and averages about 5 for normal human subjects. An fMRI study involving subjects undergoing this test revealed that while the sequence length increases, general brain activity remains the same. So while humans may show encoding difficulty, this is not related to overall brain activation. Whether able to perform the task well or not the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex is highly involved. Corsi blocks tasks with a normal forward order requires support from the visuospatial sketch pad, but not from the phonological loop. When the sequence to be recalled becomes longer than three or four items, central executive resources are usedhttp://www.scform.unica.it/pub/netdocs/11/files/allegati/vandierendonck- et-al-bjp-2004.pdf. Animal subjects The study of memory has greatly benefited from experimentation with animals. Current ethical guidelines state that using animals for scientific purposes is only acceptable when the harm (physical or psychological) done to animals is outweighed by the benefits of the research. Keeping this in mind, we can use research techniques on animals that would not necessarily be performed on humans. =Basic research= Knockout mouse breeding scheme. Our understanding of memory has benefited greatly from animal research. Animals brains can be selectively lesioned using surgical, or neurotoxic methods and be assessed before and after the experimental manipulation. Groundbreaking new technology has allowed for genetic manipulation and the creation of knockout mice. Scientists genetically engineer these mice to lack functionally or behaviourally important alleles or have missing or altered gene sequences.Blundell, Jacqueline, & Blaiss, Cory A., & Etherton, Mark R., & Espinosa, Felipe, & Tabuchi, Katsuhiko, & Walz, Christopher, & Bolliger, Marc F., & S√ºdhof, Thomas C., & Powell, Craig M. Neuroligin-1 Deletion Results in Impaired Spatial Memory and increased repetitive behaviour.Mouri, Akihiro, & Noda, Yukihiro, & Shimizu, Shigeomi, & Tsujimoto, Yoshihide. The Role of Cyclophilin D in learning and memory. Careful observation of behaviors and phenotypes may help uncover the neural substrates of memory and prove to be an essential tool for the study of gene- behaviour interactions. =Genetics= Animals can be selectively bred for certain behavioural characteristics, such as having strong maze-solving skills. Although the genetic underpinnings of observable phenotypes are extremely difficult to show, behavioural characteristics can be selectively bred. The difficulty lies in the subjective determination of the phenotype. How can one show that an animal has a good memory? There are many confounds when breeding for behaviours, however if animals can be selected for memory and learning ability, maybe we can learn something about how genes contribute to memory systems. =Technologies= Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has intriguing implications for the study of memory in humans, however it can also be used in animal models. fMRI can be used to assess brain functionality in monkeys in the context of a variety of behavioral tasks. Structural MRI can be used to examine the extent and location of brain lesions, so that behavioral abnormalities observed can be directly linked to specific brain structures. High-resolution fMRI can help locate and assess the functionality of large neural networks so that these regions can be further studied using more traditional electrophysiological recording devices. Single- unit recording directly measures action potentials and can be used in a variety of animals. This technique employed in the macaque monkey led to the discovery of the mirror neuron which has major implications for learning, memory and the perception of self.Kolb, Bryan, & Whishaw. (2007). Fundamentals of Human Neuroscience. Single cell recordings can be used to record the activity of single neurons while animals perform tasks related to memory. Cortical cooling is a relatively new technique that allows for a temporary disruption of function in a chosen area of the brain. Due to the use of large, surgically implanted devices this technique is generally used on primates, however the use of small cryotip implants has implications for use in rats. This exciting new technology allows for reversible lesions, which removes variations between animals so that better causal relationships can be shown. Animals can act as their own controls and this is ideal for any neuroscientific research. The neurotoxic lesion technique has proven to be essential for studying the neural basis of behavior and memory in animals. Neurotoxins can be used to selectively damage very specific nerve tracts in the brain. Pertaining to the study of memory, areas of interest include the hippocampus, the rhinal cortex, the pre-frontal cortex, and the frontal cortex. The neurotoxic lesion technique uses neurotoxins such as ibotenic acid to selectively disrupt or kill specific neural tracts in any of the areas described above. The animal is anaesthetized and immobilized so that stereotaxic instruments can be used to drill holes in specific locations of the skull. Scientists can then carefully administer microinjections of neurotoxins to damage only the neurons in specific brain areas. This technique allows for the selective lesioning of areas of interest and leaves surrounding supportive tissue unaffected. =Advantages= A dog in a pavlovian study. Research animals are a good substitute for humans because similar principles are assumed to underlie basic mechanisms of brain function. In order to fully understand human memory, cross-species comparisons in neuropsychology are used so that multiple variables can be manipulated. The more experimental control we have, the easier it is to eliminate confounding variables, and better causal conclusions can be made. Although there is no single ideal animal model of a human, for each problem of interest there is an animal upon which it can be most conveniently studied. For example, the study of spatial memory has benefitted greatly from experimentation and observation of food caching birds. To study auditory learning and memory, songbirds can be used. To study more complex systems such as motor learning, object recognition, short term memory and working memory, often primates such as the macaque monkey are used because of their large brains and more sophisticated intelligence. Small rodents can be used to study aversive conditioning and emotional memory, and contextual/spatial memory. To reduce memory and learning to its genetic basis, mice can be genetically modified and studied.Chan, C.S., & Chen, H. & Bradley, A., & Dragatis, I., & Rosenmund, C., & Davis, R.L. (2010). alpha 8 integrins are required for hippocampal longterm potentiation but not for hippocamptal- dependant learning. Genes Brain + Behaviour, 1-8. Generally animal studies depend on the principles of positive reinforcement, aversion techniques and Pavlovian conditioning. This type of research is extremely useful and has shed much light on learning and memory in humans. =Experimental designs= Scientific reductionism has pushed our understanding of memory closer to the neural level. In order to broaden our understanding, we need to draw conclusions from converging evidence. Studying memory in animals such as birds, rodents, and primates is difficult because scientists can only study and quantify observable behaviors. Animal research relies on carefully constructed methodologies, and these are species specific. A major obstacle to research on the innateness of memory is the scarcity of subjects with apparent superior memory quality to make up a sample from which statistically significant conclusions can be drawn. One solution to this was the brainchild of memory researcher and methodologist,Marshall, P.(2012) Research Methods, London: Oakley Books, Dr Peter Marshall.The Great Memory Show was a series of events where memory performers were invited to show off their memory abilities to a live audience, in front of TV cameras, but the real motive was to attract a pool of people who may have naturally superior memory quality, to take part in memory research at Royal Holloway, University of London.Western Mail, 8 October 1999, p7; \\"Finding the Memory Masters\\", Mensa Magazine (February 2015) Primates Macaques of the primate genus. The textbook Fundamentals of Human Neuropsychology by Kolb and Whishaw describes some designs used to study memory in the macaque monkey. Elizabeth Murray and her colleagues trained monkeys to reach through the bars of their cage after a brief delay in order to displace objects under which a reward may be located. During the brief delay the monkey had to use either object recognition memory, or contextual memory to remember where the reward was located. Object recognition is tested with a matching-to-sample task where the monkey had to remember visual characteristics of the object in order to obtain the reward. Alternatively, in the non-matching-to-sample design the monkey must remember the location of the previously seen object. The monkey must then use context and spatial memory in order to correctly displace an object in the same location as previous, in order to obtain the food reward. These two tasks can be used to differentiate between object recognition memory and contextual memory. Murray and her colleagues were able to show that hippocampal lesions impaired contextual memory whereas rhinal cortex lesions impaired object recognition memory. This experimental design allowed for the dissociation of two mutually exclusive brain regions devoted to specific types of memory. In experiments with the macaque monkey, Earl Miller and his colleagues used the delayed matching to sample (DMS) task to assess working memory in monkeys. The monkey was required to fixate on a computer screen while coloured images were displayed serially for 0.5 seconds, and separated by a one-second delay. The first image shown was the sample, and the monkey was trained to pull a lever when the sample object was shown a second time. In this experiment single-cell recordings were taken from the prefrontal cortex, an area thought to be involved with working memory. In order to verify the location of the recording device, MRI and stereotaxic instruments were used. The ability to use single cell recordings solely for experimental purposes is exclusive to animal testing and has greatly increased our understanding of memory systems. Caching birds Comparisons of the neuroanatomy of caching and non-caching birds has shed light on the neural basis of spatial memory. David Sherry and his colleagues devised experiments using the displacement of landmarks, to show that caching birds rely on spatial memory and landmark cues to find their caches, and local changes in cache appearance had no effect on food retrieval. They were able to show that changes in neurogenesis are directly related to food storing behavior. Food caching behavior reaches a maximum in August, continues through the winter and declines in the spring. They showed that the amount of neurons added to the hippocampus was also at a max during August and winter, and declined into the spring. Using selective hippocampal lesions, cause-effect relationships were shown. Lesions disrupted cache retrieval and other spatial behavior, however had no effect on actual food caching. The hippocampus has been implicated as a key structure for spatial memory in humans, and studying behavior in food caching birds and other animals has been extremely influential on this view. Sherry and his colleagues were also able to show that food-caching birds have much larger hippocampus‚Äô than non food-caching birds. Without techniques such as cell labeling, neuronal staining and careful post mortem analysis, these comparison studies would be impossible. Songbirds A Carolina chickadee, a common songbird. Songbirds are excellent animal models for studying learning and auditory memory. These birds have highly developed vocal organs, which give them the ability to create diverse and elaborate birdsongs. Neurotoxic lesions can be used to study how specific brain structures are key for this type of learning and scientists can also manipulate the environment in which these birds are raised. In addition, with functional MRI the response to different auditory stimuli has been studied in vivo. In experiments with songbirds, using these two methodologies has led to very interesting discoveries about auditory learning and memory. Much like humans, birds have a critical period when they must be exposed to adult birdsong. The cognitive systems of vocal production and auditory recognition parallel those in humans, and experiments have shown that there are critical brain structures for these processes.Zokolla, Melanie, A., & Naueb, Nicole, & Herrmannb, Christoph S., & Langemanna, Ulrike. (2008). Auditory memory: A comparison between humans and starlings. Brain Research, 12 20, 33-46.Bolhuis, Johan J., & Gahr, Manfred. (2006). Neural mechanisms of birdsong memory. Nature Reviews  Neuroscience, 7, 347. Rodents A simple radial maze. Rodents are small mammals capable of learning, displaying complex behaviors, and are relatively inexpensive to raise. They are an ideal animal to use for the study of memory. The assessment of learning and memory in rodents has been employed in scientific research for a long time, and there are many experimental methods used. Generally tests of spatial memory employ maze designs where the rodent must run a maze in order to receive a food reward.Ramos, Juan M. J. Training method dramatically affects the acquisition of a place response in rats with neurotoxic lesions of the hippocampus.Carrillo-Mora, Paula, & Giordano, Magdab, & Santamaria, Abel. Spatial memory: Theoretical basis and comparative review on experimental methods in rodents. Learning can be shown when the rodent reduces its average number of errors or wrong turns. Aversive techniques such as the Morris Water Maze can also be used to study spatial memory. The rat is placed in murky water surrounded by sheer walls containing spatial cues. Learning is shown when the rat swims a more direct route to the obscured platform. Small rodents can also be easily conditioned using taste aversion or odor aversion techniques. Performing neurotoxic lesions in these conditioned rodents is an excellent way to study the neural basis of aversion learning and memory. =Converging evidence= Psychologists who work with animals assume that the things they learn can be applied to the human brain. Memory is a complex system that relies on interactions between many distinct parts of the brain. In order to fully understand memory, researchers must cumulate evidence from human, animal, and developmental research in order to make broad theories about how memory works. Intraspecies comparisons are key. Rats for example display extremely complex behaviours and most of the structures in their brain parallel those in humans. Due to their relatively simple organization, slugs can be useful for studying how neurons interconnect to produce observable behaviour. Fruit flies are useful for studying gene-behaviour interactions because many generations with genetic alterations can be quickly bred in the laboratory.

Memory, the cognitive process of storing and retrieving past experiences, learning and recognition, is a product of brain plasticity, the structural changes within synapses that create associations between stimuli. Stimuli are encoded within milliseconds; however, the long-term maintenance of memories can take additional minutes, days, or even years to fully consolidate and become a stable memory that is accessible (more resistant to change or interference). Therefore, the formation of a specific memory occurs rapidly, but the evolution of a memory is often an ongoing process. Memory processes have been shown to be stabilized and enhanced (sped up and/or integrated) and memories better consolidated by nocturnal sleep and daytime naps. Certain sleep stages have been demonstrated as improving an individual's memory, though this is task-specific. Generally, declarative memories are believed to be enhanced by slow-wave sleep, while non-declarative memories are enhanced by rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, although there are some inconsistencies among experimental results. The effect of sleep on memory, especially as it pertains to the human brain, is an active field of research in neurology, psychology, and related disciplines.  History  In 1801, David Hartley first suggested that dreaming altered the associative planetary links within the brain during rapid eye movement (REM) periods of the sleep cycle. The idea that sleep had a mentally restorative effect, sorting out and consolidating memories and ideas, was intellectually acceptable by the end of the 19th century. In ‚ÄòPeter and Wendy‚Äô, J.M. Barrie wrote ‚ÄòIt is the nightly custom of every good mother after her children are asleep to rummage in their minds and put things straight for next morning, repacking into their proper places the many articles that have wandered during the day....When you wake in the morning, the naughtinesses and evil passions with which you went to bed have been folded up small and placed at the bottom of your mind; and on the top, beautifully aired, are spread out your prettier thoughts, ready for you to put on.‚Äô The stories of Peter Pan take place in a fictional world and contain many allusions to aspects of cognitive psychology, some of which predate their formal scientific investigation. The first semi-multiple-systematic study of the connection between sleep and memory was conducted in 1924 by Jenkins and Dallenbach, for the purpose of testing Hermann Ebbinghaus' memory decay theory. Their results showed that memory retention was much better after a period of sleep compared to the same time interval spent awake. It was not until 1953, however, when sleep was delineated into rapid eye movement sleep and non-rapid eye movement sleep, that studies focusing on the effect of specific sleep stages on memory were conducted. As behavioral characteristics of the effects of sleep and memory are becoming increasingly understood and supported, researchers are turning to the weakly understood neural basis of sleep and memory.  Sleep cycles  EEG record of brain activity and wave patterns from a sleeping boy. Sleep progresses in a cycle which consists of five stages. Four of these stages are collectively referred to as non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep whereas the last cycle is a rapid eye movement period. A cycle takes approximately 90‚Äì110 minutes to complete. Wakefulness is found through an electroencephalogram (EEG) which is measured and characterized by beta waves, the highest in frequency but lowest in amplitude, and tend to move inconsistently due to the vast amount of stimuli a person encounters while awake. *Pre-sleep is the period of decreased perceptual awareness where brain activity is characterized by alpha waves which are more rhythmic, higher in amplitude and lower in frequency compared to beta waves. *Stage one is characterized by light sleep and lasts roughly 10 minutes. Brain waves gradually transition to theta waves. *Stage two also contains theta waves; however, random short bursts of increased frequency called sleep spindles are a defining characteristic of this stage. *Stage three and four are very similar and together are considered to be \\"deep sleep\\". In these stages brain activity transitions to delta waves which are the lowest in frequency and highest in amplitude. These two stages combined are also called slow wave sleep (SWS). *Stage five, REM sleep, is one of the most interesting stages as brain wave patterns are similar to those seen in relaxed wakefulness. This is referred to as \\"active sleep\\" and is the period when most dreaming occurs. REM sleep is also thought to play a role in the cognitive development of infants and children as they spend much more of their sleep in REM periods opposed to adults. During the first half of the night, the largest portion of sleep is spent as SWS, but as the night progresses SWS stages decrease in length while REM stages increase.  Memory terms  = Stabilization vs. enhancement = Stabilization of a memory is the anchoring of a memory in place, in which a weak connection is established. Stabilization of procedural memories can even occur during waking hours, suggesting that specific non-declarative tasks are enhanced in the absence of sleep. When memories are said to be enhanced, however, the connection is strengthened by rehearsal as well as connecting it to other related memories thereby making the retrieval more efficient. Whereas stabilization of non-declarative memories can be seen to occur during a wakeful state, enhancement of these sensory and motor memories has most been found to occur during nocturnal sleep. = Use-dependent processes vs. experience-dependent processes = Brain activity that occurs during sleep is assessed in two ways: Use-dependency, and Experience-dependency. Use-dependent brain activity is a result of the neuronal usage that occurred during the previous waking hours. Essentially it is neuronal regeneration, activity that occurs whether the person has learnt anything new or not. Experience-dependent brain activity is a result of a new situation, environment, or learned task or fact that has taken place in the pre-sleep period. This is the type of brain activity that denotes memory consolidation/enhancement. It is often hard to distinguish between the two in an experimental setting because the setting alone is a new environment. This new environment would be seen in the sleeping brain activity along with the newly learned task. To avoid this, most experimenters insist participants spend one day in the experimental condition before testing begins so the setting is not novel once the experiment begins. This ensures the collected data for experience-dependent brain activity is purely from the novel task. =Consolidation= Consolidation of a memory is a process that takes an initially unstable representation and encodes it in a more sturdy, effective and efficient manner. In this new state, the memory is less susceptible to interference. There are essentially three phases of memory consolidation and all are thought to be facilitated by sleep or not sleep: # Stabilization is the encoding of a memory which takes only 6 milliseconds. # Enhancement is the continual process of consolidation which can occur over minutes, 7 hours, days but not longer. Post-sleep behavioural activities can be seen to show significant improvements in the absence of practice. # Integration can also take hours or years and is the process of connecting recently encoded memories into existing memory networks. =Reconsolidation= Reconsolidation of a memory involves the retrieval of an already consolidated memory (explicit or implicit), into short-term or working memory. Here it is brought into a labile state where subsequent information can interfere with what is currently in memory, therefore altering the memory. This is known as retroactive interference, and is an extremely significant issue for court and eyewitness testimonies. =Pre-training vs post-training sleep deprivation= Researchers approach the study of sleep and memory from different angles. Some studies measure the effects of sleep deprivation after a novel task is taught (the subject learns the task and is sleep deprived afterwards). This is referred to as post-training sleep deprivation. Conversely, other experiments have been conducted that measure the effects of sleep deprivation before a task has been taught (the subject is sleep-deprived and then learns a task). This is referred to as pre-training sleep deprivation. =Offline memory processing= This is the processing of memories out of conscious awareness. For example, after someone has been reading a book, their brain continues to process the experience during other activities. This \\"offline\\" processing likewise occurs during sleep.  Methods of measuring memory  =Behavioral measures= * A self-ordered pointing task is a task of memory where a participant is presented with a number of images (or words) which are arranged on a display. Several trials are presented, each with a different arrangement and containing some of the previous words or images. The task for the participant is to point to a word or image they had not previously pointed to in other trials. * In a recency discrimination task participants are shown two trials of image presentation and then a third trial containing a mixture of images from the first and second trial. Their task is to determine whether the image was from the most recent presentation or the previous one. * In a route retrieval task spatial learning occurs where a participant virtual tours a particular place (such as a town or maze). Participants are asked to virtually tour the same thing at a later time while brain imaging is used to measure activity. * A paired word associative task consists of two phases. During the first phase (acquisition), the responses of the paired-associate task are learned and become recallable. In the second phase (associative phase), the subject learns to pair each response to a separate stimulus. For example, a visual cue would provide information as to what words must be recalled after the stimulus and words are removed. * In a mirror tracing task participants are asked to trace several figures as fast and as accurately as possible which they can only see in a mirror. Speed is recorded as well as how much they deviate from the original image (accuracy). * In the Morris water maze task rats are used to test their spatial learning in two kinds of conditions: spatial and nonspatial. In the spatial condition, a platform is hidden by using murky water and in the nonspatial condition, the platform is visible. The spatial condition the rat must rely on their spatial memory to find the platform whereas the nonspatial condition is used for comparison purposes. A rat undergoing a Morris water navigation test * The serial reaction time task (SRT task) is a task whereby subjects face a computer screen where several markers are displayed that are spatially related to relevant markers on their keyboard. The subjects are asked to react as fast and accurately as possible to the appearance of a stimulus below one of the markers. Subjects can be trained on the task with either explicit instructions (e.g. there are colour sequences presented which must be learned) or implicit ones (e.g. the experimenter does not mention colour sequences, thus leaving the subjects to believe that they are taking place in a speed test). When this task is used in sleep studies, after a time delay, subjects are tested for retention. * In the reach-to-grasp task rodents learned a skilled forelimb task. Sleep improved movement speed with preservation of accuracy. These offline improvements were linked to both replay of task-related ensembles during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and temporal shifts that more tightly bound motor cortical ensembles to movements. * In a neuroprosthetic task rodents trained to perform a simple brain‚Äìmachine interface task in which the activity of a set of motor cortical units was used to control a mechanical arm attached to a feeding spout. After successful learning, task-related units specifically experienced increased locking and coherency to slow-wave activity (SWA) during sleep. The time spent in SWA predicted the performance gains upon awakening. * In a block tapping task participants are asked to type a sequence of five numbers with their dominant or non-dominant hand (specified in experiment), for an allotted period of time, followed by a rest period. A number of these trials occur and the computer records the number of sequences completed to assess speed and the error rate to assess accuracy. * A finger tapping test is commonly used when a pure motor task is needed. A finger tapping test requires subjects to continuously press four keys (typically numerical keys) on a keypad with their nondominant hand in a sequence, such as 4-3-1-2-4, for a given amount of time. Testing is done by determining the number of errors made. = Neural imaging measures = Neuroimaging can be classified into two categories, both used in varying situations depending on what type of information is needed. Structural imaging deals predominately with the structure of the brain (computed tomography) while functional imaging deals more heavily with metabolic processes in regards to anatomical functioning (positron emission tomography, functional magnetic resonance imaging). In recent years, the relationship between sleep and memory processes had been aided by the development of such neuroimaging techniques. Positron emission tomography (PET) is used in viewing a functional processes of the brain (or other body parts). A Positron-emitting radionuclide is injected into the bloodstream and emits gamma rays which are detected by an imaging scanner. Computer analysis then allows for a 3-dimensional reconstruction of the brain region or body part of interest. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a type of brain imaging that measures the change of oxygen in the blood due to the activity of neurons. The resulting data can be visualized as a picture of the brain with colored representations of activation. = Molecular measures = Although this may be seen as similar to neuroimaging techniques, molecular measures help to enhance areas of activation that would otherwise be indecipherable to neuroimaging. One such technique that aids in both the temporal and visual resolution of fMRI is the blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) response. Changes in the BOLD response can be seen when there is differing levels of activation in suspected areas of functioning. Energy is supplied to the brain in the form glucose and oxygen (which is transferred by hemoglobin). The blood supply is consistently regulated so that areas of activation receive higher amounts of energy compared to areas that are less activated. In positron emission tomography, the use of radionuclides (isotopes with short half lives) facilitates visual resolution. These radionuclides are attached to glucose, water and ammonia so that easy absorption into the activated brain areas is accomplished. Once these radioactive tracers are injected into the bloodstream, the efficiency and location of chemical processes can be observed using PET. Methods of measuring sleep = Electrophysiological measures = The main method of measuring sleep in humans is polysomnography (PSG). For this method, participants often must come into a lab where researchers can use PSG to measure things such as total sleep time, sleep efficiency, wake after sleep onset, and sleep fragmentation. PSG can monitor various body functions including brain activity (electroencephalography), eye movement (electrooculography), muscle movement (electromyography), and heart rhythm (electrocardiography). * Brain wave patterns and activity recorded by an electroencephalogram.Electroencephalography (EEG) is a procedure that records electrical activity along the scalp. This procedure cannot record activity from individual neurons, but instead measures the overall average electrical activity in the brain. * Electrooculography (EOG) measures the difference in electrical potential between the front and the back of the eye. This does not measure a response to individual visual stimuli, but instead measures general eye movement. * Electromyography (EMG) is used to records the electrical activity of skeletal muscles. A device called an electromyograph measures the electrical potential of muscle cells to monitor muscle movement. * Electrocardiography (ECG or EKG) measures the electrical depolarization of the heart muscles using various electrodes placed near the chest and limbs. This measure of depolarization can be used to monitor heart rhythm. = Behavioural measures = Actigraphy is a common and minimally invasive way to measure sleep architecture. Actigraphy has only one method of recording, movement. This movement can be analyzed using different actigraphic programs. As such, an actigraph can often be worn similarly to a watch, or around the waist as a belt. Because it is minimally invasive and relatively inexpensive, this method allows for recordings outside of a lab setting and for many days at a time. But, actigraphy often over estimates sleep time (de Souza 2003 and Kanady 2011). Competing theories Most studies point to the specific deficits in declarative memories that form pre or post REM sleep deprivation. Conversely, deficits in non-declarative memory occur pre or post NREM sleep deprivation. This is the stage specific enhancement theory. There is also a proposed dual- step memory hypothesis suggesting that optimal learning occurs when the memory trace is initially processed in SWS and then REM sleep. Support for this is shown in many experiments where memory improvement is greater with either SWS or REM sleep compared to sleep deprivation, but memory is even more accurate when the sleep period contains both SWS and REM sleep.  Declarative memory  Declarative memory is the memory for conscious events. There are two types of declarative memory: episodic and semantic. Episodic memory is for remembering experiences or personal facts whereas semantic memory is remembering specific facts. Declarative memory is typically considered to be an explicit memory because the individual must consciously try to remember it. =Temporal memory= Temporal memory consists of three main categories, although they are still debated by psychologists and neurobiologists; the categories are immediate memory, short-term and long-term memory. Immediate memory is when a memory is recalled based on recently presented information. Short-term memory is what is used when retaining information that had been presented within seconds or minutes prior. A type of short-term memory is known as working memory, which is the ability to retain information that is necessary to carry out sequential actions. Lastly, long-term memory is the retention of information for longer periods of time, such as days, weeks or even a lifetime. In a study, participants were placed into four groups: two control groups given either caffeine or a placebo, and two groups that were sleep deprived for 36 hours, given either caffeine or a placebo. The task used to measure temporal memory consisted of discriminating between recent and less recent face presentations. A set of twelve unfamiliar faces were presented sequentially every 10 seconds. A self-ordered pointing task was used afterwards for 5 minutes to prevent rehearsal and to keep tired participants occupied. This required them to mark any new items seen (either nouns or abstract shapes) presented on 12 sheets. A second set was presented, followed by another self-ordered pointing task, and then a random sequence of 48 faces either containing previously presented faces or new ones were shown to the participant. They were asked if they recognized the faces and whether they were from the first or second set. Results indicate that sleep deprivation does not significantly affect recognition of faces, but does produce a significant impairment of temporal memory (discriminating which face belonged to which set). Caffeine was found to have a greater effect on the sleep deprived group as compared to the placebo group deprived of sleep, but still performed worse than both control groups. Sleep deprivation was also found to increase beliefs of being correct, especially if the participants were wrong. Brain imaging studies of those sleep deprived found that the greatest reduction in metabolic rate is in the prefrontal cortex. =Verbal learning= A blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) fMRI was used in a study by Drummond et al. to measure the brain's response to verbal learning following sleep deprivation. An fMRI recorded brain activity during a verbal learning task of participants either having a normal night of sleep or those deprived of 34.7 (¬± 1.2) hours of sleep. The task alternated between a baseline condition of determining whether nouns were upper or lower case, and an experimental condition of memorizing a list of nouns. The results of the study indicate that performance is significantly worse on free recall of the list of nouns when sleep deprived (an average of 2.8 ¬± 2 words) compared to having a normal night of sleep (4.7 ¬± 4 words). In terms of brain regions activated, the left prefrontal cortex, premotor cortex, and temporal lobes were found to be activated during the task in the rested state, and discrete regions of the prefrontal cortex were even more activated during the task in the sleep deprived state. As well, the bilateral parietal lobe, left middle frontal gyrus, and right inferior frontal gyrus were found to be activated for those sleep deprived. The implication of these findings are that the brain can initially compensate for the effects of sleep deprivation while maintaining partially intact performance, which declines with an increasing time-on-task. This initial compensation may be found in the bilateral regions of both frontal and parietal lobes and the activation of the prefrontal cortex is significantly correlated with sleepiness. =Cognitive performance= Cerebral activation during performance on three cognitive tasks (verbal learning, arithmetic, and divided attention) were compared after both normal sleep and 35 hours of total sleep deprivation (TSD) in a study by Drummond and Brown. Use of fMRI measured these differences in the brain. In the verbal learning task, fMRI indicated the regions involved in both verbal learning and memorization. The results found that both TSD and a normal night of sleep showed a significant response in the prefrontal cortex, and following TSD displayed a response of additional areas which included other prefrontal areas, bilateral inferior parietal lobule and superior parietal lobes. Increases in sleepiness also correlated with activation of two ventral prefrontal regions and a correlation between a greater activation in bilateral parietal lobes (which include language areas) and lower levels of impairment on free recall were also found following TSD. In the arithmetic task, normal sleep showed the expected activation in the bilateral prefrontal and parietal working memory regions, but following TSD only showed activation in the left superior parietal lobe and the left premotor cortex in response, with no new areas to compensate (as was found in verbal learning). Increased sleepiness was also correlated with activation in a ventral prefrontal region, but only one region. The divided attention task combined both verbal learning and the arithmetic task. fMRI indicated that cerebral response after TSD is similar to that of the verbal learning task (specifically the right prefrontal cortex, bilateral parietal lobes, and cingulate gyrus showing the strongest response). The implication of this finding is that additional brain regions activated after both verbal learning and divided attention tasks following TSD represent a cerebral compensatory response to lacking sleep. For example, there is a decline in response of the left temporal lobes during both tasks which is involved in different learning tasks during a rested state, but involvement of the left inferior parietal lobe in short-term verbal memory storage following TSD suggests that this region might compensate. No new areas for the arithmetic task may suggest that it relies heavily on working memory so compensation is not possible, in comparison to tasks such as verbal learning which rely less on working memory. =Slow wave sleep (SWS)= Slow wave sleep (SWS) has often been associated with successful performance in declarative memory recall tasks. For example, declarative and procedural memory recall tasks applied over early and late nocturnal sleep, as well as wakefulness controlled conditions, have been shown that declarative memory improves more during early sleep (dominated by SWS) while procedural memory during late sleep (dominated by REM sleep). Based on targeted memory reactivation (TMR) that use associated memory cues for triggering memory traces during sleep, recent studies have been reassuring the importance of nocturnal SWS for the formation of persistent memories in neocortical networks, as well as highlighting the possibility of increasing people's memory performance at declarative recalls. Increased slow activity and sleep time spent in SWS have been also related to better performance in implicit learning. Macroscopic brain systems The most prominent population pattern in the hippocampus during nREM is called sharp wave ripples (SPW-R). SPW-Rs are the most synchronous neuronal patterns in the mammalian brain. As many as 15-30 percent of neurons in 50-200 ms fire synchronously in the CA3-CA2-CA1, subicular complex and entorhinal cortex during SWP-R (as opposed to ~1 percent during active waking and REM). Neurons within SPW-R are sequentially organized and many of the fast sequences are related to the order of neuronal firing during the pre-sleep experience of the animal. For example, when the rat explores a maze, place cell sequences in the different arms of the maze are replayed either in a forward (as during the experience itself) or reverse order, but compressed in time several-fold. SPW-R are temporally linked to both sleep spindles and slow oscillations of the neocortex. Interfering with SPW-Rs or its coupling with neocortical slow oscillations results in memory impairment, which can be as severe as surgically damaging the hippocampus and/or associated structures. SPW-R is therefore the most prominent physiological biomarker of episodic (i.e., hippocampus-dependent) memory consolidation (Buzsaki 2015). =Neural forebrain reverberation correlation= Researchers used rats in order to investigate the effects of novel tactile objects on the long-term evolution of the major rodent forebrain loops essential in species-specific behaviours, including such structures as the hippocampus, putamen, neocortex and the thalamus. The rats were monitored but not bothered for 48‚Äì96 hours, allowing normal wake-sleep cycles to occur. At some point four novel tactile objects were placed in the four corners of the rat's cage. They were all very different from one another and they were there for a total of one hour. The brain activity during this hour was used as a baseline or template to compare. Data analysis implied that the neural assemblies during SWS correlated significantly more with templates than during waking hours or REM sleep. As well, these post-learning, post-SWS reverberations lasted 48 hours, much longer than the duration of novel object learning (one hour), indicating long term potentiation. Further analysis on a neuron to neuron base showed no subset of neurons (brain structure) to be responsible for the reverberations or anti-reverberations (patterns of activity significantly more dissimilar than novel stimulation templates). Another difference noticed was the highest correlation peaks in SWS corresponded with the lowest rate of neuron firing in the forebrain, opposite that of REM sleep and waking where rate of firing is the highest. It is hypothesized that this is due to interference from other incoming stimuli during waking periods. In SWS there is no incoming stimuli, so the novel experience can be replayed, without interruption. =Neural hippocampal reverberation correlations= A study by Peigneux et al., (2004) noted that the firing sequences in the hippocampal ensembles during spatial learning are also active during sleep, which shows that post training sleep has a role in processing spatial memories. This study was done to prove that the same hippocampal areas are activated in humans during route learning in a virtual town, and are reactivated during subsequent slow wave sleep (SWS). In order to monitor this activation, experimenters used PET scans and fMRI to use cerebral blood flow as a marker of synaptic activity. The finding noted that the amount of hippocampal activation during slow-wave sleep positively correlated to the improvement on the virtual tour task the following day, which indicates that hippocampal activity during sleep correlates with the improvement in memory performance. These findings prove that learning-dependent modulation in hippocampal activity while sleeping shows processing of the previously learned episodic and spatial memory traces. This modulation of the hippocampus leads to plastic changes in the brain and ultimately an improvement in performance. The results of this study showed that spatial memory traces are processed in humans while they are in NREM sleep. It showed a reaction of the hippocampal formation during SWS, after a declarative spatial memory task. Experimenters also found, that in humans, there is experience-dependent modulation of activity during NREM sleep in the hippocampal regions, but not during REM sleep after learning. The evidence from this study was substantial to its hypothesis that the information learned while awake is altered, and strengthened while humans are sleeping. Based on the active system consolidation hypothesis, repeated reactivations of newly encoded information in hippocampus during slow oscillations in NREM sleep mediate the stabilization and gradual integration of declarative memory with pre-existing knowledge networks on the cortical level. It assumes the hippocampus might hold information only temporarily and in fast-learning rate, whereas the neocortex is related to long-term storage and slow-learning rate. This dialogue between hippocampus and neocortex occurs in parallel with hippocampal sharp-wave ripples and thalamo-cortical spindles, synchrony that drives the formation of spindle-ripple event which seems to be a prerequisite for the formation of long-term memories. Decreases in acetylcholine In this study, two groups of participants took part in a two-night counterbalanced study. Two tasks were learned by all participants between 10:00-10:30pm. The declarative task was a paired-associate word list of 40 German semantically related word pairs. The non-declarative task was a mirror-tracing task. At 11:00pm all participants were put on a two-hour infusion of either physostigmine or a placebo. Physostigmine is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor; it is a drug that inhibits the breakdown of the inhibitory neurotransmitter acetylcholine, thereby allowing it to remain active longer in the synapses. The sleep group was put to bed while the other group stayed awake. Testing of both tasks took place at 2:45am, 30 minutes after the sleep group had been woken up; a sleep which had been rich in slow-wave sleep (SWS). Results showed that the increased ACh negatively affected recall memory (declarative task), in the sleep condition compared to participants given the placebo. Specifically, recall after sleep for the placebo group showed an increase of 5.2 ¬± 0.8 words compared to an increase of only 2.1 ¬± 0.6 words when participants were given the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor. Conversely, neither speed nor accuracy declined in the non-declarative mirror task when participants were given physostigmine, and neither task performance was affected in the wake groups when physostigmine was administered. This suggests that the purpose of ACh suppression during SWS allows for hippocampus- dependent declarative memory consolidation; high levels of ACh during SWS blocks memory replay on a hippocampal level. *Note: There was no correlation between the amount of SWS and level of recall. Memory consolidation can be disrupted, however, if large parts of SWS are missing. Increases in sleep spindles A typical EEG during stage 2 sleep Sleep spindles are short and intense bursts of neurons firing in sync, occurring in the thalamo-cortical networks. These peak late in the night and are defining characteristics of stage two sleep. Sleep spindles are thought to aid in information consolidation during sleep and have been shown to increase after training on a motor task. A study using 49 rats indicated the increase of sleep spindles during slow-wave sleep following learning. It gave evidence to the increase of spindle frequency during non-REM sleep following paired associate of motor- skill learning tasks. Using an EEG, sleep spindles were detected and shown to be present only during slow-wave sleep. Beginning with a preliminary study, rats underwent six hours of monitored sleep, after a period of learning. Results showed that during the first hour following learning, there was the most evident effect on learning-modulated sleep spindle density. However, this increase in spindle density was not dependent on the training condition. In other words, there was an increase in spindles regardless of how the rats were trained. EEG patterns showed a significant difference in the density of sleep spindles compared to the density of a control group of rats, who did not undergo any training before their sleep spindles were measured. This effect of increased spindle density only lasted for the first hour into sleep following training, and then disappeared within the second hour into sleep. = Reward learning and memory = In a study by Fischer and Born, 2009, previous knowledge of monetary reward and post-training sleep are proven to be significant predictors of overall finger sequence tapping performance. Subjects were presented with two different finger sequence tasks that would have to be replicated at a later time. The subjects were told that there would be a reward offered for improvement upon a specific finger tapping sequence task. A control group was not given any knowledge of a reward. The subjects were separated further by allowing a sleep period between initial training and final testing for one group while another group faced a wake retention interval. It was concluded that the group that received both information about reward as well as being able to sleep displayed the highest increase in performance on both finger tapping sequences. Knowledge of reward without sleep and sleep without knowledge of reward were both significant contributors to improved performance. In all cases sleep was determined to have an advantageous effect on overall performance when compared to groups that underwent a twelve-hour wake retention period.  Non-declarative memory  Non-declarative memory is memory gained from previous experiences that is unconsciously applied to everyday scenarios. Non-declarative memory is essential for the performance of learned skills and habits, for example, running or cooking a favourite meal. There are three types of non-declarative memories: implicit memory (unconscious memory, priming), instrumental memory (classical conditioning), and procedural memory (automatic skill memory). =Sleep deprivation= ERK phosphorylation Extracellular signal- related kinases, also known as classical MAP kinase, are a group of protein kinases located in neurons. These proteins are activated or deactivated by phosphorylation (adding of a phosphate group using ATP), in response to neurotransmitters and growth factors. This can result in subsequent protein to protein interactions and signal transductions (neurotransmitters or hormones transmit to cells), which ultimately controls all cellular processes including gene transcription and cell cycles (important in learning and memory). A study tested four groups of rats in the Morris Water Maze, two groups in the spatial task (hidden platform) and two groups in the non-spatial task (visible platform.) The effects of six hours of total sleep deprivation (TSD) were assessed for the experimental group (one spatial group, one non-spatial group) in both tasks. Six hours after the TSD period (or sleep period for controls), the groups of rats were trained on either task then tested 24 hours later. In addition, the levels of total ERK phosphorylation (ERK 1 and ERK 2), protein phosphate 1 (PP1), and MAPK phosphatase 2 (latter two both involved in dephosphorylation) were assessed by decapitating four other groups of mice, (two sleep deprived and two non-sleep deprived), and removing their hippocampuses after the six hours of TSD, or two hours after TSD (eight hours total). Results showed that TSD did not impair learning of the spatial task, but it did impair memory. With regards to the non-spatial task, learning again was no different in the TSD; however, memory in the TSD group was actually slightly better, although not quite significantly. Analysis of the hippocampus showed that TSD significantly decreased the levels of total ERK phosphorylation by about 30%. TSD did not affect proteins in the cortex which indicates that the decreases in ERK levels were due to impaired signal transduction in the hippocampus. In addition, neither PP1 or MAPK phosphatase 2 levels were increased suggesting that the decreases in ERK were not due to dephosphorylation but instead a result of TSD. Therefore, it is proposed that TSD has aversive effects on the cellular processes (ERK: gene transcription etc.), underlying sleep-dependent memory plasticity. = REM sleep = REM sleep is known for its vivid creations and similarity to the bioelectric outputs of a waking person. This stage of sleep is characterized by muscle atonia, fast but low voltage EEG and, as the name suggests, rapid eye movement. It is difficult to attribute memory gains to a single stage of sleep when it may be the entire sleep cycle that is responsible for memory consolidation. Recent research conducted by Datta et al. used an avoidance task followed by a post-training REM sleep period to examine changes in P waves affecting reprocessing of recently acquired stimuli. It was found that not only were the P waves increased during post-training sleep but also the density of the waves. These findings may imply that P waves during REM sleep may help to activate critical forebrain and cortical structures dealing with memory consolidation. In a Hennevin et al. study, 1989, the mesencephalic reticular formation (MRF) was given light electrical stimulation, during REM sleep, which is known to have an advantageous effect for learning when applied after training. The rats in the experiment were trained to run a maze in search of a food reward. One group of rats was given non-awakening MRF electrical stimulations after each of their maze trials compared to a control group which did not receive any electrical stimulation. It was noticed that the stimulated rats performed significantly better in respect to error reduction. These findings imply that dynamic memory processes occur both during training as well as during post-training sleep. Another study by Hennevin et al. (1998) conditioned rats to fear a noise that is associated with a subsequent foot shock. The interesting part of the experiment is that fear responding to the noise (measured in the amygdala) was observed when the noise was presented during REM sleep. This was compared to a group of pseudo- conditioned rats who did not display the same amygdalar activation during post-training sleep. This would suggest that neural responding to previously salient stimuli is maintained even during REM sleep. There is no shortage of research conducted on the effects that REM sleep has on the working brain, but consistency in the findings is what plagues recent research. There is no guarantee as to what functions REM sleep may perform for our bodies and brains, but modern research is always expanding and assimilating new ideas to further our understanding of such processes. PGO waves In animals, the appearance of ponto-geniculo-occipital waves (PGO waves) is related to that of the bioelectric outputs of rapid eye movements. These waves are most clearly seen during the transition from non-REM to REM sleep. Although these phasic waves are observed in many portions of the animal brain, they are most noticeable in the pons, lateral geniculate bodies, and the occipital cortex. Peigneux et al., 2006, reported that the lateral geniculate nucleus and occipital cortex display higher levels of activity during REM sleep than during wakefulness. This would add to the theory that activation in these areas is similar to PGO wave activation in animals. Pontine waves are commonly seen in animals as a mechanism to help facilitate learning and memory consolidation. An improvement on task performance was seen to be a result of increased P waves between REM sleep sessions. In a study using post learning REM sleep deprivation the effects of stimulating the P wave generator (located in the pontine tegmentum) of a rat were observed. Two groups of rats underwent an avoidance learning task and then allowed a sleep period while another group of rats were deprived sleep. When comparing the two groups the sleep deprived rats showed a significant deficit in learning from having not undergone REM sleep. In another rat group, the P wave generator was stimulated using a carbachol injection and the rats then underwent a sleep deprivation stage. When these rats were again tested on their learning it was shown that activation of the P wave generator during sleep deprivation resulted in normal learning being achieved. This would point to the fact that the activation of P waves, even without REM sleep, was enough to enhance the memory processes that would not normally have happened. Implicit face memory Faces are an important part of one's social life. To be able to recognize, respond and act towards a person requires unconscious memory encoding and retrieval processes. Facial stimuli are processed in the fusiform gyrus (occipito-temporal brain area) and this processing is an implicit function representing a typical form of implicit memory. REM sleep has been seen to be more beneficial to implicit visuospatial memory processes, rather than slow-wave sleep which is crucial for explicit memory consolidation. REM sleep is known for its visual experiences, which may often include detailed depictions of the human countenance. A recognition task was used to gauge familiarity with a previously shown sequence of faces after a subsequent period of REM sleep. It was seen that the fusiform gyrus was active during training, the REM sleep period, and the recognition task as well. It is hypothesized that brain mechanisms during REM sleep, as well as pure repetition priming, can account for the implicit recognition of the previously shown faces. Macroscopic brain systems Previous research has shown REM sleep to reactivate cortical neural assemblies post-training on a serial reaction time task (SRT), in other words REM sleep replays the processing that occurred while one learnt an implicit task in the previous waking hours. However, control subjects did not complete a SRT task, thus researchers could not assume the reactivation of certain networks to be a result of the implicitly learned sequence/grammar as it could simply be due to elementary visuomotor processing which was obtained in both groups. To answer this question the experiment was redone and another group was added who also took part in the SRT task. They experienced no sequence to the SRT task (random group), whereas the experimental group did experience a sequence (probabilistic group), although without conscious awareness. Results of PET scans indicate that bilateral cuneus were significantly more activated during SRT practice as well as post-training REM sleep in the Probabilistic group than the Random group. In addition, this activation was significantly increased during REM sleep versus the SRT task. This suggests that specific brain regions are specifically engaged in the post-processing of sequential information. This is further supported by the fact that regional CBF (rCBF) during post-training REM sleep are modulated by the level of high-order, but not low-order learning obtained prior to sleep. Therefore, brain regions that take part in a learning process are modulated by both the sequential structure of the learned material (increased activation in cuneus), and the amount of high-order learning (rCBF). REM sleep deprivation and neurotrophic factors The effects of REM sleep deprivation (RSD) on neurotrophic factors, specifically nerve growth factor (NGF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), were assessed in 2000 by Sie et al. Neurotrophins are proteins found in the brain and periphery that aid in the survival, functioning and generation of neurons; this is an important element in the synaptic plasticity process, the underlying neurochemical foundation in forming memories. Sei et al., inserted electrodes into the skulls of seven pairs of rats to measure electroencephalogram (EEG), and inserted wires into the neck muscles of the rats to measure electromyogram (EMG), a technique used to measure the amount of muscle activity. Half the rats experienced a six-hour REM sleep deprivation period, while the other half experienced a six-hour sleep period, containing all sleep cycles. Results showed that the rats in the REM sleep deprivation group experienced decreased levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor in the cerebellum (coordination, motor learning) and brainstem (sensory and motor ascending pathway); conversely, the hippocampus (long-term memory, spatial navigation), showed decreases in nerve growth factor levels. BDNF protein has been shown to be necessary for procedural learning (form of non-declarative memory). Since procedural learning has also exhibited consolidation and enhancement under REM sleep, it is proposed that the impairment of procedural learning tasks is due to the lack of BDNF proteins in the cerebellum and brainstem during RSD. In regards to NGF, the basal forebrain (production and distribution of AcH in the brain), more specifically the medial septal area, sends cholinergic (excitatory in hippocampus) and GABAergic (inhibitory) neurotransmitters through fibres to the hippocampus target cells. These target cells then secrete NGF which plays a key role in the physiological state of the hippocampus and its functions. It has been noted that REM sleep increases the secretion of NGF, therefore it has been proposed that during RSD cholinergic activity decreases leading to a decrease in NGF and impairment in procedural learning. Vertebrate brain regions = Macroscopic brain system reorganization = Walker and Stickgold hypothesized that after initial memory acquisition, sleep reorganizes memory representation at a macro-brain systems level. Their experiment consisted of two groups; the night-sleep group was taught a motor sequence block tapping task at night, put to sleep and then retested 12 hours later. The day-wake group was taught the same task in the morning and tested 12 hours later with no intervening sleep. FMRI was used to measure brain activity during retest. Results indicated significantly fewer errors/sequence in the night-sleep group compared to the day wake group. FMRI output for the night-sleep group indicated increased activation in the right primary motor cortex/M1/Prefrontal Gyrus (contra lateral to the hand they were block tapping with), right anterior medial prefrontal lobe, right hippocampus (long-term memory, spatial memory), right ventral striatum (olfactory tubercle, nucleus accumbens), as well as regions of the cerebellum (lobules V1, V11). In the day-wake group, fMRI showed \\"decreased\\" signal activation bilaterally in the parietal cortices (integrates multiple modalities), in addition to the left insular cortex (regulation of homeostasis), left temporal pole (most anterior of temporal cortex), and the left inferior fronto-polar cortex. Previous investigations have shown that signal increases indicate brain plasticity. The increased signal activity seen in M1 after sleep corresponds to increased activity in this area seen during practice; however, an individual must practice for longer periods than they would have to sleep in order to obtain the same level of M1 signal increases. Therefore, it is suggested that sleep enhances the cortical representation of motor tasks by brain system expansion, as seen by increased signal activity. = Working memory = Considered to be a mental workspace enabling temporary storage and retrieval of information, working memory is crucial to problem-solving and analysis of different situations. Working memory capacity is a measure of the number of mental processing functions one is able to perform consecutively. Increases in one's working memory capacity can be accomplished with a strategy known as chunking. Aritake et al. conducted a finger sequence tapping experiment in which the subjects were shown coloured dots in sequence on a monitor corresponding to buttons on their keyboard. When a colour was shown, the subject had to react by pressing the right colour on the keyboard. The subjects were separated into three groups. Group one continually trained with no periods of sleep. Group two was trained and retested over ten hours of wakefulness followed by eight hours of sleep and final testing. The third group was trained at ten pm, followed by an eight-hour sleep. This group was then tested the following morning and again later in the same day. Results showed that wakefulness was an insignificant predictor of performance improvement, unless followed by a period of sleep. Groups that were allowed a post training sleep period, regardless of its time in reference to training, experienced improvements in learning the finger tapping sequences. The initial working memory capacity of the groups averaged three to four units. In groups two and three, the working memory capacity was increased to an average of 5‚Äì6 units. It was proposed that sleep-dependent improvements may contribute to overall improvement in working memory capacity, leading to improved fluid intelligence.  Sleep deprivation  Sleep deprivation, whether it is total sleep deprivation or partial sleep deprivation, can impair working memory in measures of memory, speed of cognitive processing, attention and task switching. Casement et al. found that when subjects were asked to recognize digits displayed on a screen by typing them on a keypad, the working memory speed of subjects whose sleep was restricted to four hours a night (approximately 50% of their normal sleep amount) were 58% slower than control groups who were allowed their full eight hours of sleep. Synaptic plasticity The brain is an ever-changing, plastic, model of information sharing and processing. In order for the brain to incorporate new experiences into a refined schema, it has to undergo specific modifications to consolidate and assimilate all new information. Synaptic plasticity can be described as the changing in strength between two related neurons. Neuroplasticity is most clearly seen in the instances of REM sleep deprivation during brain maturation. Regional brain measurements in neonatal REM sleep deprived rats displayed a significant size reduction in areas such as the cerebral cortex and the brain stem. The rats were deprived during critical periods after birth, and subsequently anatomical size reduction is observed. Using a pursuit task (used to test visuomotor capabilities) in combination with an fMRI, Maquet et al., 2003, found that increases in activation were seen in the supplementary eye field and right dentate nucleus of subjects who were allowed to sleep as compared to sleep deprived individuals. The right superior temporal sulcus was also noticed to have higher activation levels. When functional connectivity was analyzed it was found that the dentate nucleus was more closely involved with the functions of the superior temporal sulcus. The results suggest that performance on the pursuit task relies on the subject's ability to comprehend appropriate movement patterns in order to recreate the optimal movements. Sleep deprivation was found to interrupt the slow processes that lead to learning of this procedural skill and alter connectivity changes that would have normally been seen after a night of rest. Neuroplasticity has been thoroughly researched over the past few decades and results have shown that significant changes that occur in our cortical processing areas have the power to modulate neuronal firing to both new and previously experienced stimuli. =Neurotransmitter regulation= The changes in quantity of a certain neurotransmitter as well as how the post-synaptic terminal responds to this change are underlying mechanisms of brain plasticity. During sleep there are remarkable changes in modulatory neurotransmitters throughout the brain. Acetylcholine is an excitatory neurotransmitter that is seen to increase to near waking levels during REM sleep while compared to lower levels during slow-wave sleep. Evidence has shown that functioning of the hippocampus- dependent memory system (episodic memory and autobiographical memory) is directly affected by cholinergic changes throughout the wake-sleep cycle. High levels of ACh would promote information attained during wakefulness to be stored in the hippocampus. This is accomplished by suppressing previous excitatory connections while facilitating encoding without interference from previously stored information. During NREM sleep, and especially slow-wave sleep, low levels of Ach would cause the release of this suppression and allow for spontaneous recovery of hippocampal neurons resulting in the facilitation of memory consolidation. = Gene expression = Recently, approximately one hundred genes whose brain expression is increased during periods of sleep have been found. A similar number of genes were found to promote gene expression during wakefulness. These sets of genes are related to different functional groups which may promote different cellular processes. The genes expressed during wakefulness may perform numerous duties including energy allocation, synaptic excitatory neurotransmission, high transcriptional activity and synaptic potentiation in learning of new information. There was a sleep related increase in processes that involve the synthesis and maintenance of the synapse. Such processes include membrane trafficking, synaptic vesicle recycling, myelin structural protein formation, and cholesterol and protein synthesis. In a different study it was found that there was a sleep related increase in calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV that has been specifically involved in synaptic depression and in the consolidation of long-term memory. These findings encourage an association between sleep and different aspects of neural plasticity.  Alternative sleep schedules  =Motor skills learning= The impact of daytime naps was looked at by Walker and Stickgold (2005). The experimental group was given a 60-90 minute afternoon nap (one full cycle), after a motor skills task learned that morning, while the control group received no nap. The nap group improved 16% when tested after their nap, while the no-nap group made no significant improvements. However, it seemed to all even out after that same night's sleep; the no-nap group improved 24% and the nap group improved only 7% more for a total of 23%, virtually identical. With regards to motor skills learning, naps seem to only speed up skill enhancement, not increase the amount of enhancement. =Visuals skills learning= Much like motor skills learning, verbal skills learning increased after a daytime nap period. Researchers Mednick and colleagues have shown that if a visual skills task (find task) is taught in the morning and repeatedly tested throughout the day, individuals will actually become worse at the task. The individuals that were allowed a 30-60 minute nap seemed to gain stabilization of the skill, as no deterioration occurred. If allowed a 60-90 minute nap (REM sleep and slow-wave sleep), individuals displayed enhancement. Unlike the motor task, enhancement was not suppressed during the nocturnal sleep if the individual had napped earlier. In the situation of visual skill learning, naps have been shown to prevent wakeful deterioration and even enhance learning above and beyond enhancement occurring in nocturnal sleep. = Shift workers = Shift workers who work throughout the night have been known to have far more accidents as opposed to daytime workers.' This can be attributed to several factors, including fewer staff and fatigue; however, part of the problem may be the workers' poor working memory and poor performance skills due to poor memory consolidation. Both implicitly learned tasks and explicitly learned tasks improve by roughly 20% after a full nights sleep. Without an adequate nights sleep between learning a new task and performance of that task, performance fails to improve. Shift workers who are not given an adequate amount of sleep, particularly in the NREM stage, between learning and performance of a task will not perform as well as workers who maintain a standard sleep routine. Sleep and aging Sleep often becomes deregulated in the elderly and can lead to or exacerbate pre-existing memory decline. =Healthy older adults= The positive correlation between sleep and memory breaks down with aging. In general, older adults suffer from decreased sleep efficiency. The amount of time and density of REM sleep and SWS decreases with age. Consequently, it is common that the elderly receive no increase in memory after a period of rest. To combat this, donepezil has been tested in healthy elderly patients where it was shown to increase time spent in REM sleep and improve next day memory recall. =Alzheimer's disease= Patients with Alzheimer's disease experience more sleep disruption than the healthy elderly. Studies have shown that in patients with Alzheimer's disease, there is a decrease in fast spindles. It has also been reported that spindle density the night before a memory test correlates positively with accuracy on an immediate recall task. A positive correlation between time spent in SWS and next day autobiographical memory recall has also been reported in Alzheimer's patients.

It is a volatile, flammable, colorless liquid that acts as a central nervous system depressant.Merriam-Webster's Online Dictionary Ethanol can impair different types of memory. Ethanol Alcoholic beverages Mode of actions =Effects on the hippocampus= Alcohol acts as a general central nervous system depressant, but it also affects some specific areas of the brain to a greater extent than others. Memory impairment caused by alcohol has been linked to the disruption of hippocampal function ‚Äî particularly affecting gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) neurotransmission which negatively impacts long-term potentiation (LTP). The molecular basis of LTP is associated with learning and memory. Particularly, damage to hippocampal CA1 cells adversely affects memory formation, and this disruption has been linked to dose-dependent levels of alcohol consumption. At higher doses, alcohol significantly inhibits neuronal activity in both the CA1 and CA3 pyramidal cell layers of the hippocampus.Ryabinin AE, Criado JR, Henriksen SJ, Bloom FE, Wilson MC (1997). Differential sensitivity of c-Fos expression in hippocampus and other brain regions to moderate and low doses of alcohol. Mol Psychiatry, (1),32-43. This impairs memory encoding, since the hippocampus plays an important role in the formations of new memories.A Hippocampal Pyramidal Cell =Molecular effects on GABA and NMDA receptors= A GABAA Receptor Alcohol also acts as a positive allosteric modulator of GABA receptors, specifically type GABAA.. Upon activation, these GABA receptors conduct Cl-, resulting in neuronal hyperpolarization. This hyperpolarization decreases the chance of an action potential occurring and thus, it has an inhibitory effect on neurotransmission in the central nervous system. GABAA receptor subtypes vary in their sensitivities to dosage of alcohol consumed. Furthermore, acute alcohol intake promotes GABAergic neurotransmission via the presynaptic release of GABA, the dephosphorylation of GABAA receptors (increasing GABA sensitivity), and the elevation of endogenous GABAergic neuroactive steroids. Protein kinase C (PKC) has been implicated in differentially modulating the response of the GABAA receptor to alcohol, with effects depending on the PKC isozyme. Alcohol effects have also implicated protein kinase A in affecting GABAA receptor function, such as promoting sensitivity. Enhancement of GABAergic transmission due to alcohol consumption can also be brought about by neuroactive steroids, such as allopregnanolone, which act as GABAA receptor agonists. Both chronic alcohol consumption and alcohol dependence are correlated with the altered expression, properties, and functions of the GABAA receptor that may contribute to alcohol tolerance. There is still much yet to be discovered about alcohol's specific and varying effects on both the GABAA receptor and its subtypes. At higher doses, ethanol also affects NMDA receptors (NMDARs) by inhibiting the ion current induced by NMDA, a glutamate receptor agonist. This inhibition of synaptic excitation by alcohol has been shown to be dose-dependent (up to a certain point, after which it did not differ by much). Alcohol appears to produce this inhibition by using a site of the NMDAR that is accessible from the extracellular environment. Therefore, this inhibition of an ion current usually produced by NMDAR activation leads to decreased LTP in hippocampal areas. Alcohol negatively affects LTP to a greater degree in immature versus mature animals. In adolescents, alcohol decreases the expression of both the NMDAR NR2A subunit in the hippocampus and the NR1 subunit in the prefrontal cortex. Studies have also found that a decrease in phosphorylation of 2B subunit in the prefrontal cortex, the hippocampus, the nucleus accumbens, and the striatum. NMDARS may be affected by PKA regulation due to the actions of alcohol. Alcohol's effects on GABAA neurotransmission may indirectly inhibit the activity of the NMDAR, and they may contribute to its blockade of LTP induction; however, alcohol's direct effects on NMDAR alone are sufficient for the inhibition of LTP. The varying dose-dependent response to alcohol relies on the combined interactions and responses of the GABAA receptors, NMDARs, and metabotropic glutamate receptors subtype 5 (mGluR5). These changes prevent excitatory synaptic transmissions from occurring, affecting synaptic plasticity and, in turn, memory and learning. However, there is still much yet to be elucidated concerning specific molecular mechanisms of how alcohol affects memory formation. =Effects on other brain regions= Alcohol also impairs and alters the functioning in the cerebellum, which affects both motor function and coordination. It has a notable inhibitory effect on the neurons of the cerebral cortex, affecting and altering thought processes, decreasing inhibition, and increasing the pain threshold. It also decreases sexual performance by depressing nerve centers in the hypothalamus. Alcohol also has an effect on urine excretion via inhibition of anti-diuretic hormone (ADH) secretion of the pituitary gland. Lastly, it depresses breathing and heart rate by inhibiting neuronal functioning of the medulla. Long-term memory Long-term memory (LTM) has both a long duration and a large capacity.Baddeley, A., Eysenck, M.W. and Anderson, M.C. (2009). Memory. New York, NY: Psychology Press. Memories that are stored in LTM can last from a few days to a lifetime. LTM consists of both explicit memory (requiring conscious awareness) and implicit memory (unconscious awareness). Information selected for LTM goes through three processes. First of all, in the encoding stage, information from the senses is incorporated into mental activity in the form of a memory. Secondly, storage involves taking this information and holding it indefinitely in memory. Lastly, retrieval is the ability to recall information from the long-term memory storage. Each of these processes can be affected by alcohol. Animation: Hippocampus (red) =Explicit memory= Explicit memory requires conscious and intentional effort for recall. It includes both episodic memory (for specific events, such as a party) and semantic memory (for general information, such as one's name). Alcohol impairs episodic encoding, specifically for cued recall, recognition of completed word fragments, and free recall. A blackout is an example of a difficulty in encoding episodic memories due to alcohol. Blackouts are caused by a rapid increase in blood alcohol concentration (BAC) which in turn distorts the neurons in the hippocampus. This distortion impairs a person's ability to form new episodic memories. High doses of alcohol severely disrupt the storage process of semantic memories. Alcohol was found to impair the storage of novel stimuli but not that of previously learned information. Since alcohol affects the central nervous system, it hinders semantic storage functioning by restricting the consolidation of the information from encoding. Retrieval of explicit memory is significantly impaired by alcohol. When compared to sober participants, intoxicated participants performed quite poorly on a recall task for everyday events (i.e., episodic memory). Intoxicated participants are also slower to respond in reaction time tasks. Alcohol also impairs retrieval in word recognition tasks. When both encoding and retrieval take place during intoxication, there are surprisingly more impairments for cued recall than for free recall. In terms of gender differences in retrieval processes, females tend to score lower than males on recall tasks when intoxicated. =Implicit memory= Implicit memory does not require conscious effort or intention for recall. It occurs when previous experience influences performance on a certain task. This is evident in priming experiments. Implicit memory includes procedural memory, which influences our everyday behaviours, such as riding a bike or tying shoes. People can perform these abilities without even thinking about them, which means procedural memory functions automatically. While retrieval of explicit memory is severely impaired by alcohol, retrieval of implicit memory is not. Intoxicated subjects score higher on recognition tasks (involving implicit memory) than they can on recall tasks (involving explicit memory). Short-term memory Short-term memory refers to the temporary storage of small amounts of information over short delays. Digit span refers to the proposed number of pieces of information (5-9) that can be held in short-term memory. This is also referred to as the magic number seven ‚Äì plus or minus two. Any more pieces of information than this, and newer items replace previous items. Alcohol intoxication has been found to have dissociative effects on both short-term memory and cognitive functioning. Anterior Cingulate Cortex (yellow) Animation: Parietal Lobe (red) =Brain areas affected by alcohol= Alcohol affects the functioning of the brain. Neurochemical changes occurring in the anterior cingulate are correlated with altered short-term memory functions in the brains of young alcoholic men. fMRIs of alcohol-dependent women displayed significantly less blood oxygen in the frontal and parietal regions, especially in the right hemisphere. This is supported by findings of short-term memory impairment by lesions of both the parietal lobe and the prefrontal cortex. Associations between Third ventricle volume and cognitive performance on memory tests have been found in alcoholics. Specifically, increases in third ventricular volume correlate with a decline in memory performance. =Tasks and intoxication findings= Short- term memory is commonly tested with visual tasks. Short-term memory, especially for non-verbal and spatial material, are impaired by intoxication. Alcohol decreases iconic memory (a type of visual short-term memory). With BACs between 80‚Äì84 mg/dl, more intrusion errors occur in a delayed recall task compared to a control group. Intrusion errors, which represent reflective cognitive functioning, occur when irrelevant information is produced. Alcoholics have less control of inhibiting intrusions. Acute alcohol intoxication in social drinkers caused more intrusion errors in delayed recall tasks than in immediate free recall tasks. Acute alcohol intoxication increases the susceptibility to interference, which allows for more intrusion errors when there is a short delay. Free recall (given list of words then asked to recall list) is significantly lower and therefore impaired by alcohol intoxication. Encoding deficits were found in verbal free recall and recognition tasks under the influence of alcohol. A discrimination task found significant alcohol-related impairments both in depth perception and in visual short-term memory. State-dependent learning and relearning studies in male heavy drinkers demonstrate that the condition of intoxication while learning and sobriety when tested caused a performance deficit in free recall tasks. These findings are supportive of alcohol-induced storage deficits (not retrieval deficits). The effects of acute alcohol consumption on visual short- term memory, stereoscopic depth perception, and attention were all studied. A 33% alcohol condition showed significant impairments both in depth perception and in visual short-term memory (assessed by the vernier discrimination task). Working Memory Model. Alcohol intoxication can disrupt rehearsal strategies which may involve the phonological loop and/or the visuospatial sketchpad. Effects on working memory Working memory allows one to keep things in mind while simultaneously performing complex tasks. It involves a system for both the temporary storage and the manipulation of information, subsequently forming a crucial link between perception and controlled action.Baddeley, A. (1998) Comptes Rendus de l'Acad√©mie des Sciences ‚Äì S√©rie III, 321(2-3), 167-173. Evidence suggests that working memory involves three components: the central executive which controls attention, the visuo-spatial sketchpad which holds and manipulates spatial information, and the phonological loop which performs a similar function for auditory and speech-based information. =In the short term= Alcohol consumption has substantial, measurable effects on working memory, although these effects vary greatly between individual responses. Not much is really known about the neural mechanisms that underlie these individual differences.Paulus, Martin P, Tapert, Susan F, Pulido, Carmen, & Schuckit, Marc A. (2006). Alcohol attenuates load-related activation during a working memory task: Relation to level of response to alcohol. Dept of Psychiatry, University of California. PP 2 It is also found that alcohol impairs working memory by affecting mnemonic strategies and executive processes rather than by shrinking the basic holding capacity of working memory. Isolated acute-moderate levels of alcohol intoxication do not physically alter the structures that are critical for working memory function, such as the frontal cortex, the parietal cortex, the anterior cingulate, and parts of the basal ganglia. One finding regarding the effects of alcohol on working memory points out that alcohol reduces working memory only in individuals with a high baseline working memory capacity, which suggests that alcohol might not uniformly affect working memory in many different individuals. Alcohol appears to impair the capacity of working memory to modulate response inhibition. Alcohol disinhibits behaviour, but it only does so in individuals with a low baseline working memory capacity. An interesting finding is that the incentive to perform well with working memory measurement tasks while under the influence of alcohol 'does, in fact, have some effect on working memory, as it boosts scores in the rate of mental scanning and reaction time to stimulus; however, it did not reduce the number of errors as opposed to subjects with no incentive to perform well.Grattan-Miscio, K.E. and Vogel-Sprott, M. (2005) Effects of alcohol and performance incentives on immediate working memory. Springer Berlin / Heidelberg, 188-196 Even acute alcohol intoxication (a blood alcohol concentration of 0.08-0.09%) produces a substantial impairment of working memory processes that require mnemonic rehearsal strategies. It is less likely for alcohol to impair a working memory task that does not rely on memory rehearsal or associated mnemonic strategies. Because of this, working memory is very susceptible to falter when an individual participates in tasks involving retention concerning both auditory and visual sequences. An interesting example of this is the failure of guitarists or other musicians performing concerts to cue in on auditory patterns and make it known that their performance is hindered by intoxication, whereas professional basketball (a less sequence-heavy activity for working memory) standout Ron Artest recently admitted in an interview with Sporting News to drinking heavily during half-time early in his career and the fact that it had little ‚Äî if not any recognizable ‚Äî effect on his working memory. His former coach Fran Fraschilla has gone on record saying: =In the long term= Alcohol has been shown to have just some long-term effects on working memory. Findings have shown that in order for working memory to be substantially affected, long-term heavy drinking must be sustained over a long period of time, as up to one drink per day does not impair any cognitive function and may actually decrease the risk of a cognitive decline. Furthermore, chronic alcoholism is associated with the impairment in both sustained attention and visual working memory. As a result, alcoholics have reduced ability, but not necessarily inability, to perform these executive tasks. This is assumed to be subserved by regions of the prefrontal cortex. While it may not serve as a surprise that chronic alcoholism is linked to any decreased cognitive function such as working memory, one surprising finding is not only that even moderate levels of alcohol consumption during pregnancy were shown to have an adverse effect on the child's working memory when tested at 7.5 years of age, but also that working memory may be the most important aspect of attention that is adversely affected by prenatal alcohol exposure. Prospective memory Prospective memory involves remembering to carry out an intended action in the future without an explicit reminder. Alcohol has been found to impair this ability. Chronic heavy alcohol users report significantly more prospective forgetting compared to low-dose and alcohol-free controls. The Prospective Memory Questionnaire assesses short-term habitual prospective memory, long-term episodic prospective memory, and internally cued prospective memory. Chronic heavy alcohol users reported significantly greater deficits for all three aspects of prospective memory. Individuals that report heavy alcohol use report 24% more difficulties with prospective memory than those who report that they are light drinkers and 30% more difficulties than those who report that they never drink. The effects of alcohol on prospective memory can also be assessed in the laboratory by simulating prospective memory tasks that individuals face in everyday life. Individuals who are given 0.6 g/kg alcohol prior to performing prospective memory tasks do significantly poorer than a placebo group. Alcohol can damage the prefrontal and frontal areas of the brain, and this may be responsible for prospective memory impairments since prospective memory performance is highly correlated with frontal executive functions. In popular culture The memory inhibiting effects of alcohol are often a prominent topic in popular culture. It appears in movies, books, and television shows. Several movies show characters drinking alcohol to the point of memory loss and awakening the next morning with a host of problems due to actions they performed while intoxicated. One example is The Hangover, where three groomsmen lose the groom during a bachelor party in Las Vegas, so they retrace their steps to find him.\\"The Hangover\\" (2009). Retrieved from https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1119646/. The characters still had functioning implicit/procedural memory, which allowed them to carry out the many acts they performed that night, but their episodic memory was impaired and thus they had no recollection of the events occurring. In addition to alcohol the characters were also under the influence of flunitrazepam. Another movie is What Happens in Vegas. After an intoxicated night in \\"Sin City,\\" two people wake-up to find they got married.\\"What Happens in Vegas\\" (2008). Retrieved from https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1033643/plotsummary.

Retrieved from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f27zNlmRMWU also depict characters waking up and not remembering the night before due to alcohol consumption. By some accounts, popular culture makes light of the memory problems that can result from alcohol consumption. The court case R. v. Daviault [1994] concerned the viability of a legal defense based on intoxication. Law and Order: Special Victims Unit; in season 11 episode 4, Hammered, a recovering alcoholic was coerced to drink by a business partner and later wakes up to a dead woman in his bed.

The Fly Casting Analyzer is a unique system that measures the casting stroke of an individual casting a fly line with a fly rod. A sensor attached to the reel seat measures your rod speed and a Palm pilot (or Palm cell phone) then records the casting signature. A Palm application immediately analyzes the casting signature by breaking it down into its major parts. By systematically measuring and analyzing fly rod motions that cannot easily be resolved by eye, the Fly Casting Analyzer provides new capabilities for teaching and learning fly casting. How it works Complete casting signature The analyzer measures the most important part of a fly cast, rod rotation, which is the rod angle change during casting. This is the only motion that is necessary to make a fly cast. How the rod rotates, acceleration, speed, deceleration largely determine the quality of a cast. If this motion isn't done well, an efficient, effective cast cannot be made. A small rate gyro is enclosed in a capsule that is attached to the fly rod. Rate gyros measure angular rotation. The signal from the rate gyro is transferred via cable to a small data collection box that is held or clipped to the caster or instructor. A Palm Pilot is attached to the box and data collected in transferred to the Palm via infrared beaming. The proprietary software installed on the Palm crunches the data, turning it into a casting signature that reveals many things about rod rotation. Commercialized In 2005, Richards and Perkins commercialized the Fly Casting Analyzer with the formation of Castanalysis, LLC in partnership with Sage Fly Fishing. In 2005, Noel Perkins won the ispo-TUM Academic Challenge Award for the Fly Casting Analyzer. In 2006, the Fly Casting Analyzer was awarded an Editor's Choice Award by Fly Fish America.

Trained as a pianist, he became one of the first Canadians to compose large-scale choral and orchestral works, in spite of the difficulty of finding suitable teachers of musical composition. His younger years were spent mostly in teaching, family, and work as a church organist, and many of his compositions were written later in life. Early life Contant was born in Montreal, the son of two amateur musicians. His father was a violinist who was involved in a number of community ensembles and his mother was a piano and voice student of Emma Albani. His younger siblings, Marie and Joseph-Albert, also became musicians. All three children had their initial musical lessons from their mother. At the age of 11, Contant became a pupil of organist and pianist Joseph-A. Fowler and two years later gave his first public recital. At the age of 17 he became a student of Calixa Lavall√©e, who had just returned from Paris. Contant himself wanted to pursue studies in Europe, but his father forbade him to go in fear that European society might be detrimental to Alexis's religious faith. Career Contant spent his late teenage years and early twenties working as an accompanist for a variety of artists, including violinist Frantz Jehin- Prume. He took a post teaching at the Coll√®ge de L'Assomption in 1880‚Äì1881. In 1883 he traveled with Lavall√©e to Boston where he was able to pursue intense studies with his teacher in music composition, harmony, and counterpoint. While there he also had the opportunity to attend operas for the first time and went to many orchestral concerts and recitals. He was particularly moved by a concert of Charles Gounod's La R√©demption. During the trip, Lavall√©e became ill and Contant was asked to substitute for his teacher in several concerts, which gave him attacks of severe stage fright. These attacks led him to decide to abandon a performance career in favor of composition, teaching, and the organ for church work. Upon returning to Montreal in June 1883, Contant became a pupil of organist and composer Guillaume Couture, but the two did not get along well and he soon left. He pursued studies in composition on his own by analyzing the scores of the works by composers Bach, Mozart, Wagner, Massenet, and Franck among others. He joined the faculty at the Coll√®ge de Montr√©al, teaching there until 1890. In 1885 Contant took a post as organist at St-Jean-Baptiste Church in Montreal, a position he held until his death more than thirty years later. From 1900 to 1918 he taught at Mont-St- Louis College and from 1905 to 1917 he taught at the Conservatoire national de musique. He also ran a private studio in his home. Among his notable pupils were Victor Brault, Claude Champagne, Orpha-F. Deveaux, J.-J. Gagnier, Rodolphe Mathieu and Wilfrid Pelletier. His daughter Fleurette was a concert singer and music teacher and his grandson Jean-Yves Contant worked as a producer for CBC Radio from 1938-1979. His other daughter, Aline, was married to the painter Georges Delfosse. In 1914 he suffered a paralytic stroke which severely limited his mobility. This virtually ended his activity as a composer.\\"Alexis Contant\\". The Canadian Encyclopedia. After his death in 1918, he was entombed at the Notre Dame des Neiges Cemetery in Montreal. Compositions Contant's compositional output was minimal before 1900. As his children grew older, he was able to devote more time to composition and therefore his later life was his most productive. Contant's compositional output includes several symphonic works and works for chorus and orchestra, works for chorus with organ accompaniment, a small body of chamber music, and several pieces for solo piano and solo organ. His works were published in Paris by Hamelle, Haussman, and L. Grus and in Montreal by Archambault, Beauchemin, Joseph-√âmile B√©lair, A.J. Boucher, L. Cardinal, √âdition Belgo- Canadienne, and J.-G. Yon and in Le Passe-Temps. The Canadian Encyclopedia states that, \\"Contant was a pioneer whose vision was on a large scale, and although the results of his efforts do not equal his ambitions, he displays a sincerity and honesty worthy of admiration.\\" One of Contant's first pieces to be widely played in both Canada and Europe was La Lyre enchant√©e (1875), a 'fantaisie-nocturne' for piano. His third mass was premiered in February 1903 at the Monument national in a performance conducted by Edmond Hardy. Also premiered at the Monument-National was his Ca√Øn in November 1905; it was one of the first oratorios written by a Canadian composer. He wrote a second oratorio, Les Deux √Çmes, which was composed between 1905 and 1909 but did not premiere until 1913. His Trio for violin, cello and piano is the most often performed of his major works. After a stroke in 1914 he composed only one more song, Sur Un Crucifix to a poem by Albert Lozeau.

ASW is an acronym for Anti-Submarine Warfare. In January 2018 after successful sea trials it was announced that the \\"Sea Hunter\\" prototype has transitioned from DARPA to the Office of Naval Research for further development. While the ACTUV program is focused on demonstrating the ASW tracking capability the core platform and autonomy technologies are broadly extendable to underpin a wide range of missions and configurations for future unmanned naval vessels. The ACTUV will be \\"a first unmanned naval vessel that is designed and sized for theater or global independent deployment\\". The aim of the four part program is to develop a surface vessel optimized to overtly track and trail target submarines. A suite of sensors \\"capable of tracking quiet, modern diesel electric submarines\\" will be implemented into the completely unmanned vessel. ACTUV will operate under minimal supervisory command and control; with shore bases intermittently monitoring performance and providing high-level mission objectives through beyond line-of-sight communications links. The vessel will be provided with advanced autonomous navigation and anti collision features to keep it within maritime law and the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea. History In September 2014, DARPA signed a Memorandum of Agreement with the Office of Naval Research (ONR) to jointly fund the ACTUV prototype. In March 2015 it was stated if the program was successful it could transition to the U.S. Navy for ASW by 2018, and possibly other missions such as mine countermeasures.Wanted: Technologies to Enable Automated Lookouts for Unmanned Surface Vessels - Darpa.mil, 26 March 2015 Concept of operations The ACTUV is aimed at improving the ability to detect and engage diesel- electric submarines, which are inexpensive and quieter in comparison to nuclear-powered submarines, and to negate the threat of adversaries building large numbers by creating anti-submarine tactics at one-tenth the cost of building a diesel submarine. Areas of operation are focused on littoral waters. The craft will be an unmanned surface vehicle (USV) designed to operate and patrol autonomously for 60‚Äì90 days straight, being able to hunt for targets and avoid surface ships by itself. It will operate alongside other naval assets including the P-8 Poseidon, MQ-4C Triton, and sonobuoy sensors as a forward deployed and rapid-response node in the global maritime surveillance network.Here‚Äôs How Darpa‚Äôs Robot Ship Will Hunt Silent Subs - Wired.com, 27 December 2012Autonomous ASW: The Predator Becoming a Prey - Defense- Update.com, 1 January 2013 Once a wide-area sensor provides an initial indication of a possible target, the forward deployed ACTUV will then rapidly \\"sprint\\" to the area and use its own sensors to assess the contact. First, two side pods with long-range acquisition mid-frequency active-passive sonar will verify the presence of a submarine and identify the area of uncertainty (AOU) affected by the threat to limit close surface ships' movement. Second, two higher frequency sonars in the main hull will improve tracking precision and mission reliability. Once in close proximity, total field magnetometer arrays will provide additional information about target activity to continuously track it. Finally, very high frequency sonar will produce an \\"acoustic image\\" of the target to identify and classify the specific submarine. The ACTUV is to be in constant contact with other ships and aircraft through a satellite link; if a contact is determined to not be threatening, a sailor can order the vessel go back on patrol. The craft itself is unarmed, so if an enemy submarine is detected it will notify other naval assets that can attack and destroy it. If deemed not a threat, the craft can still shadow the submarine to deter it from acting aggressively, potentially even back to its home port. The ACTUV is designed to out-endure any diesel-electric submarine, even those equipped with Air Independent Propulsion (AIP). Using large numbers of inexpensive unmanned ACTUVs is a way to counter submarines as an undersea component of anti-access warfare. Some countries use \\"competitive strategies\\" to create cheap weaponry, hardware, and methods to impose on their adversaries a situation where they would need to incur costs of developing countermeasures that are disproportionately higher than the defenses they would be used against. The goal is to make the adversary decide the competition is unaffordable, or force them to redirect resources from other priorities. Countries building cheap diesel-electric submarines as anti-access components would be subjected to the same cost-benefit considerations they are trying to impose, as the U.S. Navy would be equipped with an even cheaper anti-submarine detection system.Move, Countermove in the Anti-Access Game - Thediplomat.com, 2 January 2013 In order to comply with International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGS), the ACTUV has to autonomously identify other surface ships at sea. Radar is the primary way to sense other ships, but it is not able to classify them. To augment radar, as well as reduce reliance on it, DARPA released a Request for Information (RFI) in March 2015 for other sensors for the ACTUV to perceive and classify nearby ships and other objects. Expected sensor systems and image-processing hardware and software include passive electro-optical/infrared (EO/IR) or non-radar active (LIDAR) technologies. Construction After making Broad Agency Announcement (BAA),ASW Continuous Trail Unmanned Vessel (ACTUV), Phase 1, Fbo.gov DARPA allowed the national security, health, and engineering company Leidos to go forward with the ACTUV program in February 2014. Using a USV for submarine hunting is aimed to free up other surface ships from needing to spend time and money looking for them themselves. Leidos' model is an unmanned trimaran built out of carbon composites equipped with navigation and piloting sensors, electro-optics, and long and short range radar to be capable of tracking diesel submarines at extreme depths for months at a time. The vessel is able to report back on the situation and its condition, and has computers programmed to identify other vessels to anticipate what they will do next. It uses a modular design that can be refitted for other roles such as intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance missions.Construction begins on DARPA's autonomous unmanned anti-submarine vessel - Gizmag.com, 16 July 2014 Leidos announced on 18 November 2014 that a test vessel fitted with autonomy software and sensors to mimic the configuration of the ACTUV completed 42 days of at-sea demonstrations to fulfill collision regulations (COLREGS). The surrogate vessel simulated scenarios where the ACTUV prototype would interact with an interfering vessel, navigating through narrow channels while avoiding obstructions and other surface ships autonomously in completely unscripted events. Follow-on testing will involve multiple interfering contacts and adversarial behaviors of interfering vessels.Leidos Completes At-Sea Testing of Prototype Maritime Autonomy System - PRNewswire.com, 18 November 2014 The company announced on 26 January 2015 that the ACTUV autonomy software had been successfully tested off the coast of Mississippi to test sensor, maneuvering, and mission functions. Installed on a work boat, the autonomy system navigated the complicated inshore environment of the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway using only a pre-loaded navigational chart and inputs from commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) radars. The surrogate vessel traveled while avoiding all obstacles, buoys, land, shoal water, and other vessels without pre-planned waypoints or human intervention. The first ACTUV, named Sea Hunter, was scheduled to launch in late fall 2015 and begin testing in the Columbia River.Leidos Prototype Maritime System Completes First Self-Guided Voyage - PRNewswire.com, 26 January 2015 By late October 2015, building of the ACTUV was 90 percent complete, with the hardware of the systems finished and the software being engineered. Testing of the command-and-control and navigation systems to enable the unmanned boat to operate safely in compliance with maritime safety standards \\"generally meets expectations.\\" The vessel is long, weighs 140 tons, and is expected to cost $15,000‚Äì20,000 to operate per day, compared to $700,000 per day for a destroyer. Advantages of the vessel over ship-launched USVs are that it has greater payload and endurance, and it can launch and recover at a pier rather than needing integration with a manned ship.

The glowing side is the atmosphere lit up by the Sun's light energy and the oval of light is the aurora. During a substorm the auroral oval brightens in a localized area and then suddenly breaks into many different forms that expand both toward Earth's pole and equator. This is exactly what Shun-ichi Akasofu (1964) drew in his auroral substorm illustration. reconnection fronts. A substorm, sometimes referred to as a magnetospheric substorm or an auroral substorm, is a brief disturbance in the Earth's magnetosphere that causes energy to be released from the \\"tail\\" of the magnetosphere and injected into the high latitude ionosphere. Visually, a substorm is seen as a sudden brightening and increased movement of auroral arcs. Substorms were first described in qualitative terms by Kristian Birkeland out-of-print, full text online which he called polar elementary storms. Sydney Chapman used the term substorm about 1960 which is now the standard term. The morphology of aurora during a substorm was first described by Syun-Ichi Akasofu in 1964 using data collected during the International Geophysical Year. Substorms are distinct from geomagnetic storms in that the latter take place over a period of several days, are observable from anywhere on Earth, inject a large number of ions into the outer radiation belt, and occur once or twice a month during the maximum of the solar cycle and a few times a year during solar minimum. Substorms, on the other hand, take place over a period of a few hours, are observable primarily at the polar regions, do not inject many particles into the radiation belt, and are relatively frequent ‚Äî often occurring only a few hours apart from each other. Substorms can be more intense and occur more frequently during a geomagnetic storm when one substorm may start before the previous one has completed. The source of the magnetic disturbances observed at the Earth's surface during geomagnetic storms is the ring current, whereas the sources of magnetic disturbances observed on the ground during substorms are electric currents in the ionosphere at high latitudes. Substorms can cause magnetic field disturbances in the auroral zones up to a magnitude of 1000 nT, roughly 2% of the total magnetic field strength in that region. The disturbance is much greater in space, as some geosynchronous satellites have registered the magnetic field dropping to half of its normal strength during a substorm. The most visible indication of a substorm is an increase in the intensity and size of polar auroras. Substorms can be divided into three phases: the growth phase, the expansion phase, and the recovery phase. In 2012, the THEMIS satellite mission observed the dynamics of rapidly developing substorms, confirming the existence of giant magnetic ropes and witnessed small explosions in the outskirts of Earth's magnetic field.NASA Spacecraft Make New Discoveries About Northern Lights http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/themis/auroras/northern_lights.html References Category:Planetary science Category:Geomagnetism Category:Earth Category:Articles containing video clips ","title":"Substorm"},{"id":"26686447","text":"Lori Sims is an American pianist.

Early Years, Nazi Regime and World War II Juergen von Huendeberg was born April 10, 1922 in Dresden, into a family of Baltic Germans. Since early childhood, he lived in Munich, where he studied architecture and philosophy at the Munich University, two years at the Academy of Fine Arts Munich (1945‚Äì1947) and some time under Werner Gilles and Adolf Schinnerer. During the Nazi regime, as a young man, he was briefly attracted to the Hitler Youth but soon became disenchanted with them. Later he became friends with Kurt Huber, who nevertheless encouraged him not to actively join his resistance movement, knowing full well of the danger. As a person without a German passport, von Huendeberg was first not allowed to join in the war efforts; when later all German residents were required to join, a woman friend of his helped him remain undetected. This friend, a doctor much older than he was, also introduced him to morphine to help with his migraines; struggling with the use of opioids, prescription medicine and alcohol was to remain a lifelong effort of his. Post-War Period Von Huendeberg's very early paintings were along the lines of Magic Realism, a form of New Objectivity, an art movement that arose in Germany in the early 1920s as an outgrowth of, and in opposition to, expressionism. Soon, however, von Huendeberg's work became almost exclusively abstract. The qualifier ‚Äúalmost‚Äù is significant; there was no technique or form of expression that von Huendeberg ever excluded. In 1949, he became connected with ZEN 49, a group of German artists who strove to create new forms of expression for abstract art. The word Zen was to reflect their rejection of materiality and a focus on meditation; 49 refers to the year they were founded, four years after World War II. Von Huendeberg was friends with and exhibited with some of their members, for example Rupprecht Geiger and Brigitte Meier-Denninghoff in the Studio for New Art (Studio fuer Neue Kunst) in Wuppertal. Von Huendeberg never became an outright member of the group, a sign even back then of his almost renegade refusal to be anyone but himself, to be a member of any group but humanity. Significantly, he also never became a German citizen, proud to his death of the fact that he never had any citizenship (his parents, after being displaced after World War I, held the Nansen passport. This connection to peaceful internationalism was always important to him). Art critic Franz Roh, one of whose books features a painting by von Huendeberg on the front cover, once spoke of visual art immediately after World War II as containing ‚Äúthe demonic, praised by Goethe as most deep [which] hints at our existential loneliness vis-a-vis the universe ‚Äì or in the face of a truly inner and productive way of life.‚Äù Von Huendeberg's art, which often features dark, almost ominous colours pierced by small patches of deep, shining light, was sometimes interpreted as depressing; Roh's description as ‚Äúdemonic‚Äù, which hints, as well, to von Huendeberg's mystic qualities, may be more apt. Abstract Art: Colour Without Form Von Huendeberg made much use of the colour gold. Art critic John Anthony Thwaites pointed to von Huendeberg's Russian-Baltic heritage and the golden background used in Russian icons. Art historian Ivo Kranzfelder describes how in his oil paintings, von Huendeberg created a feeling of space by juxtaposing broad planes of colour in almost perspectival arrangements. This depth was underscored by experimenting with adding structure through the use of materials such as sackcloth and sand, thickly textured paint and even incorporating paint tube caps into the painting. The topic of \\"colour without form\\" was always on his mind. Collages were a natural extension of these techniques. Just as his paintings often have a sculpted feeling, his collages always evoke the pictorial. A collage consisting of chains and jewels decorating Jesus on the cross points back to the iconic. Agnosticism and Psychoanalysis Deeply mystic in his art, von Huendeberg was, however, staunchly rational about religion, a fierce agnostic firmly rooted in the tradition of humanism and the Enlightenment. Partly, his agnostic stand was connected to his interest in and involvement with psychoanalysis. His friendships with various prominent Munich psychoanalysts were an important source of inspiration to him. Von Huendeberg's combination of mysticism and commitment to the rational, paired with his unbridled irreverence, a constant drive to explore new ideas, a steadfast refusal to be categorized, as well as playful irony in close companionship with serious craftsmanship, confused and irritated more than one critic. The Success Years Von Huendeberg enjoyed success for quite some years. His were the first two abstract paintings bought by the House of Art (Haus der Kunst), Munich's main museum for modern art. 1956 he received a cultural scholarship from the German Industry Association, 1957 he was invited to the Premio Lissone, 1962 he won the Seerosen-Preis (Lotus Prize) together with Edgar Ende and three other artists. His paintings were shown in Italy, Canada, the US and New Zealand. There were numerous exhibitions in Germany, including one with a close artist friend, Helmut Berninger. Disenchantment With The Visual Arts Scene and Other Artistic Endeavours From the mid-1960s on, von Huendeberg lost interest in exhibitions and the visual arts scene and his public life as an artist concentrated on experimental theatre, film and music. Nevertheless, he still worked as a painter, for example when experimenting with etchings with fellow artist Otto Mirtl. The fumes from performing this in an unventilated chamber, combined with his liberal use of alcohol, almost killed him, leaving him in a liver coma for three weeks, which he miraculously survived. Shortly before his hospitalization, he starred in a slide/theatre play as Oblomov, a Russian nobleman full of fabulous ideas but lacking the ability to make any decisions whatsoever. This play, adapted by one of his many prot√©g√©s, the then young and unknown Franz Xaver Kroetz, mirrored much of who von Huendeberg was ‚Äì a brilliant artist who at times was incapable of leaving the house for years on end, haunted by depression and addiction. For years, von Huendeberg also worked closely with avantgarde theatre artists Alexeij Sagerer and Cornelie Mueller and had friendships with film personalities such as Rainer Werner Fassbinder and Klaus Kinski. More Than Just a Post-War Curiosity In art circles, Juergen von Huendeberg is usually discussed in connection with the avantgarde of the 1950s and 1960s. But as art historian Ivo Kranzfelder states, it would be a great mistake to see him only as a historical phenomenon. While his charcoal drawings and oil paintings from this time are important, his erotic drawings and watercolours, experimentations with markers and spray paint and hundreds of acrylic gouaches where he doggedly pursued the exploration of spherical shapes and even his landscape sketches and portraits show a never ending variety and growth in his artistic expression. Shortly before his death, he only seemingly returned to his roots, painting in oil once again generous geometric shapes, mostly in earth tones, always illuminating his paintings with his trademark brilliant light effects. However, this return was an evolution, on a higher level of Goethe's spiral of growth that von Huendeberg liked to cite frequently. Personal Data Von Huendeberg died on August 21, 1996 of pancreatic cancer, meeting his death with the same conscious, curious and nonchalant eyes that saw and depicted all of his life. He was married to Elisabeth, n√©e Hennighaussen, a music librarian. They had three children, Nikolaus (1953‚Äì1954), Isabella (born 1955) and Clarissa (born 1961).

It was noted that there had been significant advances in the process of national reconciliation, but there was concern at delays in fully implementing parts of the peace accords. In this context an agreement to implement the most important parts of the accords by the parties was welcomed. The Council welcomed that the elections were held in a free, fair and secure environment. All parties were called upon to co- operate with the Secretary-General and ONUSAL to implement the remaining parts of the peace accords, requesting that the Secretary-General report to the Council by 31 August 1994 on the progress made in implementation. In particular, progress had to be made on the police and public security provisions of the accords with regard to demobilisation and enhancing the character of the National Civil Police.

History =1991‚Äì2002= During the 1990s the central body for conducting national security was Office for the Protection of Constitutional Order (Ured za za≈°titu ustavnog poretka-UZPU) which was established by the President Franjo Tuƒëman on May 27, 1991. UZUP was decommissioned on March 21, 1993 when the National Security Office (Ured za nacionalnu sigurnost-UNS) was established by the second President's decision. UNS was put into the legal framework on May 17, 1995 by the enactment of the Law on the National Security Office (Zakon o uredu za nacionalnu sigurnost). Goals and tasks of the intelligence community in Croatia were also determined by the Joint National Security Committee (Sto≈æerni odbor nacionalne sigurnosti-SONS) and the Intelligence Community Coordination Committee (Koordinacijski odbor obavje≈°tajne zajednice-KOOZ). The task of SONS was directed and coordinated by the work of government ministries in matters of national security, while KOOZ was responsible for the implementation of tasks received from SONS. The core of the intelligence community consisted of four departments that were involved in intelligence work: *Croatian Intelligence Service (Hrvatska izvje≈°tajna slu≈æba-HIS) *Service for the Protection of the Constitutional Order of the Ministry of Interior (Slu≈æba za za≈°titu ustavnog poretka Ministarstva unutarnjih poslova RH-SZUP) *Security Intelligence Service of the Ministry of Defense (Sigurnosno-informativna slu≈æba Ministarstva obrane RH-SIS) *Intelligence Directorate of the General Staff of the Armed Forces (Obavje≈°tajna uprava Glavnog sto≈æera Oru≈æanih snaga RH-ObU GSOSRH) Croatian President was giving guidelines for the work of UNS and the Croatian intelligence community. The director of UNS and state ministers were determining tasks of the services for which they were responsible. KOOZ was preparing the annual plan of the intelligence community which consisted of projects and operative actions in which performance had to be attend by two or more services. SONS was approving the annual work plan of the intelligence community and supervised its execution. Apart from the above-mentioned UNS and other agencies, a wider range of security system consisted of the criminal police, military police, customs service, the financial police, whose representatives could call the session of KOOZ. =2002‚Äì2006= In 2002 Croatian Parliament passed a Law on Security Services of the Republic of Croatia (Zakon o sigurnosnim slu≈æbama Republike Hrvatske) and the National Security Strategy of the Republic of Croatia (Strategija nacionalne sigurnosti Republike Hrvatske). The law established three security services: *Intelligence Agency (Obavje≈°tajana agencija-OA) *Counterintelligence Agency (Protuobavje≈°tajna agencija-POA) *Military Security Agency (Vojna sigurnosna agencija-VSA) In order to achieve cooperation between the President and the Croatian Government in guiding the work of the security services as well as to harmonize the operational work of the security services, the Council for National Security (Vijeƒáe za nacionalnu sigurnost) established the Council for Coordination of Security Agencies (Savjet za koordinaciju sigurnosnih slu≈æbi). Special Office of the Council for National Security (Ured Vijeƒáa za nacionalnu sigurnost) was established to perform professional and administrative work for the National Security Council and the Council for Coordination of Security Agencies. =2006‚Äì= Security and intelligence system in Croatia was reformed in mid-2006 by adopting the Law on Security and Intelligence System (Zakon o sigurnosno-obavje≈°tajnom sustavu). The law established two security services that are still active today: *Security and Intelligence Agency (Sigurnosno-obavje≈°tajna agencija- SOA) *Military Security and Intelligence Agency ( Vojna sigurnosno- obavje≈°tajna agencija-VSOA). Working Areas SOA is focused on prevention of activities or actions undertaken to endanger the constitutional order, endangering the security of state bodies, citizens and national interests by: * terrorism and other forms of organized violence, * intelligence activities of foreign intelligence agencies, organizations and individuals, * extremist organization and activities of groups and individuals, * endangering the safety of the highest state officials and protected facilities and space, * organized and economic crime, * unauthorized access to protected information and communication systems of government bodies, * disclosure of classified information by heads and employees of state bodies, scientific institutions and legal persons with public authority, * other activities aimed at threatening national security. SOA gathers, analyzes, processes and evaluates data of political, economic, scientific-technological, security and nature pertaining to the state, organizations, political and economic alliances, groups and people, particularly those who indicate intentions, capabilities, plans and hidden secret activities threatening national security, or data that is of importance to national security of the Republic of Croatia.

Published in Posthumous Poems, 1824.\\"One Word Is Too Often Profaned\\" is a poem by Percy Bysshe Shelley, written in 1822 and published in 1824 (see 1822 in poetry). Background The poem was intended for Jane Williams. It expresses Shelley's deep and genuine devotion for her. Shelley met Jane Williams and her lover, Edward Ellerker Williams in Pisa sometime in 1821. The Williams befriended Percy Bysshe and Mary Shelley and they all frequently met Lord Byron who also lived in Pisa at that time. Shelley developed a very strong affection towards Jane Williams and addressed a number of poems to her. In most of these poems, Shelley projects his love for Jane in a spiritual and devotional manner. This poem is an example of that. Shelley's affection towards Jane was known to Edward Williams and also to Mary Shelley. But since Shelley always projected this relationship in a platonic manner, Williams and Mary Shelley were not afflicted by jealousy regarding this relationship. In fact, Mary Shelley was quite fond of Jane and Edward Williams and Shelley enjoyed Edward's company too. Shelley and Edward Williams drowned while on a boating trip on 8 July, 1822. Shelley wrote a number of poems devoted to Jane including With a Guitar, To Jane, One Word is Too Often Profaned, To Jane: The Invitation, To Jane: The Recollection and To Jane: The Keen Stars Were Twinkling. In One Word is Too Often Profaned, Shelley rejects the use of the word Love to describe his relationship with Jane. He says that this word has been so often profaned or misused that he will not use it to describe this relationship. He then goes on to say that the usage of this word may be rejected by Jane herself and that his feelings for her are too pure to be falsely disdained. He uses the word pity and states that the feeling of pity from Jane is more dear than love from any other woman. At this point he starts elevating Jane's stature to something larger than other women of the world. Shelley chooses to employ the word worship to describe his devotion towards Jane. He states that the feeling of worship that he feels towards Jane is something that is uplifting and is also moral (and the heavens reject not). He describes the nature of his devotion: it is the devotion of a moth for a star or what the night feels towards the next morning. He describes his devotion as something that lies beyond worldly existence and strife (the sphere of our sorrow). Shelley uses the sentence I can give not what men call love which shows that he himself is not averse to the use of the word love but because it has been misused often by men everywhere to describe ordinary and worldly feelings, he will not use this word for Jane. The metrical feet used in the poem are a mixture of anapests and iambs. The first line of each couplet contains three accents and the second line contains two. This poem has at times been printed with the titles To --- and Love. The poem was published in London in 1824 in the collection Posthumous Poems of Percy Bysshe Shelley by John and Henry L. Hunt.

She questioned whether the current hedonism and culture of drug abuse will produce healthy societies. In the book, she states that the level of ethnic clashes, racial divide and dramatic break-down of the family weakens the West. In 2018, her Norwegian book Det nye Babylon. Hvordan Vesten mistet sin storhet analyses the cultural downfall, focusing on Scandinavia. Herland asserts that the values that kept nations united, such as empathy and solidarity now are disintegrating into a culture of selfishness. In 2019, she co-edited Nature's paradise of Smola, Norway, in which one of the world's leading photographers, Audun Lie Dahl and others contributed with photographs from the Smola region in Norway. In 2020, Herland published New Left Tyranny. The Authoritarian destruction of our Way of Life. It argues that the neo-Marxist New Left created a dysfunctional society by abandoning the working class and attacking traditional values. As a consequence, social cohesion dissolved into selfishness and a lack of personal responsibility. Western societies have been fragmentized into hate politics and are dissolving like a tower of Babel.

They were largely centered in Clear Creek and German Townships and their population, as well as that of the county itself, peaked in 1895. Because they remained independents they were a political force in the county and decided many county elections. with Both townships founded Catholic parishes in the 1850s. Catholics in Clear Creek Township purchased of land in 1857 for a Catholic church and cemetery. The parish was served by itinerant priests who would visit occasionally. The first Mass was celebrated in the log structure on the property in 1859, and the parish was organized in 1860. The parish started its first church building built of brick in 1863, which was dedicated to the apostles Peter and Paul. The old log church was used for a school until 1875 when the first school building was erected. A rectory was built between 1893 and 1894 for a resident priest. The Sisters of St. Francis of Assisi from Milwaukee taught in the parish school from 1895-1902. During this time plans for the current church structure were made. Ferdinand S. Borgolte from Rock Island, Illinois was chosen as the architect, and Harry Schroeder of Washington, Iowa as the contractor.the Hammes family also played a role in the construction, The bricks were produced by Fuller & Schumacher of Muscatine, Iowa. The cornerstone was laid on June 8, 1898, by Bishop Henry Cosgrove of Davenport. The church building was dedicated on April 18, 1899, and was built for about $10,000. In 1902 the Sisters of the Most Precious Blood taught in the school for a few months before lay teachers took over. The following year the School Sisters of St. Francis from Milwaukee came to teach in the school. A new school building with living quarters for the sisters was built in 1906. A new rectory was built in 1911. It was destroyed by a fire in 1930 when the present structure was built. Rectory Two of the three bells were placed in the tower in 1907. The larger of the two bells weighs and cost $566. The smaller bell weighs and cost $290. The German language was used until World War I for sermons and church services, when Latin was not used. Anti- German sentiment brought its use to an end. The cemetery's decorative fence was added in 1919 as a thanksgiving offering for the survival of all eighteen of the parish's servicemen in World War I and the lack of any deaths in the 1918 flu pandemic. The parish was one of fourteen in the Ottumwa Deanery that formed the Notre Dame Catholic Youth Organization in 1948. It provided social and other contacts for youth in the area. Lightning struck the church's bell tower in 1950 and set it on fire. The damage was minimal. In 1963 a parish hall was created in the basement of the church. The parish school had 48 students in the 1966-67 school year. Because of the small number the sisters withdrew from the parish and the school closed. Ten years later the parish voted to join the Keota-Harper Catholic School System. During the pastorate of the Rev. John Hebenstreit (1969-1979) the parish council was established. He ended up being the parish's last resident pastor. Saints Peter and Paul began to share a pastor, the Rev. Robert McAleer, with St. Elizabeth's in the town of Harper. In 1983 the school building was torn down. St. Mary's parish in Keota was added to the parish cluster when the Rev. H. Robert Harness was the pastor in 1988. The three parishes were officially dissolved on July 1, 1992 when they formed Holy Trinity parish. All three church buildings were initially used by the parish. As the number of Catholics in the area and the number of priests to serve the diocese continued to decline, the decision was made to cluster Holy Trinity parish with St. Mary's parish in Sigourney. At the same time, it was decided to close Saints Peter and Paul Church. The last regularly scheduled Mass in the church was celebrated on June 25, 2006, by the Rev. Marty Goetz who had been pastor since 2001. On June 13, 2009 Bishop Martin Amos approved the sale of the church building to the Clear Creek Heritage Association. Architecture View of the church from the west. Saints Peter and Paul Church is a structure. The building is Victorian Gothic in style and constructed in two-tone orange brick laid in a common bond. The upper portion of the exterior walls are a darker shade than the lower portion because there was an insufficient amount of brick fired originally. The foundation is locally quarried rock-faced stone. There is a central entrance tower, which rises , and was the tallest structure in Keokuk County when it was built. The exterior features decorative brickwork pilasters and a mock cornice with denticulation. Two sacristies are located on either side of the apse. The building contains period stained glass windows and has wood carved altars and pews. The 14 stained glass windows in the nave and the apse were donated by parish families and they portray various saints. Donor's names are inscribed below. The altars are hand carved walnut with gold leaf trim. The work is attributed to Nickolas Juhl of Davenport. Juhl, a German-born Jew, was an accomplished woodcarver who carved the altars for several of Davenport's Catholic churches. Notes References *Peiffer, Rev. N.J. (1935). History of Ss.

He belonged to the Rinpungpa family and headed the central government in N√™dong during the minority of the heir of the Phagmodrupa Dynasty. Rinpungpa ascendency Tsokye Dorje was the fourth son of Norzang, who founded the fortunes of the Rinpungpa in 1435.Thus he was not the brother of Norzang as sometimes alleged; see Giuseppe Tucci, Tibetan Painted Scrolls. Rome 1949, Vol. II, p. 642. From this time the family dominated political life in the Tsang region (West Central Tibet) at the expense of the Phagmodrupa kings who resided in N√™dong in √ú (East Central Tibet). When Norzang died in 1466, his second son Kunzang took over the leadership of the family, while Tsokye Dorje received the fief Khartog in the Yarlung Valley area.Giuseppe Tucci, Deb T'er Dmar Po Gsar Ma. Rome 1971, p. 223; Giuseppe Tucci, 1949, Vol. II, p. 642. The direct influence of the Phagmodrupa was on the wane, and in 1481 one of their line was deposed by his ministers after a Rinpungpa attack. The next ruler Ngagi Wangpo had a short and turbulent reign, and when he died in 1491 his son Ngawang Tashi Drakpa was only a boy of three. It was then decided to appoint Tsokye Dorje of the Rinpungpa as regent during his minority.Tsepon W.D. Shakabpa, Tibet. A Political History. Yale 1967, p. 87-8. At this time the chief of the Rinpungpa faction was Tsokye Dorje's nephew Donyo Dorje (1463‚Äì1512). Internal feuding In spite of the position of Rinpungpa kinsmen in both Tsang and √ú, the political turmoil in Central Tibet continued. In 1492 Donyo Dorje invaded √ú and captured three districts. In 1498 he captured Lhasa where his forces maintained Rinpungpa power until 1517. The Rinpungpa were intimately allied to the Karmapa sect. The Gelugpa monks of Drepung and Sera were therefore impeded from celebrating the annual Monlam festival during the occupation of Lhasa.Tsepon W.D. Shakabpa, 1967, p. 88. Finally, in 1499, several officers under Donyo Dorje convened in N√™dong and decided to enthrone the Phagmodrupa heir Ngawang Tashi Drakpa. Tsokye Dorje appears to have handed over power without making trouble, and eventually died in 1510. He may have had an appeasing influence on political affairs, since his demise immediately triggered a violent conflict between Donyo Dorje and Ngawang Tashi Drakpa.Giuseppe Tucci, 1971, p. 229. A son of Tsokye Dorje, Ngawang Namgyal, later became the leader of the Rinpungpa faction.

The revolt unfolded ‚Äì 1826 in Ukraine between Kiev and Bila Tserkva. After the news of the rebels' defeat in Saint Petersburg reached Ukraine, the radical Decembrist officers incited the Chernigov infantry regiment against the government. The rebels marched from Trylisy north-east to Vasylkiv and reached one thousand men in strength. Uncertain about their strategy, rebel leaders camped in Motovilivka, while the government seized the initiative and mobilized its forces in pursuit. The rebels dropped their initial plans of taking over Kiev or Brusyliv and marched south to PolohyPolohy, Kyiv oblast and back to their starting point at Trylisy. Their retreat was checked by a 400-strong loyalist unit near Kovalivka. Demoralized rebel soldiers lost around 80 men to artillery fire and surrendered without resistance. According to Hugh Seton- Watson, it was \\"the first and the last political revolt by Army officers\\" in Russia: Nicholas I and his successors eradicated liberalism in the troops and secured their unconditional loyalty.Seton-Watson, pp. 196‚Äì197. Note emphasis on Army to differentiate it from the previous palace coups by the Imperial Guards. Background In 1820 the Semenovsky Regiment of the Imperial Guards was disbanded for a single incident of insubordination. Semyonovsky officers Alexander Vadkovsky, Mikhail Bestuzhev-Ryumin and others were demoted to the Army units stationed in Ukraine. In 1821 colonel Pavel Pestel, a radical member of a conspiracy ring now known as the Decembrists, was transferred to Tulchyn, Ukraine. Pestel and the Semyonovsky Regiment exiles recruited and indoctrinated a secret society of disgruntled Army officers. In the same year it split with the aristocratic Decembrists of Saint Petersburg and assumed the title of Southern Society but by 1823 Pestel's influence brought the two groups back together. A third society, the United Slavs, operated in Ukraine in alliance with the Southern Society. Second Army commander Hans Karl von Diebitsch, the imperial government and tsar Alexander I himself received reliable but fragmented information on the scope of conspiracy in the troops. No arrests were made until Alexander's death in Taganrog on 1825. Chernigov Regiment of foot was actually based in the Kiev Governorate, halfway between Kiev and Bila Tserkva. Regimental headquarters were located in Vasylkiv on Stuhna River. Companies of the regiment were scattered in the villages west of Vasylkiv, along the Kamyanka River. These villages, from Trylisy in the west to Ustimivka in south-east, form a continuous band of settlements along Kamyanka, and are connected by roads to Bila Tserkva in the south and Fastivets, Mytnytsia, Vasylkiv and Kiev in the north. The soldiers lived individually in peasant's huts, literally \\"off the country\\". This helped the Decembrists in agitating enlisted men one by one without raising suspicion, but in the decisive hour prevented them from assembling the whole force in short time.Nechkina, pp. 120‚Äì121. Regiment commander colonel Goebel was not involved in the conspiracy and was not aware of it. His immediate subordinate, battalion commander Sergey Muravyov-Apostol, was Pestel's second in command in the Southern Society. Company commanders Veniamin Solovyov, Anastasy Kuzmin and Mikhail Schepilo were active members of the United Slavs. The regiment was literally infested with rebel officers at all levels. Rebel officers also infiltrated nearby Aktyrka, Alexopol, Kremenchug and Poltava regiments although to a lesser extent. Muravyov-Apostol counted on \\"allied\\" units stationed in Zhitomir and Brusyliv in the west and in Bila Tserkva to the south, although in real life these units remained on the government's side. Outbreak Alexander's death interrupted the Decembrists' plans and forced them to act immediately. 1825, on the day of the accession of Nicholas I, they launched a military coup in Saint Petrersburg. It failed at a cost of 1,271 lives, mostly civilians. In an unrelated move Diebitsch arrested Pestel on . The Decembrists in Ukraine panicked but did not act, hoping that the arrest was an isolated episode, and that their ringleader will keep silence. Ten days later they received the news of a failed revolt and mass arrests in Saint Petersburg.Mazour, p. 182. Sergey Muravyov-Apostol, Pestel's second-in-command in the Southern Society, left his station in Vasylkiv to meet general Loggin Rot and Decembrist Mikhail Bestuzhev-Ryumin, in Zhitomir.Bestuzhev-Ryumin was denied the right to furlough for his involvement in the Semyonovsky Regiment affair. Muravyov-Apostol needed him free, and hoped to persuade Rot to release Bestuzhev-Ryumin. Lieutenant Andreevich departed to Radomyshl to incite the Alexopol Regiment. Muravyov-Apostol barely escaped an arrest warrant against him which was delivered to Vasylkiv on the next day. Bestuzhev-Ryumin managed to get through to Muravyov-Apostol first and warned him of a manhunt. The two conspirators were put back by Artamon Muravyov's refusal to join the revolt with his Aktyrka Regiment. The arrest party followed the fugitives through Zhitomir and Lyubar and finally arrested them in Trylisy .Nechkina, pp. 121‚Äì122.Mazour, pp. 183‚Äì184. Muravyov's associates Kuzmin, Schepilo, Solovyov and Sukhinov realized that now the ring narrowed around themselves and settled for an open revolt. They rushed to Trylesy and set Muravyov-Apostol and Bestuzhev-Ryumin free. Colonel Goebel was injured in a sword fight and left to bleed but survived. Soldiers of Kuzmin's 5th company of the Chernigov Regiment stationed in Trylisy supported their officers, and on the following day Muravyov-Apostol assumed command and declared an open revolt. Unlike the action in Saint Petersburg, where soldiers were lured into defending Constantine Pavlovich as the legitimate monarch, the Chernigov Regiment soldiers were clearly told of the anti-government, anti-monarchist nature of the revolt. They marched west to nearby Kovalivka and absorbed the 2nd company. December 30 the rebels' vanguard reached Vasylkiv.Nechkina, pp. 122‚Äì125.Mazour, p. 184. Major Trukhin, the highest-ranking loyalist of the Chernigov regiment, attempted to quell the rebels and was lynched on the spot. Without further resistance the whole regiment united in an open revolt against monarchy. The rebels now counted one thousand men in strength, complete with regimental banner, purse and even their own chaplain Daniel Keyser but without field artillery. Their leaders divided over the course of action. The United Slavs pressed for immediate capture of Kiev, only one day's march away. Muravyov and Bestuzhev-Ryumin opposed immediate action until other regiments join the revolt. Their opinion prevailed. Muravyov issued orders to march west to Brusyliv, away from Kiev, to unite with \\"allied\\" Akhtyrka and Alexapol regiments.Nechkina, pp. 125‚Äì126.Mazour, pp. 184‚Äì188. Defeat 1825 Chernigov Regiment left Vasylkiv for Brusyliv. In Motovylivka Muravyov-Amursky learnt that the Decemrists of Alexapol Regiment refused to join the revolt, which made further westward movement useless. Muravyov-Amursky ordered an overnight stop at Motovylivka and took his time evaluating the alternatives. He finally settled on Bila Tserkva, were his lieutenant Vadkovsky apparently had influence over fellow officers of the 17th J√§gers Regiment. He was not aware that by this time Vadkovsky was already arrested and that the government moved the unstable 17th J√§gers away from Bila Tserkva. Meanwhile, the unexpected stopover and mounting uncertainty demoralized both enlisted men and career officers. Officers Apostol-Kegich, Mayevsky, Meschersky and Petin, who willfully joined the revolt, now deserted it. Soldiers indulged in harassing local Jews. The United Slavs managed to incite local Ukrainian peasants, but their support could not compensate for lack of strategy.Nechkina, p. 127.Mazour, pp. 191, 193. Muravyov-Apostol led the regiment south to Bila Tserkva. By the end of the next day they reached Polohy where Sukhinov arranged a forward scouting party to Bila Tserkva. The scouts brought back fearful news that the 17th J√§gers relocated to Skvira, a full day's march west of Bila Tserkva. The government now seized the initiative and removed unstable troops from the area. Muravyov-Apostol could now count only on fellow Decembrists in Zhitomir. The rebels turned again, this time heading north-west through the same Kamyanka valley which they left four days ago. Meanwhile, more officers deserted the regiment and discipline among the ranks was failing.Mazour, pp. 193‚Äì194. the regiment left Polohy for Trylisy. Halfway between Ustimivka and Kovalivka the rebels marched head-on into government troops led by Friedrich Caspar von Geismar. Geismar had around 400 men ‚Äì four squadrons of hussars with two field cannon. Artillery quickly brought rebels into submission. Sergey Muravyov-Apostol was wounded by the first canister shot, Solovyov saved him from immediate lynching by demoralized soldiers. 869 rebels surrendered without offering any resistance: government force had not suffered a single casualty. Rebels lost 60 soldiers, three officers and twelve civilians. Ippolit Muravyov-Apostol and Anastasy Kuzmin shot themselves.Nechkina, p. 128.Mazour, pp. 194‚Äì195. Punishment Immediately after suppression of the revolt the loyalists arrested the officers involved in the revolt, including those who deserted the rebels in Motovylivka. More arrests followed as the prisoners in Saint Petersburg reported their connections, real or imaginary. All commissioned officers were transported to the Peter and Paul Fortress in Saint Petersburg and faced the same investigators and judges as the Saint Peterburg Decembrists. The court in Saint Petersburg pronounced its statement July 9, 1826. Of 121 prisoners found guilty, 61 belonged to the Northern Society, 60 to the Southern Society and the United Slavs,Mazour, pp. 212‚Äì213. although only a small fraction of them was directly involved in the revolt. Thirty-six Decembrists were sentenced to death. Nicholas commuted most of the sentences, although in an indiscriminate manner inconsistent with each individual's guilt.Mazour, p. 213. Five were actually hanged, including the Chernigov Regiment leaders Sergey Muravyov- Apostol and Mikhail Bestuzhev-Ryumin. Others received sentences ranging from demotion to Army service to life in Siberia. In 1828 one of the Chernigov Regiment veterans, Ivan Sukhinov, was indicted in an attempted prison riot and committed suicide.Nechkina, p. 137. Prosecution of the Decembrists, most of them ethnic Russian nobles, by a government party led by ethnic Germans (Geismar, Benckendorff, Osten-Sacken) gave rise to rumours of a German conspiracy.Mazour, p. 196. Enlisted soldiers were punished right where they were detained. 1826 a commission based in Bila Tserkva reviewed 987 individual cases of Chernigov Regiment soldiers and found 51 of them innocent. 106 men were ran through the gauntlet. Three of them received a lethal dose of \\"twelve runs\\" (12,000 strikes) and died, 103 survived with 1,000 to 4,000 strikes. They and the rest of the soldiers were transferred to serve in the action of the Caucasian War.Gabayev. Chaplain father Daniel was detained in a monastery for two months and then stripped of his nobility and clerical title and sent for hard work to Babruysk fortress. He was granted amnesty and a pension in 1858.Mazour, p. 188. Notes Sources * Gabayev, G. S. (1932, in Russian).

It now houses the National Maritime Museum of Ireland. Early history The church was built by subscription in 1836, in pursuance of a donation of ¬£1000 for its endowment, for seafarers as the \\"Protestant Episcopal Mariners' Church at Kingstown Harbour\\".Samuel Lewis: Topography of Ireland, 1837 Due to the increasing importance of Kingstown (as the town was then known) and its harbour, it was considered necessary to have a Church to look after the spiritual needs of officers and sailors. The church, designed by the architect Joseph Welland (1798‚Äì1860), was consecrated on 25 June 1843. This initial build consisted of just the nave and transepts. Richard Brooke, the first chaplain, described it as \\"large and gaunt and lofty and ugly a satire on taste, a libel of all ecclesiastical rule, mocking at proportion and symmetry\\". From 1862 until 1867, the building was improved by the addition of the spire and lancet windows. The spire, designed by Raffles Browne, was added in 1865. The chancel was added in 1884. It was then the principal Church of Ireland church in the town. It depended for its upkeep to a large extent on voluntary subscriptions, donations, bequests and the results of fund-raising efforts. Later history Much-needed renovations were carried out in 1870, after several fund-raising efforts by the parishioners. However, further work was needed by 1884, to be carried out by Bolton of Rathmines under the direction of architect Thomas Drew (1838‚Äì1910). During this work, an accident occurred on 10 September. Scaffolding collapsed when two men were plastering the ceiling, above ground. One, Hemp, died soon afterwards; the other was seriously injured. The church re-opened on 14 October 1884.Irish Times, Dublin, 15 October 1884 In the mid-20th century, the congregation dwindled, and the church closed for worship at Easter 1972. Maritime Museum Shortly after the church closed the Maritime Institute of Ireland showed an interest in acquiring the church for use as a museum. In 1974 lease was signed between Church of Ireland officials and the Maritime Institute. The National Maritime Museum of Ireland was opened by President Patrick Hillery in 1978. In 2007 the Institute bought the building. Renovations were completed in 2011 which included improvements to the roof, interior, and electrical systems.

In Royal Air Force and Royal Navy service, it was named the Hoverfly II. Development The R-6/Hoverfly II was developed to improve on the successful Sikorsky R-4. In order to enhance performance, a completely new streamlined fuselage was designed and the boom carrying the tail rotor was lengthened and straightened. The main rotor and transmission system of the R-4 were retained.Swanborough, 1963, p.529 Sikorsky allotted their Model 49 designation to the new design. Later, dynamically-balanced modifications to the rotor were carried out by Doman Helicopters Inc. The new aircraft could attain 100 mph compared with 82 mph by the earlier design. Initial production was by Sikorsky, but most examples were built by Nash-Kelvinator. Some of the later aircraft were fitted with more powerful engines. Operational history The first R-6s were delivered to the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) in late 1944 and some were transferred to the United States Navy (USN). It was initially intended to pass 150 R-6s to the Royal Air Force (RAF), but delays caused by the switch of production from Sikorsky's factory at Stratford, Connecticut to Nash-Kelvinator at Detroit Michigan meant that only 27 R-6As were actually delivered to the RAF as the Hoverfly II.Butler, 2004, p.278 Fifteen of these were passed on to the Royal Navy's Fleet Air Arm (FAA).Thetford, 1977, p.422 Some of the RAF examples were allotted to 657 Squadron RAF for proving the use of helicopters in the Army Co-operation role, and two external stretchers could be fitted to the fuselage. 657 Squadron operated their Hoverfly IIs as Air Observation Posts, spotting for Army artillery units. The Hoverfly IIs remained in operation until April 1951, and one squadron example was displayed at the September 1950 Farnborough Air Show.Thetford, 1976, p.603 The FAA used their Hoverfly IIs in the training and liaison roles. Naval units to use the type included 771 Squadron from December 1945, followed by 705 Squadron. The USAAF operated their R-6s in secondary roles and the survivors were redesignated H-6A in 1948. The USN examples were designated the HOS-1 and a further 64 were intended to be transferred from the USAAF, but this did not take place.

Kickapoo whistle speech is a substitute for spoken Kickapoo in which the pitch and length of vowels and vowel clusters are represented while vowel qualities and consonants are not.  History  The system of whistling was employed around 1915 by young members of the Kickapoo tribe. These individuals wanted to be able to communicate without their parents‚Äô understanding.  Technique  In order to produce whistle speech, the Kickapoo Indians cup their hands together to form a chamber. Next, they blow into the chamber with their lips placed against the knuckles of their thumbs. In order to alter the pitch of their whistle, the Kickapoo Indians lift their fingers from the back of the chamber.  Use of whistle speech among Kickapoo Indians  Among the Kickapoo Indian tribe in Coahuila, Mexico, whistled speech is employed primarily for courtship purposes.

The Council reiterated the importance it attached to the full and timely implementation of the \\"Acordos de Paz\\" peace agreement and relevant resolutions of the Security Council, and the importance of the role of the United Nations in this process. The efforts of the Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali's Special Representative, Margaret Anstee, the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) and that of neighbouring states, particularly Zambia, was welcomed. An increase in the strength of UNAVEM II by raising it to its previous level was proposed, in accordance with Resolution 903 (1994), but this noted along with concern at the resurgence of military operations in Angola which affected UNAVEM II's ability to carry out its mandate. Concern was also expressed at violations of measures in Resolution 864 (1993) and long duration of peace talks in Lusaka, Zambia, appealing to both the Government of Angola and UNITA to reach an early and comprehensive peace settlement. After extending the mandate of UNAVEM II, the Council stressed that future decisions would depend on progress in the peace talks. The acceptance by the Angolan government on proposals concerning national reconciliation was welcomed and UNITA was urged to do likewise. Any recommendations by the Secretary-General regarding the United Nations presence in Angola would be promptly considered, while its presence as a whole would be reviewed if a peace agreement had not been reached in Lusaka. In light of the discussions, further sanctions would not be placed on UNITA. The continuation of military operations in the country, the worsening of the humanitarian situation and acts that would prevent the free distribution of humanitarian assistance were condemned. At the same time, countries, United Nations agencies and non-governmental organisations that had contributed assistance to Angola were praised. The resolution concluded by asking the Secretary-General to report to the Council by 30 June 1994 on developments in the country.

The film marks the second pair-up between the Deol family, after their last sports hit, Apne (2007). The film's title is inspired from the song \\"Main Jat Yamla Pagla Deewana\\" from the 1975 film, Pratigya also starring Dharmendra. The theatrical trailer of the film unveiled on 5 November 2010, whilst the film released on 14 January 2011, and received good response upon release. It turned out to be a box office hit. It is the first installment of Yamla Pagla Deewana film series and the 11th highest-grossing Bollywood film of 2011. Mukul Dev received the 7th Amrish Puri award for excellence in acting for his performance in the movie. Plot Paramvir Singh (Sunny Deol) is a Non-resident Indian (NRI) living happily with his Canadian wife Mary (Emma Brown Garett) along with his two kids Karam and Veer and his mother (Nafisa Ali) in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Years ago, after the birth of Paramvir's younger brother Gajodhar, Paramvir's father, Dharam Singh (Dharmendra) had run away from home and took Gajodhar with him, due to difficulties with the family. Back in reality, a Canadian comes to visit Paramvir at his home, where he sees Dharam Singh's photo. The Canadian recognises Dharam as a thief who had robbed him when he went to tour in Banaras. Upon hearing this news, Paramvir's mother sends him to Banaras to find his father, and younger brother. When Paramvir reaches Banaras, he meets a youngster who cons him off all his money. Seeking help, Paramvir lands up at a bar, where he sees both Dharam Singh, and his brother Gajodhar Singh (Bobby Deol), who has now grown up. Paramvir realises Gajodhar is in fact the youngster who had earlier conned him, and is disappointed to see both his father and brother are con-men. When Paramvir sees Dharam alone, he confronts him and tells him his identity. However, Dharam refuses to acknowledge him as his son. Soon, Paramvir saves Gajodhar from getting attacked by goons, to which Gajodhar befriends him and accepts him to their team, not knowing that he is his elder brother. During this time, Gajodhar falls in love with Saheba (Kulraj Randhawa), a Punjabi author. Dharam and Paramvir help him woo her, and the two start a relationship. Soon enough, Saheba's tough brothers find out, and beat Gajodhar up, and take Saheba back to Punjab. When Dharam sees that Gajodhar is hopeless, he breaks out, and asks Paramvir to help, and acknowledges that he is his father but he shouldn't tell Gajodhar anything about that, after which Paramvir and Gajodhar move to Punjab to get back his love. Saheba's elder brother Joginder Singh (Anupam Kher)who is a cruel landlord of his village and her other brothers want to marry her to an NRI. Upon hearing this, Paramvir disguises Gajodhar up to make him look like a Punjabi, and they both go to Saheba's house, with Gajodhar pretending to be an NRI named Karamveer. On the other hand, Joginder has an arch-rival Minty (Puneet Issar) who wants to take Joginders place and doesn't want Joginder to win in upcoming elections. Joginder, after meeting both of them, decides that they would marry their sister to Paramvir, not to Gajodhar. However, Paramvir is already married. One night, Paramvir gets drunk and beats up Saheba's brothers but that only makes Joginder like him more. So Paramvir tells Gajodhar to run away with Saheba one night. While they are making their escape, Dharam shows up with a band of musicians thus preventing Gajodhar and Saheba from running away because Dharam thinks Gajodhar is the one getting married not knowing that Saheba's family has chosen Paramvir. Dharam tells Paramvir and Gajodhar that Paramvir should be the one running away. So Paramvir attempts to go to the market but Poli brings him back home causing Joginder to think that Gajodhar and Dharam are joking as they said Paramvir is scared of marriage but unbeknownst to Dharam and Gajodhar, he is standing right behind them. Joginder decides to get Poli married to Gajodhar after which Gajodhar and Saheba decide they will escape that very night. Again, they fail as Paramvir's wife Mary shows up with Karam and Veer (Paramvir's sons). Paramvir, Gajodhar and Dharam make up the story that she is their neighbour in Canada and that her husband is also named Paramvir who went missing last year. Mary knows that Paramvir is in front of her but chooses not to say anything because it will ruin the whole plan. Joginder somehow finds out what has been on all this while and gets his men to attack Paramvir, Gajodhar and Dharam. Paramvir and Dharam beat his men up until Minty and his men show up. As Minty is about to attack Joginder, Gajodhar rescues him hence earning approval to marry Saheba. In the end, Dharam, Gajodhar, Paramvir, Mary, Saheba, Karam and Veer go to Canada where they live as one happy family.

The episode aired on May 18, 2010, on ABC in the United States. The episode's flash-sideways are centered on Jack Shephard, Desmond Hume, Benjamin Linus and James \\"Sawyer\\" Ford. In the flash- sideways timeline, Desmond Hume (Henry Ian Cusick) continues his attempt to gather all the passengers of Oceanic Airlines Flight 815. In 2007, The Man in Black (Terry O'Quinn) devises a new strategy. Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) takes the role as leader of the island while he and his group search for Desmond. Plot =2004 (flash-sideways timeline)= In the flash sideways timeline, Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox), Claire Littleton (Emilie de Ravin), and David Shephard (Dylan Minnette) eat breakfast and discuss David's participation in a concert that night. Jack is notified that Oceanic Airlines have found Christian Shephard's coffin; unbeknownst to him; this is a ruse planned by Desmond Hume (Henry Ian Cusick). Outside the school where he and John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) work, Ben Linus (Michael Emerson) sees and confronts Desmond, who beats him while explaining that his intent was to make Locke \\"let go\\". Ben experiences flashes of Desmond beating him in the original universe. Ben relates all this to Locke, who goes to see Jack at the hospital and decides to have the new procedure; he believes his experiences with Desmond and Jack have been fated. Alex's (Tania Raymonde) mother, Danielle Rousseau (Mira Furlan), offers the visibly injured Ben a ride home. She invites him to dinner, where Rousseau tells Ben that he has become like a father to Alex since her real father's death. Desmond enters James \\"Sawyer\\" Ford (Josh Holloway) and Miles Straume's (Ken Leung) police station, confesses to assaulting Locke and Ben, and is jailed alongside Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) and Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews). The three prisoners are to be transported by van, but the driver, Ana Lucia Cortez (Michelle Rodriguez), releases them and receives a payoff from Desmond and Hugo \\"Hurley\\" Reyes (Jorge Garcia). Desmond hands Kate a dress and tells her they are going to a concert. =2007 (original timeline)= After the submarine explosion in \\"The Candidate\\", Jack, Kate, Hurley, and Sawyer wash ashore, alive. Jack determines they must find Desmond, whose importance is revealed by the Man in Black's (Terry O'Quinn) attempt to kill him. A younger Jacob (Kenton Duty) confronts Hurley, demanding his body's ashes. Hurley gives them to him, and Jacob leaves without answering any of Hurley's questions. Hurley chases him to a campfire, where the adult Jacob (Mark Pellegrino) instructs him to bring the others before the campfire burns out, which will end his ability to manifest. They arrive in time, and are all able to see Jacob for the first time. He explains that they were chosen to come to the island because each of them has an emptiness that can be filled by the island, and that one of them must choose to be the guardian who will protect the light, the \\"heart\\" of the island, from the Man in Black. Jack volunteers; Jacob gives Jack a drink of water and declares that Jack is \\"now like [him]\\". Ben, Miles, and Richard Alpert (Nestor Carbonell) reach the destroyed Barracks of the DHARMA Initiative. Ben enters the secret room where he was previously seen summoning the smoke monster, where he kept a stack of C4 that he was going to use to destroy the Ajira airplane to prevent the Man in Black's escape. Charles Widmore (Alan Dale) and Zoe (Sheila Kelley) confront Ben, and Charles claims to be the group's only hope. Zoe and Widmore hide when the Man in Black arrives, while Miles flees. The smoke monster, the Man in Black, attacks Richard. Then, as Locke, he demands Widmore's location from Ben, who reveals it. The Man in Black kills Zoe when it becomes clear she will not talk, then threatens Widmore with harm to Penny unless he reveals his purpose on the island. Widmore whispers a response, but Ben shoots and kills him to deny him the opportunity to save his daughter. The Man in Black claims to have already gotten the information he wanted, and leaves with Ben. They find that Desmond has apparently escaped the well by climbing a rope, but the Man in Black says this will not prevent him from using what he learned from Widmore: he can use Desmond's resistance to electromagnetism to destroy the island.

He had extended access to numerous musicians through the 1960s and 1970s, including being backstage at The Beatles' final paid live concert in San Francisco's Candlestick Park, and was chief photographer at Woodstock. Career Marshall was born in Chicago, Illinois. While still at high school, he purchased his first camera and began documenting musicians and artists in San Francisco. After serving several years in the Air Force, he returned and moved to New York. He was hired by Atlantic Records and Columbia Records to photograph their musical artists. His photos appeared on the covers of over 500 albums and even more were published in Rolling Stone. He photographed Jimi Hendrix setting his guitar on fire at the Monterey Pop Festival, and Johnny Cash at San Quentin. Marshall was said to have at least one Leica camera with him at all times. One famous story concerned a CEO who offered to buy the camera that he used to shoot Jimi Hendrix at Woodstock for $25,000 (in 1973) which he refused. Marshall was well known in the industry for his portraits of musicians. His photos of 1960s and 1970s musicians, taken both on stage and off without any direction or posing, were possible because of the exceptional access musicians allowed him. His pictures of Neil Young, Janis Joplin, Bob Dylan, Jim Morrison, the Allman Brothers, The Who, Led Zeppelin, the Grateful Dead, the Jefferson Airplane, Guns N' Roses, Santana and The Beatles \\"helped define their subjects as well as rock 'n' roll photography itself.\\" Annie Leibovitz said he was \\"the rock 'n' roll photographer.\\" Marshall also photographed jazz musicians such as Thelonious Monk, John Coltrane, and Miles Davis. Other photographic assignments included shooting the Indianapolis 500 in 2005 for Autoweek and the 2007 introduction of the Nissan GT-R. Awards In 2014 Marshall was posthumously given a Trustees Award (part of the Lifetime Achievement Awards) at the 56th Grammy Awards, the first and only photographer, as of 2014, to receive one. Also in 2014, the Leica Gallery in West Hollywood opened a tribute to Marshall, accompanied by treasures from the iconic camera brand, the camera Marshall loved. A photograph of him at Woodstock shows him with $40,000 worth of camera equipment around his neck (as estimated by another photographer). Personal life Marshall was known for his forceful personality that became something of a celebrity of its own. Not having any children, he used to say \\"I have no kids,\\" \\"My photographs are my children.\\" In 1967 he dated Folgers coffee heiress, Abigail Folger, who accompanied him and fellow photographer Elaine Mayes to the Monterey Pop Festival. Folger was murdered, in 1969, by followers of Charles Manson. Marshall lived in California but died in New York City, New York, at the age of 74 while on a trip during which he was scheduled to speak in SoHo.\\"Jim Marshall Photographer for Woodstock, Cash, Dylan, and Others Dies at 74\\" latimes.com 24 March 2010 References External links * *Jim Marshall Clothing Category:1936 births Category:2010 deaths Category:American photojournalists Category:Artists from Chicago Category:Jazz photographers ","title":"Jim Marshall (photographer)"},{"id":"26687404","text":"Green woodworking tools From the left: stichaxt or stossaxt, a German or Austrian pattern of mortice axe, kreuzaxt, a double ended German mortice axe with two types of chisel ( a sort of medium-sized twybil, like a smaller version of the French bisaigue - usually fitted with a short wooden handle) and adze Hurdle-maker's small twybil A twybil is a hand tool used for green woodworking. It is used for chopping out mortises when timber framing, or making smaller pieces such as gates. It combines chopping and levering functions in a single tool. The appearance of a twybil is that of a T-shaped double-edged axe with unusually long blades and a very short handle. This appearance is deceptive, as they are actually derived from a large double-ended chisel with a side handle added for better control. The geometry of a twybil, particularly the long straight blades, makes it unworkable as an axe. Unfortunately many old examples have been damaged by such misuse. The related mortising axe or 'Bec d'ane' (donkey's nose) is similar, but single-sided and is forged and tempered to survive the shock loads of swinging as an axe. Twybils always have two working ends and these are always different. The first is an axe-like blade, with the edge arranged parallel to the handle. The second edge is crossways, as for an adze. This is used for prying and levering rather than cutting.  Use  The correct use of a twybil is highly specialized, that of rapidly clearing out mortises. Mortises are rectangular holes used to take a tenon for several forms of joint, most obviously the common mortise and tenon joint. Mortises are always cut so that their long axis is along the grain of the wood. Traditionally these were first cut by drilling with a brace and bit to mark out each end, then the twybil used to break out the wood between them. The axe edge is used to split the intervening timber away from the sides of the mortise, then the other end to lever out the split block. Their short handle allows them to be easily flipped end-for-end, making for quick working as each blade is used alternately. This is quicker to use than swapping between a chisel and a separate lever, safer than using a carefully sharpened chisel edge for levering.  Naming  The twybil has a variety of spellings and is sometimes termed the twyvil, twilbil. twivil, trybill, two-bill or even dader. In French, piochon. In Flemish and French-speaking Northern countries, they are known as bisaigu√´. Their name may originate from a root of \\"twy-\\" for \\"two\\", indicating their double-ended nature, and \\"-bill\\", a common description for edged tools (e.g. \\"billhook\\"). The Oxford Dictionaries, however, define the spelling as twibill, from the Old English, twibile. Sloane distinguishes the two names with twibil as the larger straight-bladed form and twivel as the shorter, single-handed curved form.  Construction  Twybils are made in a range of sizes, depending on the size of the work they're intended for. The length of the side handle remains roughly constant at around a hand's span and so their proportions change. A small one intended for making hurdlesAbbott, Green woodwork, p. 188 may have three arms of approximately equal length, a large framing twybil may be three feet long and yet still have the same handle. Diderot's Encyclop√©die of the 18th century shows a bisaigu√´ in use for paring end grain of a large joint, much as a modern slick chisel, which is long enough to rest on the carpenter's shoulder. The shape of the working edges varies with size and purpose. Large twybils have short straight edges for splitting, like an axe or tomahawk. Small ones have a more curved edge, curving back beneath to a shape that is more like a short knife or oyster knife, another tool used with a similar splitting and prying action. Both styles are forged and sharpened symmetrically. The levering end is asymmetrical, with a single bevel as for a chisel. Large framing twybils are straight, with this bevel on the outside. Small ones are curved or hooked, with the bevel inside. Most surviving examples are old enough that they are forged from iron rather than steel, with hard steel edges welded to them. Modern examples may be wholly of steel, frequently recycled truck leaf springs. A socket is forged on the side for the handle, this being a short wooden handle, often made to the user's own preference. Twybils are rare today, even amongst the recreators of specialist green woodworking tools. As such, good usable examples may command high prices. Ashley Iles is one of the few bulk production manufacturers to offer one.  Other related tools  The mortise chisel, even in its heavyweight \\"pigsticker\\" form, is used differently from a twybill, although the two may be used together. The twybill cuts the sides of mortices, along the grain. Its action is a splitting and prying one, so only requires a handle for leverage and is never struck. Mortise chisels are used for heavy chopping across the grain, are nearly always struck, and are used to square up the ends of square-ended mortises. Both tools are used for levering out chunks when first clearing out a mortise and so have similarly shaped bevels, often with a curved bevel surface for a better fulcrum action. Slicks are other specialised chisels also used to work on the sides of mortises, but are used for final clean-up to make an accurate and smooth-sided mortise, after the rough chopping has been carried out. In the heyday of the twybil, mortises in small work were often round-ended and so could be cut very quickly by brace and twybil alone, the tenon being rounded to fit.Edlin, Woodland crafts, The curious break and tools used to form mortises in gate hurdles, figures 99 & 100, facing p. 100 Only large, or high- quality work required the square ends and smoothed sides of a precise mortise, trimmed by this variety of chisels. The apprentice will often use all three mortising tools interchangeably and randomly, making much effort of removing the waste as small chips. The skilled framer uses each appropriately in turn, working faster, with less effort and not bothering to tear a large block of waste into fragments. They are also less likely to damage a precise edge by levering with a sharp, brittle chisel edge.

It was opened in 1937 by Fredrick H. Sexton on the campus of the Nova Scotia Technical College, which is today the Sexton Campus of Dalhousie University. Dr. Sexton served as the first principal, and later president, of NSTC from 1907 to 1947. History Inside the T-Room From its inception the T-Room was a popular hang out for Engineering students, as well as those attending neighbouring Dalhousie University. Trivia nights, or Pub Quiz nights as they were then known, were a local favorite and still take place at the venue every Friday night to this day. Circa 1980, NSTC became the Technical University of Nova Scotia (TUNS). The provincial government forced TUNS to amalgamate with Dalhousie University in April 1997. For several years the former TUNS faculties formed a college called Dalhousie University Polytechnic (nicknamed DalTech) but in 2001 the college structure was dissolved and the faculties simply became part of Dalhousie University. Today, the TUNS campus is known as the Sexton Campus of Dalhousie University. It includes the T-Room, the Faculty of Engineering and the Faculty of Architecture and Planning. The TUNS School of Computer Science was merged with Dalhousie's after the 1997 amalgamation to become the Faculty of Computer Science. Computer Science moved into a new building on the Studley Campus in 1999. It is commonly believed that the bar is named for its shape, but this is unlikely as it is actually closer in shape to a letter \\"L\\". It is more likely that the T-Room name came from students abbreviating the name Nova Scotia Technical College to \\"Tech\\" in conversation. Trivia Nights  Friday night trivia at the T-Room. Trivia at the T-Room originated every Friday starting in 2002. A student from PEI, where pub quizzes are very popular, spoke with the T-Room management and they agreed to start trivia to aid in Friday night sales. In 2004, due to the graduation of long-time trivia host Brent Desroches, trivia was handed off to a 3rd year student who had expressed interest. Brennan McVeigh hosted trivia during his time on campus. Because of the alternating schedule of co-op students a new host was required every four months. McVeigh would always return to host during his academic terms. In 2009, fans of trivia caused a public outcry when the weekly event was left off of a \\"Top Quiz and Trivia Nights\\" list published by local newspaper The Coast. Following this, The Coast published a second article mentioning the \\"renowned T-Room trivia\\" as well as its \\"die-hard fans\\", the T-Room Nation. The outcry also resulted in a brand new category for \\"Best Trivia Night\\" being added to the publication's annual \\"Best of Halifax Reader's Poll.\\" This category has been won by the T-Room each year since its creation. The Rev-Bomb In September 2009, in an effort to deplete their stock of Rev and harness the popularity of the J√§gerbomb, the bar's liquor manager introduced the Rev-Bomb. This drink combines Rev and J√§germeister and quickly gained popularity. The drink soon earned the nickname the \\"Halifax Explosion\\" for its explosive rise in popularity and devastating taste.

Early years Frederic Anton Eilers was born in Laufenselden, Nassau, Germany, Jan 14, 1839, to Ernest Julius Adolph Friederich and Elizabeth Dielmann Eilers. He grew up in the farming community of Mensfelden in the Duchy of Nassau, then attended the German High Schools of Weilburg and Wiesbaden. In 1856 he spent one year at the Clausthal mining academy and two at the University of G√∂ttingen. Shortly after his graduation from college in 1859, he, his mother, and his twelve-year-old sister Emma left for the United States. Early work In 1863, he married Elizabeth Emrich. Soon after, Eilers was offered a position with Adelberg & Raymond, a partnership between Justus Adelberg and Rossiter W. Raymond that specialized in mining consulting. He worked there three years, learning about the American mining industry while becoming a close friend of Rossiter Raymond. A year later, Anton's first child, daughter Else, was born. The next year, in 1865, while Anton was on assignment for Adelberg & Raymond in Marietta, Ohio, boring for oil, his son Karl Eilers was born. In 1866, following the Civil War, Anton secured a position as manager of the Hale Copper mine in Hillsville in Carroll County, Virginia. There, he restarted the copper mine, built a copper smelter, and experimented with copper refining. During the Eilers' time in Virginia, Anton & Elizabeth had two more children, Anna and Louise. In 1869, Anton developed plans to expand the Hale Copper mine, but a lack of experienced labor and the low quality of copper ore proved difficult obstacles for growth. In August of that year, Eilers appeared ready to work through the challenges in Virginia, as the family bought property near the copper mine. However, a few weeks later, Rossiter W. Raymond offered Anton a new position back in New York. Raymond had been appointed Commissioner of Mines and Mining Statistics In and West of the Rocky Mountains and wanted Eilers as deputy commissioner. Anton accepted the offer and moved his family back to New York. For the next 7 years, the Raymond and Eilers travelled the West, compiling information and reporting on issues related to mining. Every winter they published their findings in Congressional House documents. First tourists to enter a National Park Normally, while executing their duties and doing their research in the West, Anton and Raymond travelled separately, but in 1871 they decided to explore a region of the United States now known as Yellowstone National Park. Accompanying Anton and Raymond in August 1871 was J.S. Daugherty of Wabash City, Indiana, August F. Thrasher (photographer), Calvin C. Clawson (reporter for the New Northwest) and Gilman Sawtelle, who acted as their guide.Both Rossiter and Clawson published their series in the New Northwest. Rossiter also published his account in Harpers Magazine, in a book called Camp and Cabin. The National Park Service recognizes this party as the first group of 'tourists' to enter a national park for the purposes of simply touring a National Park.(the 1871 Hayden Survey party was also in the park at the time). Both Rossiter Raymond and Calvin Clawson wrote accounts of their journeys in serial form. Rossiter would later bind his into a chapter of a book published in 1880 called Camp and Cabin. Thrasher printed some of this photographs, exhibiting them for several groups of Montanians, before heading east to get them published in a book. At that point, the photographs disappeared, leaving the images‚Äô location an ongoing mystery.Mary C H Williams, Author of Taking of the Tools; Early Biography of Rossiter W. Raymond His years in the smelting industry 200pxIn 1876, Anton left his role as deputy to Rossiter. That January, he became manager at the Saints John smelter near Montezuma, Colorado, where he constructed works with the help of Franz Fohr, Henry Vezin, and Frank Cazin. In September of that year, Gustav Billing approached Anton about joining him at the Germania Smelting, a lead- silver ore smelter south of Salt Lake City, in what is now Murray, Utah. Eilers was familiar with Billing's plant, having stopped there on several occasions during his time as deputy commissioner. To sweeten his offer, Billing offered to make Anton a partner. Eilers accepted and immediately went to Salt Lake with Billing. By early November 1876, Anton had the lead-silver smelter working day and night, an amazing feat at the time. Anton was joined at the Germania by Otto Hahn and August Raht, both of whom had distinguished smelting careers. Together, these three refined Anton's concept of slag-types, a way of mixing ores depending on their mineral and chemical makeup to generate predictable products, including lead-silver bullion, matte, speiss, slag, and flue dust. The use of slag-types allowed the Germania to produce bullion on a constant basis, no matter what lead-silver ore the facility received. For his insights at the Germania, Anton was considered the father of lead-silver smelting in the United States. Eilers' partnership with Billing proved professionally and financially successful between 1876-1878. About this time, news arrived that Colorado's Leadville area was rich in lead-silver ore. Seeing opportunity, Billing and Eilers turned over the Germania to Gustav's brother F.W. Billing and left for Leadville, where Anton built a state-of-the- art smelter. The Billing & Eilers smelter became a top tier producer in a short time. Between 1879 and 1881 the works made the pair very wealthy. However, the high mountain location, cold winters, and some health problems led the pair to a friendly split. Anton sold out to Gustav, then headed to Germany, his first return to his mother country, with his oldest daughter Else for six months. Anton returned to the United States in the summer of 1882. That fall, he was asked to consult on a mine in Monarch, Colorado, called the Madonna mine. Anton told the mine's owners that the low-grade ore was perfect for smelting with nearby ores. He suggested a partnership, where the mine owners would put up the mine, while he raised money to build a smelter on the plains of Colorado. Anton secured the funds and the Colorado Smelting Company was formed. In July 1883, Eilers completed a smelting facility in Pueblo, Colorado. Over the next few years, the Eilers smelter as it was called smelted more than $4 million in lead and silver from the Madonna mine. In the process, the smelter also produced a number of internationally renowned metallurgists under Anton's tutelage, including Anton's own son Karl Eilers.Calculated by Anton Eilers from his own records and provided to the 1912 Colorado Geological Survey, Volumes 4 & 5, Page 239 Four years later, sensing another opportunity, Anton led the formation of the Montana Smelting Company in Great Falls, Montana. However, unlike his previous smelters, this one didn't enjoy the success the others did. This was mainly caused by a lack of cheap lead-silver ore. By the late 1880s and into he 1890, the quantity of high grade ore was declining. Other issues, such as the demonetization of silver, impacted lead- silver smelter revenues as well. To counter these industry problems, Anton and other smeltermen attempted to combine forces. Throughout the 1890s, the lead- silver smelting industry continued to struggle. There were too many smelters and too few lead-silver ore reserves nationally. Eventually, the independent minded smelting owners were forced to merge, creating in 1899 a large entity called the American Smelting & Refining Company (today known as ASARCO). At its formation, American Smelting owned 2/3 of the smelting trusts in the nation, making them a critical player in the ore and mining industry. In 1901, the Guggenheims smelting and refining assets were added to American Smelting. At that time, the Guggenheims obtained a majority of American Smelting shares and began their dominance of the company. Anton played an active role on the Executive Committee and Board of Directors of American Smelting and on its sister company, American Smelting Securities Company, between 1901-1910. During this period, he was also on the Board of Directors of Wells Fargo, a director on the Seneca Mining Co, a director of the United Missouri River Power Co, and more. In 1910, he retired from the company so he could focus on technical issues he hoped to solve, such as reducing the pollution caused by smelting. Following an illness, Anton died at Sea Cliff, Long Island, April 22, 1917. Personal life Anton and his wife Elizabeth raised 6 children (Else, Karl, Anna, Luise, Emma, and Meta). Over the years, they lived in Ohio, Virginia, Salt Lake City, Denver, and Pueblo, but for nearly all their later years, the family shuttled between their home in Brooklyn and their summer home at Sea Cliff, Long Island. Karl Eilers married Leonie Wurlitzer, daughter of Rudolph Wurlitzer, founder of the Rudolph Wurlitzer Music Company. Only one other daughter, Anna, married. The other four daughters were active in Brooklyn's social scene.SLAG: Western Smelters & Eastern Money, David Eilers, 2016 References Category:1839 births Category:1917 deaths Category:American businesspeople Category:American metallurgists Category:German emigrants to the United States Category:University of G√∂ttingen alumni Category:Asarco Category:People from Rheingau-Taunus-Kreis ","title":"Anton Eilers"},{"id":"26687648","text":"K≈çsh≈ç, son of Unkei, at , Kyoto, dating to the first decade of the thirteenth century and an Important Cultural Property. The six syllables of the nembutsu, na-mu-a-mi-da-butsu, are represented literally by six small figures of Amida streaming from K≈´ya's mouth. He walks as if on a pilgrimage, holding a staff topped with an antler and striking a gong. Similar statues, all of the Kamakura period and Important Cultural Properties, may be found at in Kyoto, in Ehime Prefecture and in Shiga Prefecture. There are a number of related images of Zend≈ç (Shan-tao), with holes in the mouth thought to be for attaching now lost figures. K≈´ya (Á©∫‰πü; 903-972) was an itinerant Japanese Buddhist monk, or hijiri (ËÅñ), later ordained in the Tendai Buddhist sect, who was an early proselytizer of the practice of the nembutsu amongst the populace. Kuya's efforts helped promote the Pure Land teaching of Buddhism to the capital at a time when the movement was first gaining traction in Japan. For his efforts, Kuya earned the name ichi hijiri (holy man of the marketplace) and Amida hijiri. K≈´ya was known for taking images with him on his travels and added musical rhythm and dance to his prayers, known as odori nembutsu.Moriarty, Elisabeth (1976). Nembutsu Odori, Asian Folklore Studies 35 (1), 7-16 Like Gy≈çki, he is said to have performed works for the public benefit such as building roads and bridges, digging wells, and burying abandoned corpses. Biographies of K≈´ya were written by his friends and followers Jakushin and Minamoto-no-Tamenori, and Number 18 of the Ry≈çjin Hish≈ç derives from 'K≈´ya's Praise'. The late tenth-century collection of biographies of those who had attained rebirth in the Pure Land, the Nihon ≈çj≈ç gokuraki ki, attributes to K≈´ya the devotion of all Japan to the nembutsu. He is also known as founder of Rokuharamitsu-ji where he later died. Details of Kuya's life are very scant prior to 938, but in the existing biographies it is said that Kuya, possibly of Imperial lineage, took tonsure at a temple in Owari Province in his youth and traveled to various holy sites and performing good works in the community. Later, Kuya traveled to Awa and Tosa provinces before undertaking austerities at a place called Yushima (ÊπØÂ≥∂) before a statue of Kannon. After attaining a vision of Kannon, he traveled to other provinces and eventually came to the capital in 938. Due to an ongoing revolt at the time, people from the provinces were displaced and came to the capital. Kuya was said to beg for food and then distribute that food to refugees and others who were suffering. Additionally, Kuya constructed Buddhist stupa and hanging scrolls depicting Kannon and AmitƒÅbha Buddha. Since his early years traveling the provinces, Kuya employed the nembutsu as a means of magically delivering the dead to the Pure Land, in contrast to the practice at the time where the dead were frequently left to decompose where they were left. Kuya was fully ordained as a monk in 948 in the Tendai Buddhist sect at Enryakuji temple on Mount Hiei, and continued promoting the practice of the nembutsu while engaging in other activities. In 963, Kuya staged a grand ceremony to commemorate the completion of a copy, begun in 950 and relying on community donations, of the Mahaprajnaparamita Sutra composed in gold ink. Research suggests this sutra project was intended to relieve epidemics and pacify the spirits of the dead. The biographies continue describing further miracles performed by Kuya until his death in 972. Details of Kuya's religious beliefs are not explicitly explained in the biographies, but it is inferred from his actions that Kuya viewed the nembutsu as a form of thaumaturgy or miracle-working, as well as a form of salvation more common in later Pure Land teachings. Stories of hijiri itinerant monks (cf. Gy≈çki were common in the early Heian period, and Kuya is counted among them, but differs somewhat in his employment of the nembutsu as opposed to more widespread esoteric practices. Further, Kuya was not exclusively devoted to AmitƒÅbha Buddha, but venerated other Buddhist deities, particularly Kannon Bodhisattva.

Haggar Apparel Co., 526 U.S. 380 (1999), is a United States Supreme Court holding that Chevron deference is appropriate for regulations issued by Customs on behalf of the Treasury. The statutes authorizing customs classification regulations were found consistent with the usual rule that regulations of an administering agency warrant judicial deference; and nothing in the regulation in question persuaded the Court that the Customs and Border Patrol intended the regulation to have some lesser force and effect. The statutory scheme did not support the importer's argument that the regulation only applied to customs officers themselves as opposed to the adjudication of importers' refund suits in the Court of International Trade. The Customs Service (which is within the US Treasury Department) is charged with fixing duties applicable to imported goods under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury. Facts Haggar Apparel Co., the respondent, designs, manufactures, and markets apparel for men. The matter arose from a refund proceeding for duties imposed on men's trousers shipped by Haggar to the United States from an assembly plant it controlled in Mexico. The fabric had been cut in the United States and then shipped to Mexico, along with the thread, buttons, and zippers necessary to complete the garments. There the trousers were sewn and reshipped to the United States. If that had been the full extent of it, there would not have been a dispute, for if there were mere assembly without other steps, all agree the imported garments would have been eligible for the duty exemption Haggar claimed.. The Government claimed that the trousers were permapressed in Mexico. This process involved baking, which the Customs Service claimed was a process in addition to assembly, and as such denied Haggar a duty exemption. Haggar claimed the baking was simply part of the assembly process, or, in the words of the controlling statute, an \\"operation incidental to the assembly process.\\"Subheading 9802.00.90, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States, 19 U.S.C. 1202. Haggar's claim was difficult because Customs had issued an administrative regulation that deemed all permapressing operations as an additional step in manufacture, not part of assembly. The regulation had been adopted in 1975 by the Commissioner of Customs upon approval by the Treasury Department, after notice-and-comment rulemaking. Procedural posture After being denied the duty exemption, Haggar brought suit in the Court of International Trade (\\"CIT\\"), which declined to find the regulation controlling and ruled in favor of Haggar. On review, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit declined to analyze the regulation with Chevron deference, and affirmed the CIT's ruling. Haggar's arguments Haggar advanced two sets of arguments in contending that Chevron analysis should not apply to the regulation. First, Haggar claimed that the regulation was limited in application to customs officers themselves and was not intended to govern the adjudication of importers' refund suits in the CIT. Second, relying on the authority and jurisdiction of the CIT, Haggar argued that even if Treasury did intend the regulation to bear on the determination of refund suits, the CIT had the power to interpret the tariff statute without giving the usual deference to regulations issued by the administering agency. Decision The Supreme Court found no support for the assertion that the statute only bound customs officers' classifications, and not the importer's themselves. Rather, the Secretary of the Treasury is directed to establish and promulgate rules and regulations for the classification and assessment of duties. Haggar tried to argue that this meant that the Secretary was only charged with ensuring that classifications were consistent among various points of entry, but the Court disagreed. The Court also ruled that the CIT must, when appropriate, give regulations Chevron deference. The Court noted that as early as 1809, Chief Justice Marshall had written in United States v. Vowell that for customs cases \\"if the question had been doubtful, the court would have respected the uniform construction which it is understood has been given by the treasury department ... upon similar questions.\\" See also *Customs valuation *Chevron v.

Manet decided to show his painting it in the window of a shop on the Boulevard des Capucines, one of Paris‚Äôs main street. The painting gathered attention and crowds during its exhibition, due to Manet's fame in Paris. The work is now at the Kunsthalle Hamburg art museum in Germany. Description The painting shows a young and beautiful woman who stands before a mirror with two extinguished candles, her face turned to the spectator. Her dress is incomplete; she wears a white chemise, blue corset, silk stockings and high-heeled footwear. The interior suggests that it is a boudoir. Behind the woman is a sofa with two pillows. An elegantly dressed man, sitting on the sofa, can be partly seen on the right of the painting. On the left side, there is a chair, a table and a flowerpot. Interpretations Both the title and the numerous details suggest that the picture represents a high class prostitute and her client. \\"Nana\\" was a popular assumed name for female prostitutes during the second half of the 19th century (much like the connotation \\"Candy\\" has had for English-speakers more recently). Even today the French word \\"nana\\" is used to describe a frivolous woman (or simply \\"a female\\" in argothttp://www.e-dictionary.info/en/broads/). Reception Manet wanted to present the painting at the Salon of Paris but it was rejected because it was deemed to be contemptuous of the morality of the time. French society was not prepared for such frank depictions of prostitution, and the critics did not see the artistic qualities of the work and concentrated solely on the scene which was represented. One of the defenders of Manet was √âmile Zola who in 1880 published a novel of the same name as the ninth volume of Les Rougon-Macquart series. However, there is no clear evidence of mutual inspiration in the choice of the theme and the title as the book was published three years later. It is likely that Manet found inspiration in L'Assommoir, Zola's previous book, in which the character of Nana appears for the first time.

Havruta started as part of Jerusalem Open House and split off in 2010. Goals Havruta aims to create a broad community of volunteers and participants who will offer social support and sense of communal belonging and empowerment for gays who have some religious connection in all aspects of their lives and life cycle events. In addition, Havruta aims to increase the recognition of religious gays, leading to them being accepted. Havruta also aims to help gay people live a religious lifestyle, and support them through working together, as well as offering an opportunity for the greater gay community to share the experience of a Jewish religious life. Community activities Havruta serves as a community for religiously inclined and formerly religious gays and helps bridge the wide gaps that exist between religious and gay life. Havruta provides monthly social meetings in Jerusalem, Tel Aviv and Haifa as well as annual hikes and weekend retreats that attract many members. These meetings provide a space where religious gays can socialize in a loving and accepting environment.

It was founded in 1945 and was the only newspaper printed in the Greek language during the Socialist People's Republic of Albania. Background After World War II, Albania as part of the Eastern Bloc, was governed by a Communist regime led by Enver Hoxha. Communist Albania was one of the last surviving Stalinist regimes worldwide, in which press remained under tight dictatorial control until the collapse of the Eastern Bloc political class. This regime suppressed the local Greek communities, and took measures to disperse it or at least keep it loyal to Albania. Under these circumstances, ethnic Greeks, who are traditionally concentrated in parts of the country's south (Northern Epirus), were subject to serious human rights abuses, particularly in terms of religious freedom, education in Greek language and freedom of publication. Founding and censorship (1945‚Äì1991) Laiko Vima was founded on 25 May 1945,Frantzi 2006: p. 5 by the local branch of the Party of Labour of Albania and was the only newspaper in the Greek language for the needs of the local communities. Laiko Vima was published in Gjirokast√´r, home to large number of Greek minority members, and was distributed only to Gjirokast√´r District. The newspaper was an organ of the local branch of the Party of Labour, and every article was subject to heavy censorship. In 1956 Laiko Vima started to host a literary page, initially edited by Panos Tsoukas, who was an active member of the Party of Labour. During 1960‚Äì1968 the literary page was suspended but reappeared in 1968‚Äì1988, this time edited by the poet Andreas Zarbalas. From 1988 to 1991 it evolved into a separate literary magazine with the title: The people's literary tribune (). This featured poems and prose pieces by both established and new writers, for whom it functioned as the antechamber for further publishing. Moreover, various poems used allegory and metaphors in order to evade censorship.Frantzi 2006: pp. 7, 8 In 1970, after 25 years of circulation, the newspaper was awarded by Enver Hoxha as having played a major role in the revolutionary education of the Greek minority. Post-communist period Vladimir Putin with editor of the Vima newspaper Efstathios Efstathiadis In early 1991, following the fall of the communist regime and liberalization in Albania, Laiko Vima continued to be published but now as a private newspaper owned by local Greeks in Gjirokast√´r. Besides Laiko Vima, which is still in circulation, several other Greek newspapers as well as magazines are published in the areas in which ethnic Greek communities live and are also available in parts of nearby Greece.

Among the malignant brain cancers, gliomas of the brainstem and pons, glioblastoma multiforme, and high- grade (highly anaplastic) astrocytoma are among the worst. In these cases, untreated survival usually amounts to only a few months, and survival with current radiation and chemotherapy treatments may extend that time from around a year to a year and a half, possibly two or more, depending on the patient's condition, immune function, treatments used, and the specific type of malignant brain neoplasm. Surgery may in some cases be curative, but, as a general rule, malignant brain cancers tend to regenerate and emerge from remission easily, especially highly malignant cases. In such cases, the goal is to excise as much of the mass (tumor cells) and as much of the tumor margin as possible without endangering vital functions or other important cognitive abilities. The Journal of Neuro-Oncology is the longest continuously published journal in the field and serves as a leading reference to those practicing in the area of neuro-oncology. General information =Primary tumors of the central nervous system= Primary brain tumors can occur at any age, from infancy to late in life. These tumors often afflict people during their prime years. Factors such as age, tumor location, and clinical presentation are helpful in differential diagnosis. Most types of primary brain tumors are more common in men with the exception of meningiomas, which are more common in women.McAllister, L.D., Ward, J.H., Schulman, S.F., DeAngels, L.M. (2002). Practical Neuro-Oncology: A Guide to Patient Care. Woburn, MA: Butterworth- Heinemann. Human Central Nervous System =Metastatic tumors of the central nervous system= Cancer spreads to the nervous system by direct invasion, compression, or metastasis. Direct invasion or compression from continuous tissues relates to the proximity of the nervous system to other structures, such as the brachial plexus, lumbosacral plexus, vertebral neuroforamina, base of skull, cranium, and pelvic bones. Intracranial metastasis There are three types of intracranial metastasis: brain metastasis, dural metastasis, and leptomeningeal metastasis. Brain metastasis can be single or multiple and involve any portion of the brain. Metastasis to dural structures generally occurs by hematogenous spread or direct invasion from a contiguous bone. Dural metastases can invade the underlying brain and cause focal edema and associated neurologic symptoms. These processes tend to cause seizures early in the course because of their cortical location. Metastasis to the leptomeninges is an uncommon but well-recognized clinical presentation in cancer patients. Leptomeningeal metastasis most commonly is due to breast, lung, or melanoma primary tumors. Skull metastasis Metastases to the skull are divided into two categories by general site: calvarium and skull base. Metastases to the calvarium usually are asymptomatic. Metastases to the skull base quickly become symptomatic because of their proximity to cranial nerves and vascular structures. Spinal metastasis The spine most often is affected by metastatic disease involving the epidural space. This usually occurs as direct tumor spread from a vertebral body (85%) or by invasion of paravertebral masses through a neuroforamin (10‚Äì15%). =Genetic syndromes and risk factors= There are multiple hereditary conditions that increase a person's chance of developing brain tumors. =Nongenetic risk factors= Few issues in medicine are as potentially contentious as the suspicion of environmental and occupational causes of cancer, including brain tumors. Prior cranial irradiation is the only risk factor that definitely predisposes to brain tumor formation. Some of the risk factors are ionizing radiation, nonionizing radiation, nitrosamines and industrial chemicals. Mechanisms =Tumor factors= Histology Seizures are common in patients with low-grade tumors such as dysembryoblastic neuroepithelial tumors, gangligliomas, and oligodendrogliomas. The rapid growth of fast-growing high- grade brain tumors may damage the subcortical network essential for electrical transmission, whereas slow-growing tumors have been suggested to induce partial deafferentation of cortical regions, causing denervation hypersensitivity and producing an epileptogenic milieu. Studies strongly suggest that genetic factors may play a role in tumor development and tumor- related epilepsy.Smits, A. (2011). Seizures and the natural history of World Health Organization grade II gliomas: a review. Neurosurgery (2011): 1326-1333. Tumor location The location of tumors is closely related to their histology. The majority of glioneuronal tumors occur in the temporal lobe. Some data have shown that oligodendroglial tumors were more likely to be located in frontal lobe, whereas astrocytomas were more commonly found in temporal locations. It may be postulated that tumor-related seizures have unique characteristics, which may share some common genetic pathways with tumorigenesis. Blood-brain barrier disruption (BBB) Human and animal studies have suggested that perturbations in neurovascular integrity and breakdown of the BBB lead to neuronal hypersynchronization and epileptiform activity. Relevant molecular changes in brain tumors that affect BBB structure and function include decreased expression of transmembrane junctional proteins and heightened release of vascular endothelial growth factor. Results suggest that pathological disruption of the BBB in brain tumor patients may contribute to seizure activity. =Peri-tumoral factors= Contemporary imaging techniques provide testimony to the remarkable differences between the peri- tumoral brain and normal tissue. Morphological changes Certain morphological changes in the peri-tumoral brain tissue, such as persistent neurons in the white matter, inefficient neuronal migration, and changes in synaptic vesicles, are also believed to contribute to seizure generation. Hypoxia, acidosis and metabolic changes Tumors with insufficient blood supply often cause interstitial hypoxia, which subsequently contributes to acidosis. The intratumoral hypoxia and acidosis may extend to the surrounding tissue. Furthermore, hypoxia causes acidosis as a consequence of both heightened metabolic requirements of the proliferating tissue and impaired oxidative energy metabolism. Ionic changes Ionic changes in the peri- tumoral zone may influence neuronal activity. An interesting hypothesis was proposed by Sontheimer, who suggested that glioma invasion into the peri- tumoral zone is in part mediated by chloride channel overexpression, allowing cells to traverse the extracellular space through rapid changes in cell shape. Glutamate neurotransmission Recent work has demonstrated a close link between seizure activity and high extracellular glutamate in tumor-related epilepsy. Glutamate activation of ionotropic receptors leads to a rapid excitatory signal based on cation influx that can cause release of calcium from intracellular stores. Initial patient evaluation and care 1\\\\. Brain Tumor Presentations In general, patients with primary brain tumors or single metastatic tumors can present with any of these signs and symptoms, whereas patients with multiple brain metastases tend to present with generalized symptoms and may lack localized findings. Several clinical features warrant special comment: *Seizures (partial or generalized) are the presenting symptom in 15-20% of patients with intracranial tumors. Seizures occur in up to 50% of patients with melanoma metastases, oligodendrogliomas, and tumors that have a hemorrhagic component. Seizures also are more common with cortically based tumors. *Seizures are much less common in patients with infratentorial tumors than in those with supratentorial tumors. *\\"Stroke-like\\" onset of symptoms is due to hemorrhage within the tumor or, less commonly, macroscopic tumor embolus from systemic cancer. *Although intratumoral hemorrhage can occur in any primary or metastatic brain tumor, certain tumors have a greater tendency to bleed, including metastasis from melanoma, choriocarcinoma, and thyroid cancer and the primary brain tumors glioblastoma and oligodendroglioma. 2\\\\. Spinal Cord Tumor Presentations *Pain is the first symptom in >90% of patients presenting with epidural metastasis and occurs less frequently with intradural tumors.Muller, H. L., Gebhardt, U., Warmuth-Metz, M., Pietsch, T., Sorensen, N., & Kortmann, R. D. (2012). Meningioma assecond malignant neoplasm after oncological treatment during childhood. 188, 438-441. Retrieved from *Mechanisms of pain include spinal cord ischemia and traction on the periosteum, dura, nearby soft tissues, and nerve roots. *Pain occasionally can be absent in adults and more often is absent in childhood. If other neurologic symptoms suggestive of myelopathy are present, without pain, the clinician should evaluate for spinal cord tumor. *Changes in bowel and bladder habits, particularly urinary retention with overflow incontinence, usually occur late in the course of epidural spinal cord compression but are seen in a small percentage of patients at presentation. 3\\\\. Approach to the Evaluation of New Patients The initial evaluation of a patient with a newly diagnosed tumor of the nervous system is a critical step toward appropriate management and patient care. The most important portions of the initial evaluation are a detailed history and a thorough examination. This process serves to identify the extent and nature of neurological deficit, provides diagnostic clues, can help disclose a source of metastasis, or may identify a genetic process associated with a primary central nervous system tumor. 4\\\\. Practical Strategies for Providing Appropriate Patient Care There is no question that the clinical management of neurooncology patients is challenging. However, if we are to help patients and ultimately make advances in treating these tumors, meticulous and compassionate care of patients with neurological malignancies are crucial. *Give instructions both orally and in written form for the patient to take home. *Use a consistent format of written instructions, so that a patient can expect where to find information on the page. *Write down new or important diagnoses for the patient to refer to at home. *Identify one reliable caregiver to serve as a contact point. *Pictures and diagrams are helpful. *A team approach, using clinicians with different areas of expertise, is helpful. *Provide a reliable and simple method for the patient to seek help. *Minimize sedating drug use. Diagnostic procedures =Diagnostic imaging of the brain and spinal cord= The imaging studies commonly used in neurooncology are computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Less commonly used are myelography, positron emission tomography (PET), and diagnostic angiography. =Lumbar puncture and cerebrospinal fluid analysis= Lumbar puncture (LP) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis are important for the evaluation of some primary tumors, metastatic conditions, and neurologic complications of cancer. =Pathologic diagnosis= Accurate histologic diagnosis is critical for treatment planning and patient counseling. Surgically obtained tissue usually is required to make a histologic diagnosis. For certain tumors, a definitive diagnosis can be accomplished by vitreous aspirate, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cytology, or suggested by the presence of certain tumor markers in the CSF. Commonly used treatments # Radiotherapy Radiotherapy is an important treatment for central nervous system tumors and has been demonstrated to extend survival and improve the quality of life for patients with many of the primary and metastatic brain tumors. # Chemotherapy Chemotherapy, or the use of drugs in the treatment of cancer, can lead to the long-term control of many malignancies. Some tumors, such as testicular cancer of Hodgkin's disease, may be cured even when they are widespread. As chemotherapy may be associated with severe toxicity, it should be given under the supervision of one skilled in the administration and monitoring of such agents. # Corticosteroids Corticosteroids (CS) are commonly used in patients with a variety of neuro- oncologic conditions. CS treatment often is required to control symptoms related to increased intracranial pressure (ICP) or peritumoral edema.Duffau, H. (2012). The challenge to remove diffuse low-grade gliomas while preserving brain functions. 10(7), 569-574. # Neurosurgical Interventions Neurosurgical intervention is warranted in almost all cases of primary central nervous system tumors and for many metastatic tumors. A biopsy usually establishes a definitive histologic diagnosis. The role of surgery depends on the nature of the tumor. With modern neurosurgical techniques, most patients with extra-axial brain tumors are cured with minimal residual neurologic deficit. Specific tumors =Primary tumors= 1\\\\. Malignant Astrocytomas Malignant astrocytomas are the most common primary brain tumors in adults. Malignant astrocytomas generate symptoms and signs by mass effect, local brain infiltration, tissue destruction, cerebral edema, and increased intracranial pressure. Headaches and seizures are the most frequent initial symptoms. Associated focal neurologic signs and symptoms occur depending on the anatomic location of the tumor. Confusion and mental status difficulties occur in patients with large tumors, those that cross the corpus callosum and those with a lot of associated edema. 2\\\\. Other Astrocytomas Tumors of presumed or known astrocytic lineage other than the malignant astrocytomas include a variety of tumors categorized by histology, location, age of onset, and natural history. 3\\\\. Oligodendrogliomas The oligodendrogliomas include low- grade oligodendroglioma, anaplastic oligodendroglioma, and oligoastrocytoma (mixed glioma). This group of tumors, although less common than astrocytomas, has received increased attention in the past decade because of reports of chemosensitivity and a favorable survival rate when compared with astrocytomas of similar grade. 4\\\\. Brain Stem Gliomas Brain stem glioma is a distinct category of central nervous system tumor because of its unique location and behavior. The histology of brain stem gliomas spans the spectrum of gliomas located elsewhere in the central nervous system. The cause of these tumors is still unknown. Researchers have not found any direct genetic link. 5\\\\. Pituitary Region Tumors A wide variety of tumors can occur in and around the sella turcica. The most common tumors in this region are craniopharyngiomas, pituitary adenomas, meningiomas, and optic chiasm gliomas. Visual impairment is a common presenting symptom, due to compression or invasion of the optic chiasm. 6\\\\. Germ Cell and Pineal Region Tumors Most tumors of the pineal region are either germinomas or pineal cell tumors, and are tumors of adolescents and young adults. Presentation relates to the location in the nervous system.Bauer, S., May, C., Dionysiou, D., Stamatakos, G., Buchler, P., & Reyes, M. (2012). Multiscale modeling for image analysis of brain tumor studies.59(1), 25-29. Retrieved from http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.prx.library.gatech.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber;=5970097 7\\\\. Medulloblastoma and Other Primitive Neuroectodermal Tumors Medulloblastoma and other primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNETs) are a group of highly aggressive central nervous system tumors with a tendency to spread via cerebrospinal fluid pathways. These typically are tumors of childhood and young adulthood. 8\\\\. Meningiomas and Other Meningeal Tumors Meningioma is the most common tumor in the central nervous system. Although most are slow growing and histologically benign, they can induce significant symptoms depending on location. 9\\\\. Tumors of the Optic Nerve and Chiasm These tumors include the tumors involving the orbit and optic pathways, which include optic nerve gliomas and optic nerve sheath meningiomas.Campen, C. J., Dearlove, J., Partap, S., Murphy, P., Gibbs, I. C., Dahl, G. V., & Fisher, P. G. (2012). Concurrent cyclophosphamide and craniospinal radiotherapy for pediatric high- risk embryonal brain tumors. 10(J), Retrieved from 10\\\\. Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL), a rare central nervous system tumor, occurs preferentially in immunocompromised patients; however, it is increasing in incidence in both the HIV and non-HIV populations. 11\\\\. Primary Spinal Cord Tumors Primary spinal cord tumors are uncommon and most are either astrocytomas or ependymomas. =Metastatic tumors= 1\\\\. Spinal Cord Metastasis The management of spinal cord metastasis depends on whether or not the metastasis is causing epidural spinal cord compression as well as the overall status of the patient's systemic cancer. 2\\\\. Brain Metastasis The occurrence of brain metastases represents a significant challenge in the care of patients with cancer. Symptoms may significantly alter the quality of life of affected patients, and brain metastases generally represent overall treatment failure. Long-term survival is poor. 3\\\\. Leptomeningeal Metastasis Leptomeningeal metastasis (LM) is a rare complication of systemic cancer in which the leptomeninges are infiltrated by cancer cells. The overall incidence is 3‚Äì8% but is increasing as more cancer patients survive following initial treatment.

The purpose of palliative care is not to cure but to prevent or treat, as early as possible, the symptoms and side effects of the disease and its treatment, in addition to the related psychological, social, and spiritual problems. Palliative care is also called comfort care, supportive care, and symptom management. Palliative care is provided throughout a patient‚Äôs experience with cancer. It usually begins at diagnosis and continues through treatment, follow-up care, and the end of life. =Cancer pain management= Key points for cancer pain management: * Cancer pain can be managed. * Controlling pain is part of a patient's cancer treatment. * Talking openly with the physician and health care team helps them manage one's pain. * The best way to control pain is to stop it from starting or keep it from getting worse. * There are many different medicines to control pain. Everyone's pain control plan is different. * Patients keeping a record of their pain helps create the best pain control plan. * People who take cancer pain medicines as prescribed rarely become addicted to them. * Your body does not become immune to pain medicine. Stronger medicines should not be saved for \\"later\\". =Treatment implications for tumor-related epilepsy= Studies on adult patients demonstrated that gross total resection or even extended lesionectomy could greatly improve seizure prognosis. The fact that both tumoral and peri- tumoral factors contribute to the pathogenesis of tumor-related epilepsy suggests that VPA should be considered as a first line therapy in treating tumor-related epilepsy.

He is the drummer and vocalist of the metalcore band Atreyu. He is responsible for the melodic singing found in the band's music. He is the band's primary songwriter, along with guitarist Dan Jacobs. Following Atreyu's hiatus in 2011, Saller focused on his side project Hell or Highwater, where he is the lead vocalist. In 2011, the group released their debut album, Begin Again, in 2011. The band released an EP entitled The Other Side in August 2013. Saller returned to Atreyu in 2014 and has remained a full-time member of the group since. Atreyu At 13, Saller was invited by his older brother Ryan to join a band started by some of his friends, Dan Jacobs and Alex Varkatzas. The three of them formed a street punk band called Retribution, which by 1998, had adapted a heavier sound and changed names to Atreyu after the main character of The Neverending Story. The band signed to Victory Records in 2001 and released 3 albums under the label, Suicide Notes and Butterfly Kisses in 2002, The Curse in 2004, and A Death-Grip on Yesterday in 2006. The band later joined major label Hollywood Records and released 2007's Lead Sails Paper Anchor and 2009's Congregation of the Damned. After over 10 years of worldwide success, the band embarked on hiatus, but returned in 2014. They released their sixth studio album, Long Live in 2015. =Vocal duties= Saller did not sing on the band's 1998 EP, Visions, as he only played drums for the band at that time. Between Visions and Fractures in the Facade of Your Porcelain Beauty, Saller learned to sing while playing drums and became the band's clean vocalist. On Suicide Notes and Butterfly Kisses, his vocals were largely confined to choruses, however, as Atreyu's career went on, Saller's vocals would get more and more frequent, and they would become a major part of Atreyu's sound. Hell or Highwater Formerly the Black Cloud Collective, Hell or Highwater resulted out of Saller's solo material and eventually became a full band. He is solely the band's vocalist. The band released their debut album, Begin Again, independently on iTunes in 2011. After touring for over a year, the band recouped and released an EP, entitled The Other Side in August 2013.

After reaffirming Resolution 733 (1992) and all of its subsequent resolutions on the situation in Somalia, the Council addressed measures to resolve the situation and extended the mandate of the United Nations Operation in Somalia II (UNOSOM II) until 30 September 1994. The Somali parties and factions were urged to work towards reconciliation and to abide by the agreements and commitments they entered into, and a statement the parties released to that effect was welcomed. The declaration would also establish procedures for the reconciliation conference, elect a president, vice- president and prime minister, and complete and review the formation of an independent legal system. There was concern at the delays in the reconciliation process and the deteriorating security situation in Somalia. Fighting, banditry, violence and armed attacks on humanitarian aid workers were condemned. The safety of workers and United Nations personnel was important, with tributes paid to those who had lost their lives in Somalia from several countries. The Council also took note that the Somali leaders had asked for the continued support of UNOSOM II during the reconciliation and rehabilitation efforts, while the UNOSOM II was expected to be complete by March 1995. Acting under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, the Council extended the mandate of UNOSOM II until 30 September 1994 on the subject of a review submitted by the Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali no later than 29 July 1994 concerning the humanitarian, political and security situation in Somalia and its future. All parties had to cooperate with UNOSOM II and their obligations, including those on voluntary disarmament, and immediately negotiate further. The Council demanded that violence and intimidation against humanitarian workers end, and reaffirmed that the arms embargo placed on Somalia was compulsory. The progress in establishing the justice and police programmes by UNOSOM II was welcomed, along with Member States which provided assistance in this manner. Finally, the continuing importance of UNOSOM II having the necessary troops, civilian personnel, equipment, financial and logistic support to carry out its mandate was stressed.

Biography Bar was born in Kfar Yona during the Mandate era to parents of Kurdish Jewish origin. His father changed the family name from Barazani to Bar at the recommendation of David Ben-Gurion. Bar studied at the Tcherniovsky high school in Netanya. In 1954, Bar joined the Israel Defense Forces as a combat soldier in the Givati Brigade, and became an officer.

Bar fought as the commander of Paratrooper Battalion 202 during the Six-Day War, participating in combat operations in Gaza City. In 1968, he participated in the Battle of Karameh. He later served as the deputy commander of the 275th brigade and as commander of the ID school of officer training. In October 1973, one day before the Yom Kippur War broke out, he was appointed commander of the 820th Brigade, which was positioned on the Golan Heights, and commanded that brigade through the war. He later testified before the Agranat Commission, an Israeli government investigation of failures that occurred during that war. He was then transferred to the Armored Corps and commanded the 166th Brigade, which was based in northern Israel.

He belonged to the Phagmodrupa Dynasty which was the dominating regime in Tibet from 1354 to 1435 and maintained a degree of authority until the early 17th century. His rule is sometimes considered to be the last of importance in the history of the dynasty.http://www.densatil.org/rulinghouse.html ; Tsepon W.D. Shakabpa, Tibet. A Political History. Yale 1967, p. 88-90; Giuseppe Tucci, Tibetan Painted Scrolls. Rome 1949, Vol. I, p. 45. Political background The earliest years of Ngawang Tashi Drakpa's life was also a time when the political authority of the Phagmodrupa regime was at its nadir. The dynasty originally wielded strong executive power over Central Tibet (√ú and Tsang), but after 1435 the various fiefs gained an autonomous position. In particular the royal court in N√™dong was overshadowed by the Rinpungpa family, whose principal stronghold was Samdrubtse (Shigatse in Tsang, West Central Tibet). This family acted as patrons to the Karmapa lama, whose religious influence in √ú (East Central Tibet) was greatly enhanced when the Rinpungpa captured Lhasa in 1498.Tsepon W.D. Shakabpa, 1967, p. 86-8. The ties between Karmapa and Rinpungpa were not unconditional, however, since the former did not wish to see their activities and decisions determined by a secular hegemon. Later on, this led the Karmapa and Shamarpa hierarchs to support a revival of Phagmodrupa power.Olaf Czaja, Medieval rule in Tibet. Wien 2013, p. 249. Troubled childhood Ngawang Tashi Drakpa was born in 1488 as the only son of King Ngagi Wangpo and his consort Lady Dsongkhama. His mother died when he was only one year old, followed by the father in 1491.Giuseppe Tucci. Deb T'er Dmar Po Gsar Ma. Rome 1971, pp. 226-7. Due to his minority a regent was appointed at the N√™dong court. The person chosen was Tsokye Dorje, a member of the increasingly powerful Rinpungpa. In 1499, after a turbulent regency, Tsokye Dorje handed over powers to Ngawang Tashi Drakpa who was enthroned as king (gongma, \\"the high one\\", \\"superior\\"). Five years later the young ruler married a Rinpungpa lady out of political expediency. This consort, Legtso Gyalmo, bore him two sons, namely Drowai Gonpo (1508-1548) and Drakpa Jungne (1508-1570).Giuseppe Tucci, 1949, Vol. II, p. 641; Giuseppe Tucci, 1971, p. 227-8. He later married Sangye Pal Dzomma of the house of Nelpa, a strong- willed woman who actively assisted her husband in expanding their common power base. She was, in a modern assessment, \\"one of the most powerful and fascinating female rulers in Tibet\\".Per K. S√∏rensen & Guntram Hazod, Rulers on the Celestial Plain. Wien 2007, p. 763. The Phagmodrupa regain power The years around 1500 saw the summit of Rinpungpa authority in the central parts of Tibet. The leader of the family was Donyo Dorje, a nephew of the ex-regent Tsokye Dorje. His allegiance to the Karmapa hierarch Ch√∂drak Gyatso led him to harass the monks of the Gelugpa sect (the Yellow Hats) in the Lhasa area. The Karmapa and Shamarpa hierarchs nevertheless strove to consolidate the authority of the young Ngawang Tashi Drakpa. In 1510, just after the death of the ex-regent Tsokye Dorje, a conflict escalated between Donyo Dorje and Ngawang Tashi Namgyal. After the demise of Donyo Dorje in 1512, the fortunes of the Rinpungpa eventually began to wane. In a long series of petty wars over the next years, the gongma and his allies pushed back the Rinpungpa positions.Giuseppe Tucci, 1971, p. 229-33. In 1517 the latter lost control over Lhasa. The gongma now resolved to increase his religious network by lifting the restrictions of the Gelugpa, without antagonizing the Karmapa.Olaf Czaja, 2013, p. 255. In the next year the Monlam (prayer) festival could be celebrated in Lhasa by the Gelugpa monks, for the first time in twenty years. They had previously been impeded from participating by the Rinpungpa troops. Queen Sangye Pal Dzomma was a main sponsor of the festival, and had close contacts with the Second Dalai Lama, the leading Gelugpa figure.Per K. S√∏rensen & Guntram Hazod, 2007, p. 53. The power of the Rinpungpa was henceforth mainly restricted to Tsang. The historical sources give a generally favourable image of Ngawang Tashi Drakpa and his queen, as being successful in warfare and great patrons of all the major religious sites in the Lhasa area.Sarat Chandra Das, 'A short history of the House of Phagdu'. Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal 1905, p. 206. In his chronicle The Song of the Spring Queen, the Fifth Dalai Lama calls him King of Tibet, although this epithet must be qualified.Giuseppe Tucci, 1949, Vol I, p. 45. The outlying areas Ngari, Amdo and Kham seem to have been outside his political network, and Tsang did not generally obey his authority. Relationship with China Since ancient times, the Phagmodrupa dynasty stood in a nominal tribute relationship with China. Emperors would confer titles and gifts to new rulers, but did not intervene in the internal affairs of Central Tibet. The dynastic annals of the Ming Dynasty, the Mingshi, are fairly vague on Tibetan politics in this era. They complain about violence committed by monks bringing tribute in the Yangzhou district in 1495. The court of Beijing sent envoys with an admonition to the Phagmodrupa ruler to punish the monks. Arriving to Tibet they heard that the former ruler Kunga Lekpa had died (actually back in 1481 according to Tibetan chronicles), and that his \\"son\\" (actually nephew) Ngagi Wangpo asked for investiture. The imperial investiture was brought to Tibet with two monks. At closer inspection it turned out that Ngagi Wangpo was dead as well. The two envoys therefore gave the investiture to his son in turn, whom they called Awang Dashi Daba Jianzan (Ngawang Tashi Drakpa Gyaltsen). The Chinese authorities at home were dissatisfied with the self-willed decision of the envoys, but did not change the state of matters. Intermittent Phagmodrupa tributes continued to be dispatched to the Ming for the rest of Ngawang Tashi Drakpa's long reign. Apart from that a large number of Tibetan local regimes sent tribute, which was in reality a trade exchange; in 1524 these \\"tributaries\\" were as many as 37.Giuseppe Tucci, 1949, Vol. II, p. 693. Family disputes By the mid-16th century the physical faculties of Ngawang Tashi Drakpa began to decline. His son Drowai Gonpo (1508‚Äì1548) was established as ruler in Gongri Karpo, to the west of N√™dong, and his sons in turn caused trouble for the ageing gongma. Rebellions against the Phagmodrupa ruler took place in 1553-54 and forced him to step down in favour of his grandson Ngawang Drakpa Gyaltsen. New political turmoil erupted in √ú in 1555; eventually a general council was held and Ngawang Tashi Drakpa was returned to power, in 1556 or 1557.Olaf Czaja, 2013, p. 271. These disturbances underpinned the rise to power of a family of feudatories, the Kyish√∂pa, who resided close to Lhasa. They became the leading political power in the area in the second half of the 16th century.Per K. Sorensen & Guntram Hazod, 2007, p. 767-8. From 1559 the old Ngawang Tashi Drakpa entertained a close relationship with the Third Dalai Lama. The Jiajing Emperor issued a patent in 1562 where a certain Drakpa Tashi Gyaltsen, son of the old ruler, was appointed as his successor since the father was old and sick and unable to run the affairs.Peter Schwieger, 'Significance of Ming titles conferred upon the Phag mo gru rulers: A reevaluation of Chinese-Tibetan relations during the Ming Dynasty', The Tibet Journal 34-35 2009/10, p. 318. http://www.ltwa.net/library/images/downloads/publication/procedings2009.pdf This Drakpa Tashi Gyaltsen is otherwise unknown, unless the document alludes to the king's grandson Ngawang Drakpa Gyaltsen of the Gongri Karpo branch of the dynasty. What is known is that Ngawang Drakpa Gyaltsen strove to grab power from the frail monarch. Ngawang Tashi Drakpa eventually died in 1564. Two branches of the family then competed for power, and the mediation of the Dalai Lama was called for. Ngawang Drakpa Gyaltsen was eventually acknowledged as his successor in 1576, but by now the powers of the Phagmodrupa were eclipsed.Giuseppe Tucci, 1949, Vol. I, pp. 44-5. The statement of Tsepon W.D. Shakabpa, 1967, p. 92, that the king who died in 1564 was Drakpa Jungne, is certainly incorrect. Although gongmas continued to be appointed up to the early 17th century, the main struggle for power in Tibet was henceforth between the Gelugpa and the Karmapa and their patrons, the Tsangpa.

It is also the 120th and 121st episodes overall of the series. It aired on ABC in the United States on May 23, 2010. In the episode, the Man in Black (Terry O'Quinn) executes his plan to destroy the island as Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) tries to stop him once and for all. Meanwhile, the true nature of this season's \\"flash-sideways\\" narrative device is revealed. The finale was written by co-creator/executive producer Damon Lindelof and executive producer Carlton Cuse, and directed by executive producer Jack Bender. Unlike the previous season finales, which were two hours long with advertisements, the series finale was expanded by half an hour, running two and a half hours starting at 9 pm ET, with a retrospective of the past six seasons running for two hours, starting at 7 pm. \\"The End\\" was watched by 13.5 million Americans and received a polarized response from both fans and critics. Reviewers from the Chicago Tribune and IGN called it the best episode of the season and praised its emotion and character. Reviews from the Los Angeles Times and The Philadelphia Inquirer criticized the finale for answering so few of the series' questions. Web site Metacritic gave \\"The End\\" a score of 74 out of 100, suggesting \\"mostly positive reviews\\", while The Guardian and The Daily Telegraph reported mixed and \\"lukewarm\\" reviews. Retrospective reviews have been more negative, with the episode now being remembered by some as one of the worst series finales of all time. Plot =Flash sideways= Desmond gathers many of the islanders at the benefit concert of Daniel Widmore (Jeremy Davies) and DriveShaft. One by one, each protagonist begins to recognize one another based on close contact with a person or object that was important to them throughout their time on the island, receiving flashes of memory. Eventually, most of them remember their past lives and are drawn to the church that was to be the site of Jack's father's funeral. John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) regains the use of his legs after being successfully operated on by Jack. After remembering his time on the island through the flashes of memory, Locke attempts to convince Jack of the truth, but Jack, although also experiencing flashes of memory, resists the revelation. Locke later meets Ben outside the church where Locke forgives him for murdering him. Ben then meets Hurley, who says everyone is inside, motioning him to join them, but Ben elects to stay outside. As Hurley heads back inside, he says to Ben that he was a \\"real good number two...\\", to which Ben replies back that Hurley was a \\"great number one\\". Kate later encounters Jack, and while her presence causes him to experience more flashes, he continues to resist. She takes him to the church and instructs him to enter through the back door, telling him the others will be waiting for him. In the church, he enters a room where there are symbols not just of Christianity, but also of other faiths such as Hinduism, Judaism, Islam etc. He then encounters his father's coffin. He opens the coffin lid and discovers it to be empty. Christian Shephard (John Terry) then appears behind him. Jack slowly comes to realize that he is dead as well. After an emotional embrace, Christian reassures him that the events leading up to now actually happened and the time he spent with the people on the island was \\"the most important period\\" of his life. He explains to Jack that time has no meaning in this place and that they \\"made\\" the place to \\"find each other\\", independent of the time at which they died. Christian explains that place exists so the Oceanic 815 survivors could \\"let go\\" and \\"move on\\" together. Jack and Christian go out into the church to meet the others. Everyone is able to see, recognize, and remember everyone else and their lives together. After an emotional reunion, Christian opens the front doors, revealing another bright light that slowly envelops everyone inside the church. =On the island= Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox), Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) and Hugo \\"Hurley\\" Reyes (Jorge Garcia) head to the heart of the island, while James \\"Sawyer\\" Ford (Josh Holloway) goes after Desmond Hume (Henry Ian Cusick), who was thrown into a well. Arriving there, Sawyer is confronted by Ben Linus (Michael Emerson) and the Man in Black (Terry O'Quinn), who reveals his plan to destroy the island. Sawyer then steals Ben's rifle and reunites with Jack's group. Jack then tells Sawyer that he plans to confront the Man in Black. At the same time, Desmond, having been rescued by Rose Henderson (L. Scott Caldwell) and Bernard Nadler (Sam Anderson), is confronted by the Man in Black, who has Ben with him. The Man in Black threatens to kill Rose and Bernard if Desmond does not come with him, and he complies, provided the Man in Black leaves the couple unharmed. Meanwhile, Miles Straume (Ken Leung) finds a no longer ageless Richard Alpert (Nestor Carbonell) in the jungle, and they set out by boat to destroy the Ajira plane which would allow the Man in Black to escape. Along the way, they rescue Frank Lapidus (Jeff Fahey), who had survived the destruction of the submarine, and they decide to leave the island by using the plane. On the way to the heart of the Island, Jack's group encounters the Man in Black's group. Jack tells the Man in Black that he is going to kill him, and together with Desmond, they travel to the heart of the Island. Jack tells Sawyer that he believes Desmond can kill the Man in Black because he thinks Jacob brought him back not as bait but as a weapon. Desmond tells Jack that destroying the island and killing the Man in Black do not matter because he is going down to the heart of the island and leaving for another place. Jack and the Man in Black lower Desmond down to the heart of the island and he reaches a chamber, leading to a glowing pool with an elongated stone at its center. Immune to the pool's electromagnetic energy, Desmond manages to remove the giant stone stopper in the center of the pool. However, the light goes out and the pool dries up, setting about the destruction of the island which the Man in Black predicted. A result of Desmond's act is an unforeseen side-effect of making the Man in Black mortal again. During a prolonged fight, the Man in Black stabs Jack in the same spot where his appendix was taken out and almost kills him when Kate shoots the Man in Black in the back, allowing Jack to kick him off the cliff to his death. The island continues to crumble and Jack realizes that he has to restore the light of the heart of the Island. He tells Kate to get Claire Littleton (Emilie de Ravin) on the plane and leave the island in case he fails. The two profess their love for each other and Kate leaves with Sawyer while Hurley and Ben follow Jack back to the pool. Kate and Sawyer travel to Hydra Island via Desmond's boat Elizabeth, to the site of the Ajira Airlines plane where Lapidus, Richard and Miles have been quickly trying to make it air-worthy. Kate convinces Claire she can help her raise Aaron and they head for the plane. After Kate, Sawyer and Claire board the plane, Lapidus successfully gets it off the island. Jack leads Hurley and Ben back to the heart of the Island, where Jack convinces an emotional Hurley to take over as the protector of the island, stating Hurley was always meant to be the leader. Hurley and Ben lower Jack to the dry pool where he rescues a barely conscious Desmond. Jack manages to restore the light by replacing the stone plug, and is enveloped in the light that surrounds him. Hurley, in his role as the new protector of the island, does not know what to do. Ben tells him he should help Desmond get home and suggests there may be a better way of protecting the island than how Jacob did. Hurley asks him for help, and Ben is honored. Jack reawakens outside by a river and walks toward the bamboo forest. After Jack collapses to the ground, Vincent approaches him and lies next to him. Jack gazes happily at the sky while watching the Ajira plane fly overhead away from the island. Jack slowly closes his eyes as he dies. Production Michael Emerson said that the ending grew \\"more satisfying\\" the more he thought about it. Damon Lindelof, producer, reported on his Twitter page that the finale completed shooting in Hawaii on April 24, 2010, exactly six years after filming was completed on the show's pilot. When interviewed about the finale, Carlton Cuse stated that it had a real, definite resolution instead of a snow globe, waking up in bed, it's all been a dream, cut to black' kind of ending,\\" referencing the series finales of St. Elsewhere, Newhart, and The Sopranos, respectively. Only Fox and O'Quinn's scripts explained the nature of the Sideways world; Lindelof and Cuse explained its meaning to the others while filming the church scene, the last time the cast members were together.Sepinwall, Alan. \\"Comic-Con: 'Hawaii Five-0' cashes in on its 'Lost' & 'Battlestar Galactica' nerd-cred \\" HitFix, July 23, 2010. They have expressed satisfaction regarding the finale; Daniel Dae Kim stated \\"If you think about how many pieces the writers had to put together in order to make it fall into place, it‚Äôs mind-boggling, and they did such a great job...

After I read it, I had to sit for five or 10 minutes, just reflecting and digesting, because it definitely makes an impact.\\" Emerson said: Carbonell described the finale as being \\"all about everyone‚Äôs resolutions.\\" Cusick said \\"There are so many walks of life getting together to talk about the show and so many issues to be brought up and that's exactly what the ending will bring up. People will be talking about it for weeks afterwards and that's what the show has always done.\\" Instead of being displayed along with ABC promotional material (which in most cases would consist of a preview of the next Lost episode), the finale's closing credits are shown alongside various shots of the Oceanic 815 plane wreckage. However, this footage was not added by the producers of the show and is not considered a part of the actual episode. ABC independently decided to add the footage as a soft, nostalgic transition between the final scene and upcoming local news broadcast. After the finale, a post-finale special of Jimmy Kimmel Live!, titled Jimmy Kimmel Live: Aloha to Lost, aired at 12:05 am, showing three alternate endings, which turned out to be finale spoofs from Survivor, The Sopranos, and Newhart. An ABC source reported that the DVD and Blu-ray release of season six will feature twenty minutes of additional scenes, some of which will have answers to questions, cut from the storyline because of running time. =Returning actors= All former series regulars who appear (Jeremy Davies, Maggie Grace, Rebecca Mader, Elizabeth Mitchell, Dominic Monaghan, Ian Somerhalder, Cynthia Watros) are restored to the main cast in this episode. Those who do not return are Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, Malcolm David Kelley, Harold Perrineau, Michelle Rodriguez, Kiele Sanchez, and Rodrigo Santoro (Rodriguez appeared in the previous episode). Additionally, long-time recurring guest stars Sam Anderson, L. Scott Caldwell, Fran√ßois Chau (incidentally, it's the first time Chau was credited for his appearance), Fionnula Flanagan, John Terry and Sonya Walger are upgraded to the main cast. Despite being killed off in the twelfth episode of the season and reprising her role only once more in the thirteenth, cast member Zuleikha Robinson received an on-screen, main cast credit for every episode. Adewale Akinnuoye- Agbaje turned down an offer to return because of salary disagreements. Despite the fact that it was earlier reported by Carlton Cuse that Malcolm David Kelley would appear, he only appeared in archive footage. Broadcasting The episode was initially broadcast on ABC in the eastern United States and CTV in eastern Canada, then simultaneously in the western United States, Western Canada, Fox in Italy and Portugal, Fox and Cuatro in Spain, DiziMax in Turkey and Sky1 in the United Kingdom and Ireland, HOT 3 in Israel at 9 pm Pacific Time on May 23, 2010. Because of the time difference, its initial Spain simulcast airing was at 6 am (5 am in the UK) BST. In Ireland, RT√â Two decided to air it on Monday, May 24 at 9 pm rather than its usual Thursday night slot in the interest of fans who did not want the ending to be spoiled. ABC charged up to US$900,000 for a 30-second commercial during the May 23 U.S. broadcast.Battaglio, Stephen. \\"2010: The Year in Numbers\\", \\"TV Insider\\", TV Guide, December 20, 2010, Page 9 =Ratings and viewership= In its original American broadcast, \\"The End\\" was viewed by 13.5 million households with a 5.8 rating/15% share in the 18‚Äì49 demographic, coming first in every time slot and boosting ABC to the highest rated network on Sunday. The best rated half-hour (the last one) was viewed by 15.31 million viewers and earned a 6.4 rating/19% share in the 18‚Äì49 demographic. At least 20.5 million viewers watched at least six minutes of the episode according to ABC. After its first broadcast, the series finale became the 55th highest viewed series finale ever in the United States. Entertainment Weekly's Michael Ausiello called the ratings \\"Solid, not spectacular\\". According to Ausiello, even though it was the show's highest rated episode in two years, it was still \\"far from a record-breaking performance\\". In the UK, 584,000 viewers tuned in to see the episode on Sky 1 during a 5 am broadcast. A later broadcast the following night was viewed by approximately 2.5 million. In Canada, viewers averaged over two million with the 7 pm special and the two-hour finale. Critical reception =Contemporary reviews= \\"The End\\" provoked an immediate response, and received a strongly polarized reaction from both fans and TV critics alike. Response to the episode was positive and negative in equal measures, both in the United States and internationally. According to the web site Metacritic, \\"The End\\" received \\"generally favorable reviews\\" with a Metascore ‚Äì a weighted average based on the impressions of 31 critical reviews ‚Äì of 74 out of 100. Of the most positive reviews, IGN writer Chris Carbot gave the episode a score of 10/10, describing it as \\"one of the most enthralling, entertaining and satisfying conclusions [he] could have hoped for.\\" Eric Deggans of the St. Petersburg Times also gave \\"The End\\" a perfect score, calling it \\"emotional, funny [and] expertly measured\\". Robert Bianco of USA Today rated the finale as perfect as well, stating that it could \\"stand with the best any series has produced\\". James Poniewozik of Time also praised \\"The End\\", calling it \\"full of heart and commitment\\"; Zap2it's Ryan McGee described the episode as \\"a masterpiece.\\" Jason Hughes of TV Squad felt that \\"as finales go, 'The End' will definitely go down as one of the more satisfying ones\\". Emily VanDerWerff of the Los Angeles Times felt that the episode \\"provides character payoffs we‚Äôve been waiting for. ... The important thing ... is not answers. It‚Äôs resolution. And 'Lost' provided that in spades.\\" Richard Roeper gave the episode an A+ rating, calling it a \\"great finale to one of the best TV shows of all time.\\" Not all critics were satisfied with the episode: the British newspapers The Guardian and The Daily Telegraph both reported that \\"The End\\" received negative reviews and disappointed its viewers. Alan Sepinwall of Star-Ledger was less enthusiastic about the finale and stated that he didn't consider the episode to be \\"wholly satisfying, either as closure for this season or the series\\", highlighting the episode's \\"narrative dead ends\\" as part of the reason. Mike Hale of The New York Times gave \\"The End\\" a mixed review, as the episode showed that the series was \\"shaky on the big picture\\". Matthew Gilbert of the Boston Globe also gave the episode a mixed review, citing some of the episode's \\"quite hokey\\" metaphors. David Zurawik of the Baltimore Sun gave the episode a highly negative review, describing the final scenes as \\"wimpy, phony, quasi-religious, white-light [and] huggy-bear\\". He added: \\"It looked like [Jack] was walking into a Hollywood wrap party without food or music ‚Äì just a bunch of actors grinning idiotically for 10 minutes and hugging one another.\\" Max Read of Gawker was also particularly scathing, calling the finale \\"incredibly dumb\\" and remarking that \\"it ended in the worst way possible\\". Mary McNamara of the Los Angeles Times gave the episode 1¬Ω stars out of 5, saying that many fans would wish \\"for a time slip that would give them those 2¬Ω hours and possibly six seasons back\\". M.L. House of TV Fanatic felt \\"bored\\" and \\"especially disappointed\\" by the finale, and that the show's resolution was \\"overarching\\". Peter Mucha of The Philadelphia Inquirer also spoke negatively of the finale, calling the series \\"one of TV's longest, lamest cons.\\" Laura Miller of Salon.com suggested that the finale episode was a failure because of its fan base, calling the series \\"the quintessential example of a pop masterpiece ruined by its own fans.\\" Outside the US, the episode also prompted a polarized response. The BBC's Entertainment reporter Kev Geoghegan felt that the episode was \\"emotionally satisfying\\" and that \\"the show was wrapped up rather nicely\\". Michael Deacon in The Daily Telegraph was \\"beatifically surprised\\" at the \\"great\\" ending. Shane Hegarty in The Irish Times felt that the final scene was \\"somewhat of a letdown\\", comparing it to the recent similar ending of Ashes to Ashes and contrasting it with the last ever episode of The Sopranos. He remarked: \\"[The Sopranos] was not about mystery, but its final scene was so inscrutable that fans are still squinting in an effort to figure it out. Losts finale, though, was not too obtuse.\\" Some reviewers ended puzzled about the meaning of Lost. Tim Teeman in The Times referred to \\"a global scratching of heads\\" in his review but concluded \\"The questions are ceaseless: it may be healthier, as one online fan put it, 'to just accept it and move on. Steve Busfield and Richard Vine of The Guardian spoke positively about the episode, saying that the series would \\"continue to baffle, infuriate and delight fans for an eternity\\". Conversely, the TV critic Charlie Brooker, also writing for The Guardian, remarked that \\"The End\\" plot \\"made less sense than a milk hammock\\", while the comedian Danny Baker called the episode \\"an outrage\\". =Reflective reviews= Retrospective reviews from critics have been more negative. Chris E. Hayner of Zap2It named \\"The End\\" as the number one worst series finale, calling it \\"the king of disappointing series finales\\". Indiewire similarly branded the finale as the number one worst ever, criticizing it for being \\"unbelievably long\\" and having a \\"decided lack of dramatic tension and any real thrills\\". Discussing the final season as a whole, Indiewire described season six as \\"directionless\\" and \\"largely a 'miss. Writing for MTV in 2015, Josh Wigler called the episode \\"the finale that sucks\\", and said that it would live on \\"as the model for how NOT to finish your show\\". Daniel D'Addario, writing for Salon.com, listed \\"The End\\" as one of the \\"worst finales ever\\", describing the series as \\"a show whose twists and turns didn't always seem to be undertaken by people who knew what they were doing.\\" The resolution of the flash-sideways storyline as being a form of purgatory received considerable criticism: writing for Rolling Stone in May 2015, Sean Collins named \\"The End\\" as one of the worst series finales, and described the flash-sideways plot point as \\"corny\\". Collins felt that \\"this short-sighted decision [made] the series hard to happily revisit\\", and that the episode as a whole had \\"balked\\". Brian Moylan of The Guardian felt that the finale had failed to fulfill some of the writers' promises, specifically the purgatory storyline. Moylan believed that the writers had set up mysteries that they \\"had no intention of answering\\". Danny Walker of the Daily Mirror listed the episode as one of the seven worst TV series finales, saying that it \\"left viewers with even more unanswered questions\\". Maddie Crum of The Huffington Post selected \\"The End\\" as her choice for the most disappointing series finale of all time, saying that it was \\"a complete stock ending\\" with \\"cheap pathos plays\\". In 2019, Kelly Lawler of USA Today named the episode the third worst series finale, describing the ending as \\"easy\\" and \\"schmaltzy\\". Writing in September 2014, Tom Eames of Digital Spy defended the finale, explaining that, although \\"divisive and controversial\\", it was \\"a beautiful piece of television\\". He stated: \\"It had returning characters, tears, action, romance and as happy an ending as possible for a show like Lost.\\" Cory Barker of TV.com also retrospectively reviewed the episode positively, naming it one of his all-time favorite series finales, and describing it as \\"emotionally satisfying\\" and \\"jam-packed with amazing moments\\". Entertainment Weekly listed \\"The End\\" as the seventh best series finale ever, describing it as \\"a high-energy epic romp\\". Reception from audiences continues to be mixed: , an ongoing poll for E! states that 53.87% of the audience loathed the finale, while the remaining 46.13% loved it. =Awards= The episode was nominated in eight categories for the 62nd Primetime Emmy Awards, the most Emmy nominations for a Lost episode. The episode was nominated for Primetime Emmy Awards in the categories of Outstanding Directing for a Drama Series and Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series. For the Creative Arts Emmy Awards, \\"The End\\" won for Outstanding Single-Camera Picture Editing for a Drama Series, while other nominations included Outstanding Sound Editing for a Series, Outstanding Sound Mixing for a Comedy or Drama Series, Outstanding Music Composition for a Series (Original Dramatic Score).

She was quiet in middle school, but tried to change herself in high school to impress Fujioka, whom she has had a crush on since an encounter in middle school.

Reception Deb Aoki of About.com says of the first volume that while it has a basic premise, she was \\"charmed\\" by it. She also seems to enjoy Miku's characterization, saying \\"Miku is a likable gal simply because she's determined to get her guy to see things her way, no matter how discouraged she gets. Sure, she cries and gets angry, but she never wallows in self-pity for long. Miku's got too much pride and self-respect for that. That's a good thing, because shojo manga really doesn't need any more whine-y doormat heroines.\\" References External links *Viz Media's Page for Cactus's Secret *Shojo Beat's Page for Cactus's Secret * Category:2003 manga Category:Comedy anime and manga Category:Romance anime and manga Category:Sharp Point Press titles Category:Sh≈çjo manga Category:Shueisha manga Category:Viz Media manga ","title":"Cactus's Secret"},{"id":"26688800","text":"Shaila is the debut studio album by Shaila D√∫rcal.

Early life Kiamos was born on 4 October 1975 in Athens, where he spent the rest of his adolescent life. In 1994, at the age of 18, he passed the entry exams for medical school. However, it was around the same time that he discovered his interest in music, leading to his decision to reject the medical school's offer of a scholarship. He began to learn to play the guitar, and took up music theory lessons. Musical career His early career began with appearances in major nightclubs alongside well-established names in the Greek music scene, such as Tolis Voskopoulos, Makis Christodoulopoulos,Eleni Dimou and Giorgos Alkaios. In 1998, Kiamos released his first CD entitled Enas Erotas Latria ke Anagki, from which two songs gained popularity: Ola Ya Senane Milane (Horis Nero) and Trelos Ya Sena. In 1999, he released his second CD Den Ise Moni. This was followed in 2000 by Tou Erota Feggaria. In 2002, Kiamos made progress in the northern city of Thessaloniki.

When Kiamos was performing at a nightclub in Piraeus, after finishing his performance, Zacharoulla, a self-confessed fan of his music, went to the back door to request an autograph. Kiamos continued performing at the same club and after several encounters, they started a relationship which would remain secret until their marriage six months later. The couple has three children together - Liana (born in 2008), and Vasilis (born in 2010). On September 1, 2011, their third child, a boy, was born.

Launched on March 24, 2010, Game Room let players download classic video games and compete against each other for high scores. Players on both Xbox 360 and Windows PCs could access Game Room through their respective versions of Microsoft's Live online services (Xbox Live and Games for Windows ‚Äì Live). The servers shut down on October 31st, 2017. At the 2011 Consumer Electronics Show, Microsoft announced a mobile version of Game Room for Windows Phone 7. Asteroids Deluxe was the only game announced, but a show floor demo revealed working prototypes of Centipede and Shao-Lin's Road. Format The Game Room front end can be downloaded at no charge from Microsoft's Marketplace online storefront. When launched, players are presented with a three-story virtual video arcade, each story containing four separate rooms. These rooms may be decorated however the player wishes, using the included themes and set pieces. The player can fill the rooms with virtual game cabinets that are used to play arcade and console games downloaded through the service, with each room holding a maximum of eight cabinets. Games for Game Room are made available through downloadable game packs. While the packs are free to download, individual games must be purchased in order to be played fully. Players may play each game in the pack once without charge, limited to ten minutes of game time. Games are purchased on a game-by-game basis, which allows unlimited play of the game. Previously, this was limited to Xbox 360 or Games for Windows, but a late update removed this distinction, defaulting the game purchases to the previous \\"Play Anywhere\\" model (a multiplatform spending model that would be expanded years later for Xbox One and Windows 10 as Xbox Play Anywhere). Gameplay Games in Game Room are launched by selecting them while players browse through their arcade. Each game offers a \\"classic mode\\", where one can set a number of gameplay options, dependent on the game's format. Arcade games have DIP switches that may be changed in order to increase difficulty or offer additional lives to the player, while console games have their original gameplay variations. Both are accessible using Game Room's on-screen interfaces. Also, some games can be played in a special \\"ranked mode,\\" which allows scores to be posted to online leaderboards while limiting gameplay options to a single variation common to all players, as well as disallowing several Game Room options, seemingly to prevent falsifying rankings or other forms of cheating. While browsing their arcades, players see avatars of themselves and their online friends wandering around and playing the games; Xbox 360 players see their console avatars, while PC players see generic avatars instead. Similarly, players may visit the arcades of their online friends as well as play the games found there. If a friend's arcade has a game that the player does not own, the player may purchase plays or may use their in-game tokens. However, the player may play copies of a game they already own for free. Players may also challenge their friends at various games in both score-based and skill-based contests. During gameplay, players win medals based on their score or how long they have played the game (both for that individual play and all-time on that game). Medals are offered in gold, silver and bronze, with each being worth a certain number of points. As players earn medals, they can advance in levels, which will unlock new themes and set pieces to be used in their arcades. Like other LIVE titles, players also earn achievements based on their gameplay. Game selection The initial game pack releases for Game Room were a mix of arcade, Intellivision, and Atari 2600 games. Other arcade machines were also to be covered, with Microsoft promising at least 1000 virtual arcade cabinets over the subsequent three years. Despite Microsoft's promise, there have not been any new games or other content since Game Pack 13 was released on December 22, 2010. Initially, Microsoft announced plans to release game packs weekly, starting on April 28, 2010,http://kotaku.com/5504919/no-new-titles-for-game-room-until-late-april although the first new release did not take place until May 5, 2010.

Observations The Security Council noted that the hostilities were still continuing, that there was no ceasefire and the violence affecting the population had not stopped. In particular, there were reports of genocide occurring. The violence and the systematic murder of thousands of civilians were severely condemned by the Council, and that the perpetrators were acting with impunity. The Council noted that the purpose of UNAMIR was not to act as a buffer between the two sides, and that its expanded military component will continue only as long as it is needed to protect displaced civilians, refugees and humanitarian aid workers. The displacement of some 1.5 million Rwandans, for whom famine and disease was a risk, along with the mass exodus of refugees, was a huge humanitarian crisis. The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights had visited the region and a Special Rapporteur for Rwanda was appointed. The contributions of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) and neighbouring countries was welcomed. The resolution stressed the importance of the Arusha Accords as a basis for a peaceful solution to the conflict in Rwanda, while reaffirming the territorial integrity and unity of the country. Acts The Council supported the recommendations of the Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali concerning the deployment of the expanded UNAMIR, principally: :(a) the deployment of two battalions for phase 2 in synchronisation with phase 1; :(b) urgent preparations for the deployment of two battalions for phase 3; :(c) the flexible implementation of all three phases. After extending UNAMIR's mandate in mediating for a ceasefire, the Council reaffirmed that UNAMIR should: :(a) contribute towards the security of refugees and displaced persons; :(b) provide security for humanitarian workers and deliveries. It was recognised that UNAMIR may require to take action in self-defense against persons threatening protected sites and populations and humanitarian workers. The mission was to accelerate the provision of additional troops and equipment, and support and co-operate with the Special Rapporteur. The Council demanded that all parties should end hostilities, murder and inciting ethnic hatred in the state media and agree a ceasefire. Both parties had ensured that they would co-operate with UNAMIR, particularly as it was necessary that the security of all UNAMIR's staff was assured. The intention of the Secretary- General to establish a fund for Rwanda was welcomed. The situation in Rwanda and the role of UNAMIR were to be constantly followed, with the Secretary- General being requested to report to the Council no later than 9 August and 9 October 1994 on the progress of the mission, the security situation of the population, the humanitarian situation and the prospects for a ceasefire and reconciliation.

This included breakthroughs in the halftone process. It made the printing of images for commercial usage more economical, feasible, and realistic. The reproduction of art from wood engravings (time consuming and strenuous), was largely replaced with photo- mechanical engravings (higher accuracy level).Scribner's Magazine, July 1922 p. 124. \\"American Illustration and the Reproductive Arts\\" by Carrington.

However, the vast majority of illustrators received little recognition, compared to the fine artists. This was basically due to their artwork being viewed as commercially (not creativity) inspired.Artists, Advertising, and the Borders of Art by Bogart, 1995 pp. 1‚Äì3, 47-55, 78. Their stature was above that of the advertising artists, but not by much. Most lacked job security. Nonetheless, these unheralded illustrators played a powerful role, in communicating (and documenting) the people's aspirations, concerns, customs, humor, labor, morals and social interests.Cover Story: The Art of American Magazine Covers 1900-1950 by Heller & Fili, 1996. One of them was Paul Martin, whose work appeared on the covers of Collier's, Everybody's, Farm & Fireside, The Farmer's Wife, Liberty, Parents and People's Home Journal from 1923‚Äì31. These seven magazines were once ranked among the most widely circulated. They all went out of business long ago, except for Parents. Their eventual downfall was caused by the changing times (or taste), emergence of radio and television (more attractive medium for advertisers), and economics (increased cost / decreased revenue). The more specialized ones that targeted specific audiences, tended to fare better. Another point is that major advancements in photographic equipment and technology took place during the 1930s. This brought about the gradual changeover (twenty-five+ year process) from illustrated to photographic covers. The former still lingered on, for its innovative and enchanting qualities, until succumbing to Photoshop and other graphic software programs. Collier's (Calling the play) Collier's 10-25-1924 General-interest magazines (mixture of entertainment, pictures, politics, serials, short stories and sports) were once very popular and appealed to diverse audiences. One of them was the historically significant Collier's, which had a revival under new editor William L. Chenery in 1925.A Cavalcade of Collier's, edited by McArdle (Collier's last editor), 1959 pp. xii‚Äìxiii.Magazines in the Twentieth Century, Peterson, 1956 p. 188; The New York Times, August 20, 1974 p. 38. Martin drew many of its covers during the mid-Roaring Twenties, including seven in 1925 (twenty 1923‚Äì27). Two of them were for Christmas issues (1924 & 26). Some artists created a niche and then stuck with it, such as in drawing comical situations, domestic follies, political satire, pretty women or simple pleasures.Scribner's Magazine, July 1922 p. 126 (at www.unz.com).

They resonated with the populace, who had just lived through a catastrophic world war and influenza pandemic. Martin excluded the non-essential details (extra people, scenery, structures, trees etc.), which allowed viewers to make an instant connection. His paintings were often easy to recognize, since their theme and style remained fairly consistent. They sometimes gave the illusion of three-dimensional depth. This was through the use of various techniques, such as color intensity variation, linear perspective and overlapping. His cover art practically always had a holiday/seasonal theme or portrayed the magazine's overall image.Collier's usually preferred cover art that conveyed plain and simple thoughts, unlike its main rival in the Post. This was common practice back then. It only once corresponded to an inside article. Martin's first step was to come up with ideas and turn them into conceptual sketches. These rough drafts were submitted to art editors, for their review and consideration for publication. He continued working on the ones approved, which came with or without a modification request. (The rejects were sometimes submitted elsewhere.) He then hired boys for photo sessions, most of whom lived locally.Hard Row to Hoe (literary newsletter), V-9 Fall 2005. \\"Golden Era of the Illustrations\\" pp. 1‚Äì3. Joe E.

His wife assisted by preparing the models for their scene. Collier's couldn't keep up with the rapidly changing times following World War II, and ceased publication in December 1956. The main culprit was television, which dramatically affected its advertising and circulation revenue. Collier's top competitors (Life, Look and Post) adapted somewhat better to the changing times, which helped them hold out longer.

It stated that any active player who received payment for writing on tennis, would be stripped of their amateur status starting Jan. 1, 1925. This resolution was easily approved by its members, who voted in blocks (47,196 to 6,250). It would have most deeply affected Bill Tilden, followed distantly by Vincent Richards. Strong opposition came from the influential S. Wallis Merrihew, fans and writers. A petition was signed by, among others, 12 [not 18] of the top 25 (PDF) ranked racketmen from the NY metro area. It rebuked the new rule that redefined amateurism. Walter Merrill Hall (#11 of 25) and Martin (#18 of 25) did not sign on with the pro-Tilden forces. They instead wrote a separate letter (text. on p. 2D), urging its reconsideration. A special committee was appointed by Pres. Wightman, to further study the troubling matter. It consisted of Arthur Hellen, Merrihew, Mersereau & Tilden. These four then enlarged the jury to seven, by carefully selecting Devereux Milburn, Senator George Pepper & Grantland Rice. Their unanimous report was released in early- mid Dec. The USLTA accepted its recommendations, & greatly modified the anti- writing-for-pay resolution.

It required some of the best tennis that Tilden has played here all week, before the Philadelphians were able to overcome the New York pair. Hammett and Martin were always contenders, except in the third set when they slumped badly; and in order to hold them off, Tilden constantly found it necessary to invade his partner's territory and play the opposing pair single- handed. ... There was nothing to choose between the two teams in the first and second sets. In the third set, Hammett and Martin went to pieces as Tilden became rampant and raked their court with placement drives and volleys. After the Phlladelphians had gained a commanding lead [in that one], the New York pair allowed the set to go without making much effort, preferring to save their strength for the next chapter. But after the rest period, Tilden returned to the courts to play perhaps his best tennis of the match.

NAPPC works in coordination with local, national, and international pollinator protection plans that focus on species, genera, families, or classes of animals. The campaign coordinates with existing projects that address pollinator habitats or migratory corridors. Such plans include Bat Conservation International‚Äôs Management Plan, the Plant Conservation Alliance‚Äôs Plan, and the S√£o Paulo Declaration on Pollinators . NAPPC complements these and other pollinator conservation efforts in that it focuses on pollinator protection in the United States, Canada, and Mexico, and addresses species including invertebrates, birds, and mammals. NAPPC coordinates with existing pollinator protection plans to avoid duplication, use resources effectively and replicate proposals in new venues. The NAPPC Action Plan builds on scientific research concerning pollinators and pollinator habitats and promotes and supports pollinator research. Pollinators in peril Possible declines in the health and population of pollinators pose a threat to the integrity of biodiversity, to global food webs, and to human health. Factors which could contribute to declines include: * improper use of pesticides and herbicides, * habitat fragmentation, * loss and degradation causing a reduction of food sources and sites for mating, nesting, roosting, and migration, * aggressive competition from non-native species, * disease, predators, and parasites, * climate change, * lack of floral diversity. The importance of pollinator services to ecosystem and economic health is well documented (Sobeich and Savignano, 2000). Animal pollinators are needed for the reproduction of 90% of flowering plants and one third of human food crops(Buchmann and Nabhan, 1996Free, 1970 in Tepedino 1979McGregor, 1976 in Tepedino, 1993) Domestic honeybees pollinate approximately $10 billion worth of crops in the U.S. each year.Watanabe, 1994 Bee poisonings from pesticides result in annual losses of $14.3 million.Pimental et al., 1992 in Ingram et al., 1996 Pollinators support biodiversity, as there is a positive correlation between plant diversity and pollinator diversity (Heithaus, 1974 in Tepedino, 1979Moldenke, 1975 in Tepedino, 1979del Moral and Standley, 1979 in Tepedino, 1979). The elimination, replacement or reduction of a pollinator may result in the decline of a plant species, which in turn may affect plant abundance, and hence community dynamics (Tepedino, 1979Buchmann and Nabhan, 1966USEPA, 1998) and impact wild animals and humans that depend on those plants (Buchhmann and Nabhan, 1996Kevan, 1977 in Allen-Wardell et al., 1998). Goal The major goal of the alliance of pollinator researchers, conservation and environmental groups, private industry, and state and federal agencies, is to implement an action plan to: * coordinate local, national, and international projects in the areas of pollinator research, education and awareness, conservation and restoration, policies and practices, and partnership initiatives, * aid communication among stakeholders, build coalitions, and leverage existing resources, * demonstrate a positive measurable impact on the populations and health of pollinating animals within five years. History In recognition of the significance of a stable pollinator population, the Pollinator Partnership (formerly the Coevolution Institute) collaborating with the [National Fish & Wildlife Foundation] established the North American Pollinator Protection Campaign (NAPPC) in 1999. Since its founding, the NAPPC has focused attention on the plight of pollinators and the need to protect them throughout the U.S., Canada, and Mexico. Two such efforts were the NAPPC Strategic Planning Conferences at the National Academy of Sciences in Washington, DC. These two conferences resulted in a blueprint for pollinator protection. Accomplishments * The U.S. Postal Service introduces a \\"Pollination\\" stamp series released in June 2007. * The U.S. Senate passed a Resolution to protect pollinators and designates June 24‚Äì30, 2007 National Pollinator Week. * \\"Nature's Partners\\", a pollinator curriculum for Grades 3-6 introduced * First-ever pollinator provision written into the 2008 Farm Bill. Pollinator awards Each year, NAPPC and the Pollinator Partnership present awards to individuals whose actions have made them champions for pollinators in Canada, the United States, and Mexico.

The prize saw her sharing the stage with Sarah McLachlan and the Indigo Girls. From this many opportunities followed, doing background vocals for artists such as Astrud Gilberto and G. Love & Special Sauce. Nancy combined her day job at Indre Recording Studios with time to record her first full-length album \\"Smitten\\" (produced by Emmy-winning engineer and multi-instrumentalist Shane McMartin). The album was greeted by many positive reviews including Billboard Magazine which singled her out by saying, > Falkow is writing infectious pop/folk songs with palpable soul.Nancy Falkow >  Smitten  CD Baby The song \\"It Could've Been Anyone\\" from Smitten made it to the soundtrack of the movie Emmett's Mark, starring Tim Roth and Gabriel Byrne. A string of nominations in previous years from the Philadelphia City Paper Music Awards resulted in a win in 2002, as Best Singer-Songwriter/Folk Performer. A number of notable gigs confirmed Nancy as a fixture on the Philadelphia music scene. The highlight of her career occurred when she toured with Daniel Lanois as a background vocalist on his \\"Shine\\" tour of the east coast in 2003. Nancy also was the main female vocalist with Mike Brenner's slide guitar hip-hop hybrid \\"Slo-Mo\\" and appeared extensively on their second album \\"My Buzz Comes Back\\". By 2003, Nancy was busy recording and co-producing (with McMartin) her second album \\"Clear View,\\" which she released in 2004. This brought a close to the Philadelphia chapter of her career as Nancy relocated to Dublin, Ireland in 2004. With marriage, a baby daughter and a chance meeting on a train, Nancy started a new project called \\"Sunflow\\" in 2006 with Dublin singer/songwriter Fran King, an album of lullabies followed called \\"Under The Stars\\" (2008) produced by Duncan Maitland. In 2010 \\"I Wish You Love\\" from that album featured in an episode of \\"Life UneXpected\\" and in a Toyota Prius commercial. In December 2012 Falkow reunited with Producer Duncan Maitland and recorded the single \\"What I'm Doing Right,\\" which was released December 1, with initial proceeds to benefit the Irish charity The Jack & Jill Children's Foundation.

His highest rank was sekiwake. He is now the head coach of Irumagawa stable. Career A former amateur champion at Nihon University, he turned professional at the age of 23, joining Kasugano stable in March 1981. He reached the top makuuchi division in September 1983, and in 1984 he earned his first special prize for Fighting Spirit, and defeated Takanosato in his first ever bout against a yokozuna to earn his first of his three kinboshi. He spent most of 1985 in the second j≈´ry≈ç division, but in 1986 made the san'yaku ranks at komusubi. In November 1987 he scored 10‚Äì5 from the maegashira 6 ranking, defeating two ≈çzeki and winning the Technique Prize. This earned him promotion to his highest rank of sekiwake for the following tournament in January 1988. However, by the end of the year he was in j≈´ry≈ç again due to injury problems. He won the j≈´ry≈ç y≈´sh≈ç on two occasions in 1989 and won promotion back to the top division. After missing the September 1990 tournament he fell to j≈´ry≈ç again and made only one more appearance in makuuchi before retiring in May 1992 at the age of 34. Retirement from sumo He became an elder of the Japan Sumo Association under the name Irumagawa Oyakata, and established Irumagawa stable in 1993. His wrestlers Yotsukasa and Otsukasa both reached the top division in 1999, and they were followed by Masatsukasa in 2008 and Sagatsukasa in 2010. Fighting style A powerful and versatile wrestler, Tochitsukasa preferred tsuki/oshi or pushing and thrusting techniques rather than fighting on the mawashi. His favourite kimarite were oshi-dashi (push out) and tsuki otoshi (thrust over). However he also regularly won by yori-kiri (force out), and was also capable of pulling off throws, both overarm (uwatenage) and underarm (shitatenage). Trivia He had a crowd-pleasing quirk of always staying in a squat position for much longer than normal and rocking back and forth before returning to his corner during the shikiri, or warm-up phase of a match.

Red Hot Chili Peppers guitarist and Turley's now ex-husband, John Frusciante, performs guitar on the band's recordings, and did perform alongside the group at their debut performance, while he was briefly a full-time band member. Swahili Blonde is signed to Manimal Vinyl. They made their live debut at The Echo Club in Los Angeles on July 10, 2010. The band utilizes disorientating chord progressions and obscure rhythms, with songs featuring a variety of instruments. The live band line-up features Nicole Turley, Laena Geronimo (Myers-Ionita), Dante Adrian White-Aliano, Arianna Basco, and Heather Cvar. The band also included Laena's father, former Devo drummer Alan Myers, until his death in 2013. Swahili Blonde's first digital single, entitled \\"Elixor Fixor\\" was released on iTunes on December 13, 2009, with a second, \\"Dr. Teeth\\", released in March 2010. The project's debut album, Man Meat, was released on August 3, 2010, mastered by Aaron Funk. Frusciante had previously worked with Funk in the collaborative group Speed Dealer Moms along with Chris McDonald. In 2014, members Nicole, Laena, John, and Dante released a 4 track digital EP in collaboration with Bosnian Rainbows members Teri Gender Bender and Omar Rodr√≠guez-L√≥pez under the name Kimono Kult.

He also led his high school to the 1966 Virginia State 1A championship and helped Princeton earn a 1967‚Äì68 co-Ivy League Championship as well as a 1968‚Äì69 outright Ivy League Championship. Over the course of his basketball career, he was coached by four National Basketball Hall of Fame members. In college, Hummer was a three-time All-Ivy League selection (first-team: 1969 and 1970, second team: 1968). He played for two Ivy League champion teams and served as team captain as a senior. He was a part of the first of head coach Pete Carril's thirteen Ivy League champions (1968), eleven NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament teams (1969) and three undefeated conference champions (1969). Although Hummer set no statistical records, his name continues to be ranked high in the Princeton record book by many statistical measures. He played six seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA) for the Braves, Chicago Bulls and Seattle SuperSonics. He was the 15th overall selection in the 1970 NBA draft and the first draft choice in the history of the Braves franchise. As a Braves draft choice, he was a somewhat controversial pick in a draft year with two All-American local products available. During his NBA career, he played for Hall of Famers Dolph Schayes, Bill Russell and Jack Ramsay. After his professional basketball career ended, he went to Stanford University to get an MBA in 1980. In 1989, Ann Winblad and he founded Hummer Winblad Venture Partners, a venture capital firm focusing on software companies. Amateur career Hummer attended Washington-Lee High School in Arlington, Virginia. Following in the footsteps of his brother Ed Hummer, he led W-L to the 1966 Virginia 1A state title as a high school senior. Ed had led the team to the 1962 and 1963 titles. His nephew (Ed's son Ian) was a freshman on the 2009‚Äì10 Princeton team. In Hummer's sophomore season at Princeton, the team was co-champion of the Ivy League with a 20‚Äì6 (12‚Äì3 Ivy) record. Despite the fact that Princeton had three of the five first-team All-Ivy team members, plus second-team member Hummer, they lost the one-game league playoff to the Jim McMillian-led 1968 Columbia Lions. That year the team rose to as high as 8th in the AP Poll. This was the first of thirteen Ivy League championships for head coach Pete Carril. The following season, the team accumulated a 19‚Äì7 (14‚Äì0) record and participated in the 1969 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament. They lost to St. John's in the tournament, but Hummer was joined by Geoff Petrie on the first-team All-Ivy squad. This was the first of eleven NCAA tournament appearance for Carril. It was also the first of three 14‚Äì0 conference champions for Carril. As a senior, Hummer was first-team All-Ivy, but the Tigers placed third in the conference to the undefeated (in Ivy League games) Corky Calhoun-led Penn Quakers and McMillian's Lions. Although Princeton did not appear in the 1970 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament, they hosted Penn's game. All three of his varsity years were spent under Carril. Again, following in the footsteps of his brother who had served as Princeton captain of the 1966‚Äì67 team, John was co-captain for the 1969‚Äì70 team along with classmate Petrie. Hummer was honored with the team's B. Franklin Bunn ‚Äô07 Award for play, sportsmanship and influence that contributed most to the sport. During his career, he shared the spotlight with Petrie and did not set any statistical records at a school and conference where Bill Bradley continues to dominate the record books. Over the course of his career, Hummer was the 9th Tiger to accumulate 1000 career points (1031 in 67 games) and he continued to rank seventh in school history with a 15.4 points/game average through the 2009‚Äì10 season. Since his career ended in 1970 only Brian Taylor has posted a higher average. He stands eighth in career free throws made (297), having only been passed since his career ended by Craig Robinson and Kit Mueller. He is tenth in career rebounds. Professional basketball career Following his senior season, Hummer was one of three first-round Ivy League selections in the 1970 NBA Draft (Petrie ‚Äì 8th, McMillian 13th and Hummer 15th). Hummer was also drafted by The Floridians in the 1970 American Basketball Association draft. The 1970 draft included two promising All-American local-Buffalo area talents: St. Bonaventure University's Buffalo-born Bob Lanier and Niagara University's Calvin Murphy. Murphy was a fan favorite that many local fans hoped the Braves would select. However, Braves General Manager Eddie Donovan doubted the Murphy could make it in the NBA. The Baltimore Bullets traded to improve their draft position on the day of the March 23, 1970 NBA draft. They traded their #15 selection and Mike Davis to the expansion Buffalo Braves for the #9 selection. That day, the Braves selected Hummer with the 15th pick. Hummer averaged 11.3 points and 8.9 rebounds for the 1970‚Äì71 Buffalo Braves during an average of 32.6 minutes in 81 games played for coach Dolph Schayes. The 22‚Äì60 Braves finished fourth in the four-team Atlantic Division. Hummer and the Braves struggled for two more seasons with 60-loss seasons. The 1972‚Äì73 Braves were Jack Ramsay's first coaching season with his second NBA team. After the Braves selected Ernie DiGregorio in the 1973 NBA draft to complement 1972 NBA draft selection Bob McAdoo, it was clear the team was going to change to fast-paced offense to leverage DiGregorio's skills. Hummer was more of a defensive player. Prior to the 1973‚Äì74 NBA season, Hummer was packaged with a 1974 NBA draft 2nd round pick and a 1975 NBA draft 2nd round pick in a trade that sent him to the Chicago Bulls in exchange for Gar Heard and Kevin Kunnert. The deal was part of the resume that earned Donavan the NBA Executive of the Year Award. That season the 54‚Äì28 Dick Motta-coached 1973‚Äì74 Bulls team that he was traded to initially would make the playoffs, but the 36‚Äì46 Bill Russell- coached 1973‚Äì74 SuperSonics that he would finish the season with would not. During the season (on January 7), he was traded by the Bulls to the Seattle SuperSonics in exchange for a 1975 NBA draft 2nd round selection. Russell's SuperSonics (1974‚Äì75 and 1975‚Äì76) were the only playoff teams for whom he played in the postseason. In the 1975 NBA Playoffs, the Sonics defeated the Detroit Pistons 2‚Äì1 in the first round before losing to the Golden State Warriors 4‚Äì2. Hummer appeared in six of the nine playoff games that year, but accumulated no points. The following season the Sonics earned a bye in the first round of the 1976 NBA Playoffs where they lost to the Phoenix Suns. Hummer appeared in three of these games. Never a strong free throw shooter, Hummer failed to make 50% of his free throws during his last three seasons in the NBA. In the 1974‚Äì75 season, he shot an unusually low 0.275 from the free throw line. Education and finance career Hummer graduated from Princeton University in 1970 with an A.B. in English and in 1980 with an MBA from Stanford Graduate School of Business. In 1989, Ann Winblad and he founded Hummer Winblad Venture Partners, which claims to have been the first venture capital firm to focus exclusively on software companies. The company now makes multimillion-dollar investments in several companies per year. The company has financed over 100 ventures that have been on the forefront of trends that have gone from PC software to enterprise computing to Internet applications. The company's investments have now spanned generations of software applications, architectures, delivery methods, and business models, including Omniture, Voltage Security, MuleSoft, Wind River Systems and Hyperion Solutions. Other notable companies that they have provided venture capital for that no longer exist are Napster, Pets.com, and HomeGrocer.

Rabban Ara was consecrated a patriarch in Rome, but it's unknown whether this union had a major significance. See also * List of Patriarchs of the Church of the East Notes References * Abbeloos, J.

Amongst the operas which had their first performances abroad are Melesio Morales' Ildegonda (Italy, 1868), Daniel Cat√°n's Florencia en el Amazonas (USA, 1996), and Julio Estrada's Murmullos del p√°ramo (Spain, 2006). Rolando Villaz√≥n in the L'elisir d'amore in Vienna 2007. Many of the operas listed have librettos in Spanish, the official language of Mexico. However, the practice of using French or Italian librettos was common in 19th and early 20th century Mexico when much of the opera in that country was performed by visiting troupes largely composed of European singers unaccustomed to singing in Spanish. Both Gustavo Campa's Le roi poete and Ricardo Castro Herrera's La l√©gende de Rudel had French librettos,The French libretto of La l√©gende de Rudel was translated into Italian for its first performance while Catalina de Guisa by Cenobio Paniagua and several other notable operas of this period had Italian librettos.Standish, Peter, A Companion to Mexican Studies, Boydell & Brewer Ltd, 2006, pp. 69‚Äì70. Although the vast majority of later Mexican operas have Spanish librettos, there have been 20th century works set to English texts, most notably The visitors by Carlos Ch√°vez with a libretto by the American poet Chester Kallman. The first opera by a Mexican-born composer was Manuel de Zumaya's La Part√©nope, performed in 1711 before a private audience in the Viceroy's Palace in Mexico City. However, the first Mexican composer to have his operas publicly staged was Manuel Arenzana, the maestro de capilla at Puebla Cathedral from 1792 to 1821. He is known to have written at least two works performed during the 1805/1806 season at the Teatro Coliseo in Mexico City ‚Äì El extrangero and Los dos ribales en amore. Both were short comic pieces. The first Mexican opera seria was Paniagua's Catalina de Guisa (composed in 1845 and premiered in 1859). Fernando de la Mora With its story about the Huguenots in France and an Italian libretto by Felice Romani, contemporary critics noted that the only thing Mexican about it was the composer.Grout, Donald Jay and Williams, Hermine Weigel, A short history of opera, Columbia University Press, 2003, p. 561. Bethell, Leslie, The Cambridge History of Latin America, Volume 4, Cambridge University Press, 1984, p. 469. Although the traditions of European opera and especially Italian opera had initially dominated the Mexican music conservatories and strongly influenced native opera composers (in both style and subject matter), elements of Mexican nationalism had already appeared by the latter part of the 19th century with operas such as Aniceto Ortega del Villar's 1871 Guatimotzin, a romanticised account of the defense of Mexico by its last Aztec ruler, Cuauht√©moc. Later works such as Miguel Bernal Jim√©nez's 1941 Tata Vasco (based on the life of Vasco de Quiroga, the first bishop of Michoac√°n) incorporated native melodies into the score.

Biography Haas was born 1914 in Slovenska Bistrica, Slovenia, which was part of Austria-Hungary at the time. She joined the revolutionary workers movement in high school and worked as a courier between groups in Yugoslavia and France. Haas met Tito in Paris, France, in 1937, a year after he had divorced his first wife, Pelagija \\"Polka\\" Belousova. In 1940, Haas travelled to Istanbul, Turkey, to deliver a passport to Tito, who was returning from a trip to Moscow, Soviet Union. Their relationship soon turned romantic, according to Tito's authorized biography, The Loves of Josip Broz Tito. The couple married in 1940 and returned to Yugoslavia using aliases. They lived in Zagreb until the Invasion of Yugoslavia, when Tito moved to Belgrade, while Haas, who was pregnant with their only child, remained in Zagreb. In May 1941, Haas gave birth to their only son, Mi≈°o Broz, who was a Croatian ambassador to Indonesia from 2004 to 2009. Partisan supporters hid Haas and her son from Nazi German authorities and their allies, but she was eventually caught and arrested. She was swapped for a German officer in a 1943 prisoner exchange between the Germans and the Partisans. By the time Haas was released and rejoined the Partisans in 1943, Tito was having an affair with his personal secretary Davorjanka Paunoviƒá, who was code named \\"Zdenka\\". Haas and Tito suddenly separated in 1943 in Jajce during the second meeting of AVNOJ after she reportedly walked in on him and Davorjanka Paunoviƒá. Haas spent much of the rest of World War II in Slovenia, away from Tito. Haas reportedly met Tito only once after World War II during a visit to his presidential office in Belgrade. Following the end of the war, Haas worked at several Yugoslav government institutions. She remarried and gave birth to two daughters. She lived much of her later life in relative obscurity. Herta Haas died in Belgrade, Serbia, on 5 March 2010, at the age of 95.

History Since the rapid adoption of the modern day chip in the 1960s, most companies involved in producing semiconductors were extremely vertically integrated. Semiconductor companies owned and operated their own fabrication plants and also the processing technologies that facilitated the creation of the chips. Research, design, testing, production, and manufacturing were all kept \\"in house\\". Advances in the semiconductor industry made the market extremely competitive and companies began to use a technology roadmap that helped set goals for the industry. This roadmap came to be known as Moore's Law, a statistical trend seen by Intel's co-founder Gordon Moore in which the number of transistors on an integrated circuit is doubled approximately every 2 years.By Jon Mundy, TrustedReviews. ‚ÄúWhat is Moore's Law?.‚Äù February 17, 2016. Retrieved February 26, 2016. This increase in transistor numbers meant that chips were getting smaller and faster as time progressed. As chips continued to get faster, so did the levels of sophistication within the circuitry. Companies were constantly updating machinery to be able to keep up with production demands and overhauls of newer circuits. Companies raced to make transistors smaller in order to pack more of them on the same size silicon and enable faster chips. This practice became known as \\"shrinkage\\". Companies were now in a race against each other and themselves to create the next fastest chip, as all goals were to meet or exceed Moore's Law. With the shrinking of sizes in semiconductors, production became much more intricate. Fabrication machines, which were producing chips at the millimeter level in the 1960s, were now operating in the micrometer and heading into the nanometer scale. , most cutting edge processor makers are working in the 32 nm level and heading into full 22 nm production; sizes comparable to the human DNA strand. The process at which most of these intricate chips are being produced at is called photolithography, and the cost of equipment and operating them has grown astronomically, resulting in an inevitable consolidation of semiconductor companies. Divergence Companies like Xilinx and Western Design Center were pioneers and the first to realize the practicality of not having to sustain a fabrication plant model. As costs continued to grow and competition grew fierce, resources could not be focused on maintaining a business model that had to sustain research and production. The solution became the Fabless semiconductor company model, where a company could focus all its resources to the design, marketing, and sale of its devices while outsourcing the production of its devices to manufacturers called fabs. This business model grew in such popularity that the new initiative was being promoted by a group called the Fabless Semiconductor Association (FSA) which is now the Global Semiconductor Alliance. These fabs, commonly referred to as foundries, were able to update assembly and photolithography systems much more easily than their counterparts as all they focused on is handling bulk orders that come from these fabless businesses. In addition, the bottom line of these two business models became much stronger. Convergence Although many companies grew and profited well from a fabless business model, new hurdles still had to be dealt with. The modern day microprocessor now has billions of dollars of research put behind it, with months and even years of research in creating the micro circuitry and teams of hundreds of engineers testing and developing a chip. Now even keeping fabrication and development apart is not enough. \\"On one side will be Intel and a select few that can afford their own fab plants‚Äîwhich will cost between $2.5 billion and $3 billion to build in 2003 and $6 billion by 2007‚Äîand perform basic research on transistor design or new chip materials. These new fabs will process wafers with 300-millimeter diameters, larger and more complex to make than today's 200-millimeter variety. On the other side will be everyone else. They will have to share fabs, pool research, buy technology or rely more heavily on outside foundries, which in turn will have to seek help.\\" The theory, Rock's Law, was first articulated by venture capitalist Arthur Rock in which he proposed that the cost of a fabrication plant doubles every 4 years and eventually gets to the point in which it will collide with Moore's law. The implication is that rising plant costs will eventually prohibit further chip improvements. Realizing this, companies began to collaborate. This also meant many compatible companies ended up being takeover targets in order to strengthen relationships and help the businesses' bottom line. in July, 2006, AMD announced the acquisition of the GPU manufacturer ATI Technologies for $4.3 billion in cash and 58 million shares of its stock and completed the acquisition on October 25, 2006.CNW Group. ‚ÄúAMD Completes ATI Acquisition and Creates Processing Powerhouse.‚Äù October 12, 2007.

It provides desiccation, coagulation/cauterization, and curettage to remove lesions from the skin.  Procedure  A round dull instrument (curette) of varying sizes (1 mm to 6 mm) is used to scrape off the cancer down to the dermis.http://www.healthpress.co.uk/acatalog/ffminsur.pdf The scraping is then paused while an electrosurgical device like a hyfrecator is used next. Electrocoagulation (electrodesiccation) is performed over the raw surgical ulcer to denature a layer of the dermis and the curette is used again over the surgical ulcer to remove denatured dermis down to living tissue. In the case of skin cancers, the cautery and electrodesiccation is usually performed three times, or until the surgeon is confident that reasonable margins have been achieved.  Applications  * Seborrheic keratosis * Viral warts * Bowens disease (in situ squamous cell carcinoma) * Pyogenic granuloma * Actinic keratoses * Basal cell carcinoma * Keratoacanthoma * Skin tags  The cure rate  The cure rate is highly user dependent. The more aggressive the surgeon is at performing EDC, the higher the cure rate. Like standard excision, the wider the surgical margin, the higher the cure rate. Cure rate for small cancer is higher than cure rate for larger cancers. Cure rate for nodular basal cell cancer is higher than for infiltrative basal cell cancer. Essentially, all the prognostic factors that apply to Mohs surgery and standard surgical excision will also apply to EDC.  Advantages  The method is quick and easy to perform under local anesthetic. Used correctly, it can allow for adequate to good cosmetic result on small tumor in certain area. No sutures are used, so a follow up visit might not be necessary. Minimal expense is required. If recurrence occur, rapid diagnosis is possible as the roots are exposed to the surface, and not buried by surgical closure methods (flaps, etc.).  Disadvantages  As the surgical margin is not confirmed by pathology, the free surgical margin can not be confirmed by an objective pathology report. The recurrence rate for EDC is considered by many (National Comprehensive Cancer Network) to be too high for use on many facial region, and on recurrent skin cancer.http://wwwu.tsgh.ndmctsgh.edu.tw/commcpc/images/nccn/Non- Melanoma%20Skin%20Cancer-2007.pdf As a surgical ulcer is created and is larger than the original tumor, healing time may be delayed and subsequent scarring obvious.

The purpose of cooling out is to encourage the students to adjust their expectations or redefine failure. The practices contrast with \\"warming up\\", in which students who aspire to easier educational goals are encouraged to reach for more ambitious degrees. History According to Burton R. Clark's 1960 article \\"The Cooling-Out Function in Higher Education\\", the term was first used by Erving Goffman in the 1952 article \\"Cooling the Mark Out: Some Aspects of Adaptation to Failure\\". Goffman used the term to describe a practice of confidence artists, but Clark proposed that it was a legitimate function of higher education to gradually refocus students from unattainable goals to achievements that were within their reach or to soften the blow of failure for what they cannot attain. Among the techniques of cooling out, students who do not achieve well on pre-entrance testing or who do not perform well in class may be refocused to remedial coursework and offered counseling and vocational planning. Academic probation may be used to encourage students to accept academic refocus. In 2002, theorists Regina Deil- Amen and James E. Rosenbaum noted that students in many schools are encouraged to accept an ideal that college is accessible to all and defined \\"Cooling Out\\" as \\"the process by which community colleges urge students to recognize their academic deficiencies and lower their aspirations\\", noting that \\"cooling out may also be used to describe the ways in which community colleges get students to lower their unrealistically high expectations for obtaining bachelor's degrees and to aim for one- or two-year degrees in vocational or applied programs.\\" They argue that cooling out should be initiated in the later years of high school by educators and administrators familiar with a student's potential. In junior and community colleges, students are dissuaded from maintaining unrealistically high expectations of transferring and earning a bachelor's degree. Researchers say that \\"community colleges passively discourage student success by setting institutional roadblocks in the way of those with bachelor's degree aspirations\\" (p.42). Examples of roadblocks include pre-entrance testing, counseling, orientation classes, etc.  Examples  Sometimes, practices such as these are used to \\"cool out\\" a student: * Remedial coursework, such as requiring a student to pass a basic class for no academic course credit before permitting the student to enroll in the normal class * Encouraging students to change their plans, such as encouraging a low-performing student to give up an unrealistic dream of becoming a dentist and instead to become a dental hygienist or dental technician, which requires less training. * Requiring students to pass certain difficult courses, with the goal of reducing the number of students who can complete the program * Requiring students to take college entrance exams or other tests to enroll in the targeted program Bias in application In \\"The Functioning of the Hidden Curriculum\\", E. Margolis and M. Romero note that cooling out may also be applied to students whose educational goals are unrealistic due to factors other than academic ability, such as lack of financial resources. They argue that \\"cooling out\\" has been used against students of color and women, concluding that \\"the less capital a student brings to the graduate setting, the more impact the process [of cooling out] has on that student's educational experience.\\"Marolis and Romero (2000), p. 1280.  Warming up  A contrasting process ‚Äì called \\"warming up\\" ‚Äì may also occur (p.41). Warming up is defined as \\"the raising of students initial aspirations after they enroll in a college\\" (p.41). Both cooling out and warming up may occur in the same schools and at equal rates. National survey data suggest that warming up may occur more than cooling out in today's community colleges (p. 64). The \\"warming up\\" process may involve some of the same techniques, such as counseling a student that if he can pass the chemistry and mathematics classes needed to get a two-year degree in welding, that he may be able to handle engineering coursework.

Catalog =UTSAV Series= Released: 2013. An East Meets West Music Series Celebrating the life, music and legacy of Ravi Shankar, featuring musicians and students inspired by the Maestro and who continue his mission of Peace through Music. The first two installments include Arghyam - The Offering by world-renowned classical Hindustani vocalist in the Jaipur-Atrauli Gharan Tradition, Ashwini Bhide Deshpande and Raga & Raj, a set of daring experimental compositions by Barry Phillips - a long time student of Ravi Shankar - Linda Burman-Hall harpsichordists extraordinaire with Lux Musica Ensemble! =UTSAV Series: Arghyam - The Offering= Released: 2013.

East Meets West Music: UTSAV Series! Arghyam - The Offering =UTSAV Series: Raga & Raj= Released: 2013. Celebrating Ravi Shankar's life and musical legacy of East- Meets-West cultural exchange, Barry Phillips, Linda Burman-Hall and Lux Musica Ensemble (with guest Debopriyo Sarkar) present a selection of daring, experimental compositions that reflect and re-imagine the musical encounters between North India and British Traditions encountered during the late 1780s. Featuring compositions by Lou Harrison, William Hamilton Bird, and Vishnu Digambar Paluskar arranged by Phillips and Burman-Hall, and an original composition by Phillips, the music of Raga & Raj is built on the affinities and attractions between North Indian and British musical traditions as they encountered each other in the late 1700s and 1800s. Raga & Raj reinterprets the music of that intriguing historical moment, illuminating for us the triumphs and challenges of this type of cross-cultural exchange and reminding us of Ravi Shankar's musical mission and life's work: Peace through Music. East Meets West Music: UTSAV Series! Raga & Raj =The Living Room Sessions Part 1= Released: 2012. In October 2011, at the age of 91, Ravi Shankar invited his long time-tabla accompanist, Tanmoy Bose, to his home in Encinitas, California for an informal recording session. Over four days in Shankar's living room, the recorded seven different Ragas. The resulting music is pure Ravi Shankar, combining his deep musical experience and brilliant technique with the passion he brings to live performance. The first two releases, The Living Room Sessions Part 1, consists of four tracks that span a wide range of Indian classical styles - from the opening Raga Malgunji, a meditative raga reflecting on the distance between the human and the supreme; to the lighter, lyrical Raga Khamaj and Raga Kedara; and closing the Raga Satyajit, a spontaneous raga dedicated to the late director and friend of Shankar, Satyajit Ray, that is both melodic and rhythmic. The seamless musical dialog between Shankar and Bose creates a uniquely stirring listening experience. Both intimate and masterly, The Living Room Sessions Part 1 is an invitation into the home and musical genius of Ravi Shankar. East Meets West Music: The Living Room Sessions Part 1 =The Living Room Sessions Part 2= Released: 2013. No less noteworthy and masterly, then its predecessor The 2013 Grammy winning Living Room Sessions Part 1, with three of the last session recording made by Maestro Ravi Shankar before his passing in December 2012. Session Mishra Kafi introduces the set with a beautiful Alaap and Gat in medium tempo Deepchandi Taal. Session Sindhi Bhairavi, with its Gat in Dadra and Teen Taal, highlights in the in-depth facility with rhythm and improvisational flow which he and Bose have built over their years performing together. And during the Teen Taal of Session Bhairavi, Shankar's playing is characterized by such intensity, clarity, and delight that it reveals, once more, the Maestro's musical genius as something to reckon with, even in his tenth decade. East Meets West Music: The Living Room Sessions Part 2 =Tenth Decade In Concert: Live in Escondido= Released: 2012. Cinematographer and director Alan Kozlowski presents an intimate look at 91-year-old Ravi Shankar performing in Southern California in October 2011. Kozlowski, known for his work on documentaries featuring the likes of Jeff Bridges and Jackson Browne as well as feature films such as Travelers and Magicians, offers a uniquely personal perspective on Ravi Shankar. The filmmaker has studied music with Ravi since 1978, and has produced a documentary honoring Ravi called Sangeet Ratna and co-produced with George Harrison a collection of Ravi's work called In Celebration. The love of subject is clear in the film, but it's Ravi's raw and powerful performance that leaves the most lasting impression. Though Ravi has curtailed his busy touring schedule, his playing continues to draw intense praise. Songlines Magazine says that the master has lost \\"absolutely nothing in the way of performances.\\" East Meets West Music: Tenth Decade in Concert - Live in Escondido =The Nine Decades Series= First release: 2010. EMWMusic‚Äôs inaugural release, Nine Decades: Volume 1, is the first in a multi- volume series. The Nine Decades series features rare and never-before released recordings hand-picked by Ravi Shankar from his vast archive and remastered for an optimum listening experience. With live performances and studio recordings pivotal to his development as an artist and reflective of unique times and places, the Nine Decades series provides insightful perspective on a career that spans 70-plus years and is a direct bridge between the artist himself and his listeners. East Meets West Music: NINE DECADE SERIES =Nine Decades: Volume 1 (1967‚Äì68)= Released: 2010. Raga Gangeshwari, the centerpiece of Volume 1, takes listeners to an outdoor concert at a temple on the banks of the Ganges in 1968. Though recorded with one hand-held microphone, Raga Gangeshwari is representative of the archives many treasures, which the artist describes in his liner notes as ‚Äúnot recorded with sophisticated audio equipment and yet they exhibit the power of life in live performance that has a value beyond any technological shortcomings.‚Äù The intimate quality of the recording and virtuosic playing allows listeners to experience a page from the artist‚Äôs diary circa 1968. Raga Gangeshwari is performed with Kamala Chakravarty on tanpura and Ustad Alla Rakha on tabla. Also featured on this volume is Vedic chanting by temple priests, as well as audience reactions to an early performance in the West. East Meets West Music: NINE DECADES VOL 1 =Nine Decades: Volume 2 (1968‚Äì69)= Released: 2011. The second installation of the Nine Decades series, Reminiscence of North Vista, is a live recording from a private part at Ravi's North Vista home in Los Angeles on August 29, 1969. Ravi Shankar moved to the Hollywood house in 1968 and regularly had parties attended by luminaries such as George Harrison, John Lennon, Peter Sellers, Marlon Brando and many others. This recording perfectly encapsulates the spirit of the performances at these gatherings. Recorded just one week after his legendary Woodstock appearance, the set features the Maestro performing to evening Ragas with Alla Rakha on Tabla (as well as the sounds of crickets and party-goers). This is a unique performance by two artists at the height of their power, performing in an informal setting in front of family and friends. East Meets West Music: NINE DECADES VOL 2 =Nine Decades: Volume 3 (1950‚Äì54)= Released: 2011. Volume three in the Nine decade series, entitled Orchestral Experimentations, is a set of nine studio tracks featuring Ravi Shankar's earliest compositional experimentations with his National Orchestra between 1950 and 1954. The orchestra consisted of many of the finest Indian Musicians of the period, and in these recordings one senses the excitement Ravi felt at having such resources at his disposal. Not only was Ravi inspired by the players to experiment with the orchestration, but he enjoyed the freedom to explore both North and South Indian systems, as well as use some Western technique. Ravi also maintained his natural inclination for improvisation by recording usually within an hour or two completing the composition. =Raga reissue= Released: 2010. EMWMusic released for the first time on DVD the 1971 documentary film Raga: A Film Journey into the Soul of India. Directed by Howard Worth, Raga was released by Apple Films through the support of Shankar's friend George Harrison. The DVD release features a digitally remastered 35mm print optimized to modern color-range resolution and standard, and a fully remastered audio soundtrack.

It is named after Colonel James Swan of Fife, Scotland, who purchased the island and some surrounding areas and organized their colonization in the eighteenth century. The population was 332 at the 2010 census. The town is accessible by ferry from Bass Harbor. The island has a summertime population of approximately 1,000. There is a general store on the island, which opened in spring 2007, and at least one inn. There are also a number of small cottage-industry shops.

It may be used in three different ways: conceptualization, analysis, and simulation. The work of Jean-Louis Le Moigne is associated with systemography. Systemography modeling consists of building, simultaneously, the process' operational, informational and decisional systemographs in modeling phase. Ettore Bresciani Filho (2001) recommends the following order in systemography modeling: #Define the border of the system to be modeled, characterizing the border's processors responsible for the system's inputs and outputs. #Build the operational systemograph of the production system, disposing in a block diagram the production process' different stages, representing each with an operational processor. #Build the informational systemograph of the production system, disposing in a block diagram the different stages of the information's generation, transformation and communication, representing each with an informational processor. #Build the decisional systemograph of the production system, disposing in a block diagram the different stages of the decision's process representing each one with decisional processors. #Classify the processors of the systemographs in categories, types and levels; building a comparative table of processors. #Identify the possible forces fields influences, such as culture and organizational climate. #Relate the problems in priority order, applying problem analysis techniques to identify and find solutions for each one of them. #Use mathematical methods for the modeling the processors as the system as a whole. #Propose the solution of the problems in the form of recommendations and procedures to be adopted. To systemograph consists, in a few words, in building a model, physical or mathematical, static or dynamic, analytical or numeric of a phenomenon that can be noticed as complex by the analyzer that intends to model it. The elaboration of the operational systemographs (presenting the operations involved in the process), of the informational systemographs (where the information flow is highlighted) and of the decisional systemographs (where the decisions are shown) allows, during the activity analysis, to evaluate it and to improve it. These systemographs allow to observe and to eliminate redundancies and cycles that are (or not) important for the process, providing its systemic visualization, identifying points to allow its rationalization, increase of flexibility, and activation. History The systemography was studied and presented theoretically by Jean-Louis LeMoigne (1990; 1994) in his Th√©orie du Syst√®me G√©n√©ral (1994). Bresciani Filho presents, in his works and through his students, a practical use of the systemography concepts, particularly for systems of production and of information.

He returned in 1813, and was appointed as state secretary by the Second Triumvirate. In 1817, he was jailed and banished to the United States, where he graduated in medicine at the Maryland university. He returned in 1821 and worked in the Public Library, and it is believed that he was the first person to teach about chemistry in Buenos Aires. Later, he joined the Legislature, where he held his position for a number of terms. He represented the Banda Oriental in the Constitutional Assembly of 1824, and supported the enactment of a federalist government. Moreno was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1825.American Antiquarian Society Members Directory He moved to England and Juan Manuel de Rosas appointed him as minister plenipotentiary in 1832.

Cooper (born 1963) is an internal medicine and public health physician, and the Bloomberg Distinguished Professor of Equity in Health and Healthcare at Johns Hopkins University, jointly appointed in the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Johns Hopkins School of Nursing and in the departments of Health, Behavior and Society, Health Policy and Management; Epidemiology; and International Health in the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. She is the James F. Fries Professor of Medicine in the Division of General Internal Medicine, Director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Equity, and Director of the Johns Hopkins Urban Health Institute. Dr. Cooper is also a Gilman Scholar and a core faculty member in the Welch Center for Prevention, Epidemiology, and Clinical Research. She is internationally recognized for her research on the impact of race, ethnicity and gender on the patient-physician relationship and subsequent health disparities. In 2007, she received a MacArthur Fellowship ‚Äùgenius‚Äù grant from the MacArthur Foundation. Biography Dr. Cooper was born in Liberia, West Africa, to a mother who is a librarian, and a physician father. She attended the American Cooperative School in Liberia until tenth grade, and the International School of Geneva, in Switzerland, for her last two years of high school before moving to the United States to attend college. She graduated from Emory University with a B.A. in chemistry in 1984 and from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Medicine with an M.D., in 1988. After completing her internship and residency in internal medicine at the University of Maryland Medical System, she became board certified by the American Board of Internal Medicine in 1991. She then went to Johns Hopkins University, where she obtained an M.P.H. in 1993. There, she completed a general internal medicine fellowship the following year before joining the university faculty. In 2011, Governor Martin O'Malley created the Maryland Health Care Quality and Costs Council through an executive order, and Dr. Cooper was appointed as co-chair of its Cultural Competency Workgroup.https://health.maryland.gov/mhqcc/Documents/Revised_EO_01.01.2011.09.pdfhttps://health.maryland.gov/mhqcc/SiteAssets/SitePages/meetings/Cooper%20Perquera%20-%20Cultural%20Comp.pdf Dr. Cooper has testified in congressional hearings in support of funding for health disparities research, equity in healthcare delivery, and diversity and inclusion in the healthcare workforce. In 2019, Dr. Cooper testified at the Energy and Commerce Committee hearing on \\"Investing in America's Health Care\\" in support of reauthorizing the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI).https://energycommerce.house.gov/sites/democrats.energycommerce.house.gov/files/documents/Testimony- Cooper-Investing%20in%20America%27s%20Health%20Care_060419.pdf Johns Hopkins Center for Health Equity Dr. Cooper is the founder and director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Equity (originally called the Johns Hopkins Center to Eliminate Cardiovascular Health Disparities). The Center, established in 2010, uses a comprehensive strategy to promote equity in health and health care for vulnerable populations: it advances scientific knowledge, educates and trains scholars, engages and partners with communities, raises public awareness of health inequities, and advocates for changes in clinical practice and policy. The Center has made strides towards realizing the goal of health equity in Baltimore and serves as a model for community-academic partnerships in other urban areas, across the country and globally, plagued by similar health disparities. Johns Hopkins Urban Health Institute (UHI) Dr. Cooper was appointed as the director of the UHI in April 2020, just as racial disparities in infections, hospitalizations, and deaths from the novel coronavirus were becoming more evident in the US.https://hub.jhu.edu/2020/04/21/lisa-cooper- urban-health-institute/ Dr. Cooper is executing a new vision for the institute's future as a vital partner in the health of Baltimore City. The mission of the UHI is to advance health and health equity in Baltimore by: facilitating collaborations between communities, universities, and healthcare delivery systems to build collective capacity for achieving health equity in Baltimore; mobilizing resources in support of promising strategies to achieve substantial gains in the health and well-being of Baltimore residents; and advancing understanding and dialogue by including community voices to build trust and enhance pathways to health, well-being, and social justice in Baltimore.  Research  Dr. Cooper‚Äôs research has focused on the physician- patient relationship and how race and ethnicity factor into the quality of patient care. The interventions she has tested include patient-centered strategies to overcome racial and ethnic disparities in healthcare. She has pioneered approaches for reducing healthcare disparities among minority populations through culturally tailored education programs and patient- centered communication training. Her most highly cited paper is a 1999 article in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) that analyzed the role race plays in the patient-physician relationship. The study demonstrated that minority patients found that their physicians involved them in the decision-making process at lower levels than non-minorities did, and that patients seeing physicians of their own race also rated the decision-making process as more participatory than patients seeing physicians of another race. The first of its kind, this study revealed that differences in the relationship between the patient and physician may be a key factor underlying the already established inequitable quality of health care based on a person's race and ethnicity. Dr. Cooper‚Äôs research contributed greatly to two paradigm shifts in healthcare research: patient-centeredness and health disparities. Her research documented the existence of disparities in the quality of medical communication experienced by African Americans and other ethnic minorities compared to whites, and the contribution of implicit racial bias and stereotyping behaviors among physicians to poorer communication in the visits of African American patients. Her interventions have identified the important role of patient activation and engagement in treatment decisions in reducing disparities in health care quality for chronic conditions.

Paper presented at the Second International Plagiarism Conference, The Sage Gateshead, Tyne & Wear, United Kingdom. and Folt√Ωnek, Tom√°≈° (Czechia) and Tricia Bertram Gallant (USA). Academic integrity supports the enactment of educational values through behaviours such as the avoidance of cheating, plagiarism, and contract cheating, as well as the maintenance of academic standards; honesty and rigor in research and academic publishing.  Historical evolution  During the late 18th century, academic integrity was tightly correlated to the honor code (United States). This was monitored mainly by the students and surrounding culture of the time. The honor code focused on duty, pride, power, and self-esteem. Any act promoting the uprising or building of any of these within an individual was the goal. Thus, academic integrity was tied solely to the status and appearance of upstanding character of the individual. Any acts of academic dishonesty performed to maintain their good name was seen as a necessary means to an end. It wasn't until the end of the 19th century when the goals of the university changed that the concept of academic integrity changed. Academics of this era were required to teach and produce original research. The pressure to acquire tenure and publish added extra stress to their jobs, though acts of academic dishonesty were viewed as acts of follies. Still, the honor code concept of academic integrity was evolving into a more contemporary concept. Academic integrity was now beginning to replace honor of the individual honor to the university as an institution. Such an evolution was important to promote unity throughout the academic institution and encourage students to hold each other accountable for dishonest acts. It also allowed the students to feel empowered through the self-monitoring of each other. As the importance of original research grew among faculty members the questioning of research integrity grew as well. With so much pressure linked to their professional status professor were under intense scrutiny by the surrounding society. This inevitably led to the separating academic integrity ideals for student and faculty. By 1970 most universities in the United States had established honor codes for their student body and faculty members, although this concept has not really caught on elsewhere in the world (e.g. see Yakovchuk et al.). Improvements in information technology have created challenges within academic integrity, especially with respect to increased plagiarism and use of poor-quality sources found on the internet. Technology has also increased opportunities for collaborative writing, raising issues of proper attribution of authorship.  Impact: the university  Academic integrity means avoiding plagiarism and cheating, among other misconduct behaviours. Academic integrity is practiced in the majority of educational institutions, it is noted in mission statements, policies,Glendinning, I. (2013). Comparison of policies for Academic Integrity in Higher Education across the European Union. Retrieved from http://ketlib.lib.unipi.gr/xmlui/bitstream/handle/ket/814/Comparison%20of%20policies%20for%20Academic%20Integrity%20in%20Higher%20Education%20across%20the%20European%20Union.pdf?sequence=2 procedures, and honor codes, but it is also being taught in ethics classes and being noted in syllabi. Many universities have sections on their websites devoted to academic integrity which define what the term means to their specific institution. Honor code can help improve trust and honesty to students and give credits to those that actually wrote it. It can help teachers and students create an honor pledge that allows them to have severe punishments to those who committed academic dishonesty. The honor pledge is created before the assignment is assigned and need to be read over and signed, so it can show that the student is agreeing to not violate any rules. Universities have moved toward an inclusive approach to inspiring academic integrity, by creating Student Honor Councils as well as taking a more active role in making students aware of the consequences for academic dishonesty. Academic Integrity is also the meaning of what it truly feels to be involved with many on campus activities, and making contributions to local community. Gary Pavela, Director of Judicial Programs and Student Ethical Development, University of Maryland stated that \\"Promoting student moral development requires affirming shared values. More colleges are starting to focus on one value that goes to the heart of the academic enterprise: a commitment to honesty in the pursuit of truth.\\" To promote the academic integrity, publication ethics, and responsible research in the higher education system in India, the University Grants Commission (India) enacted the \\"UGC (Promotion of Academic Integrity and Prevention of Plagiarism in Higher Educational Institutions) Regulations, 2018\\" on July 23, 2018. The Regulations then recommend some institutional mechanisms to eliminate the scope of plagiarism. Apart from the Assessment Guide, the Computer Science and Engineering Department of The Chinese University of Hong Kong has invented a plagiarism detection software system named as VeriGuide. This system aims at upholding the academic honesty levels of various academic institutions (such as: universities, community colleges). Through its website, the system provides a platform for students and educators to manage and submit academic works (i.e. student assignments). The system also provides as a function of analyzing the readability of academic works and serve as an assignment collection system and database. Despite these advances, academic dishonesty still plagues the university. In the 1990s, the academic dishonesty rates were as bad as, and in some cases, worse than they were in the 1960s. The acknowledgement of this ethics crisis is inspiring many universities to focus more on promoting common values of academic integrity. Conversely, critics have drawn attention to the fact that \\"teaching and learning are interrupted because faculty, in an effort to control plagiarism and protect notions of intellectual capital, are forced to engage with the students as detectives rather than as teachers, advisors, or mentors. The focus on controlling plagiarism among students is critiqued as unnecessarily legalistic and the rules more rigid than those necessarily accorded to intellectual property law (Marsh, 2004)\\". Similarly, contributions made from a societal perspective question or critique previously unexamined assumptions of the \\"inherent goodness, universality, and absoluteness of independence, originality, and authorship (Valentine, 2006). Authors who write about the societal dimension such as Ede and Lundsford (2001) do not suggest the elimination of notions of individual authorship and the unconditional acceptance of copying and collaboration in its place. Rather, the societal dimension highlights the need to consider both and the importance of deconstructing how the idea of the \\"individual author\\" might be serving (or not serving) the goals of teaching (learning), service, and research. Postsecondary education institutions are urged to step back from the mindless or fear-based ready adoption of the \\"turnitin culture\\" (Maruca, 2005) to allow for such question asking in the spirit of enhancing academic integrity and the teaching and learning environment.\\" See also *Academic dishonesty *Research integrity *Exam proctoring *Contract cheating *Plagiarism  Journals  Peer-reviewed and practitioner journals that address topics related to academic integrity include: * International Journal for Educational Integrity * Journal of Academic Ethics * Canadian Perspectives on Academic Integrity References External links *Rhode Island College LibGuide ‚Äì Academic Integrity *Publication ethics checklist (for routine use during manuscript submission to a journal) Integrity Category:Ethically disputed educational practices ","title":"Academic integrity"},{"id":"26690994","text":"Lester Berchart Reiff (1877-1948) was an American jockey who achieved racing acclaim in the United Kingdom in the first decade of the twentieth century.

This followed an incident at Manchester Racecourse on 27 September in which Lester's horse had finished second by a head to a horse ridden by his brother. The local stewards (racecourse officials) were unsatisfied by the brothers' explanations and so referred the matter to the Jockey Club. Lord Durham also accused the brothers of involvement in a horse doping ring along with Enoch Wishard and other American gamblers. While \\"doping\\" with performance enhancing stimulants was illegal at the time in the United States, it was still permissible in the UK in 1901 and was not outlawed until 1904. Lester Reiff's license was revoked for the 1902 season due to these incidents and he was barred or \\"warned off\\" from racing in other countries. His license was reinstated in 1904 but unlike his brother who resumed his career with success, Lester did not pursue horse racing again.

The population was 952 at the 2010 census. \\"Woodland\\" was originally the name of the entire town of Baileyville. However, because the state of Maine has a law stating that no two towns may share the same name, Woodland of Aroostook County and Woodland of Washington County found themselves before the Maine Supreme Judicial Court in the late 1990s. Because it was founded as a township first, the Woodland of Aroostook County was allowed to keep its name, and Woodland of Washington County was ordered by the court to choose a new name: \\"Baileyville\\".

This addition met with mixed reviews as The Globe and Mail author Stephen Godfrey wrote in his ‚ÄúA Storm Warning‚Äù article. He said ‚Äúthe scenes are as refreshing as the rest of the film and show Winning‚Äôs talent for creating suspense and sympathy. But the structure of the film is now unbalanced; in its original form, Storm was an elaborate tease, a cat-and-mouse game that escalated gradually...‚Äù The new segments were filmed in the winter of January 1987 in Bragg Creek and Calgary, Alberta with the original cast. Distribution and theatrical release Storm was picked up by Cannon Films Cannon International for worldwide distribution in December 1986. The Canadian theatrical release was handled separately by Thomas Howe Associates of Vancouver, Canada with a premiere in Calgary November 26, 1987 followed by a Canadian theatrical run. Storm also ran theatrically in Los Angeles in December 1989 to qualify for the Academy Awards and was reviewed positively by the LA Times. Reception Kevin Thomas, of the Los Angeles Times called the movie taut, ambitious and darkly comic in a 1989 review. He said the film worked very effectively as a comment on the male psyche and how lethal the mix of fear and aggression can be when men have a need to prove their masculinity for reasons imagined or real. The Globe and Mail writer Jay Scott in an August 28, 1985 review called it a remarkable new thriller and a comic combination of Treasure of the Sierra Madre and Deliverance. Peter Goddard of the Toronto Star wrote Winning‚Äôs sense of movement within a scene is already masterly. He could make ice melting seem exciting. Fred Haeseker in a November 1987 Calgary Herald review wrote that it‚Äôs a tongue-in-cheek pastiche of time-honored shock effects and rite-of- passage clich√©s, seen with a sense of humor that is usually missing from the pictures that spawned them.

The novel recounts the authors' childhood lives growing up in a household of 12 children. The bestselling book was later adapted into a feature film by Twentieth Century Fox in 1950 and followed up by the sequel, Belles on Their Toes (1950), which was adapted as a 1952 film. Plot The book tells the story of time and motion study and efficiency experts Frank Bunker Gilbreth and Lillian Moller Gilbreth, and their children as they reside in Montclair, New Jersey, for many years. Lillian Gilbreth was described in the 1940s as \\"a genius in the art of living\\". The best-selling biographical novel was composed by two of the children, who wrote about their childhoods. Gilbreth's home doubled as a sort of real-world laboratory that tested her and her husband Frank's ideas about education and efficiency. The book is more of a series of stories, many of which are humorous, with little overarching narrative. The title comes from one of Frank Sr.'s favorite jokes: it often happened that when he and his family were out driving and stopped at a red light, a pedestrian would ask, \\"Hey, Mister! How come you got so many kids?\\" Gilbreth would pretend to ponder the question carefully, and then, just as the light turned green, would say, \\"Well, they come cheaper by the dozen, you know\\", and drive off. At several points in the book, a total number of children is spoken of as being 12. In real life, although the Gilbreths had 12 children who survived infanthood, only up to 11 were living at the time of the stories. In fact, when Mary died of diphtheria at age five, seven of her siblings were not yet born, so there never were 12 children alive at the same time. The only chapter that mentions Mary by name is the one that tells the stories of the children's births; otherwise, she is not mentioned and her absence is not explained. It was not until the sequel, Belles on Their Toes, was published in 1950 that Mary's death is mentioned in a footnote. In the rest of the book, only the 11 children who lived to adulthood are mentioned by name. From oldest to youngest, they are Anne, Ernestine (Ern), Martha (Mart), Frank Jr., Bill, Lillian (Lill), Fred, Dan, John (Jack), Bob, and Jane. The stories in the book are organized topically. They skip around in time, and the details of the timing are not always made clear. For example, Bill is mentioned as having been 6 years old at the time of the story in which he honks the car horn while his father is under the hood trying to fix the engine. This would have been around 1919, before the three youngest children were born, though this detail is not mentioned. The book ends with the sudden death of Frank Sr, which occurred in 1924. At that time, the oldest child (Anne) was 20 years old and the youngest (Jane) was nearly 2 years old. Adaptations Cheaper by the Dozen was made into a 1950 motion picture, starring Clifton Webb and Myrna Loy as Frank and Lillian Gilbreth. The film was produced by 20th Century Fox. Cheaper by the Dozen was adapted as a stage play in 1992 by Christopher Sergel. It played at Grey Lite Theatre in 1992, directed by Lori David. Cheaper by the Dozen has been adapted as a musical, dramatized by Christopher Sergel with a score by David Rogers and Mark Bucci. Cheaper by the Dozen (2003) and Cheaper by the Dozen 2 (2005), starring comedians Steve Martin and Bonnie Hunt, have little relationship with the book other than the title and the focus on a family with 12 children. On the cover of Kate's book (Kate is the female lead character in the movies), the title is shown to be Cheaper by the Dozen, and the author's maiden name appears as Gilbreth (the name of the real family in the book upon which the 1950 film was based). During a game of Apple Schmear, Nora tells Hank that her \\"Great Grandma Gilbreth\\" invented the game. Furthermore, Lorraine and Tom argue about how much time she should be allotted in front of the mirror in the mornings. He allots her a few extra minutes, connecting back to the time efficiency specialist that the father, Frank Gilbreth, was in the 1950 film. On August 6, 2019, following the acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney, Disney CEO Bob Iger announced that a reboot of Cheaper by the Dozen is in development and would premiere on the company's streaming service, Disney+.https://www.teenvogue.com/story/disney- will-remake-cheaper-by-the-dozen-home-alone-more-beloved-films Gail Lerner is set to direct the film with a script co-written by Kenya Barris and Jenifer Rice-Genzuk Henry.https://thedisinsider.com/2019/08/11/gail-lerner-to-direct- cheaper-by-the-dozen-reboot/ Contemporary appraisals Re-reading the book in 2003, Pulitzer Prize-winning critic Jonathan Yardley wrote in The Washington Post: \\"[I]t is a joy to report that Cheaper by the Dozen still reads remarkably well. ... The prose ... is unadorned and matter of fact, and its organizational structure is a bit difficult to detect, but what matters most is that it is a touching family portrait that also happens to be very, very funny.\\" The book won the French International Humor Award and has been translated into a dozen languages.

The fight ended in a North Korean victory following a successful ambush of US forces which resulted in heavy American casualties. The US Army's 3rd Battalion, 29th Infantry Regiment, a newly formed unit consisting mostly of inexperienced new arrivals, was ordered to move to the South Korean village of Hadong to hold the pass there against advancing forces of the North Korean Korean People's Army (KPA). Unprepared for combat, the American forces walked into an ambush in which most of the battalion's command staff was killed in the pass, leaving lower-ranking soldiers to mount a disorganized defence against North Korean troops occupying prepared positions on higher ground. For three hours the battalion fought, pinned in a crossfire by North Korean soldiers on higher ground. North Korean forces were able to divide the American force and kill most of its commanders, further disorganizing the men. Following the failed operation, the wounded US commander ordered a withdrawal, which quickly became disorganized, resulting in hundreds of casualties. Destroyed after its first engagement, the 3rd Battalion, 29th Infantry Regiment was disbanded and merged with other units as the North Korean forces advanced through the pass and attacked US positions to the east.  Background  = Outbreak of war = Following the invasion of South Korea by North Korea, and the subsequent outbreak of the Korean War as a result, the United Nations decided to commit troops to the conflict on behalf of South Korea. The United States subsequently sent ground forces to the Korean peninsula with the goal of fighting back the North Korean invasion and to prevent South Korea from collapsing. However, US forces in the Far East had been steadily decreasing since the end of World War II in 1945, and at the time the closest forces were the 24th Infantry Division of the Eighth United States Army, which was headquartered in Japan. The division was understrength, and most of its equipment was antiquated due to reductions in military spending. Regardless, the 24th Infantry Division was ordered into South Korea. US Forces retreat during the Battle of Taejon The 24th Infantry Division was the first US unit sent into Korea with the mission to take the initial \\"shock\\" of North Korean advances, delaying much larger KPA units to buy time to allow follow-on forces to arrive. The division was consequently outnumbered and outgunned for several weeks as it attempted to delay the KPA, making time for the 7th Infantry Division, 25th Infantry Division, 1st Cavalry Division and other Eighth Army supporting units to move into position. Republic of Korea Army (ROK) forces in the meantime were systematically defeated and forced south along Korea's east coast, with entire divisions being overrun by the KPA's superior firepower and equipment. Advance elements of the 24th Infantry Division were badly defeated in the Battle of Osan on July 5, during the first battle between American and North Korean forces. For the first month after the defeat of Task Force Smith, 24th Infantry Division soldiers were repeatedly defeated and forced south by the KPA's superior numbers and equipment. The regiments of the 24th Infantry Division were systematically pushed south in battles around Chochiwon, Chonan, and Pyongtaek. The 24th Infantry Division made a final stand in the Battle of Taejon, being almost completely destroyed but delaying North Korean forces from advancing until July 20. By that time, the Eighth Army's force of combat troops were roughly equal to North Korean forces attacking the region at around 70,000 for each side, with new UN units arriving every day. = Replacements arrive = On July 20, 400 hastily assembled US Army recruits arrived in Okinawa aboard the . The inexperienced soldiers were assigned to the 29th Infantry Regiment, 2nd Infantry Division, a command that was preparing other battalions to move into Korea and to relieve the other units of the 24th Infantry Division. The new formations, now consisting mostly of soldiers who had no combat experience and grouped into two battalions, were immediately sent into Pusan. The headquarters of the regiment remained behind to form a new regiment. This regiment would originally be in charge of the defense of Okinawa but would later be rushed into Korea. The two battalions landed in Pusan on July 21 and were assigned to the 19th Infantry Regiment, 24th Infantry Division, but they retained their designations as the 1st and 3rd Battalions of the 29th Infantry Regiment. Instead of being given time to train and prepare to enter the front lines, the battalions were immediately sent to the regiment's sector at Chinju. By July 22 the units were on the front lines with new equipment. The equipment, fresh from production lines, was not prepared for combat, despite promises from several commanders that the unit would be given time to do so.  Battle  American planners believed that the Hadong area was under attack from elements of the KPA 4th Division, having just received replacements following its victory at Taejon. However, the soldiers in the area were actually from the KPA 6th Division under the command of General Pang Ho San. The two divisions were coordinating to envelop the UN's left flank and were extremely spread out. Therefore, only groups of a few hundred were advancing through the region, some with small numbers of tanks. = Arrival = Hadong county, South Korea, area of the ambush Immediately after arrival, the commanding officer of the 19th Infantry Regiment, Colonel Ned D. Moore, ordered the 3rd Battalion, 29th Infantry to move out and seize the Hadong pass, a road junction southwest of Chinju, where about 500 North Korean soldiers were reported to be moving. Eighth Army had also received reports that the KPA had been fighting South Korean police who were resisting in the village of Hadong, west of the pass. The battalion commander, Lieutenant Colonel Harold W. Mott, alerted his troops, and at 00:30 on July 26, the battalion departed alone on its mission. It had a strength of 925 men. The battalion was to hold the pass, a southern route into Pusan, from any advancing North Korean forces. Hadong was seen as a significant path into Chinju, despite its lack of defenses. The North Koreans, in the meantime, advanced to Hadong and captured the village which was lightly defended by a group of South Korean police, as no military was available due to manpower shortages. The KPA 6th Division set up in roads east of the village and began sending probes and scout parties to the east. The move was part of a larger coordinated operation by the 6th Division to take Chinju, and then Masan, in hopes of flanking the UN lines at their vulnerable southern limit. Thinking the UN units were disorganized and suffering low morale, KPA 6th Division commander General Pang Ho San ordered his forces to aggressively advance to Chinju as quickly as possible. Accompanying the 3rd Battalion was South Korean Major General Chae Byong Duk, South Korea's Army Chief of Staff who had been relieved after the fall of Seoul. Having fallen out of favor with the South Korean command, Chae was to be an interpreter and guide for 3rd Battalion on its mission. He accompanied the battalion with only a few of his aides. The battalion was forced to take several detours through Konyang because of impassable roads, and it was delayed in its arrival to Hadong. Shortly before dawn, the troops encountered a truck of 15 South Korean militia who claimed they were the remains of a 400-man unit that had been wiped out by KPA forces in the area. Mott sent his executive officer back to the command post to ask Moore for further instructions, and Moore ordered them to proceed with the mission. Because the battalion had no radio equipment it was forced to send a runner to relay this information, and he returned by nightfall, forcing the battalion to encamp in the village of Hoengchon, west of Hadong, for the night. = Ambush = At 08:45 on July 27 the battalion moved out towards the Hadong pass, arriving within an hour. When it was within of the pass, L Company at the head of the formation spotted a North Korean patrol. The company's heavy weapons were fired at the patrol, forcing it to withdraw but causing no casualties. L Company then rushed the pass and dug in at 09:30, waiting for a scheduled airstrike on the village of Hadong to the west at 09:45. Behind L Company was the battalion command group, followed by K and M Companies, with I Company covering the rear. The battalion's command group, including Mott, Chae and most of the senior officers, approached the pass as L Company took cover on the left side of the road. As they approached the pass, a company of KPA soldiers was spotted up the road, part of a scouting party looking to probe further east. L Company was preparing to ambush the North Koreans when they got closer, but before this could happen, Chae called out to the Koreans demanding they identify themselves. The North Koreans immediately ducked for cover in the ditches on the side of the road, and L Company opened fire on them. Hadong village, 1950 Immediately the American forces were hit with machine gun and mortar fire from the north ridge, where North Korean troops had been dug in. The first burst of machine gun fire killed Chae and wounded most of the other commanders, including Mott. Mott managed to make it to the ditch where American forces dug him a foxhole, but soon after all the Americans in his vicinity were killed or withdrew and he was left alone and unable to communicate with the rest of the battalion. The KPA had the US battalion in a crossfire on higher ground, both from the pass and from the ridge. Mortar fire knocked out many parked vehicles, including the radio jeep of a US Air Force tactical air-control party which was to direct airstrikes. During the fight two flights of US aircraft flew over the area trying in vain to contact the party, and when unable to do so, left the area without making any strikes. The 3rd Battalion had walked into a prepared North Korean ambush, suffering a bombardment of mortar and machine gun fire from prepared and hidden positions, and almost its entire command group was eliminated within a minute of the first shot being fired. L Company, at the pass, was heavily engaged with the KPA forces higher on the hill. The company's 1st Platoon sustained a direct assault on its foxholes, with two members of the company killed by bayonets. L Company was separated from the rest of the battalion by KPA forces advancing on its position further up the ridge. K Company attempted to move up to relieve it but was unable to do so. However, the company held in place. Meanwhile, I Company began moving up the hill to provide support. KPA forces were able to cut the battalion into disorganized groups, with L Company engaging forces in the pass and I Company under attack from forces on the north ridge behind them. By noon, the North Korean forces on the higher ground had enveloped the American forces. = American withdrawal = At 12:00, Mott was brought to the position of L Company commander Captain George F. Sharra. Mott ordered Sharra to take command and organize a retreat. Sharra ordered his three platoons to withdraw. A KPA battalion began moving down the pass towards the American positions. Men of I Company were forced to withdraw through rice paddies south of the pass, being strafed by mortar and machine gun fire in the process. They also had to cross a -wide stream in the retreat, and some drowned in the process. Most of the Americans were forced to discard weapons, equipment and clothing in the retreat. Many of the men of L Company, as well as some of the wounded, were able to evacuate by truck. Survivors from 3rd Battalion disengaged from the battle in groups. The largest group of 97 survivors moved south to the small port of Noryangjin where a fishing vessel carried them out to a Republic of Korea Navy patrol boat. Other groups of soldiers escaped into the hills while some had to fight their way back to Chinju. Most of the battalion's officers were casualties in the fight, and the scattered and disorganized retreat destroyed the battalion. Stragglers continued to wander into the 19th Infantry's lines throughout the rest of the day.  Aftermath  More than half of the American battalion was lost during its first engagement. Only 354 members of the battalion, including some walking wounded, were able to report for duty the next day. A captured North Korean soldier reported that around 100 men had been captured at Hadong. A later search uncovered 313 American bodies, most along the river and in the rice paddies south of the pass. Official casualties for the Americans in the battle were 242 killed, 135 wounded, 51 captured, and 67 missing, for a total of 495 casualties. However, two of the prisoners died in captivity and all but four of the missing were found dead, leaving the total number killed during the battle at 307. Over 30 vehicles and practically all of the soldiers' weapons used by 3rd Battalion were lost. Casualties of North Korean forces could not be estimated by the American units. The shattered 3rd Battalion traveled back to Chinju to join the 19th Infantry Regiment. There it was disbanded and its remaining men were assigned to the 19th Infantry Regiment, which itself had suffered heavy losses. Meanwhile, the 1st Battalion, 29th Infantry was sent to Anui to the north, where it was attacked and pushed back repeatedly by the KPA 4th Division. On July 31, the KPA 6th Division struck Chinju, pushing back the 19th Infantry Regiment and the 3rd Battalion, 29th Infantry, forcing them to withdraw east. This left the southern entries to Pusan open, but the KPA 6th Division was unable to exploit it due to its extended supply line. The 6th Division eventually advanced further east, attempting to capture the city of Masan, but newly reorganized troops of the US Army repulsed them and inflicted heavy casualties on them less than a week later during the Battle of the Notch.

Canada established relations with the United Arab Emirates in 1974. Each maintains an embassy in the other's capital.  History Formal relations between the two countries were established in 1974, 3 years after the independence of the United Arab Emirates. Diplomatic relationship Canada's ambassador to the United Arab Emirates, Masud Husain, appointed October 23, 2016, completed his term in July 2019. As of September 2019, no new Canadian Ambassador to the UAE has been named.

Aviation Travel between Canada and United Arab Emirates is operated by Emirates and Etihad with 5 flights operating weekly, and Air Canada operating 3 flights weekly. Emirates airlines operates 5 flights between Toronto and Dubai on Airbus A380 aircraft, Air Canada operates 3 flights between Toronto and Dubai on Boeing 787 Dreamliner aircraft and Etihad operates 5 flights between Toronto and Abu Dhabi on a Boeing 777-300ER aircraft. = Aviation dispute= The Canada‚ÄìUnited Arab Emirates aviation dispute was a dispute between Canada and the United Arab Emirates over aviation rights. The dispute revolved around Canada's refusal to allow extra landing rights to Emirati air carriers: Emirates Airlines and Etihad Airways. The dispute has resolved in July 2018 after Canada opened its airspace to 5 flights a week between Toronto and Dubai and Toronto and Abu Dhabi.  Background  In 1999 Canada and the United Arab Emirates signed their first air agreement, under which Emirati airliners would be allowed to fly into Canada six times a week. In October 2007 Emirates began offering three flights a week between Toronto and Dubai; soon after this it began requesting that Canada allow increased flights to the country as part of an expansion plan to service increased demand between Canada and the UAE, citing the 27,000 Canadians residing in the UAE and important trade relationships between the two countries, Canada's largest trade partner in the Middle East. Negotiations between the two countries occurred for several years, but resulted in little to no progress. In June 2010, an agreement for the Canadian military to use a UAE military base to service its operations in Afghanistan expired. The UAE granted a three-month extension of the military base lease, but further talks stalled and the agreement was not renewed after again expiring in October. In November 2010 it was reported that although Air Canada objected to any increased service to Canadian destinations, Canada was prepared to offer more landing slots at Calgary and Vancouver. The UAE wasn't satisfied with anything less than more flights to Toronto, however.U.A.E. wanted only Toronto air access: sources CBC News, 8 November 2010. It was also reported that Canada's offers included a capacity cut instead of a capacity increase, meaning that the offers were of little value to the UAE and UAE negotiators were accordingly offended.Bruce Cheadle UAE envoy explains tit- for-tat visa demand Canadian Press, 9 November 2010.  Closure of airspace to Canadian ministers' plane  On 11 October 2010, Canada's Minister of National Defence, Peter MacKay, spoke at a news conference in Kandahar, Afghanistan, while visiting Canadian troops stating that negotiations with the UAE to extend the lease of the Canadian base had failed and that the Canadian Forces would vacate Camp Mirage in compliance with the UAE's wishes. This posed a potential problem for transportation to and from Afghanistan. Hours later MacKay, Chief of the Defence Staff General Walter Natynczyk and Veterans Affairs Minister Jean-Pierre Blackburn were on a plane back to Canada which was scheduled to land at Camp Mirage when it was denied landing rights and forced to reroute to Europe. The UAE responded to the incident saying that the Canadian government of Prime Minister Stephen Harper (Conservative Party) was distorting information about the incident; that the plane had been notified ahead of time that landing rights had been suspended, and that the Harper government was resorting to \\"fear tactics\\" to spin a negative light on the UAE in the Canadian media. The Harper government in turn said that it would not be \\"blackmailed\\" by the UAE using its military base as a bargaining chip.  Possible effect on Canada's United Nations Security Council bid  According to Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, an unnamed UAE official stated that the UAE lobbied against Canada's bid in the 2010 United Nations Security Council election, which Canada failed to acquire a seat in, due to the airline dispute. No official connection or response was made by Canada or UAE regarding the news source.  Visa requirements imposed on Canadians  In November 2010 the UAE announced that Canadians would require visas to enter the UAE beginning 2 January 2011.U.A.E. slaps visas on Canadians CBC News, 8 November 2010. Visa requirements for UAE citizens to enter Canada were already present. After a nuclear deal was signed between Canada and UAE in September 2012, the visa fees ($1,000 for a six-month, multiple-entry visa, and $250 for a 30-day visa) has been reduced by a third. Canada and the United Arab Emirates agreed to end the visa requirements for Canadians traveling to UAE when Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister John Baird and his UAE counterpart Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan met on 2 April 2013, during Baird's visit to the UAE. They announced that they have agreed to restore the visa regime that existed prior to the dispute. They said the two countries are also ready to sign a nuclear co-operation deal. Details on the two agreements formalized in the next month.  2011 Canadian federal election  On 2 May 2011, Canadians went to the polls in the 41st federal election and once again the Conservative Party of Stephen Harper emerged as the party with most elected representatives, this time with a majority of seats in Parliament. This was much to the dismay of the UAE, which considered Harper largely responsible for the souring of their bilateral relationship. The Emirati airlines have since announced that they will take some time before reapproaching the deal with Canadian authorities.  Resolution  In June 2018, Sultan Al Mansouri, the UAE's Minister of Economy, met with Marc Garneau, the Canadian Minister of Transport, in Ottawa to discuss cooperation in the air transport field. The meeting came during the same time where Canadian-Emirati relations seem to have improved drastically, with Canada declaring that UAE has met the status quo for visa free travel and removed its visa requirements for Emirati citizens. In July 2018, the years-long dispute has been resolved as Emirates Airlines and Etihad Airlines announced that they will increase their flights to Toronto 5 times a week after signing an agreement with Canadian authorities.

Biography Charles H. Brower was born in Asbury Park, New Jersey and came from a long line of Dutch New Jersey farmers. His father, Charles Hendrick Brower, was an insurance agent and owner of two butcher shops. In 1903 his father sold the butcher shops and purchased a ranch near Pasadena, California. After the ranch failed, the family moved to Pasadena and lived there a few years. In Pasadena, Brower first attended Columbia Grammar School, and then Pasadena High School, specializing in agriculture. He also worked as a paperboy for the Los Angeles Examiner. During his junior year in high school his parents inherited some money from an uncle and moved back to New Jersey, settling in Freehold, New Jersey, where Brower attended Freehold High School, graduating in the class of 1920.\\"Alumni of Rutgers To Honor Brower\\", Asbury Park Press, March 20, 1959.

He entered Rutgers on a scholarship to study agriculture, he then changed his major to physics, and then once again to English. He graduated from Rutgers College (NJ) in 1925 with a Bachelor of Science in English. After graduation he worked as a teacher of English in Middlesex County Vocational School, and then as a full-time teacher at the Bound Brook High School in New Jersey. Though he liked teaching, he did not like the salary it provided, and began a search for a different career path. He worked briefly in Boston as a trainee adjuster for a casualty insurance company, and then as an assistant advertising manager at Pacific Mills. On July 8, 1930, Brower married Marry Elizabeth Nelson. They had three children, Brock H. Brower (1931-2014) a journalist and novelist; Charles N.

Along with the Zuo Zhuan and the Guliang Zhuan, the work is one of the Three Commentaries on the Spring and Autumn Annals. In particular, Gongyang Zhuan is a central work to New Text Confucianism (), which advocates Confucius as an institutional reformer instead of a respected scholar, and Chunqiu as an embodiment of Confucius' holistic vision on political, social, and moral issues instead of a merely chronicle. Gongyang Zhuan significantly influenced the political institution in Han Dynasty. It fell out of favor among elites and was eventually replaced by the Zuo Zhuan. Gongyang Zhuan scholarship was reinvigorated in late Ming Dynasty and became a major source of inspiration for Chinese reformers from eighteen to early twentieth century. Sima Qian states that Mencius, Gongsun Gu, Xunzi and Han Fei often drew on the Gongyang, while actually they drew on commentaries similar to what we now call the Zuozhuan; for him the distinction was meaningless.Liang Cai The Journal of the American Oriental Society. 131.3 (July‚ÄìSeptember 2011): p371. Excavating the genealogy of classical studies in the western Han dynasty (206 B.C.E.-8 C.E.) Content Gongyang Zhuan argues that Chunqiu is not merely a history, but a manifesto of Confucius' philosophy on his ideal regarding sociopolitical order. Unlike Zuo Zhuan, a later favorite among many scholars for its vivid narrative of historical events, Gongyang Zhuan was compiled in a dialogistic style resembling a class conversation between a Confucian scholar and his student discussing the \\"profound meanings behind the subtle words [of \\"Chunqiu\\"]\\"(), and was brief in explaining the historical context. Because of its emphasis on the theoretical interpretation of the Annals, Jiang Qing (b. 1953) dubbed it \\"the political theory wing of Confucianism ().\\" The primary assumption of Gongyang Zhuan is that Confucius authored Chunqiu in order to criticize the politics of his time and set a constitutional guideline for future generations. Moreover, Confucius is not merely a transmitter of ancient scholarship but a charismatic sage () who should have received the Mandate of Heaven and become a King himself. But since Confucius did not receive the kingship due to the political circumstances at the time, he compiled Chunqiu based on official chronicles, in which he criticized () the events and historical figures of the Spring and Autumn period according to a coherent philosophy. Based on this assumption, Gongyang Zhuan strives to undercover what it claims to be the deeper meaning behind layers of subtle texts. Gongyang Zhuan's interpretation of Chunqiu is more voluntarism than that advocated by the Old Texts scholars. =Dong Zhongshu's interpretation= Dong Zhongshu was a leading Confucian scholar in the Western Han dynasty, and was regarded as an authority on Gongyang Zhuan. Dong advocated According to Qing Dynasty scholar Kang Youwei's summary, some of Gongyang Zhuan's political agenda including the establishment of a well-ordered hierarchical regime (), a strong and centralized political authority (), and a merit-based civil government (), and a benevolent ruler whose legitimacy is based on the Mandate of Heaven. =Jiang Qing's reading= According to contemporary scholar Jiang Qing's Introductory Treatise on Gongyang Scholarship (), Gongyang Zhuan includes the following themes: *Three Stages of Human History (). Gongyang Zhuan' argues that human society evolves over time and could be divided into three phases. The first stage (Êìö‰∫Ç‰∏ñ) is marked by political chaos and social anomy, the second stage () is characterized by the reestablishment of legitimate political order, and the third stage (Â§™Âπ≥‰∏ñ) is when the world as a whole experiences great harmony and every individual is able to fully realize their potential. *Unity of cosmological and political order () *Reconciliation between past and present sources of political legitimacy () *Limitation on monarchical power () *Distinction between legitimate political maneuver and realpolitik () *Interaction between human and heaven () *Distinction between Chinese and non-Chinese cultures () *Just retribution () Early development The genealogy of Gongyang Zhuan has been a contested issue among scholars. According to the Book of Han, Bu Shang (Zixia), one of the top disciples of Confucius, taught Confucius' class notes to his disciple Gongyang Gao (ÂÖ¨ÁæäÈ´ò) of the State of Qi during the Warring States period (475‚Äì221 BCE). An oral commentary at first, it was written down and edited during the early Han Dynasty by Gongyang Gao's decedent Gongyang Shou (ÂÖ¨ÁæäÂ£Ω) and his collaborator Humu Sheng (ËÉ°ÊØçÁîü). Humu Sheng later became a boshi (\\"erudite\\") in the Han court in charge of the studying and teaching of Gongyang Zhuan. Along with him was another Gongyang Zhuan authority Dong Zhongshu. With Emperor Wu of Han's adoption of Dong's proposal to formally establish Confucianism as the state ideology, the power and influence of the Gongyang School increased significantly. Later, Dong Zhongshu authored Luxuriant Dew of the Spring and Autumn Annals, Interactions Between Heaven and Mankind and Strange Calamities of Yin and Yang, in which he popularized his mysticism interpretation of Gongyang Zhuan. Along with the widespread adoption of divination practices, the Han intelligentsia became shrouded in an atmosphere of superstition and mystery. Nonetheless, among officials, Gongyang School was seen as a vital political classic that provided ideological basis and historical precedents in governing, and was cited during policy debates. Dong Zhongshu's two students, Yan Pengzu (Âö¥ÂΩ≠Á•ñ) and Yan Anle (È°èÂÆâÊ®Ç) became the leaders of Gongyang School after Dong's death. Some exegesis monographs by Gongyang scholars mounts to over one million characters in length, that scholars from other schools accused Gongyang school for being too fixated on the trivia of Chunqiu. At the end of Western Han Dynasty, scholar Liu Xin proposed to establish professorship for Zuo Zhuan and ‚Äò‚ÄôGuliang Zhuan. Once his advice was adopted, Gongyang school no longer monopolized the official interpretation of Spring and Autumn Annals. From the time of the Eastern Han Dynasty onwards, more and more people criticized Dong Zhongshu's interpretation of the Gongyang Zhuan. During the later years of the Han Dynasty, He Xiu (‰Ωï‰ºë) became the most ardent defender of Gongyang School. He combated vigorously with scholars who prefer Zuo Zhuan and Guliang Zhuan. After spending seventeen years, he wrote a hermeneutics work on Gongyang Zhuan, which is largely survived into modern days. He Xiu's work became the primary source for textual reconstruction of Gongyang Zhuan and a major source of inspiration for later Gongyang scholars. Huan Kuan (Ê°ìÂØ¨), author of the Confucian political treatise Discourses on Salt and Iron (ÈπΩÈêµË´ñ), was another notable Gongyang Scholar. Commentaries In his Confucian work Discourse on the Six Arts (ÂÖ≠ËóùË´ñ), the Han scholar Zheng Xuan makes the following comment: :The Zuo Zhuan is best with regards to Confucian rites, the Gongyang Zhuan for divination and the Guliang Zhuan for the classical view of Confucianism. The Eastern Jin Dynasty scholar Fan Ning (ËåÉÂØß) (grandfather of Fan Ye, author of the Book of the Later Han), in his commentary on works relating to the Spring and Autumn Annals said that the Zuo Zhuan was colorful and rich in content but contains too much wizardry, the Guliang Zhuan was clear and elegantly written but too short whilst the Gongyang Zhuan seemed argumentative, judgmental and vulgar in style. In the opinion of the Han scholar and official He Xiu (‰Ωï‰ºë), the Gongyang Zhuan's achievement is its appraisal of the Spring and Autumn Annals to expound the \\"great way of Confucianism\\" through the use of subtle and profound language. Later development In the period between the Eastern Wu and the end of the Southern and Northern Dynasties (229-589 CE), the official He Xiu School was established. During the Tang Dynasty, study of the Gongyang Zhuan gradually declined with very few academics concentrating on the work. Gongyang scholarship was introduced to Japan. Notable scholars include Hayashi Razan and his son Hayashi Gah≈ç. Hayashi Gah≈ç later published a commentated version of Gongyang Zhuan (ÂÖ¨Ë∞∑ÁôΩÊñá) in 1688, attributing the comments to his father. During the Qing Dynasty the study of textual criticism flourished with successive scholars researching the Gongyang Zhuan and reinvigorating its ideas. This re-evaluation of the work was probably a response to the massive social and political changes of the period which caused scholars to reassess the dominant official interpretation of Confucianism. Gongyang Zhuan played an important role in the works of the Changzhou School of Thought (Â∏∏Â∑ûÂ≠∏Ê¥æ) proponents. The school held an important position during the late Qing Dynasty as a mainstream center of learning with scholars such as Kong Guangsen (Â≠îÂª£Ê£Æ), Zhuang Cunyu (ËéäÂ≠òËàá), Liu Fenglu (ÂäâÈÄ¢Á•ø), Gong Zizhen (ÈæîËá™Áèç), Wei Yuan (È≠èÊ∫ê) and Kang Youwei (Â∫∑ÊúâÁà≤) amongst others. The school's main target for criticism was the Old Texts (Âè§ÊñáÁ∂ì). In particular, Kang Youwei's interpretation helped facilitated the widespread doubt on the Old Texts among intellectuals, and thus creating a sympathetic audience for his reformist ideas, which later became well known in Hundred Days' Reform. In 1995, Chinese scholar Jiang Qing (Ëî£ÊÖ∂) published his work Introductory Treatise on Gongyang Scholarship, which marked the revived interest in the Gongyang Zhuan among modern political theorists.

Algoman orogeny added landmass to the Superior province by volcanic activity and continental collision along a boundary that stretches from present-day South Dakota, U.S., into the Lake Huron region near Sudbury, Ontario, Canada. It is long, and separates the older Archean gneissic terrane to the south from younger Late Archean greenstone-granite terrane to the north. The zone is characterized by active compression during the Algoman orogeny (about ), a pulling-apart (extensional) tectonics (2,450 to 2,100 million years ago), a second compression during the Penokean orogeny (1,900 to 1,850 million years ago), a second extension during Middle Proterozoic time (1,600 million years ago) and minor reactivation during Phanerozoic time (the past 500 million years). Collision began along the Great Lakes tectonic zone with the Algoman mountain-building event and continued for tens of millions of years. During the formation of the GLTZ, the gneissic Minnesota River Valley subprovince was thrust up onto the Superior province's edge as it consumed the Superior province's oceanic crust. Fragmentation of the Kenorland supercontinent began and was completed by . The Wyoming province is the continental landmass that is hypothesized to have rifted away from the southern Superior province portion of Kenorland, before moving rapidly west and docking with the Laurentia supercontinent 1,850 to 1,715 million years ago. Sedimentation from the GLTZ-rifting environment continued into the Penokean orogeny, which is the next major tectonic event in the Great Lakes region. Several earthquakes have been documented in Minnesota, Michigan's Upper Peninsula and Sudbury in the last 120 years along the GLTZ. Location The Wawa subprovince is the wide green belt to the south; it is part of the Superior province. The Minnesota River Valley subprovince is also shown. During the Late Archean Eon the Algoman orogeny ‚Äì which occurred about ‚Äì added landmass through volcanic activity and continental collision along a boundary that stretches from present-day South Dakota, U.S., into the Sudbury, Ontario, Canada, region. The farthest west into South Dakota is 99¬∞W, which is about from the Minnesota ‚Äì South Dakota border. This crustal boundary is the Great Lakes tectonic zone (GLTZ). It is a long paleosuture that separates the more than 3,000-million-year-old Archean gneissic terrane to the south ‚Äì Minnesota River Valley subprovince ‚Äì from the 2,700-million-year-old Late Archean greenstone-granite terrane to the north ‚Äì Wawa Subprovince of the Superior province. The GLTZ is wide. Mechanism =Collision= This diagram shows the dynamics of two colliding continental plates. The Superior province was underridden by the Minnesota River Valley subprovince plate. The collision of the gneissic Minnesota River Valley (MRV) subprovince onto the southern edge of the Superior province was another process in the slow change in tectonics which marks the end of the Archean Eon. This gneissic terrane originally extended several hundred kilometers east to west, making it more of a protocontinent than a future Superior province belt. The boundary that separates the two colliding bodies is the Great Lakes tectonic zone; it is a fault zone of highly deformed rocks. Collision began along the GLTZ around and continued for tens of millions of years. The collision is interpreted to have happened obliquely at an angle, beginning in the west. =Suturing= The MRV subprovince experienced two distinct high-grade metamorphic events, one and the other . The first was probably during formation of the terrane, the second was during suturing. The growth of the Superior province greenstone-granitic terranes ended with the suturing of the Minnesota River Valley gneiss terrane to the basaltic Wawa subprovince. Suturing, the last stage of closure, started in South Dakota and continued eastward. During the formation of the GLTZ, the MRV protocontinent consumed the Superior province's oceanic crust as the subprovince came in from the south. Suturing of one continental block onto another usually occurs because a subduction zone exists beneath one of the blocks. The subduction zone consumes the oceanic crust connected to the other block. After the oceanic crust is consumed, the two blocks meet and the subducting oceanic crust pulls the attached continental block under the other. During the collision with the Superior province, the MRV gneissic block was thrust up onto the Superior province's edge; this resulted in a thrusted crumpled fault tens of kilometers wide producing a mountain range, and a shear zone which defines the boundary between the two terranes. Tectonism along the zone began during the docking of the two terranes into a single continental mass, and culminated in the early Proterozoic, where deformation took place under low to intermediate pressures. =Rifting= Hotspot causing rifting of tectonic plates After suturing, the region was tectonically quiet for a few hundred million years. The Algoman Mountains had been built and then eroded into sediments that covered the area. Fragmentation of this Archean supercontinent began around under a hotspot near Sudbury and was completed by around . This is when the Wyoming province is hypothesized to have drifted away from the Superior province. =Cessation of rifting= The pattern of sedimentation from this rifting environment continued into the Penokean orogeny, which is the next major tectonic event in the Great Lakes region. During the Penokean orogeny (1,850 to 1,900 million years ago), compression deformed the sequences in the Lake Superior region. GLTZ in Marquette, Michigan, area The pale yellow portion shows the Upper Peninsula (UP) of Michigan. Marquette is on the south shore of Lake Superior, straight north of the \\"'r' in the word 'Upper'\\". Recent geologic mapping in the Marquette, Michigan, U.S., area provides information of the structure for the zone along a strike. The GLTZ was an active dextral strike-slip zone south of Marquette, passing under the large Marquette anticline. P.K. Sims and W.C. Day suggest that the kinematics determined in the exposed GLTZ ‚Äì which are consistent ‚Äì are applicable to its entire length. In the Marquette area, the GLTZ is a northwest-striking zone of metamorphic rock about wide that was crushed by the dynamics of tectonic movements. Shear zone boundaries are subparallel and strike N60¬∞W; the foliation in mylonite within the GLTZ strikes N70¬∞W and dips S75¬∞W. A stretching lineation (line of tectonic transport) in the mylonite foliation plunges 42¬∞ in a S43¬∞E direction. In the Sims-and-Day model, this last collision in the assembly of the Superior province resulted from northwest-directed tectonic transport of the Minnesota River Valley subprovince terrane against the terrane of the Superior province. The collision was oblique, resulting in dextral-thrust shear along the boundary. Composition of rock This map shows the locations of the Superior province, Penokean orogeny, Minnesota River Valley subprovince, Great Lakes tectonic zone (Minnesota's portion) and the present-day location of the Wyoming province. Early Archean rocks generally form elongate, domal or circular bodies that are several kilometers thick. Late-stage dikes and sills of diabase, quartz-feldspar fine-grained instrusive rocks (aplite) and quartz- feldspar-mica coarse-grained intrusive rocks (pegmatite) are common. Most of the region's crystalline rock bodies of Late Archean age are part of the greenstone-granite terrane of northern Minnesota, northwestern Wisconsin and the western part of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. Lithologies of the rocks are usually gneissose and migmatitic. Repeated metamorphism and deformation caused extensive recrystallization, intense foliation, shear zones and folding. There are east-northeast- to east-trending faults in the gneissic rocks south of the Great Lakes tectonic zone in Minnesota, south of the Midcontinent Rift System in Wisconsin and in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. =Minnesota= Crystalline rocks are more prominent in Minnesota, where they underlie , than they are in either Wisconsin or Michigan's Upper Peninsula. Montevideo and Morton gneiss complexes The Montevideo Gneiss Complex is No. 13 on the map and occurs in two separate gerrymandering places; one has a northwesterly orientation in west-central Minnesota and the other emplacement is south of the first one and has an east‚Äìwest orientation. The Morton Gneiss Complex is No. 14 on the map with its northern edge contiguous to the southerly Montevideo portion and gerrymanders to the southwest. The Sacred Heart granite is No. 15 on the map; it is bisected by the Morton complex. Recent radiometric age data indicates that there are four crystalline rock complexes 3,400 million years old in the Lake Superior region. The best- known units are the Morton Gneiss and the Montevideo Gneiss complexes, along the Minnesota River Valley in southwest Minnesota. Rocks exposed in the Minnesota River Valley include a complex of migmatitic granitic gneisses, schistose to gneissic amphibolite, metagabbro and paragneisses. The complex of ancient gneisses is intruded by a younger, weakly deformed granite body, the Sacred Heart granite. Sacred Heart granitic bodies The Sacred Heart granitic bodies that occur along portions of the Minnesota River Valley are relatively unfractured and unfoliated, and may represent passive intrusions into folded metasedimentary rocks. It is a typical late-tectonic medium- grained pink granite that was intruded around , after the suturing of the MRV gneissic terrane onto the Superior province. Similar intrusions farther east along the GLTZ show later dates, reinforcing the theorized closure from west to east. =Northern Wisconsin= The Watersmeet Domes gneisses straddle the Wisconsin-Michigan border. (Note that the map scales are different for these three maps.) No. 11 is a quartz monzonite-migmatite complex which also straddles the border; it is northwest of the Watersmeet Domes and has a southwesterly orientation. Late Archean lithologies in northwestern Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan are similar to the Sacred Heart granite and consist of gneisses and migmatites. The 1,850-year-old Penokean magmatism in Wisconsin represents margin-type igneous activity terminated by collision. Some of the Penokean granites show iron enrichment similar to the magnetite series, rather than the low-oxygen concentration of the magnetic titanium oxides. Penokean-age rocks in the northern Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan contain areas of low-pressure, low- to high-temperature metamorphism. The folding and metamorphism increased in intensity to the south and southeast, and produced the isolated gneissic 1,755-million-year-old Watersmeet Domes which straddle the border of Michigan and northeastern Wisconsin. =Michigan's Upper Peninsula= Marquette, Michigan, is on the eastern side of the map, on Lake Superior. The Northern complex is No. 1 on the map; it has three emplacements just northeast of Marquette. The Southern complex is No. 2 on the map and has one emplacement the just southwest of Marquette. On the Michigan-Wisconsin border are the Watersmeet Dome gneisses; they extend into Wisconsin. Compressive deformation during the Penokean orogeny reactivated the GLTZ, which followed deposition of the Marquette Range Supergroup sediments and resulted in a north-side up motion along steep brittle-ductile faults in the eastern, low-grade portion of the Marquette Trough In the western portion of the Marquette syncline, a second episode of GLTZ reactivation took place during the uplift of the post-Huronian 2,400- to 2,100-million-year-old granitic Southern Complex. The Northern and Southern complexes of the Upper Peninsula are highly migmatized and intensely foliated, with the intensity of foliation increasing toward margins. The western part of the Southern Complex shows intricate phases of folding and foliation. These Late Archean rocks form a roughly north‚Äìsouth belt lying south of Marquette extending to the Michigan-Wisconsin border. =Sudbury, Ontario= The Sudbury Basin structure is located in Greater Sudbury at the erosional boundary between the Archean Superior province and the overlying sequence of early Proterozoic continental margin deposits.The original url used showed the entire article as a PDF.

The sublayer consists of a mass of basic to ultrabasic inclusions of varying size and frequency of occurrence. Sudbury gabbro varies between a gabbro and a norite, depending upon the local silicates' ratios. The quartz biotite gabbro is medium- to coarse-grained, the Climax quartz monzonite is medium-grained. In the eastern Sudbury area the rock is highly crystalline hornblendic gneiss, which apparently dips at a rather low angle toward the southeast. A paleostress analysis of the eastern exposures near Sudbury shows continuing dextral offset during the Penokean orogeny. Wyoming province separation hypothesis =General information= An episode of hotspot gabbro magmatism occurred at the eastern edge of the Wyoming craton, south of current-day Sudbury. Continental rifting is exhibited by emplacement of mafic igneous rocks on each side of the rift margins. By the Superior and Wyoming provinces had completely separated. From about 2,100 to 1,865 million years ago the Wyoming craton drifted in a westward direction until it docked with the Superior province, northwest of its original position. Before rifting The final assembly of supercontinent Kenorland was finished by 2,600 to 2,550 million years ago; the southern Superior province ‚Äì with the Minnesota River Valley subprovince attached ‚Äì and the current-day southeastern border of the Wyoming province abutted each other from the Sudbury area westerly about to the Wisconsin-Michigan state line on Lake Superior. The hotspot was south of the East Bull Lake suite, approximately under present-day Sudbury. The Blue Draw Metagabbros ‚Äì in the Black Hills of South Dakota ‚Äì were west of Sudbury and south of the westernmost contact of the two provinces on the Wyoming province. During rifting This shows a possible configuration for the attachment of the Wyoming and Superior provinces at 2,100 million years ago. Note the Blue Draw Metagabbro (BDM), marked by the red dot, on the Wyoming province. The 2,170-million-year-old intrusive events that affected the Superior and the Wyoming cratons indicate that the plume had moved west, centered in the opening between the Superior province and the rifting Wyoming province. The Wyoming province was rotating away, with the Blue Draw Metagabbro being the pivot point. Harlan's reconstruction of this pivot is shown to the right. At this time the two provinces are in contact at only one point north of the Blue Draw Metagabbro; that point of contact was from Sudbury and southwest of Duluth, Minnesota. The Blue Draw Metagabbro is now west of Sudbury and remains about south of the Superior-Wyoming provinces' junction. After complete separation The 2,125- to 2,090-million-year-old mafic magmatic events affecting the Superior and Wyoming cratons show the hotspot having moved west from Sudbury, and the two provinces have rifted so that they are separated by . That narrowest distance between the two cratons is from Sudbury, in east- central South Dakota. The Blue Draw Metagabbro is now west of Sudbury and south of the Superior province's southern border. =Supporting evidence= Before rifting Matachewan Dike Swarms Swarms of mafic dikes and sills are typical of continental rifting and can be used to time supercontinent breakup. Intrusion of the 2,475- to 2,445-million-year-old Matachewan-Hearst Mafic Dike Swarm and the 2,490- to 2,475-million-year-old East Bull Lake suite of layered mafic intrusive rocks are interpreted as indicating early Paleoproterozoic, mantle-hotspot driven rifting centered near Sudbury, Ontario, during the onset of Kenorland breakup. Radiometric dating shows that the Wyoming province's Blue Draw Metagabbro was undergoing rifting at , the same time the emplacement of the long belt of mafic layered intrusions in the Sudbury region. In the northern Black Hills of southwest South Dakota the 2,600- to 2,560-million-year-old Precambrian cystalline core, the Blue Draw Metagabbro, is a thick layered sill. The East Bull Lake intrusive suite, in the southern Superior province near Sudbury, Ontario, aligns spatially with the Blue Draw Metagabbro if the Superior and Wyoming cratons are restored to the Kenorland configuration proposed by Roscoe and Card (1993). These layered mafic intrusions are of similar thickness and identical age, and occur along a rifted belt. Recent paleomagnetic and geochronological data from the central Wyoming craton support the hypothesis that the Huronian (in southern Ontario) and Snowy Pass (in southeastern Wyoming) supergroups were adjacent to each other at and may have evolved as a single sedimentary rift basin between 2,450 and 2,100 million years ago. These Huronian and Snowy Pass sedimentary rocks are similar, each having 2,450- to 2,100-million-year-old epicratonic rifts succeeded by a 2,100- to 1,800-million-year-old passive sedimentary margins. During rifting Much of the southeastern Superior province was bisected by the more than 2,172- to 2,167-million-year-old Biscotasing Diabase Swarm which trended northeast from Sudbury. In southcentral Wyoming province there is a 2,170 ¬± 8-million-year-old quartz diorite dike of Wind River Range. After complete separation By , the Wyoming craton is thought to have completely separated from the southern Superior province, this is consistent with the occurrence of a 2,076- to 2,067-million-year-old hotspot centered just south of the Superior province and east of the MRV. The 2,125- to 2,101-million-year-old Marathon and 2,077- to 2,076-million-year-old Fort Frances dikes, both on the present-day Superior province north of the Great Lakes tectonic zone, are consistent with rifting during this time period. Earthquakes The red dots show larger-magnitude earthquakes in Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan's Upper Peninsula and southern Ontario. The earthquake near Minnesota's western \\"bulge\\" is the Morris earthquake. This map and table shows where Minnesota's earthquakes have occurred. Earthquakes 1, 6, 9, 11, 15 and 18 are in the Great Lakes tectonic zone. The size of the dot indicates the strength of the earthquake. The Morris earthquake is No. 11. Minnesota has been the most seismically active in the region of Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan's Upper Peninsula and southern Ontario. Several earthquakes have been documented in Minnesota in the last 120 years, with at least six in the GLTZ. The epicenters show a clear relationship to tectonic features of the state; four epicenters lie along the Great Lakes tectonic zone. Depths are estimated at . The best-documented event occurred on July 9, 1975, near Morris, Minnesota, with a magnitude of 4.6, and a felt area of covering parts of four states. Wisconsin has had no earthquakes along the GLTZ, Michigan's Upper Peninsula has had four earthquakes in the vicinity of the GLTZ ‚Äì Negaunee, Newberry and two in Sault Ste. Marie ‚Äì and the Sudbury area has had three earthquakes.

The size of the ship's company (the complement) is the number of people on board, excluding civilians and guests. United States =Aircraft-capable ships= An exception to this rule is the definition of ship's company as it applies to the U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps personnel assigned to aircraft-capable ships of the U.S. Navy, primarily aircraft carriers and amphibious assault ships. In the case of aircraft carriers in the U.S. Navy, the total ship's complement is divided into three categories: # the ship's company physically assigned to the ship, and # the carrier air wing, with its associated strike fighter, U.S. Marine fighter/attack, electronic attack, airborne early warning and helicopter squadrons, which is considered a separate \\"embarked\\" command, and # the carrier strike group commander and staff, which is also considered an \\"embarked\\" command The number of personnel assigned to the ship's company of a averages 3,200 officers and enlisted, while the associated carrier air wing has approximately 2,500 officers and enlisted personnel, and the embarked carrier strike group staff will average 25 to 30 officers and enlisted personnel.

Both the CO of the aircraft carrier and the CAG report to the embarked rear admiral who is the carrier strike group commander. =Amphibious assault ships= In the case of amphibious assault ships of the U.S. Navy, the total ship's complement is also divided into several categories: # the ship's company physically assigned to the ship # the embarked Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU), commanded by a Marine Corps colonel, and consisting of a Marine Corps MEU Headquarters Group (MEU HQG) as the command element (CE), a Battalion Landing Team (BLT) as the ground combat element (GCE), a composite Marine Medium Tiltrotor Squadron (Reinforced) (consisting of Marine Corps rotary-wing, tilt rotor and STOVL attack jet aircraft) as the aviation combat element (ACE), and a Combat Logistics Battalion (CLB) as the logistics combat element (LCE). # ancillary embarked units, such as a Tactical Air Control Squadron detachment and a Navy Helicopter Sea Combat Squadron detachment # an embarked Amphibious Squadron (PHIBRON) commodore and staff, and # an embarked amphibious readiness group (PHIBGRU) or expeditionary strike group (ESG) commander, typically a Navy rear admiral or a Marine Corps brigadier general, and associated staff. Commanding officer and executive officer positions aboard large amphibious assault ships are also assigned to captains and alternate between a naval aviator or naval flight officer in one position and a surface warfare officer in the other. Command structure The ship's company is usually divided into various companies or departments, the title varying depending on the extant tradition in that nation's naval service (Navy and/or Coast Guard), which are divided into divisions. In overall command of the ship's company is the commanding officer (CO), assisted by the executive officer (XO) who is the second-in- command of the vessel. The CO's representative with the enlisted crew is called the coxswain in some navies, while in the U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard, the position is known as the command master chief petty officer on surface vessels and the chief of the boat (COB) aboard U.S. Navy submarines. The coxswain / command master chief / chief of the boat is the highest-ranking non-commissioned officer serving on the ship. Depending on the size and type of ship, each company or department has an average of four divisions ranging from 10 people to several hundred. In charge of each division is a division officer, typically assisted by a division chief petty officer and a division leading petty officer, with various enlisted personnel and non-commissioned officers assigned to the division. Divisions may be further sub-divided into sections or work centers. There are also various structures, or branches, to the ship's company. The executive branch includes the commanding officer and the executive officer, while the other branches vary from ship to ship and service to service.

His family became major land-holders in the Kona District of the island of Hawaii. The Greenwell Store is now a museum and historical center. Life Henry Nicholas Greenwell was born 9 January 1826 in Lanchester, County Durham, England. His father was William Thomas Greenwell (1777‚Äì1856) and mother was Dorothy Smales (1789‚Äì1871). His oldest brother was William Greenwell (1820‚Äì1918) an English archaeologist who became canon at Durham Cathedral. His sister Dorothy (1821‚Äì1882) published poetry under the name Dora Greenwell. He had two other older brothers Francis Greenwell (1823‚Äì1894) and Alan Greenwell (1824‚Äì1914). As fourth son he had little chance of inheriting the family estate called Greenwell Ford. He attended Durham School and Royal Military Academy Sandhurst expecting a military career. In 1844 Greenwell purchased a commission as a Lieutenant in the 70th Regiment of the British Army which was stationed in Ireland during the great Famine. He became disenchanted, sold his commission in 1847 and on 15 March 1848, left for Melbourne, Australia. Arriving in June 1848, he traveled to Sydney looking for a sheep or cattle station, but came instead to California in 1849 for the California Gold Rush. When the ship arrived in San Francisco, the crew immediately left and headed for the gold fields, leaving him with goods he intended to sell. After injuring himself unloading, he sailed to the Hawaiian Islands in January 1850 to recover. After a brief time in Honolulu working at the H. J. Holdsworth store, he moved to Kailua-Kona, and opened his own retail store in the Kona District in late 1850. In late 1852 one of his Chinese servants died after being accused of theft. Greenwell was arrested and charged with second degree murder. Asher B. Bates was prosecutor, William Little Lee judge, and a jury of British subjects was found for the trial in January 1853. Witnesses testified that Greenwell had beaten or whipped the man, but others said the man was already ill and that Greenwell treated his employees fairly. After half an hour the jury unanimously found him not guilty. The case formed a precedent still cited in the Hawaii state criminal code. He became successful growing Oranges to send to the expanding California market. However, in 1866 the crop was destroyed by blight, so he looked to diversify. In 1867 on what would be a circumnavigation of the earth, he visited New Zealand and returned to England to visit family. On his return he picked up a new variety of Oranges in Brazil, and ideas for other potential crops. He also met his future wife on the voyage. Greenwell married Elizabeth Caroline Hall (1841‚Äì1934) 9 April 1868 and had six sons, four daughters, and 23 grandchildren. The new crop being grown in this area was coffea, the tree bearing the fruit made into \\"beans\\" for coffee. The first trees were brought to the Kona area by missionaries at nearby Kahikolu Church in the late 1820s. The few earlier attempts had uneven results, but the Greenwell brand developed a reputation for consistent quality for Kona coffee. Greenwell served as Collector of Customs at the port at Kealakekua Bay, and as Postmaster and area School Superintendent. A stone building was built just south of the wooden house, in the traditional land division (ahupuaa) known as Kalukalu (for a type of grass that grows there). The oranges continued to be mentioned by travelers through the area. Isabella Bird, who knew Dora in England, visited the Greenwells in 1873. Greenwell's coffee was honored at the 1873 World's Fair in Vienna. In 1876 Greenwell provided coffee as part of the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The Greenwell family traded in sheep skins and dairy products, eventually using the profits to buy more land in the area. Coffee only grows in a narrow elevation band, so drier areas above the usual cloud cover were used as pasture land for cattle, sheep, and horses. Early in 1879, the royal physician Georges Phillipe Trousseau sold all of his holdings in Kona to Greenwell. Other lands were purchased from the family of missionary John Davis Paris. Legacy 1880 advertisement: wool is usually not associated with tropical islands Greenwell died 18 May 1891 aboard a steamer that he often took between the islands. He and many family members are buried at the Christ Church Episcopal cemetery, near the store on the Hawaii Belt Road. Elizabeth Greenwell operated the store after his death, and many children and grandchildren became active in farming and ranching on the nearby lands. While the Reciprocity Treaty of 1875 had caused most large Hawaii coffee plantations to convert to sugarcane, this was not practical in the steep Kona district. Instead, small plots were leased to individual families, often Chinese, Japanese, or Portuguese immigrants after their labor contracts on sugarcane plantations expired. Quality improved further with the introduction of the Guatemalan variety via Hermann A. Widemann, which turned out to be well- adapted to higher elevations; it remains a popular variety through modern times. First-born son William Henry Greenwell was born at Kalukalu 7 June 1869. His sons included Henry Alan Greenwell (1908‚Äì1919), Jack Brysson Greenwell (1910‚Äì1996) and another Henry Alan Greenwell (1919‚Äì1992). William H. Greenwell managed the business from 1891 until he died 17 June 1927 after an operation for apendicitis. William's wife Maud Annandale Johnstone (1883‚Äì1976), named for Annandale, Scotland where she was born, ran the store until the 1950s. The wooden house was torn down in the 1960s. Second and third sons continued the ranching business divided into three main ranches after 1927. Fourth son Wilfrid Alan Greenwell was born 7 November 1878, graduated from Yale in 1905, became a lawyer and married Lulu J. Law in November 1910. He became a partner in the firm Robertson, Castle & Olson in Honolulu and died in 1931. Leonard Lanchester Greenwell was born 4 December 1884 married Dora Beebe in 1909 and died in January 1975 in California. Fifth son Julian Greenwell was born 2 September 1880 and died 20 May 1960. Daughter Dora Caroline Greenwell was born 15 October 1870, married Gerald E. Bryant 6 September 1894, and died in 1952. Daughter Elizabeth Greenwell was born in 1873, married Howard R. Bryant in 1893, and died in 1903. Daughter Christina Margaret Greenwell was born 16 September 1874, married Jordan Natscheff in 1910 and died in 1964. =Palani ranch= Francis Radcliffe (Frank or \\"Palani\\") Greenwell was born 26 August 1876, worked as a manager of Coffee and Tea plantations and cattle rancher. Frank served from 1903 through 1905 in the House of Representatives of the Territory of Hawaii, and some other government positions. Frank married Evelyn Violet Wallace (1888‚Äì1985) on 8 February 1910 and died 19 May 1966. Frank Greenwell lived farther north, on the slopes of HualƒÅlai, above present-day Palani Road at . Originally called the Honokohau Ranch for its traditional land division name, the ranch and the road from it to the shoreline became known by the Hawaiian variant of his name. Frank's oldest son Robert Francis Greenwell (1911‚Äì1992) managed Palani ranch after Frank's death. Frank's son Radcliffe Leonard \\"Rally\\" Greenwell (1913‚Äì2006) went to work for Parker Ranch in 1934 and became manager in September 1962. James Mallaby Greenwell (1915‚Äì2004) went to work for Parker Ranch when he was 18. He then worked at Hawaii Meat Company for 25 years, becoming its president until 1964. He then held management positions at Palani Ranch and organized the Lanihau Properties, LLC real estate company. He was inducted into the Paniolo Hall of Fame in 2001. The ranch had a heard of about 1600 head in 2004. His wife Martha Lowery (born 1920) became an artist. His son James Sherwood \\"Jimmy\\" Greenwell (born 1945) then took over the Palani ranch. Robert Francis' son Robert Kelly Greenwell (born 1941) ran unsuccessfully for Mayor of Hawaii County in 2004, and in 2008 was elected to the Hawaii County Council.

Arthur's daughter Amy Beatrice Holdsworth Greenwell (1920‚Äì1974) attended Stanford University and served as a nurse in World War II. From 1953 to 1957 she served on a Historical Site Commission for the Territory. Amy established a garden to preserve the Kona Field System, and left it to the Bernice P. Bishop Museum on her death. Arthur's son Sherwood Robert H. Greenwell (1919‚Äì2004) managed of Kealakekua Ranch from 1951 to 1989. He founded and was president of Kona Historical society, and became a County Supervisor 1954‚Äì55 and 1959‚Äì67, and Council member in 1968. Greenwell donated land for a county park which was named for Arthur Greenwell in 1963. Sherwood died 21 September 2004. Kealakekua ranch was about located south of H≈çk≈´kano ranch at , with access via Greenwell Mountain Road. A ranching complex called Papaloa was built at over elevation at . Kealakekua ranch was sold to Sekin International of Japan in 1990 who proposed to build a golf course and 500 estates, but economic slowdowns caused Sekin to sell it in 2002 for less than half of the 1990 price. The area is now under a reforestation effort. Conservation easements on were sold in 2007. =H≈çk≈´kano ranch= The Greenwell Store is now a museum William H. Greenwell's son Norman Leonard Greenwell (1926‚Äì1992) managed the main W. H. Greenwell Estate ranch of located , just uphill from the Kalukalu store. John Pace purchased it and renamed it H≈çk≈´kano ranch in 1986, and also purchased Kealakekua ranch in 2004. Namesakes of the Pace family include Pace, Florida and the John C. Pace Library. The Pace family put the ranches up for sale in 2009. H≈çk≈´kano ranch was divided into parcels between and for sale. In December 2009 a large fire broke out on H≈çk≈´kano ranch, followed by another at Kealakekua ranch. Norman's wife Jean Greenwell (1929‚Äì2009) was another founder of the Kona Historical society in 1976, and wrote articles on the area history. The Greenwell Store was added to the National Register of Historic Places listings on the island of Hawaii. The society restored the former store and opened it as a museum. Norman's son Thomas Frederick born 2 June 1958 (great-grandson of Henry Nicholas) and his family still grow and sell coffee on a farm adjacent to the original homestead. Some of the trees were planted in 1903 by Elizabeth Caroline Greenwell. A recent venture was producing a reportedly healthy drink from the pulp of coffee cherries.

It is traditionally attributed to a writer with the surname of Guliang in the disciple tradition of Zixia, but versions of his name vary and there is no definitive way to date the text. Although it may be based in part on oral traditions from as early as the Warring States period (475‚Äì221 BCE), the first references to the work appear in the Han Dynasty, and the peak of its influence was the 1st century BCE. Along with the Zuo Zhuan and Gongyang Zhuan the work is one of the Three Commentaries on the Spring and Autumn Annals. Written in question and answer style, the work annotates the Spring and Autumn Annals covering the period between the first year of State of Lu ruler Duke Yin of Lu (È≠ØÈö±ÂÖ¨) (722 BCE) and the fourteenth year of his later counterpart Duke Ai of Lu (È≠ØÂìÄÂÖ¨) (481 BCE). Like the Gongyang Zhuan the G«îli√°ng Zhu√†n is written as a didactic explanation of the subtle political and social messages of the Spring and Autumn Annals rather than in the anecdotal style of the Zuo Zhuan. It is an important book for the study of the development of Confucianism from the Warring States Period through the Han Dynasty. Today, the book is usually considered to be the work of the Han Dynasty Confucian scholars and contains about 30,000 Chinese characters. Its focus is on clarifying Confucian debate on the political significance of the Spring and Autumn Annals in a style somewhat similar to the Gongyang Zhuan but with many differences in both doctrine and interpretation. Its major concerns include the ritual code, political and familial hierarchies, and hereditary succession. In general, the Guliang Zhuan uses a somewhat simple explanatory style rather than the grandiloquent language adopted by the Gongyang Zhuan.

He is currently the honorary life president of the International Taekwon-Do Federation, having previously served as its President from 2002 to 2015 following the death of General Choi Hong Hi from stomach cancer on 15 June 2002. Chang previously served as a member of the International Olympic Committee representing North Korea, and now serves as an honorary member of the IOC. Death of General Choi and ascension to ITF presidency On 22 September 2002, 70 representatives from 46 countries attended a memorial service for General Choi Hong Hi. The solemn and memorable service was held in Pyongyang, North Korea. Choi Hong Hi spoke to a select group of ITF officials and high-level instructors on his deathbed at Pyongyang Hospital. It was recorded that there might be no misinterpretation of his intentions regarding the future of the ITF. The following is an excerpt: :You probably might know Mr. Chang Ung well. It is time to introduce Mr. Chang Ung proudly in public. Please carry on propaganda that Mr. Chang Ung is the tallest and in the highest position in the ITF. If only I had been as tall as Mr. Chang Ung, I could have had less opponents, however, as my body was so tiny that there were many opponents. Thus, all alone, I could not but fight against them for so long. But I have never been worn out for the justice was on my side. I have always worried about a successor to the President, however, my mind is set at ease for there is Mr. Chang Ung. These last words were witnessed by: Mr. Rhee Ki Ha, Grand Master and former Vice-President of the ITF; Mr. Tom MacCallum, Master and the Secretary General; Mr. Leong Wei Meng, Master and the Chairman of the Consultative Committee; Mr. Kwang Sung Hwang, Grand Master, spokesman and special aide; Mr. Park Jong Soo, Grand Master and a member of the Consultative Council; Mr. Hwang Jin, Master and a member of the Consultative Council; Mr. Hwang Bong Yong, Chairman of the Korean Taekwon- Do Committee; Mr. Jong Jae Hun, Secretary General of the International Martial Art Games Committee and Mr. Rang Bong Man, Secretary General of the Korean Taekwon-Do Committee A special Congress of the ITF and memorial was held at the People's Palace of Culture in Pyongyang on September 22, 2002, after Choi's death. It was here that Presidents and representatives from 46 national Taekwon-Do federations unanimously elected Mr. Chang Ung, member of the International Olympic Committee, as president of the ITF. He was re-elected as president on October 13, 2009. Legitimacy as ITF President =Senior Grandmaster Phap Lu's Open Email= Senior Master Phap Lu stated on October 22, 2002, in an Open email to Taekwon-Doists that, \\"General Choi did not speak his last words with the constitution in mind. He spoke as a CREATOR of the art. When he was alive what he said was law, in death are his words are no longer valid?\\" It is here that he explains the background behind General Choi's reason for choosing Chang Ung as a successor. :\\"That was why General Choi handpicked Mr. Russell MacLellan as the Senior Vice-president to fulfill the role as acting President if anything happened to General Choi. At this time Mr. Chang Ung‚Äôs name was never mentioned. Our beloved Founder still waited for his son to visit him at the hospital in Pyongyang, but his last hope TOTALLY vanished when the nine people visited Gen. Choi without his son‚Äôs presence in mid of June 2002 after the International Gen. Choi‚Äôs Cup in Ottawa, Canada...Since February 2002 there has been a recent rapid change in the political situation in both KOREAs. After General Choi was admitted to the hospital in North Korea, General Choi saw the light of unification in both TAEKWON-DO and North and South KOREAs. With Mr. Chang Ung‚Äôs I.O.C. experience, knowledge and talents, as well as his relationship with Mr. Ung Yong Kim, his various meetings with both North and South Koreans TaeKwon-Do Committees members, General Choi Hong Hi, handpicked Mr. Chang Ung as his successor before his departure. The sudden appearance of Mr. Chang Ung surprised much of the PRESENT CORE ITF MEMBERS as he was never spoken of by General Choi.\\" :\\"Our beloved Founder General Choi Hong Hi DID NOT PICK Mr. Chang Ung in favor of North Korea, but he picked him up as successor because OF THE PRESENT POLITICAL CLIMATE as well as his leadership qualities. This was the BRILLIANT FUTURE VISION of our beloved Founder and Father. If you were Mr. Chang Ung I believe that regardless of whether you were a Canadian, Italian, Korean or Argentinian you would be picked too. THAT IS OUR GENERAL CHOI, everything fits for Taekwon-Do. If it fits he would use it, because he believed that these were gifts from Heaven to him. Gen. Choi used to tell us that his Parents gave his name CHOI HONG HI and HEAVEN gave his name TAEKWON- DO. He was even afraid that nobody would know what Taekwon-do would be, he asked people to cover his coffin with the words TAEKWON-DO. I believe that whatever the outcome will be: IT IS THE LAST WISHES OF GENERAL CHOI HONG HI. We at least own him for these.\\"' People in the ITF see it as a great honor to meet him in person. =Regarding the Legal Status of Chang Ung's ITF= Shortly after Chang's ascension to the ITF presidency, the legality of the organization was put into question. However, these issues have since been resolved. \\\\- The ITF was registered to the Austrian Police in 1986.

The band was originally composed of vocalist and bassist Ekhi Lopetegi, guitarist Tomas Palomo, keyboardist Unai Lazcano and drummer Igor Escudeo; they created the band to explore their mutual interests, from the local punk rock scene to electronic music. Palomo was replaced in 2008 by Guillermo Astrain. Delorean are named after the time machine featured in the Back to the Future series, which was a DeLorean car. Career The quartet released an EP and two studio albums between 2004 and 2006 to little mainstream success. In 2008, Palomo left the band and was replaced by Guillermo Astrain. Delorean subsequently relocated to Barcelona, veering towards more computer-based composition and production. Tiring of the relative low quality of the local dance music scene, the band members created their own eclectic club night, Desparrame, in which they continued the evolution of their music. Remixes for the likes of The xx, Cold Cave, and Franz Ferdinand gave Delorean exposure in the music press. Following their successful visit to the 2007 SXSW festival in Austin, Texas, the band released Transatlantic KK, a variation of the second studio album Into the Plateau, on the New York-based Simple Social Graces label. The Ayrton Senna EP was released in 2009 to positive reviews from critics. The band subsequently toured with Swedish groups jj and Miike Snow. In 2010, Delorean released their third album, Subiza, and secured a worldwide distribution deal with New York label True Panther Sounds. In October 2013, the band members, while on tour in Mexico City, were taken hostage as part of a \\"virtual kidnapping\\", by criminals posing as security officers, who moved them to another hotel, then called their family members attempting to extort money from them.

The concept is often used in sociology, psychology and linguistics. Social sciences Nominal identity is the name to which one identifies, or calls oneself (i.e. general \\"African American,\\" \\"Irish,\\" \\"Straight,\\" \\"Gay,\\" \\"Female,\\" \\"Male\\"). Whereas virtual identity is the experience of that identity, \\"The latter is, in a sense, what the name means; this is primarily a matter of its consequences for those who bear it, and can change while the nominal identity remains the same (and vice versa).\\" Among those who self-identify as \\"gay,\\" the term may not confer the same experience for two people or even between various geographical or cultural regions. Similarly, while one may talk about a \\"chair,\\" \\"chair\\" itself can entail many forms, from arm chair to ladder back to even tree stump, if the experience of \\"chair\\" is something upon which a person sits. Pierre Bourdieu uses the term nominal identity in Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgment of Taste to mean both that which the identity of a subject is named and also where identity is an insignificant measurement or representation of the \\"perceived reality\\" of a subject or phenomenon. To further clarify, for Bourdieu nominal identity can often mean \\"face value\\" or \\"appearance.\\" He often mentions the term nominal identity in order to illustrate the idea of a more complex reality, beyond the name, within the studied subject. =Nominal identity in ethnicity= Ethnic identity is a \\"social identity arising through group formation, individual identification with a group, and interaction between different ethnic groups.\\" Henry E. Brady and Cynthia S. Kaplan compiled a study called \\"Categorically Wrong? Nominal versus Graded Measures of Ethnic Identity\\" that takes a look at ethnicity as a nominal identity. Their study proposed whether or not \\"the attitudes of members of the group with the more salient identity can be completely explained by its nominal identity while the attitudes of the members of the group with less salient identity require a graded measure of ethnicity.\\" Brady and Kaplan focused on the country Estonia, where they posited two groups: \\"Estonians,\\" and one that they call the \\"Slavs,\\" a collective group of Russians, Ukrainians, or Belarusians. They chose this geographical area in particular because of the \\"centrality of ethnicity in the politics of transition in the USSR.\\" media usage (such as television, radio, or newspaper, whether it was the Estonia language Republic television or Russian-language media), individuals who identify themselves with another nationality, and the language used at home. Brady and Kaplan concluded that \\"ethnicity is not always a nominal characteristic\\" for these two groups in Estonia. It is only nominal when most salient. \\"Ethnic identity ... causes individuals within a group to form their attitudes based upon their nominal identity\\". Individuals may generalize themselves in a certain category such as their nationality, but when it comes down to variables of different degrees in formulating their ethnicity, it is no longer nominal. It is their way of dividing themselves from a generalized name. Linguistics Nominal identity in linguistics pertains to the identity of a word or group of words functioning as a noun or an adjective within a sentence's structure. Specifically, it relates to how one can look at a sentence and propose a different understanding of that sentence through the analysis of its identity defined in its lexical construct, such as in the example used by Chris Barker when discussing one of Manfred Krifka's study \\"Four thousand ships passed through the lock: Object-induced measure functions on events\\": > \\"(1) Four thousand ships passed through the lock last year.\\" On the surface, the proposition suggests that 4,000 distinct ships passed through the lock last year. However, as Krifka points out in his study, one could say that there were fewer than 4,000 distinct ships and that some of those ships passed through the lock more than once. Individuals reading this sentence could argue about the interpretation of this sentence.

History Established in 1933 as a new primary routing, NC 581 originally traversed from US 264/NC 91 in Bailey, north to US 64/NC 90 in Spring Hope. In 1937, NC 581 was extended south on new primary routing to US 301 near Lucama. By 1941, NC 581 was also extended north on new primary routing to NC 56 in Mapleville. By 1950, NC 581 extended again on new primary routing south to US 70, then east replacing NC 111, ending at US 70 Business and US 117 Business in downtown Goldsboro. In 1982, NC 581 was extended north from Mapleville, concurrency overlapped with NC 56, to its current northern terminus in Louisburg. In 1998, NC 581 was removed from downtown Goldsboro and redirected south along US 13/US 117, from Ash Street to Arrington Bridge Road, then southeast to its current southern terminus with NC 111\\\\. In 2008, NC 581 was realigned onto new freeway extension with US 117, removing it from part of Ash Street and overlap with US 13/US 117 Alternate; a year later US 117 would revert to its former route, leaving NC 581 on the new freeway segment. In 2015, NC 581 was rerouted in Bailey, following along the truck route along Main, Benson and Deans Streets; the one block of Sanford Street became SR 1186 and is restricted to all thru trucks with a load limit exceeding . The justification for the route change was because of the railroad underpass with a vertical clearance. Nine crashes, including a school activity bus, happened between May 1, 2008 and April 30, 2013; also, representatives from Carolina and Northwestern Railroad indicated that they would not allow a widening of the underpass.

On August 7 of that year, Robert Stuart made the first written notation of the place while returning from the Columbia River. Hot Lake became a resting place for travelers, especially when settlers began traversing through the valley on the Oregon Trail in the 1840s. The first hotel was built at Hot Lake in 1864 by Samuel F. Newhard, and a post office was established in 1883. In 1884, the railroad was built through the area. The Hot Lake Resort was built in 1906. The resort began to decline in the 1930s, as a result of the death of its director since 1917, Dr. W. T. Phy, a disastrous 1934 fire, and the Great Depression. The post office was discontinued in 1943. Hot Lake is now served by the La Grande post office.

A fresco in the Benedictine monastery of Santi Quattro Coronati depicts Constantine offering his crown to Sylvester. Constantine the Great's (272‚Äì337) relationship with the four Bishops of Rome during his reign is an important component of the history of the Papacy, and more generally the history of the Catholic Church. The legend surrounding Constantine I's victory in the Battle of the Milvian Bridge (312) relates his vision of the Chi Rho (‚òß) and the text in hoc signo vinces in the sky and his reproducing this symbol on the shields of his troops. The following year Constantine and Licinius proclaimed the toleration of Christianity with the Edict of Milan, and in 325 Constantine convened and presided over the First Council of Nicaea, the first ecumenical council. None of this, however, has particularly much to do with the popes, who did not even attend the Council; in fact, the first bishop of Rome to be contemporaneously referred to as \\"Pope\\" (œÄŒ¨œÄœÄŒ±œÇ, or pappas) is Damasus I (366-384).Baumgartner, 2003, p. 6. Moreover, between 324 and 330, he built Constantinople as a new capital for the empire, and--with no apologies to the Roman community of Christians--relocated key Roman families and translated many Christian relics to the new churches. The Donation of Constantine, an 8th-century forgery used to enhance the prestige and authority of popes, places the pope more centrally in the narrative of Constantinian Christianity. The legend of the Donation claims that Constantine offered his crown to Sylvester I (314-335), and even that Sylvester baptized Constantine. In reality, Constantine was baptized (nearing his death in May 337) by Eusebius of Nicomedia, who, unlike the pope, was an Arian bishop of Constantinople. Sylvester was succeeded by Mark (336) and Julius I (337-352) during the life of Constantine. Although the \\"Donation\\" never occurred, Constantine did hand over the Lateran Palace to the bishop of Rome, and begin the construction of Old Saint Peter's Basilica (the \\"Constantinian Basilica\\"). The gift of the Lateran probably occurred during the reign of Miltiades (311-314), Sylvester I's predecessor, who began using it as his residence. Old St. Peter's was begun between 326 and 330 and would have taken three decades to complete, long after the death of Constantine. Constantine's legalization of Christianity, combined with the donation of these properties, gave the bishop of Rome an unprecedented level of temporal power, for the first time creating an incentive for secular leaders to interfere with papal succession. Background The coins of Constantine continued to depict Roman god Sol Invictus (\\"Unconquered Sun\\") until about 315.Duffy, 2006, p. 25. In spite of the Diocletian Persecution, Christians constituted approximately one-tenth of the population of the Roman Empire at the time of Constantine's rise to power. Christianity was legalized by Galerius, who was the first emperor to issue an edict of toleration for all religious creeds including Christianity in April 311.De Mortibus Persecutorum (\\"On the Deaths of the Persecutors\\", chapters 34, 35) Eamon Duffy characterizes the church in Rome before Constantine as \\"not one congregation, but a loose constellation of churches based in private houses or, as time went on and the community grew, meeting in rented halls in markets and public baths. It was without any single dominant ruling officer, its elders or leaders sharing responsibility, but distributing tasks, like that of foreign correspondent. By the eve of the conversion of Constantine, there were more than two dozen of these religious community-centers or tituli\\".Duffy, 2006, p. 11. The Roman church was a small community, and its bishop exercised little influence outside its members in the time of Constantine. Constantine was the first Roman Emperor to embrace Christianity, although he likely continued in his pre-Christian beliefs. He and co-Emperor Licinius bestowed imperial favor on Christianity through the Edict of Milan promulgated in 313. After the Edict of Milan, the church adopted the same governmental structure as the Empire: geographical provinces ruled by bishops. These bishops of important cities (Metropolitan bishops) therefore rose in power over the bishops of lesser cities (later called Suffragan bishops). Whatever his personal beliefs, Constantine's political interest in Christianity was as a unifying force and his policy of \\"the imposition of unity on the churches at all costs\\" soon set him on a \\"collision course with the popes.\\"Duffy, 2006, p. 27. Popes under Constantine =Miltiades= The modern facade of the Lateran Palace Miltiades (311‚Äì314) was pope at the time of Constantine's victory, and Constantine gifted to Miltiades the Lateran Palace, where he relocated, holding a synod in 313. Constantine designated Miltiades as one of four bishops to adjudicate the case of the Donatists, but he had no authority to decide the case or publish the result without the approval of the emperor himself.Hurst, 1897, p. 720. Customarily, the African bishops may have gone to the bishop of Rome as a respected, neutral figure, but it was well known that Miltiades would not agree with the Donatist position that ordination by a \\"traitor\\" bishop would invalidate the sacrament. Turning to Constantine was a strange move because he had not yet been baptized, and word of his budding conversion may not yet have reached Alexandria. Constantine therefore referred the matter to Miltiades, requiring him to collaborate with three bishops from Gaul.Duffy, 2006, p. 28. Eamon Duffy calls this the \\"first direct intervention by an emperor in the affairs of the church.\\" When Miltiades invited fifteen additional Italian bishops to participate in the synod and ruled against the Donatists, they appealed to Constantine again, who called for a new synod in Arles, this time headed by the bishops of Arles and Syracuse. =Sylvester I= Athanasius of Alexandria Miltiades died, and his successor, Sylvester I (313‚Äì335), did not travel to Arles. The Arles synod gave Silvester I somewhat of a nod by asking him to circulate their decisions to the other bishops, although he had no part in the process. During Silvester I's reign, construction began on the Lateran Basilica, Santa Croce in Gerusalemme, and St. Peter's. Silvester did not attend the first ecumenical council, the First Council of Nicaea (325), but sent two priests as his representatives; the Western bishops of Carthage and Milan were also in attendance.Duffy, 2006, p. 29. Silvester would have viewed Arianism as a heresy;Hans K√ºhner Encyclopedia of the Papacy. 1958. \\"Silvester I.\\" New York. Constantine himself probably did not understand the complex theological issues in dispute, although he had surrounded himself with many followers of Arius, including Bishop Eusebius of Nicomedia, his eventual baptizer. Arius's followers did poorly at Nicaea, and the Nicene Creed that was adopted was squarely against their Christological position. The Arians were \\"silenced, not persuaded\\" by the Council, and the controversy in the larger Christian community was not resolved. The Arian position would persist in the East for three generations, and even eventually be adopted by Constantine's son, Constantius II. Constantine himself supported the Nicene position mainly because it was \\"his Council\\" sought a compromise text that would \\"paper over the differences between the two sides.\\" Eusebius remained an Arian, although he assured Constantine his views were compatible with his interpretation of the Nicene Creed, and baptized Constantine in 337.Duffy, 2006, p. 30. The chief supporter of the Nicene Creed was Bishop Athanasius of Alexandria, but in 335 he was deposed and exiled to Gaul over unrelated fears about the Egyptian corn supply to Constantinople. His followers were rounded up and picked off. The key debates in Nicaea had been conducted in the Greek language, with the subtleties of particular words inciting great controversy; the Latin language of the West simply \\"did not yet even possess adequate terminology to handle the debate properly.\\" The pope's legates signed onto the findings of the Council, and it continued to be supported by the next two popes, just as followers of Athanasius remained welcome in Rome, but the theological issues were little examined in the West. =Mark= Mark (336) was the first to designate the bishop of Ostia as the first among the consecrators of the new bishop of Rome (the bishop of Ostia is currently the Dean of the College of Cardinals). =Julius I= The influence of Constantine would help solidify a strong role for the Roman emperor in the selection process: Constantine chose Julius I (337‚Äì352) for all intents and purposes, and his son Constantius II exiled Liberius and installed Felix II (an Arian) as his successor. Julius I received Athanasius, and invited the Arian Eastern bishops then in Antioch to join him in Rome. The Eastern bishops would have regarded Julius I as having an equal dignity to their own episcopate, but were not pleased that he took into his communion a bishop condemned by an Eastern synod. Aftermath Under Pope Liberius (352-366), the Arian conflict between the emperor and bishop of Rome culminated in the Synod of Arles (353), convened by Constantius II. Therein, Liberius's legates signed a declaration condemning the Council of Nicaea. When Liberius himself refused to cooperate, he was exiled.K√ºhner. Liberius. Pope Damasus, (366-384) was able to largely suppress the Arians with the help of Emperor Theodosius, Gregory of Nazianzus, Gregory of Nyssa, and Ambrose of Milan. Historiography Raphael's The Baptism of Constantine depicts Sylvester I instead of Arian bishop Eusebius of Nicomedia, Constantine's actual baptizer. The Donation of Constantine depicts the inside St. Peter's, which was not completed before Constantine's death. The Donation of Constantine purported to memorialize the transfer to Sylvester I and his successors of dominion over the entire Western Roman Empire for the consideration of Sylvester I's instruction of Constantine in Christianity, baptism of Constantine, and curing Constantine of leprosy. Constantine allegedly kept for himself only the Eastern Roman Empire. The forgery was probably constructed during the Frankish Papacy, when Pope Stephen II became the first pope to cross the Alps to crown Pepin the Short, who issued the Donation of Pepin (a non-forgery), granting the pope control of the lands of the Lombards, which coalesced into the first fragments of the Papal States. It was not long before the document was denounced as a forgery, notably by Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor (r. 983-1002). By the mid 15th century, not even the popes themselves regarded the document as genuine. Italian humanist Lorenzo Valla further proved its falsity in 1440 by showing that its Latin language did not correspond to that of the 4th century. The \\"Donation\\" purports to acknowledge the primacy of Rome over Antioch, Jerusalem, Alexandria, and Constantinople, even though the last of these had not even been founded at the time of the claimed Donation.Pohlsander, 2004, p. 28. The myth of the \\"Donation of Constantine\\" is embellished further in a 5th-century hagiographic text Vita S Silvestri (or Actus S Silvestri).Pohlsander, 2004, p. 27. Among other things, the document claims that Silvester I slew a dragon that had been threatening Rome. The text says that all of these events occurred right after Constantine's entry into the city following the Battle of the Milvian Bridge, despite the fact that Silvester I did not become bishop until 314. These events were incorporated uncritically into the Liber pontificalis c. 530. John Malalas further embellished the story in his Chronicon, which claimed that Silvester I baptized not only Constantine, but his mother Helena, and--for good measure--a large group of his relatives and Roman bystanders. Theophanes the Confessor in his Chronicle c. 815-820 adds Constantine's son Crispus to the list and viciously attacks contrary accounts as Arian lies; Theophanes refers to the Lateran Baptistery as the \\"Baptistry of Constantine.\\" Pope Pius V's Breviarum Romanum (1568) and Pope Gregory XIII's Martyrologium Romanum (1584) also asserted that Silvester I was the baptizer of Constantine. When Pope Sixtus V erected the Egyptian obelisk to the north of the Lateran Basilica in 1588, he added to the base the inscription \\"Constantine was baptized here.\\" Cardinal Cesare Baroni continued to claim this in his Annales Ecclesiastici (1592) and a French author has claimed this as recently as 1906. This falsified version of Constantine's baptism has found its way into a great deal of ecclesiastical art. Depictions include the Stavelot Triptych (c. 1165), frescoes in I Santi Quattro Coronati, stained glass in the St Michael and All Angels' Church, Ashton-under-Lyne, and--most famously--Raphael's The Baptism of Constantine in the Raphael Rooms of the Apostolic Palace.

He has lived in France since 1984, and obtained French citizenship in 1992.  Biography  Coming from an intellectual family, Qigang Chen began his musical studies as a child. When in his early teens, he was confronted with the Cultural Revolution and would spend three years locked up in a barracks, undergoing an \\"ideological reeducation\\". Nonetheless, his passion for music remained unshakeable and, in spite of the social pressure and anti- cultural policy, he pursued his training in composition. In 1977, Qigang Chen was one of 26 candidates out of two thousand to be accepted into the composition class at the Beijing Central Conservatory. After five years of studies with Luo Zhongrong, in 1983 he stood for the national competition where he came first. As a result, he was the only one in his field to be authorized to go abroad to pursue graduate studies in composition. He was Olivier Messiaen's last student, from 1984 to 1988. His first five years in France allowed him to broaden the scope of his culture and acquire new knowledge about 20th-century music. Qigang Chen is one of the most performed living composers around the world, winning him many accolades. In 2001 his orchestral work Wu Xing was selected from over 1000 entries as one of the five finalists of the Masterprize Award, hosted by the BBC. In 2003, EMI/Virgin Classics released an album devoted to his music, including the highly acclaimed work Iris devoil√©e. It was later voted by Gramophone Magazine as one of the Top Ten Classical Recordings of the Month. In 2005, he was awarded the Grand Prix de la Musique Symphonique by SACEM in recognition of his career achievement. He worked as Music Director of the Opening Ceremony of the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing. Most recently, in 2013, he was decorated with Chevalier de l'Ordre des arts et des lettres by the French government. In 2015, he launched a composition workshop at Gonggen College in China, as a platform for dialogues with, and between, young musicians.

In 2012, the first ever ski tow in Albania was opened at Bigell Ski Resort near Dardh√´.  Demographics  Dardh√´ is populated by an Orthodox [Vlach] population who also called Aromanians. There are a few families who were previously nomadic before settling in the village long before the Ottoman invasion in the region. Much of the Orthodox Albanian population has moved away to Albanian cities such as Kor√ß√´ and Tiran√´ or migrated to the United States of America. \\"I cannot confirm my previous information of Dardh√´ being a Vlach village.

It probably shared the development of the Vlach villages on Grammos and played a part in their ekistic, cultural, and economic birth and evolution; but it was not inhabited by Vlachs, as least to any notable extent. It certainly received refugees from Nikolic√´ and Arr√´z, and possibly from other Vlach settlements on Grammos; but they probably stayed only for a while before moving on to settle permanently elsewhere, or else they were assimilated by the more numerous Albanian speakers. The interesting thing about Dardh√´ is that, unlike the other Christian villages on Grammos, it did not suffer any serious destruction or collapse. Its inhabitants never had to leave and the village developed into a kind of centre of resistance for local Christians. The Vlach inhabitants of modern Dardh√´ are apparently descended from Arvanitovlach nomads who settled there in the twentieth century.\\" A Greek school was founded in the village in 1810 by Ikonomou Isidoros while Greek education was flourishing with the establishment of additional schools at the beginning of the 20th century: a girls' school (1901-1902) and a middle level school. In the school season of 1901-1902 a total of 150 students attended the Greek schools, which were sponsored by the local community fund, as well as the local Orthodox Church. The first Albanian school opened in 1917 with the initiative of Leonidha √áika, which started with 20 students, and with financing from the Vatra, which sponsors the new school in 1924 that is still in place today. Dardh√´ has historically suffered from heavy emigration. Many families of the area would form the first Albanian community in USA, and Romania as well. People from Dardh√´ have been immense contributors to Albanian American organizations.

An eastbound reassurance shield for SR 110 is also present on the New Hampshire side; however, westbound signage clearly indicates the end of the route at the state line. Many maps erroneously depict SR 110 extending all the way to NH 153. History When it was designated in 1925, SR 110 was a much longer route than it is today, stretching from Alfred to Limington. It went under major changes in 1931, with its western terminus being shifted to the New Hampshire state line and all of its eastern routing becoming part of modern SR 4, SR 5, SR 11, and U.S. Route 202, resulting in the short alignment it has today.Floodgap Roadgap's RoadsAroundME: Maine State Route 110 Junction list References 110 Category:Transportation in York County, Maine Category:U.S. Route 202 ","title":"Maine State Route 110"},{"id":"26692274","text":"The Kansas Department of Administration (KDA) is a department of the state of Kansas under the Governor of Kansas.

The total array consists of 3√ó20√ó20 unit cells with overall dimensions of 10√ó100√ó100 millimeters. The history of metamaterials begins with artificial dielectrics in microwave engineering as it developed just after World War II. Yet, there are seminal explorations of artificial materials for manipulating electromagnetic waves at the end of the 19th century. Hence, the history of metamaterials is essentially a history of developing certain types of manufactured materials, which interact at radio frequency, microwave, and later optical frequencies. As the science of materials has advanced, photonic materials have been developed which use the photon of light as the fundamental carrier of information. This has led to photonic crystals, and at the beginning of the new millennium, the proof of principle for functioning metamaterials with a negative index of refraction in the microwave- (at 10.5 Gigahertz) and optical range. This was followed by the first proof of principle for metamaterial cloaking (shielding an object from view), also in the microwave range, about six years later. However, a cloak that can conceal objects across the entire electromagnetic spectrum is still decades away. Many physics and engineering problems need to be solved. Nevertheless, negative refractive materials have led to the development of metamaterial antennas and metamaterial microwave lenses for miniature wireless system antennas which are more efficient than their conventional counterparts. Also, metamaterial antennas are now commercially available. Meanwhile, subwavelength focusing with the superlens is also a part of present-day metamaterials research. Early wave studies Electromagnetic waves are formed by the vibrations of electric fields and magnetic fields. These fields are perpendicular to one another in the direction the wave is traveling. Once formed, this energy travels at the speed of light until further interaction with matter. The electric field is in a vertical plane and the magnetic field in a horizontal plane. The two types of fields in electromagnetic waves are always in phase with each other.Anatomy of an Electromagnetic Wave. Mission Science. NASA. Public domain material copied from NASA website . Accessdate 2013-05-23. Classical waves transfer energy without transporting matter through the medium (material). For example, waves in a pond do not carry the water molecules from place to place; rather the wave's energy travels through the water, leaving the water molecules in place. Additionally, charged particles, such as electrons and protons create electromagnetic fields when they move, and these fields transport the type of energy known as electromagnetic radiation, or light. A changing magnetic field will induce a changing electric field and vice versa‚Äîthe two are linked. These changing fields form electromagnetic waves. Electromagnetic waves differ from mechanical waves in that they do not require a medium to propagate. This means that electromagnetic waves can travel not only through air and solid materials, but also through the vacuum of space. The \\"history of metamaterials\\" can have a variety starting points depending on the properties of interest. Related early wave studies started in 1904 and progressed through more than half of the first part of the twentieth century. This early research included the relationship of the phase velocity to group velocity and the relationship of the wave vector and Pointing vector. In 1904 the possibility of negative phase velocity accompanied by an anti- parallel group velocity were noted by Horace Lamb (book: Hydrodynamics) and Arthur Schuster (Book: Intro to Optics).Slyusar V.I. Metamaterials on antenna solutions.// 7th International Conference on Antenna Theory and Techniques ICATT‚Äô09, Lviv, Ukraine, October 6‚Äì9, 2009. pp. 19‚Äì24 However both thought practical achievement of these phenomena were not possible. In 1945 Leonid Mandelstam (also \\"Mandel'shtam\\") studied the anti-parallel phase and group advance in more detail. He is also noted for examining the electromagnetic characteristics of materials demonstrating negative refraction, as well as the first left-handed material concept. These studies included negative group velocity. He reported that such phenomena occurs in a crystal lattice. This may be considered significant because the metamaterial is a man made crystal lattice (structure). (PDF is self-published version.)Early wave studies *[1] H. Lamb, \\"On group-velocity,\\" Proc.

Pafomov (1959), and several years later, the research team V.M. Agranovich and V.L. Ginzburg (1966) reported the repercussions of negative permittivity, negative permeability, and negative group velocity in their study of crystals and excitons. In 1967, V.G. Veselago from Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology considered the theoretical model of medium that known now as a metamaterial. However, physical experimentation did not occur until 33 years after the paper's publication due to lack of available materials and lack of sufficient computing power. It was not until the 1990s that materials and computing power became available to artificially produce the necessary structures. Veselago also predicted a number of electromagnetic phenomena that would be reversed including the refractive index. In addition, he is credited with coining the term \\"left handed material\\" for the present day metamaterial because of the anti-parallel behavior of the wave vector and other electromagnetic fields. Moreover, he noted that the material he was studying was a double negative material, as certain metamaterials are named today, because of the ability to simultaneously produce negative values for two important parameters, e.g. permittivity and permeability. In 1968, his paper was translated and published in English.He is often credited with inventing the modern day electromagnetic metamaterials as a result of his seminal 1967/68 report. He was nominated later for a Nobel prize. Later still, developments in nanofabrication and subwavelength imaging techniques are now taking this work into optical wavelengths.Shalaev, V.M. \\"Optical negative-index metamaterials,\\" Nature Photonics Vol. 1, 41‚Äì48 (2007) Novel materials and engineered structures Early electromagnetic media Bose's apparatus demonstrated at the Royal Institution in 1897. A schematic diagram‚Äîthe waveguide radiator is affixed on top of the transmitter at left. In addition, a pyramidal electromagnetic horn antenna is first used by Bose. This horn antenna acts as a \\"collecting funnel\\" for the electromagnetic radiation of interest. In the 19th century Maxwell's equations united all previous observations, experiments, and established propositions pertaining to electricity and magnetism into a consistent theory, which is also fundamental to optics. Maxwell's work demonstrated that electricity, magnetism and even light are all manifestations of the same phenomenon, namely the electromagnetic field. Likewise, the concept of using certain constructed materials as a method for manipulating electromagnetic waves dates back to the 19th century. Microwave theory had developed significantly during the latter part of the 19th century with the cylindrical parabolic reflector, dielectric lens, microwave absorbers, the cavity radiator, the radiating iris, and the pyramidal electromagnetic horn. The science involving microwaves also included round, square, and rectangular waveguides precluding Sir Rayleigh's published work on waveguide operation in 1896. Microwave optics, involving the focusing of microwaves, introduced quasi-optical components, and a treatment of microwave optics was published in 1897 (by Righi). A facility of the NSF provides added material to the original paper ‚Äì The work of Jagadish Chandra Bose: 100 years of millimeter wave research. =Jagadish Chandra Bose= Jagadish Chandra Bose was a scientist involved in original microwave research during the 1890s. As officiating professor of physics at Presidency College he involved himself with laboratory experiments and studies involving refraction, diffraction and polarization, as well as transmitters, receivers and various microwave components.Bose's horn operated in the millimetre wave range . IN Compliance. Magazine article. November 2010. He connected receivers to a sensitive galvanometer, and developed crystals to be used as a receiver. The crystals operated in the shortwave radio range. Crystals were also developed to detect both white and ultraviolet light. These crystals were patented in 1904 for their capability to detect electromagnetic radiation. Furthermore, it appears that his work also anticipated the existence of p-type and n-type semiconductors by 60 years. For the general public in 1895, Bose was able to remotely ring a bell and explode gunpowder with the use of electromagnetic waves. In 1896, it was reported that Bose had transmitted electromagnetic signals over almost a mile. Microwave Symposium Digest. 1997. IEEE MTT-S International. Issue Date: 8‚Äì13 June 1997. pp. 553‚Äì556 . *This paper appears in * * In 1897, Bose reported on his microwave research (experiments) at the Royal Institution in London. There he demonstrated his apparatus at wavelengths that ranged from 2.5 centimeters to 5 millimeters. Early chiral media In 1898, Jagadish Chandra Bose conducted the first microwave experiment on twisted structures. These twisted structures match the geometries that are known as artificial chiral media in today's terminology. By this time, he had also researched double refraction (birefringence) in crystals. Other research included polarization of electric field \\"waves\\" that crystals produce. He discovered this type of polarization in other materials including a class of dielectrics. In addition, chirality as optical activity in a given material is a phenomenon that has been studied since the 19th century. By 1811, a study of quartz crystals revealed that such crystaline solids rotate the polarization of polarized light denoting optical activity. By 1815, materials other than crystals, such as oil of turpentine were known to exhibit chirality. However, the basic cause was not known. Louis Pasteur solved the problem (chirality of the molecules) originating a new discipline known as stereochemistry. At the macroscopic scale, Lindman applied microwaves to the problem with wire spirals (wire helices) in 1920 and 1922.(see abstract) Karl F. Lindman, from 1914 and into the 1920s, studied artificial chiral media formed by a collection of randomly oriented small spirals. He was written about by present-day metamaterials scientists: Ismo V. Lindell, Ari H. Sihvola, and Juhani Kurkijarvi. 20th century artificial dielectrics This \\"lens\\" converts the input spherical microwave radiation into parallel (collimated) lines in a given direction at the exit side of the microwave lens. The focusing action of the lens is accomplished by the refracting qualities of the metallic strip. Much of the historic research related to metamaterials is weighted from the view of antenna beam shaping within microwave engineering just after World War II. Furthermore, metamaterials appear to be historically linked to the body of research pertaining to artificial dielectrics throughout the late 1940s, the 1950s and the 1960s. The most common use for artificial dielectrics throughout prior decades has been in the microwave regime for antenna beam shaping. The artificial dielectrics had been proposed as a low cost and lightweight \\"tool\\". Research on artificial dielectrics, other than metamaterials, is still ongoing for pertinent parts of the electromagnetic spectrum. Pioneering works in microwave engineering on artificial dielectrics in microwave were produced by Winston E. Kock, Seymour Cohn, John Brown, and Walter Rotman. Periodic artificial structures were proposed by Kock, Rotman, and Sergei Schelkunoff. There is also an extensive reference list that is focused on the properties of artificial dielectrics in the 1990 book, Field theory of guided waves by R.E. Collin. Schelkunoff achieved notice for contributions to antenna theory and electromagnetic wave propagation. * The estimated year of publication (based on this article's references) is 2005. * Quote from abstract: \\"The number of proposals for practical microwave and optical applications benefiting from the properties of [novel materials] is increasing rapidly. However, the utilization of artificial materials in microwave engineering is not a new concept. The purpose of this short report is to revisit some of the most important early contributions that have led to the utilization of artificial dielectrics and magnetics in microwave applications.\\" \\"Magnetic particles made of capacitively loaded loops were also suggested by Sergei Schelkunoff in 1952 (who was a senior colleague of Winston Kock at Bell Labs at the time). However, Schelkunoff suggested these particles as a means of synthesizing high permeability (and not negative) values but he recognized that such high permeability artificial dielectrics would be quite dispersive.\\" W.E. Kock proposed metallic and wire lenses for antennas. Some of these are the metallic delay lens, parallel-wire lens, and the wire mesh lens. In addition, he conducted analytical studies regarding the response of customized metallic particles to a quasistatic electromagnetic radiation. As with the current large group of researchers conveying the behavior of metamaterials, Kock noted behaviors and structure in artificial materials that are similar to metamaterials. He employed particles, which would be of varying geometric shape; spheres, discs, ellipsoids and prolate or oblate spheroids, and would be either isolated or set in a repeating pattern as part of an array configuration. Furthermore, he was able to determine that such particles behave as a dielectric medium. He also noticed that the permittivity \\"Œµ\\" and permeability \\"Œº\\" of these particles can be purposely tuned, but not independently. With metamaterials, however, local values for both Œµ and Œº are designed as part of the fabrication process, or analytically designed in theoretical studies. Because of this process, individual metamaterial inclusions can be independently tuned. *This page contains the following citations: W.E.

The optical properties of the medium depended solely on the particles‚Äô geometrical shape and spacing, rather than on their own intrinsic behavior. His work also anticipated the split-ring resonator, a fabricated periodic structure that is a common workhorse for metamaterials. Kock, however, did not investigate the simultaneous occurrence of negative values of Œµ and Œº, which has become one of the first achievements defining modern metamaterials. This was because research in artificial materials was oriented toward other goals, such as creating plasma media at RF or microwave frequencies related to the overarching needs of NASA and the space program at that time. In one journal, entitled Proceedings of the IRE (see ref below), Kock describes a new type of antenna applying the optical properties of Radio waves. It is in fact a metallic lens, which focuses electromagnetic waves \\"...from short waves up to wavelengths of perhaps five meters or more.\\"  *Kock, Winston E. and Harvey, F.K. *: Walter Rotman and R.F. Turner advanced microwave beam shaping systems with a lens that has three perfect focal points; two symmetrically located off-axis and one on-axis. They published the design equations for the improved straight-front-face lens, the evaluation of its phase control capabilities, scanning capabilities, and the demonstrated fabrication techniques applicable to this type of design. . *This section has public domain material obtained from the United States Air Force. Rotman invented other periodic structures that include many types of surface wave antennas: the trough waveguide, the channel waveguide, and the sandwich wire antenna. The sandwich wire antenna, asymmetrical trough waveguide antenna  * Photonic structures \\"At frequencies of a few hundred gigahertz and lower, electrons are the principle particles which serve as the workhorse of devices. On the other hand, at infrared through optical to ultraviolet wavelengths, the photon is the fundamental particle of choice.\\" The word 'photonics' appeared in the late 1960s to describe a research field whose goal was to use light to perform functions that traditionally fell within the typical domain of electronics, such as telecommunications, information processing, among other processes. The term photonics more specifically connotes: * The particle properties of light, * The potential of creating signal processing device technologies using photons, * The practical application of optics, and * An analogy to electronics. Hence, as photonic materials are used, the photons, rather than electrons, become the fundamental carriers of information. Furthermore, the photon appears to be a more effiecient carrier of information, and materials that can process photonic signals are both in use and in further development. Additionally, developing photonic materials will lead to further miniaturization of components. In 1987 Eli Yablonovitch proposed controlling spontaneous emissions and constructing physical zones in periodic dielectrics that forbid certain wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation. These capabilities would be built into three- dimensional periodic dielectric structures (artificial dielectric). He noted that controlling spontaneous emission is desirable for semiconductor processes. Exceptional phenomena =Invention of the metamaterial= Historically, and conventionally, the function or behavior of materials can be altered through their chemistry. This has long been known. For example, adding lead changes the color or hardness of glass. However, at the end of the 20th century this description was expanded by John Pendry, a physicist from Imperial College in London. In the 1990s he was consulting for a British company, Marconi Materials Technology, as a condensed matter physics expert. The company manufactured a stealth technology made of a radiation-absorbing carbon that was for naval vessels. However, the company did not understand the physics of the material. The company asked Pendry if he could understand how the material worked. Pendry discovered that the radiation absorption property did not come from the molecular or chemical structure of the material, i.e. the carbon per se. This property came from the long and thin, physical shape of the carbon fibers. He realized rather than conventionally altering a material through its chemistry, as lead does with glass, the behavior of a material can be altered by changing a material's internal structure on a very fine scale. The very fine scale was less than the wavelength of the electromagnetic radiation that is applied. The theory applies across the electromagnetic spectrum that is in use by today's technologies. The radiations of interest are from radio waves, and microwaves, through infrared to the visible wavelengths. Scientists view this material as \\"beyond\\" conventional materials. Hence, the Greek word \\"meta\\" was attached, and these are called metamaterials. After successfully deducing and realizing the carbon fiber structure, Pendry further proposed that he try to change the magnetic properties of a non-magnetic material, also by altering its physical structure. The material would not be intrinsically magnetic, nor inherently susceptible to being magnetized. Copper wire is such a non-magnetic material. He envisioned fabricating a non-magnetic composite material, which could mimic the movements of electrons orbiting atoms. However, the structures are fabricated on a scale that is magnitudes larger than the atom, yet smaller than the radiated wavelength. He envisioned and hypothesized miniature loops of copper wire set in a fiberglass substrate could mimic the action of electrons but on a larger scale. Furthermore, this composite material could act like a slab of iron. In addition, he deduced that a current run through the loops of wire results in a magnetic response. This metamaterial idea resulted in variations. Cutting the loops results in a magnetic resonator, which acts like a switch. The switch, in turn, would allow Pendry to determine or alter the magnetic properties of the material simply by choice. At the time, Pendry didn't realize the significance of the two materials he had engineered. By combining the electrical properties of Marconi's radar- absorbing material with his new man-made magnetic material he had unwittingly placed in his hands a new way to manipulate electromagnetic radiation. In 1999, Pendry published his new conception of artificially produced magnetic materials in a notable physics journal. This was read by scientists all over the world, and it \\"stoked their imagination\\". PDF copy =Negative refractive index= In 1967, Victor Veselago produced an often cited, seminal work on a theoretical material that could produce extraordinary effects that are difficult or impossible to produce in nature. At that time he proposed that a reversal of Snell's law, an extraordinary lens, and other exceptional phenomena can occur within the laws of physics. This theory lay dormant for a few decades. There were no materials available in nature, or otherwise, that could physically realize Veselago's analysis. Not until thirty-three years later did the properties of this material, a metamaterial, became a subdiscipline of physics and engineering. However, there were certain observations, demonstrations, and implementations that closely preceded this work. Permittivity of metals, with values that could be stretched from the positive to the negative domain, had been studied extensively. In other words, negative permittivity was a known phenomenon by the time the first metamaterial was produced. Contemporaries of Kock were involved in this type of research. The concentrated effort was led by the US government for researching interactions between the ionosphere and the re-entry of NASA space vehicles. In the 1990s, Pendry et al. developed sequentially repeating thin wire structures, analogous to crystal structures. These extended the range of material permittivity. However, a more revolutionary structure developed by Pendry et al. was a structure that could control magnetic interactions (permeability) of the radiated light, albeit only at microwave frequencies. This sequentially repeating, split ring structure, extended material magnetic parameters into the negative. This lattice or periodic, \\"magnetic\\" structure was constructed from non-magnetic components. Hence, in electromagnetic domain, a negative value for permittivity and permeability occurring simultaneously was a requirement to produce the first metamaterials. These were beginning steps for proof of principle regarding Veselago's original 1967 proposal. In 2000, a team of UCSD researchers produced and demonstrated metamaterials, which exhibited unusual physical properties that were never before produced in nature. These materials obey the laws of physics, but behave differently from normal materials. In essence these negative index metamaterials were noted for having the ability to reverse many of the physical properties that govern the behavior of ordinary optical materials. One of those unusual properties is the capability to reverse, for the first time, the Snell's law of refraction. Until this May 2000 demonstration by the UCSD team, the material was unavailable. Advances during the 1990s in fabrication and computation capabilities allowed these first metamaterials to be constructed. Thus, testing the \\"new\\" metamaterial began for the effects described by Victor Veselago 30 years earlier, but only at first in the microwave frequency domain. Reversal of group velocity was explicitly announced in the related published paper. Summary of milestones in metamaterial research. There is also a list of peer reviewed articles pertaining to the research achievements of the Smith Group. =The super lens= The super lens or superlens is a practical structure based on John Pendry's work describing a perfect lens that can go beyond the diffraction limit by focusing all four fourier components. Pendry's paper described a theoretical novel lens that could capture images below the diffraction limit by employing the negative refractive index behavior. The super lens is a practical realization of this theory. It is a working lens that can capture images below the diffraction limit even though limitations occur due to the inefficiencies of conventional materials. This means that although there are losses, enough of an image is returned to show this work was a successful demonstration. =Invisibility cloak= Ulf Leonhardt was born in East Germany, and presently occupies the theoretical physics chair at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland, and is considered one the leaders in the science of creating an invisibility cloak. Around 1999, Leonhardt began work on how to build a cloaking device with a few other colleagues. Leonhardt stated that at the time invisibility was not considered fashionable. He then wrote a theoretical study entitled \\"Optical Conformal Mapping\\". The first sentence sums up the objective: \\"An invisibility device should guide light around an object as if nothing were there.\\" In 2005, he sent the paper to three notable scientific journals, Nature, Nature Physics, and Science. Each journal, in turn, rejected the paper. In 2006, Physical Review Letters rejected the paper for publication, as well. However, according to the PRL assessment, one of the anonymous reviewers noted that (he or she ) had been to two meetings in the previous months with John Pendry's group, who were also working on a cloaking device. From the meetings, the reviewer also became aware of a patent that Pendry and his colleagues were supposed to file. Leonhardt was at the time unaware of the Pendry group's work. Because of the Pendry meetings, Leonhardt's work was not really considered new physics by the reviewer and, therefore, did not merit publication in Physical Review Letters. Later in 2006, Science (the journal) reversed its decision and contacted Leonhardt to publish his paper because it had just received a theoretical study from Pendry's team entitled \\"Controlling Electromagnetic Fields\\". Science considered both papers strikingly similar and published them both in the same issue of Science Express on May 25, 2006. The published papers touched off research efforts by a dozen groups to build cloaking devices at locations around the globe, which would test out the mathematics of both papers. The url is linked to \\"Scott.net\\" because the article appears to be unavailable on the \\"Science News\\" website. *Two theoretical studies appeared strikingly similar to the academic journal Science Only months after the submission of notable invisibility cloak theories, a practical device was built and demonstrated by David Schurig and David Smith, engineering researchers of Duke University (October 2006). It was limited to the microwave range so the object was not invisible to the human eye. However, it demonstrated proof of principle.

He was born in Florence, Italy. By 1700 he was already known as a theorbist not only in his native Florence, but also in other cities such as Ferrara and Milan. The fame he enjoyed by 1701 enabled him to obtain appointment as an auxiliary theorbist at the Habsburg court in Vienna with the same salary as the main theorbist, Orazio Clementi. At the 1706 carnival he made his debut as an opera composer with Cleotide, and in 1713 was appointed as a court composer. In 1708, with the death of Clementi, Conti was promoted senior theorbist, a position he held until 1726. In the same year he was elected a member of the Accademia Filarmonica of Bologna and in 1711 he was appointed vice-Kapellmeister (vice-maestro di cappella) in Vienna. In April of that year, after the death of his first wife, Theresia Kugler, Conti remarried to the prima donna Maria Landini, at that time the highest-paid singer in Vienna. She sang the main soprano roles in Conti's operas from 1714 and 1721, but died in 1722. After her death Anna Maria Lorenzani was appointed prima donna and performed in three more of Conti's operas. She became his third wife in April 1725. On 28 August 1723, Conti, as theorbist, took part in the first performance of the festival opera Costanza e Fortezza by Johann Joseph Fux. In 1726 and again during 1729 to 1732 Conti visited Italy because of health problems. He returned to Vienna in 1732, where he staged two new operas but in July of the same year he died. He was succeeded by his son Ignazio Conti (Florence 1699-1759).Hermine Weigel Williams Francesco Bartolomeo Conti: his life and music 1999 \\"Ignazio Conti did not accompany his father to Italy. He continued his court duties as Hof-Scholar and, in his father's absence, found opportunities to have several of his works performed.\\"von K√∂chel, Ludwig Johann Josef Fux, Hofcompositor und Hofkapellmeister der Kaiser 1872 \\"Gleichzeitig mit dem Vater, und mit diesem √∂fter verwechselt, componierte f√ºr den Hof sein Sohn Ignazio Conti (geb. 1699, gest. in Wien 28.

Conti was also a supreme player of the mandolin, and wrote the earliest sonatas for the instrument. His works composed between 1714 and 1725 were primarily written for the carnival season or to celebrate birthdays and name days of the members of the Imperial family. Handel reused some of Conti's music for Cleotide in his pasticcio Ormisda (1730) performed at the Queen's Theatre. His music was also appreciated by Johann Sebastian Bach, and Conti's cantata Languet anima mea, survives in a manuscript version from 1716 as arranged by Bach (BWV deest 1006). In 1739, Mattheson in his Der vollkommene Capellmeister, Part I, Chapter six, Nr.48 writes about him: Excerpt from a Letter from Regensburg of October 19, 1730. \\"On September 10 in Vienna the Imperial Composilore di Musica, Francesco Conti, was expelled from St. Stephan's Cathedral by virtue of an excommunication pronounced on him by the local Consistorio. His Imperial Majesty had reduced the imposed standing from thrice to once out of innate kindness; but since then the man behaved very badly the first time, in the view of many hundreds of persons, as he did the second time on September 17 when placed before the doors of said church for an hour in a long hairy coat, called a coat of penance, between twelve guards who formed a circle around him while he held a burning black candle in his hand; the same thing is also to occur on the 24th. His food is bread and water as long as he remains under the ecclesiastical authority; after transfer to the secular he is to pay the priest who was beaten by him 1,000 guilders in compensation as well as expenses, then remain in jail for four years and subsequently be banned from Austria forever: since as he stood in front of the church doors the first time he used a very uncivil and vexatious effrontery (i.e., he used his art of gesticulation in a most wicked manner). The said court-Compositeur has been sentenced to such punishment because he laid violent hands on a priest and beat him up severely. The following epigram has been made about him: \\"It is not good Muse, nor Music, which you have composed Conti, for that was a heavy touch: And the bass is too heavy, and the key is not harmonious: Hence as a result you bear black marks forever.\\"  Works  16 operas, including: * Cleotide (1706) * Don Chisciotte in Sierra Morena (1719) * Teseo in Creta.

The track reached a chart peak of #3 in the UK and gave Richard a #1 hit in the Netherlands, Norway (for eight weeks) and South Africa. A #2 hit in Australia and Ireland, Richard's \\"When the Girl in Your Arms...\\" was also a hit in Belgium/Flemish Region (#4), Belgium/Wallonia (#10) and New Zealand (#7). Although Cliff Richard had a deal for US distribution with ABC-Paramount - who in 1959 had released his only US hit (as of 1961) \\"Living Doll\\" (#30) - \\"When the Girl in Your Arms...\\" was not given a US release concurrent with its UK charting, as ABC-Parmamount felt it prudent to await the American opening of the track's parent movie The Young Ones. Connie Francis heard Richard's hit while visiting the UK and in an unusual move Francis - whose singles were typically remakes of traditional pop standards or original material - covered Richard's UK hit in a 2 November 1961 session in New York City produced by Arnold Maxin with Don Costa as arranger/conductor. Entitled \\"When the Boy in Your Arms (Is the Boy in Your Heart)\\", Francis' version reached #10 on the Billboard Hot 100 in January 1962 and #8 in Cash Box. The single's B-side \\"Baby's First Christmas\\" also became a chart hit over the 1961 holiday season reaching #26.

Francis' next single release \\"Don't Break the Heart That Loves You\\" despite hitting #1 in the US only reached #39 in the UK and Francis would have only four subsequent UK chartings with \\"Vacation\\" at #10 her only Top Twenty entrant.

Global communication implies a transfer of knowledge and ideas from centers of power to peripheries and the imposition of a new intercultural hegemony by means of the \\"soft power\\" of global news and entertainment. \\"International\\" Or \\"Global\\" With the end of the twentieth century and the turn of a new millennium, the global arena and the field of international communication were undergoing significant changes. Some authors started to use the term global communication because it goes beyond the bounds of individual states and emphasizes communication between and among peoples across borders and, importantly, the rise of transnational media corporations. International communication traditionally refers to communication between and among nation- states and connotes issues of national sovereignty, control of national information resources, and the supremacy of national governments. Nevertheless, earlier International communication theories have failed to develop models or research agendas that match the reality of the contemporary role of global communication . The old theories only explain part of the global picture and the theories of modernization, dependency, and cultural imperialism have failed to satisfactorily explain global communication. The term \\"global\\", implies a declining role of the state and state sovereignty. As a term, \\"international\\" has within it notions of bilateral or multilateral decisions. \\"Global\\" could be seen as an aspiration, also as a fear, of the weakening of the state. In addition, global may imply something more pervasive, more geographically inclusive than international. History The study of global communication increased dramatically after World War II due to military considerations coupled with their economic and political implications. Earlier attempts at theorizing have failed to develop models or research agendas that match the reality of the contemporary role of global communication . More global communication research was written in the decade from 1945‚Äì1955; most of the research of the 1950s dealt with propaganda and the cold war. By 1970, global communication research had grown to include a great variety of subjects, especially comparative mass communication systems, communication and national development and propaganda and public opinion. From the point of view of global communication scholars, previous theories of modernization, dependency, and cultural imperialism have failed to satisfactorily explain global communication. The old theories only explain part of the global picture. =Technological development= The emergence of global communication technologies may be considered the origin of the field of global communication in the nineteenth century. Numerous technical advances such as the creation of a new major global communication phenomenon, convergence, digital environments and the internet are some of the major engines driving the change from international communication to global communication. =Global power shifts= With the collapse of the Soviet Union, the shadow of Cold War has lifted to reveal shifting political, economic, and cultural alliances and conflicts. The increasing importance of these currents, especially in the cultural sphere, demands a reconsideration of the nature of the international communication field within the rubric of international relations. =News agencies and propaganda= Three key players are usually recognized as the founders of the international news agencies. In 1835, Charles-Louis Havas created the world's first news agency; In 1849, Bernhard Wolff started publishing stock market news and daily reports from Paris, London, Amsterdam, and Frankfurt; In 1849, Paul Julius Freiherr von Reuter established his own commercial service, the Reuter agency, and organized a worldwide exchange of news in 1870. In 1859, Reuter, Havas and the German Wolff agency reached an agreement to exchange news from all over the world, which was known as the League of Allied Agencies, or the \\" Ring Combination\\". In 1848, American News Agency Associated Press was founded and was formally admitted into the \\"Ring Combination\\" in 1887. There are some major factors that point to the growing importance of global communication in the world of the twenty-first century: # world population explosion # from geopolitics to gaiapolitics # increased cross-cultural communication # changing concept of community # greater centralization of control # information explosion # changes in technologies # greater dependence on global communication # greater interdependence and democracy # impact of communication on peace and war  Theoretical approaches and perspectives  = Transcultural political economy = Transcultural Political Economy is a concept that is presented in Global Communications by Paula Chakravartty and Yeuzhi Zhao. This concept looks at global communications and media studies in three major areas: global flows of information and culture, decentralizing the conceptual parameters of global information and media studies, and the normative debates in global communications in the context of neoliberalism. Transcultural Political Economy is a multidisciplinary study that focuses on the tensions between political economy and cultural studies. It \\"integrate[s] institutional and cultural analyzes and address urgent questions in global communications in the context of economic integration, empire formation, and the tensions associated with adapting new privatized technologies, neoliberalized and globalized institutional structures, and hybrid cultural forms and practices\\". Transcultural Political Economy addresses the issues surrounding the practice of neoliberalism and its creation of unequal power structures within the world system. Chakravartty, P. & Zhao, Y. (2008). Global Communications: toward a transcultural political economy. Rowman & Littlefield. = Globalization theory = Globalization theory was popularized in the 1990s as a model for understanding global communication. The concept of globalization inspired a number of theories from various schools of thought in communication studies that each emphasize different aspects of globalization. Many globalization theories highlight actors in the business sector as leaders in the processes of global integration. Transnationalizing business is often celebrated as progression toward a more interconnected world. Globalization theories are often associated with theories of modernity. Some scholars view globalization as the social, political, economic, and cultural integration of societies into a capitalist system; Others see globalization as a successor to modernity, while some see it as an iteration of imperialism. Some question the usefulness and legitimacy of globalization theory, arguing that it does not adequately conceptualize current international relations or function as a lens through which to examine everyday events. Many scholars criticize globalization theories as overzealous toward and unrealistic about the extent of global integration. Some scholars criticize social theorists for offering opinions and predictions based on theory with little practical evidence. In contrast, some scholars work to dispute the pessimistic views of globalization theory. = World systems theory = World-system theory is a macro- sociological perspective that seeks to explain the dynamics of the \\"capitalist world economy\\" as a \\"total social system\\". A world-system is what Wallerstein terms a \\"world-economy\\", integrated through the market rather than a political centre, in which two or more regions are interdependent with respect to necessities like food, fuel, and two or more polities compete for domination without the emergence of one single centre forever.Goldfrank, Walter L. (2000). \\"Paradigm Regained? The Rules of Wallerstein's World-System Method. Journal of World-Systems Research. Vol. 6. N. 2 pp. 150-195 World-system theory was first articulated by Immanuel Wallerstein. There are three major sources of the world-system theory which conceived by Wallerstein: the Annales school's general methodology, Marx's focus on accumulation process and competitive class struggles and so on, and dependence theory's neo-Marxist explanation of development processes.Thomas Barfield (1998), The dictionary of anthropology, Wiley-Blackwell, , Referring to the transnational division of labor, world-system divides the world into core countries, peripheral countries, semi-peripheral countries and external areas. The core countries usually developed a strong central governments, extensive bureaucracies and large mercenary armies, which permit the local bourgeoisie to obtain control over international commerce and extract capital surpluses from the trade for benefits.Paul Halsall(1997) Modern History Sourcebook: Summary of Wallerstein on World System Theory. The peripheral countries often lack strong central governments or been controlled by core countries, they export raw materials and rely on coercive labor practices. Semi-peripheries which served as buffers between the core and the peripheries. They retain limited but declining access to international banking and the production of high-cost high-quality manufactured goods.[3] External areas such as Russia maintain their own economic systems, they want to remain outside the modern world economy. = Modernisation theory = The theory of modernization was developed by Daniel Lerner (1958) in the \\"Passing of traditional society.\\" Lerner's description of \\"modernised\\" is an individual having the ability to be empathetic and being able to see oneself in another person's situation. This concept has come from the transition of traditional societies to modern societies, where modern societies is distinctively industrial, urban, literate, and participant. This theory looks at development in a linear fashion, concluding that nations need to develop into a modern society to make it a sustainable and flourishing nation. Developing modernized societies include technological advancement, and developing media sectors to help create a participatory culture. Lerner, D. (1958). The passing of traditional society: Modernising the Middle East. Free Press. = Post-colonialism = See also: Post-structuralism, imperialism, modernity, Post-colonialism is a theoretical approach to looking at literature that examines the colonizer-colonized experience. It deals with the adaptation of formerly colonized nations and their development in cultural, political, economical aspects. Some Notable theoreticians include: Frantz Fanon, Edward Said, Gayatri Spivak, R Siva Kumar, Dipesh Chakrabarty, Derek Gregory. = Cultural imperialism = Cultural imperialism is a mighty civilization exerts culture influence over another. Less economically prominent cultures often import culture from Western countries, which have the economic means to produce a majority of the world's cultural media, mostly via the global transmission of media.Dan Ketchum, What Is the Meaning of Cultural Imperialism? The weak civilization adopts the mighty civilization's customs, philosophies, worldviews and general ways of life. The theoretical foundations of the academic study of cultural imperialism mostly come from Michel Foucault's concept of biopower, governmentality and Edward Sa√Ød's concept of Post-colonialism, which theories see cultural imperialism as the cultural legacy of colonialism or forms of Western hegemony. Media effect study which integrated with political-economy traditional is the core argument of cultural imperialism. There are two opposite effects of media study. The negative one is that Western media imposes socio-political conflicts to the developing country and the latter one's resistance to the media effects to preserve their traditional cultural identities.G. K., & Tan. A.S. (1987), American TV in the Philippines: A test of cultural impact. Journalism Quarterly The positive effects are the issues of the process of civilization such as women's right or racial equality with exposing to Western media.Kang, J. G., & Morgan, M. (1988). Culture clash: Impact of U.S. television in Korea. Journalism Quarterly Now the term of cultural imperialism usually refers to America's global culture expansion to the rest of world, which include brand name products, video media, fast food and so on. = Communication for development (C4D) = Communication for Development (C4D) is a praxis oriented aspect of global communication studies that approaches global development with a focus on action and participation for social change enacted through communication systems. C4D underlines \\"voice, citizenship and collective action\\" as central values that promote citizen-led development where the visiting party provides guidance rather than direction within the host community. C4D often incorporates bottom-up theories of social change with the aim to create sustainable change which is believed to be more likely to occur if the efforts are planned, implemented, and sustained by community members themselves. Some development workers and academics suggest that a shared definition of communication for development should be clarified, because disagreement within the field can detract from the characteristics that most scholars view as central to current development, including participatory action research (PAR). Many C4D projects revolve around media systems as a central site for social change, which differentiates C4D from other approaches to development. Theories behind C4D highlight that development projects should be contextually situated and that communication technology will affect different types of social change accordingly. = Global media studies = Global media studies is a field of media study in a global scope. Media study deals with the content, history and effects of media. Media study often draws on theories and methods from the disciplines of cultural studies, rhetoric, philosophy, communication studies, feminist theory, political economy and sociology.Dayan, Daniel and Katz, Elihu (1992). Media Events. London, England: Harvard University Press. . Among these study approaches, political economic analysis is non-ignorable in understanding the current media and communication developments. But the political economic research has become more resilient because of stronger empirical studies, and the potential connections to policy-making and alternative praxis.Janet Wasko (2009). Global Media Studies. Television & New Media. Volume 10 Number 1 January 2009 167-168. Each country has its own distinct media ecosystem. The media of mainland China is state- run, so the political subjects are under the strict regulations set by the government while other areas such as sports, finance, and increasingly lucrative entertainment industry face less regulation from government.Council on Foreign Relations. Canada has a well-developed media sector, but the mass media is threatened by the direct outcome of American economic and cultural imperialism which hinder the form of Canada's media identity.Irving, John A. (1969). Mass Media in Canada. The Ryerson Press. p. 225. Many of the media in America are controlled by large for-profit corporations who reap revenues from advertisings, subscriptions and the sale of copyrighted materials. Currently, six corporations (Comcast, The Walt Disney Company, News Corporation, Time Warner, Viacom and CBS Corporation) have controlled roughly 90% of the America media.Ashley Lutz (2012) These 6 Corporations Control 90% Of The Media In America. Business Insider. 14 June 2012. Such figures come from the policies of the federal government or the tendency to natural monopolies in the industry.  Central debates  = Global power shifts = Immanuel Wallerstein's world system theory develops a basic framework to understand global power shifts in the rise of the modern world. Wallerstein proposes four different categories: core, semi-periphery, periphery, and external, in terms of different region's relative position in the world system. The core regions are the ones that benefited the most from the capitalist world economy, such as England and France. The peripheral areas relied on and exported raw materials to the core, such as Eastern Europe and Latin America. The semi- peripheries are either core regions in decline or peripheries attempting to improve their relative position in the world system, such as Portugal and Spain. The external areas managed to remain outside the modern world economy, such as Russia.Summary of Wallerstein on World System Theory There are two basic types of global power shifts in the 21st century. One is traditional power transition amongst states, which follows Wallerstein's world system theory. For instance, the global power shifts from the West to the East since the rise of Asia. The other is power diffusion, the way that power move from states to non-states actors. For instance, \\"climate change, drug trade, financial flows, pandemics, all these things that cross borders outsider the control of governments.\\" = Global public sphere = Public sphere theory, attributed to Jurgen Habermas, is a theory that in its basic premise conceives of democratic governments as those that can stand criticism that comes from public spheres. Public spheres are places, physical or imagined, where people discuss any kind of topic, particularly topics of a societal or political nature. Global public sphere is, therefore, a public that is made of people from across the globe, who come together to discuss and act on issues that concern them. The concept of global public sphere is linked to the shift of public sphere, from restricted to nation-state, to made of individuals and groups connected across as well as within borders. Since Plato, it can be argued that philosophers have been thinking about versions of a common space for all people to debate in; however, a global public sphere that can fit the description above began to appear much later. In the second half of the 20th century, the legacy of World War II and technological advancements created a new sense of the global and started the economic and political phenomena that we now call globalization. This includes the expansion of humankind into space, which gave individuals the sense of a global unity, the growth of satellite technology, which allowed for people across the globe to view the same television channels, and the internet, which can provide access to an unprecedented amount of information and spaces to connect with other people. = Cultural industries = The term \\"culture industry\\" appeared in the post- war period. At that time, culture and industry were argued to be opposites. Cultural industries\\" are also referred to as the \\"Creative industries.  Definitions and scope of cultural industries  In the present day, there remain different interpretations of culture as an industry. For some, cultural industries are simply those industries that produce cultural goods and services. In the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the cultural industries are regarded as those industries that \\"combine the creation, production and commercialization of contents which are intangible and cultural in nature. These contents are typically protected by copyright and they can take the form of goods or services\\". According to UNESCO, an essential part of cultural industries is that they are \\"central in promoting and maintaining cultural diversity and in ensuring democratic access to culture\\". \\"Cultural industries\\" combines the cultural and economic, which gives the cultural industries a distinctive profile. In France, the \\"cultural industries\\" have recently been defined as a set of economic activities that combine the functions of conception, creation and production of culture with more industrial functions in the large-scale manufacture and commercialization cultural products. In Canada, economic activities involved in the preservation of heritage are also included in the definition of culture.  Global cultural industries  Since the rise of the cultural industries has occurred simultaneously with economic globalization, cultural industries have close connections with globalization and global communication. Herbert Schiller argued that the 'entertainment, communications and information (ECI) complex were having a direct impact on culture and human consciousness. As Schiller argued, the result of transnational corporate expansion is the perpetuation of cultural imperialism, defined as \\"the sum of the processes by which a society is brought into the modern world system and how its dominating stratum is attracted, pressured, forced, and sometimes bribed into shaping social institutions to correspond to, or even promote, the values and structures of the dominating centre of the system\\". The second wave of transnational corporate expansion, which began in the 1970s with the emergence of Export Processing Zones in developing countries, is focused on the development of global production networks. This process was described as a \\"new international division of labour\\" (NIDL) by the German political economists Fr”ßbel et al. (1980). Ernst and Kim have argued that GPNs are changing the nature of the multinational corporation itself, from \\"stand alone overseas investment projects, to \\"global network flagships\\" that integrate their dispersed supply, knowledge and customer bases into global and regional production networks\\", entailing a shift from top-down hierarchical models of corporate control to increasingly networked and collective forms of organization.  Global media empires  The largest firms in media and media-related industries have a very high international profile. Global media empires such as Disney, News Corporation, Time-Warner and Viacom-CBS now derive 25-45 per cent of their revenues outside of the United States. It is often argued that the global media are dominated by a small number of powerful media conglomerates. Edward S. Herman and Robert W. McChesney (1997) argued that the global media were \\"dominated by three or four dozen large transnational corporations (TNCs) with fewer than ten mostly US- based media conglomerates towering over the global market.\\" Similarly, Manfred Steger has observed that \\" to a very large extent, the global cultural flows of our time are generated and directed by global media empires that rely on powerful communication technologies to spread their message.\\" He also argued that during the last two decades, a few very large TNCs would come to dominate the global market for entertainment, news, television, and film. = Diaspora = Diaspora is often confused with exodus. Diasporas are minority groups that have a sense of connection with a larger community outside of the borders they currently inhabit, and through diasporic media create a sense of a larger identity and community, whether imagined or real. In scholarly work about diaspora in communication studies, the view of nation and culture as interchangeable terms is no longer prevalent. Stuart Hall theorized of hybridity, which he distinguished from \\"old style pluralism\\", \\"nomadic voyaging of the postmodern\\", and \\"global homogenization\\". Hybridity is the retention of an original identity and strong ties to an original country and tradition, but with the understanding that there is no unchanged, ideal nation of the past that they can return to. To be hybrid is to also adapt to a new culture and tradition without simply assimilating in it, but rather negotiating a place between the \\"original\\" and \\"new\\" cultures. In Communication studies, diaspora is discussed as the identity that unifies people across time and space, sometimes existing in physical spaces and other times existing in imagined 'non-spaces'. However, it has been argued that the concept of 'diaspora' implies ethnic homogeneity and essentializes identity to only ethnicity. One of the most cited and well-known works in the field of diasporic media is Hamid Naficy's work on exiled Iranian Americans' creation of cable television in the United States. Diasporic media refer to media that address the needs of particular ethnic, religious, and/or linguistic groups that live in multicultural settings . Diasporic media can be in the diaspora's traditional language or in another language, and they can include news or media from the \\"origin\\" country or they can contain the diaspora's local news or media. Diasporic media can be created in radio, television, film, music, in newspapers, magazines, and other publishing, as well as online. It can be argued that the development and spread of satellite television is an instrumental element of the growth of diasporic media today. Satellite television allowed migrants to access the news and popular culture from their homeland, as well as allowing people who speak the same language to access the same channels that might be produced outside of the \\"homeland\\" Contemporary studies of diaspora show that diasporic media are part of the change in the tendency Immanuel Wallerstein described in his world systems theory. The world systems theory postulates that much of the flow of people in the world has been from the 'periphery', or economically-developing states, towards the centre; which are often metropolitan, economically-wealthy states that grew their wealth in colonialist entrepreneurship. However, contrary to the movement of people, the flow of information (including media products), has tended to be from the centre to the periphery. = Technology and media = The advancement of media and technology have played the pivotal role in process of globalization and global communication. Cable television, ISDN, digitalization, direct broadcast satellites as well as the Internet have created a situation where vast amounts of information can be transferred around the globe in a matter of seconds. During the early 20th century, telegraph, telephony, and radio started the process of global communication. As media technologies developed intensely, they were thought to create, in Marshall McLuhan‚Äô s famous words, a ‚Äò‚Äòglobal village.‚Äô‚Äô The launch of Sputnik, the world‚Äô s first artificial satellite, on October 4, 1957, marked the beginning of technologies that would further interconnect the world. The first live global television broadcast occurred when Neil Armstrong stepped onto the moon in July 1969. In November 1972, pay TV caused expansion of cable when Service Electric offered Home Box Office over its cable system. By 2000, over direct broadcast satellite, a household could receive channels from all over the world. Now with the World Wide Web, smart phones, tablet devices, smart televisions and other digital media devices, billions of people are now able to access media content that was once tied to particular communications media (print, broadcast) or platforms (newspapers, magazines, radio, television, cinema). = Justice = Justice in communication studies includes, but is not limited to, the concern with democratic process and fostering democratic publics . Jurgen Habermas theorized of public sphere (in The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere) as the space that is created whenever matters of common concern are discussed between the state and civil society. Thus, public sphere includes not only the media, but also public protest in the form of marches, demonstrations, et cetera. There are, however, critiques of political economy in whose view it is impossible to work within the current system to produce democratic publics. Such a critique is that produced by Karl Marx, who saw institutions such as parliament, the state, the 'acceptable' public sphere, economic enterprises, and so on as structurally produced and perpetuated by a capitalist system, and thus they can not be mobilized to change it. In such a system, there can only be illusory justice, which is fair only within the logic of the system. This illusion of justice is produced through dominating ideology. Another issue of justice in communication studies is the question of decolonizing research methods and theoretical discourse . The idea of decolonizing research comes from a rejection of the functionalist approach, which assumed that research can be conducted in a vacuum, free of ideology or the researcher's biases. This approach assumed cultures to be unchanging, homogenous, and isolated from each other. The purpose of decolonizing research and discourse is to 'uncloak' research as an unbiased power structure, and produce research that is more self-aware. The approach in decolonizing research methods attempts to create methodologies that treat the people in the study as participants or partners, rather than subjects - which is a term that in itself carries strong connotations of colonialism. Decolonizing research also involves moving away from Eurocentric models that are assumed to work anywhere else, and instead to create work that is more useful in local contexts. Decolonial approaches specifically seek to produce knowledge about the mechanisms and effects of colonialism. These approaches allow former subjects to 'talk back', which is a reflection of independent agency, on the colonizer's own terms of research, rather than to be 'given' a voice, which is an unequal power structure.

Carr gained a reputation for being a high-energy onstage performer, often being the most attention-grabbing part of his band's live shows. When not in a band Carr has promoted gigs, booked for bands and worked as a tour photographer.  Early work  Carr had previously played bass in King Kommunist and Skulls, as well as guitar in Bombs Below. Whilst non of these bands were successful, they played all over the North of England and Skulls garnered a large following in Rotherham.  Blockades  Carr joined as bassist in October 2008 whilst the band were still called CryGirlCry. The band originally had a post grunge sound and quite an indie orientated fan base, however, Carr brought along a heavier influence which sat well with drummer Danny Barnett's style of song writing which led to the band developing a harder sound. The band played all over the UK building up a following which led to them playing at such venues as Leeds Cockpit and Manchester Academy with such well known bands as To The Bones, Helsinki Seven, Atomic Garden, Lauren Harris and many more established acts. In January 2009, the band recorded their only EP with their new heavier sound at Boom Studios in Cheshire, and signed to Dapsone Records. Carr left Blockades in July 2009, citing creative and personal reasons. The band disbanded in August 2009 after being unable to find a suitable replacement.  Promotion/booking work  Between playing in Skulls and Bombs Below, Carr ran regular gigs in Bradford at the 1 in 12 Club under the guise of Dead and Buried Promotions. The night got a regular following and hosted bands such as Broadways Not Ready, 1000 Scars, Boys With Beaks and future thrash stars Evile. Flemming Rasmussen (producer of Metallica records Master Of Puppets and ...And Justice For All) once attended one of the shows. Carr also briefly booked shows for Leeds punks AB Negative, securing them support slots on the UK Subs 2007 UK Tour.  Photography  Carr has worked as tour photographer (under the name Cardiac Fracture Photographic) for such well known acts as Wednesday 13, Electric 6 and UK Subs. Carr has been known to work at smaller gigs with local bands in West and South Yorkshire. Carr also does promo shoots for local bands, which, as well as live shots for local bands, he still occasionally does.  Current status  Currently, Carr is working on a new band in Rotherham, after the life affirming struggle of his move from Bradford to Doncaster in late 2009, as well as an acoustic act with ex No Av On The TV/Bombs Below drummer Andy Griggs and surviving members of Right Said Fred.

It is not open for public access.  Facilities and aircraft  The facility contains a rough airstrip at an elevation of above mean sea level. It has one runway designated 7/25 with a gravel surface measuring 5,000 by 100 feet (1,524 x 30 m). According to the FAA, for the 12-month period ending July 12, 1977, it had 15,500 general aviation aircraft operations, an average of 42 per day. Husky Oil Company was making these flights in and out of Lonely. Many of the flights were L-188 Electra's and also a rare C-133 Cargomaster. Husky had to make improvements to the runway in order to accommodate these aircraft. There were also Huey's being flown in as well.Dale Mangels recollections History The airstrip was built in 1957 to support the Distant Early Warning Line radar station at Point Lonely (POW-1). The station was logistically supported by the Point Barrow Main DEW Line Station (POW-MAIN). It was operated by civilian contract workers. DEW Line operations ceased in October 1990, and the personnel were relieved from their duties. The radar station was upgraded with new radars and in 1994 was re-designated part of the North Warning System (NWS) as a Short Range Radar Site, A-18, equipped with a minimally attended AN/FPS-124 surveillance radar. In 1998 Pacific Air Forces initiated \\"Operation Clean Sweep\\", in which abandoned Cold War stations in Alaska were remediated and the land restored to its previous state. The site remediation of the radar and support station was carried out by the 611th Civil Engineering Squadron at Elmendorf AFB, and remediation work was completed by 2005. The site is controlled by the Pacific Air Forces 611th Air Support Group, based at Elmendorf. The airstrip remains open to provide contractor support access to the military radar site.

Improvements Citytrain passenger journey growth between the 1997/1998 to 2007/2008 financial years The Brisbane and south east corner of Queensland has experienced significant population growth, with approximately one million more people living in the area over the last 20 years and a forecast population of more than 3.8 million by 2026. This growth has placed an unprecedented demand on public transport and its infrastructure; Citytrain has reported successive patronage increases of 9% in both the 2005‚Äì2006 and 2006‚Äì2007 financial years, and a 6.6% increase in the 2007‚Äì2008 financial year. To respond to this demand, the Government of Queensland created the South East Queensland Infrastructure Plan and Program to manage the investment in new transport infrastructure, amongst other areas. QR, in response, created the SEQIPRAIL office to manage and deliver rail components of the plan. =Increased capacity= Beenleigh line A third track was laid between Salisbury and Kuraby stations, a length of . Previously two tracks, the added capacity allows Gold Coast line services to operate with less chance of delays. Seven railway stations along the section were significantly upgraded. The project was commissioned on 2 March 2008. Ferny Grove line A second track was laid between Mitchelton and Keperra railway station, including an upgrade to the intermediate stations, Oxford Park and Grovely. Upgraded with two platforms, this upgrade allows additional services to operate on the line during peak hour, and will also remove waiting times outbound from Mitchelton and inbound from Keperra. Other improvements include lifts and footbridges, to meet the Disability Standards for Accessible Public Transport, and new, modern station buildings. The further duplication of the railway between Keperra and Ferny Grove stations, plus an additional platform and parking at Ferny Grove has been completed. Gold Coast line The line between Ormeau and Coomera stations, in length, was duplicated in October 2006, allowing for additional capacity. Similarly, the length between Helensvale and Robina stations is being duplicated, and should remove the need for a four-minute layover at Helensvale for Robina services to wait for the Brisbane service due to the single track either side of the station. It was completed on July 2008. Ipswich line of track between Corinda and Darra stations was quadruplicated. Previously four tracks to Corinda then two to Ipswich, the quadruplication allowed for greater capacity, especially with the Springfield railway line branching from Darra station. Sunshine Coast line of track north of Caboolture station to Beerburrum station has been duplicated and re-aligned, along with the construction of stations at Elimbah and Beerburrum. Construction work began in 2007, and the project was commissioned on 14 April 2009. From Beerburrum station, of track to Landsborough is proposed to be similarly duplicated and re-aligned. This project is in planning stage, with construction scheduled to begin in 2020. =New lines= Gold Coast line A extension of the Gold Coast railway line from Robina to Varsity Lakes is completed. This is the first stage of the proposed progressive extension of the line to the Gold Coast Airport. Further extension of the line including proposed stations at Tallebudgera, Elanora and Tugun is expected to be constructed after the completion of the Cross River Rail project. Maroochydore line The Maroochydore railway line (or CAMCOS, Caloundra and Maroochydore Corridor Options Study), is a proposed single track line that was initially due for construction and progressive completion in stages between 2015 and 2020. However, with the launch of the Connecting SEQ 2031, a regional plan for the future of transportation in South East Queensland, the project was postponed to start in 2031, or even after.¬´Maroochydore train hope derailed¬ª. Sunshine Coast Daily It will branch from the existing Sunshine Coast line after Beerwah railway station to Caloundra and Maroochydore in Sunshine Coast. Springfield line The Springfield railway line is a line extending from Darra railway station on the Ipswich line to the Springfield area. The extension of the network had a total cost of $475 million and was completed in December 2013. Redcliffe Peninsula line The Redcliffe Peninsula railway line (previously known as the Moreton Bay Rail link) is a suburban railway line extending north-northwest from Brisbane central business district (approximately from Central station. The line is part of the QR Citytrain network, branching from the existing Caboolture line immediately after Petrie railway station, and extend to the Redcliffe peninsula. It was more seriously identified and anticipated in the 1970s, and the land was purchased in the 1980s although the line was not built. Construction commenced in 2013 and the line was opened to passengers on 4 October 2016. CBD underground access On 26 August 2007 the then- Minister for Transport and Main Roads, Paul Lucas, announced the Inner City Rail Capacity Study to look at underground rail access under the Brisbane central business district. Dismissing a City Loop-style scenario similar to Melbourne, citing the relatively small size of the CBD and \\"technical and operational constraints\\", Lucas imagined an underground line from Park Road station to Woolloongabba, then across the Brisbane River to connect with the Exhibition railway line, with major new stations at Woolloongabba, Gardens Point/QUT, and in the CBD. The study will also investigate the feasibility of the Exhibition line operating all year with new stations, and the upgrading of existing lines with additional tracks. Lucas allocated A$5 million to the study and appointed AECOM and Parsons Brinckerhoff as consultants to \\"look at options for boosting rail capacity in the city centre, including potential for an underground tunnel\\". This project, Cross River Rail, is now under construction and due to open in 2024.

Harney, is a lake that straddles the county line between Volusia County and Seminole County, Florida, at the coordinates latitude 28¬∞45‚Äô21.404\\", longitude 81¬∞ 03‚Äô36.019\\". It is fed by the Saint Johns River which flows through central Florida and feeds many of the nearby lakes such as Lake Monroe.  History  A large amount of Lake Harney's history can be credited to General William S. Harney and the wars he took part in throughout Florida. Mal Martin, in a 2001 online article, \\"The Naming of Lake Harney\\", stated, \\"William Selby Harney was born in Haysboro, Tennessee, on August 22, 1800.\\" When he entered the military, he enlisted as a Second Lieutenant in the First United States Infantry on February 12, 1818, and remained at that rank throughout the First Seminole War which was sparked by Andrew Jackson's attack on a fort held by the Seminole people. Harney was recognized for his military abilities and raised to the rank of First Lieutenant, on January 7, 1819. Harney continued in his military career and, after the end of the Second Seminole War, served in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War and the Civil War, retiring on August 1, 1863, as a General. After retirement, he married a nurse and lived in Pass Christian, Mississippi, for some time. He died on May 9, 1889, in Orlando, Florida, and was buried at Arlington National Cemetery. There are several landmarks named in his honor, such as Harney Peak (now Black Elk Peak) in South Dakota and Camp Harney in Zapata, Texas.  Wildlife  Lake Harney is home to a variety of species of fish, reptiles, water fowl and wading birds. It is nominally fresh water with some salt water springs throughout the area. The lake is home to a variety of fish such as largemouth bass, crappie, bluegill, and redear sunfish, all of which are prey to the lake's birds such as bald eagles, osprey, Crested caracara, white ibis, wood stork (Ibis), herons, cranes, cattle egrets, wild turkeys, a variety of ducks and other water fowl.

Originally published in 1976 by Heinemann, it was republished in 1977 by Columbia University Press. The original manuscript was the product of Wallis's doctoral research at Oxford under the tutelage of Bryan Wilson. Wallis, after a review of the original manuscript by Scientology leaders, made edits to about 100 passages before publication. In the book, Wallis first analyzes the degree to which the Church of Scientology views itself as legitimate, as well as to what degree external society regarded the organization as \\"respectable\\" or \\"deviant\\". Furthermore, he provides a contextual history of the organization, including a discussion of the Dianetics movement founded by L. Ron Hubbard. Next, Wallis discusses the appeal of the Scientology practice of Auditing, and compares this to abreaction therapy. And finally, he examines how Scientology shifted from a cult to a sect in structure, and analyzes the authoritarian nature of the management of the organization. While Wallis was researching the book, the Guardian's Office, Scientology's intelligence agency, investigated him. They assigned an individual as an undercover agent who pretended to be a student at Stirling University, where he was teaching. The agent inquired if Wallis was involved with illegal drugs. Wallis later discovered forged letters purportedly sent by him and designed to implicate him in controversial acts. Wallis assumed this was a reaction by the Guardian's Office to The Road to Total Freedom. The Road to Total Freedom received generally positive reception in book reviews and media coverage. The Encyclopedia of Religion and Society acknowledged Wallis \\"displayed characteristic skill\\" in bringing a large amount of information together in an analysis of Scientology. Similarly, Choice: Current Reviews for Academic Libraries described the author's research as \\"substantively important\\", and Library Journal called it \\"a sociological analysis for the serious student, with all the appropriate scholarly apparatus\\". Research Wallis completed his doctoral studies under Bryan Wilson at the University of Oxford. The author's research into new religious movements began in the 1970s with study of the Church of Scientology. He had performed research on the subject of Scientology for his doctoral thesis; this was later printed as The Road to Total Freedom in 1976. Wallis' study of Scientology also led to an article by Wallis in the Sociological Yearbook of Religion in Britain. The research began with an attempt at participant observation: Wallis enrolled at a \\"Communications Course\\" in Scientology's facility at Saint Hill Manor, but left after two days because he was not willing to lie about his reaction to the course content. To collect further data, Wallis circulated a survey by post and reviewed Scientology's extensive published material. He also interviewed current and former members, including Helen Parsons Smith, a former sister-in-law of Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard. After Wallis had finished the initial manuscript for The Road to Total Freedom, he provided representatives of Scientology leadership with a copy. Wallis negotiated with the Scientology leaders, and it was agreed upon that certain sections of the book would be edited. In total, approximately 100 sections of the book were edited due to input from Scientology leaders. This fact was not made public at the time of the book's publication. Content In the book, Wallis brings together a significant amount of information and presents an analysis of the church-sect structure which simultaneously exhibited a denomination-cult pattern. The book presents a critical analysis of Scientology. Wallis introduces an argument that individuals were intrigued by the Church of Scientology for two reasons: the level with which the organization viewed itself as a sincere structure, and the degree to which the external society saw Scientology as \\"respectable\\" as opposed to \\"deviant\\" in nature. The Road to Total Freedom begins with a history of Scientology, then explores it within a context of a belief system, organizational structure, and form of social control. Wallis then describes how Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard \\"asserted the originality of the entire theory and practice and acknowledges having been influenced only in a most general way by other writers\\". He next compares the Scientology practice of Auditing to that of abreaction therapy ‚Äì a process where repressed memories are unearthed, usually through hypnosis, to aid improving the mental well-being of a patient. The author goes on to explain how individuals were attracted to Dianetics, the precursor to Scientology. Wallis notes, \\"[Dianetics] offered a rationale for failure in social mobility and in social interaction. It provided an explanation in terms of traumatic incidents in which the individual had been unwittingly involved, and thereby relieved him of responsibility for his failure.\\" Scientologists who participated in a questionnaire for Wallis' research identified areas of their life that they hoped Scientology would improve, including: loneliness, financial difficulties, marital issues, other interpersonal relationships, psychological problems, and physical illness. Wallis describes Hubbard's thought process to turn his methodology of Dianetics into a religion, noting, \\"Hubbard's theory and techniques had been moving increasingly in this direction\\". Wallis notes how Scientology became a focus for those previously involved in the Dianetics movement. Wallis points out that Hubbard instructed members of Scientology not to immediately tell new followers about methodologies that might be less familiar to some, such as belief in the existence of prior lives. Wallis then continues his argument regarding the transitional period the organization underwent, and describes how Scientology has transformed from a cult to a sect, and explains patterns of membership and leaving the group. He delves into the structure of authoritarian managerial control of the organization, which is seen to have developed as a result of perceived problems in society. He characterizes the \\"Org\\" management system in Scientology as \\"an elaborate and imposing bureaucratic structure\\". Wallis describes a process referred to as \\"deviance amplification\\", and analyzes how individuals maintain perceptions of reality within a deviant belief system. He notes that individual believers in Scientology methodologies are kept within the organization by management techniques which shield members from external society. Wallis posits that exposure of members of the Church of Scientology to a reality external to the organization presents \\"a major challenge to the legitimacy or validity of their definition of reality\\". Unusually for a sociological study, the book features a rebuttal from a believing member of the organisation; a fellow sociologist called J. L. Simmons. He criticises many of Wallis' procedures and conclusions, saying that these alleged errors are \\"indicative of either a decline in scholastic method or are deliberate and malicious.\\" Simmons invites the reader to compare The Road to Total Freedom against Hubbard's Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health, asking which is more \\"alive and hopeful and scientifically objective\\". Scientology's response Author Stewart Lamont writes in Religion Inc. that while Wallis was researching the book, individuals from the Scientology intelligence agency called the Guardian's Office investigated the author. Alan E. Aldridge notes in his book Religion in the Contemporary World: A Sociological Introduction, \\"Roy Wallis gave graphic accounts of attempts by members of the Church of Scientology to discredit him personally and professionally, and to subvert or suppress his research findings.\\" An undercover agent for Scientology went to Stirling University, where Wallis was a teacher. The individual pretended to be a student, and asked Wallis if he was involved with illegal drugs. Wallis recognized the individual from the Scientology facility Saint Hill Manor, and the agent switched his cover and then asserted that he was actually a defector from Scientology. In a 1977 article in Doing Sociological Research titled \\"The Moral Career of a Research Project\\", Wallis details what occurred after this incident, \\"In the weeks following his visit a number of forged letters came to light, some of which were supposedly written by me. These letters sent to my university employers, colleagues and others, implicated me in a variety of acts from a homosexual love affair to spying for the drug squad. Because I had few enemies and because this attention followed so closely upon the receipt of my paper by the Church of Scientology organization, it did not seem too difficult to infer the source of these attempts to inconvenience me.\\" According to Lamont, as of the publication of Religion Inc. in 1986, \\"the book is now accepted by the Public Affairs office of the Church of Scientology as reasonable and fair\\", and he was provided a copy of the book from the organization itself. Reception In his book The Social Dimensions of Sectarianism: Sects and New Religious Movements in Contemporary Society, Wallis' former mentor Bryan R. Wilson described The Road to Total Freedom as \\"A thorough study of the early development and organization of Scientology\\". The Encyclopedia of Religion and Society noted that Wallis \\"displayed characteristic skill in assimilating and simplifying a large amount of diverse material into a parsimonious reworking of the classic church-sect typology\\". Writing in The Future of Religion: Secularization, Revival and Cult Formation, authors Rodney Stark and William Sims Bainbridge characterized the book as \\"the first major scholarly study of Scientology\\". A review in Religious Studies describes the book as \\"a convenient and in many respects convincing account of the history of Scientology.\\" However, it comments that Wallis \\"does not really succeed in the formidable task of giving the reader a rounded picture of what it is like to be a believing member of the Org[anisation]. His analysis, like its subject matter, is rather mechanical and follows a particular pattern.\\" The review observes that Wallis did not explore the parallels between Dianetics and B. F. Skinner's psychological theories, nor between the screening processes used in Scientology and in Communist China. It recommends that the book would have been more interesting if it had compared its subject with initiation rites, including those of Freemasonry. It dismisses as \\"facile\\" the book's background material on secularization and religious schisms. Choice: Current Reviews for Academic Libraries noted of the book's research, \\"The study is substantively important and theoretically grounded\\". The review noted the book had a \\"good bibliography\\", and concluded that the book be \\"recommended for academic libraries.\\" Library Journal compared the book to Scientology by author George Malko, but commented that The Road to Total Freedom is \\"a much more scholarly, documented work\\". Library Journal concluded, \\"The record ‚Äì often a chilling one ‚Äì speaks for itself. Not a polemic nor a popular treatment, this is a sociological analysis for the serious student, with all the appropriate scholarly apparatus.\\" A review in The Times Literary Supplement commented, \\"this is a most informative, candid and valuable book\\". Writing in Quill, published by the Society of Professional Journalists, Robert Vaughn Young commented, \\"Perhaps because this is a sociological study of Scientology, this is a cold, calm, academic dissection of the subject and Hubbard.\\" The California Court of Appeal cited the book as a reference in a decision relating to a criminal defendant who was a member of Scientology. When Wallis died in 1990, his obituary in The Independent noted that The Road to Total Freedom \\"still stands as a classic of good field research\\".

In Aesop's Fables there is a cautionary story, numbered 239 in the Perry Index, indicating that retribution is swift where the god is defied.Aesopica Oath- taking and the penalties for perjuring oneself played an important part in the Ancient Greek concept of justice. Divine retribution Hesiod's Theogony identifies Horkos as the son of Eris (\\"strife\\") and brother of various tribulations: Ponos (\\"Hardship\\"), Lethe (\\"Forgetfulness\\"), Limos (\\"Starvation\\"), Algae (\\"Pains\\"), Hysminai (\\"Battles\\"), Makhai (\\"Wars\\"), Phonoi (\\"Murders\\"), Androktasiai (Manslaughters\\"), Neikea (\\"Quarrels\\"), Pseudea (\\"Lies\\"), Logoi (\\"Stories\\"), Amphillogiai (\\"Disputes\\"), Dysnomia (\\"Anarchy\\"), and Ate (\\"Ruin\\").Richard Caldwell, Hesiod's Theogony, Focus Publishing/R. Pullins Company (June 1, 1987). . In his Works and Days, Hesiod states that the Erinyes (Furies) assisted at the birth of Horkos, \\"whom Eris bore, to be a plague on those who take false oath\\", and that the fifth of the month was especially dangerous as being the day on which he was born. However, according to the moral given in an ethical parable related by Aesop, there is no fixed day on which the god's punishment falls on the wicked. Aesop's fable concerns a man who had taken a deposit from a friend and, when asked to swear an oath regarding it, left the town hurriedly. A lame man whom he met told his fellow- traveller that he was Horkos on his way to track down wicked people. The man asked Horkos how often he returned to the city they were leaving. \\"I come back after forty years, or sometimes thirty,\\" Horkos replied. Believing himself to be free from danger, the man returned the following morning and swore that he had never received the deposit. Almost immediately, Horkos arrived to execute the perjurer by throwing him off a cliff. Protesting, the man asked why the god had said he was not coming back for years when in fact he did not grant even a day's reprieve. Horkos replied, \\"You should also know that if somebody intends to provoke me, I am accustomed to come back again the very same day.\\" Concepts of justice A 1610 depiction of a Fury from the Kunsthistorisches Museum A similar story was told by Herodotus and may even have been the fable's origin.Francisco Rodr√≠guez Adrados, History of the Graeco-Latin Fable Vol.3 , Brill 2003, pp.275-6 It concerned a man who asked the Delphic oracle‚Äôs advice about dishonouring such an oath and received the answer that he would profit for the moment but that it would bring about the destruction of him and his heirs - for Horkos has a son 'who is nameless and without hands or feet, swift in pursuit'. Nor can there be any repentance, for intent is no different from action.The History of Herodotus VI.86, pp.93-4 The severity of such justice underlines the importance of oath-taking in Ancient Greece, which was undertaken in the name of the gods. To perjure oneself meant waging war on the gods, who even themselves could suffer under the same sanctions.Everett L. Wheeler, \\"Sophistic interpretations and Greek treaties\\", Princeton University, October 1984 In taking an oath one called down a conditional curse on oneself, to take effect if one lied or broke one's promise.Sommerstein & Torrance, p.1 The lasting nature of this curse, and the corresponding benefit of honouring one's word, is also emphasised by Hesiod in discussing the matter: \\"Whoever wilfully swears a false oath, telling a lie in his testimony, he himself is incurably hurt at the same time as he harms Justice, and in after times his family is left more obscure, whereas the family of the man who keeps his oath is better in after times.\\"Hesiod, Works and Days 282-5 In later times, the role of bringing justice for broken oaths was undertaken by the Furies, specified by Hesiod as the midwives at the birth of Horkos. Justice was also under the protection of the King of the gods, who in this aspect is referred to as Zeus Horkios (guardian of oaths); in circumstances where other divine entities were named, they too took responsibility for retribution.Sommerstein & Torrance, pp.295-9 References *Alan H.

Types =Internal= Internal photographic lens controllers take information from the camera or lens elements and perform automatic and manual focusing and aperture adjustment. They are frequently contained inside as part of a modern zoom lens and used mainly for photography. =Stand- alone= Stand-alone lens controllers are attached to a photographic lens by a cable to allow operator manual control of lens functions. =Machine vision, CCTV, and computer vision= Lens controllers for machine vision are universal devices designed to control lenses from multiple manufacturers. Although there is no standard for wiring of lenses most have direct current (DC) motors attached to lens elements and are controlled with ¬±6 VDC, ¬±8 VDC or ¬±12 VDC. Machine vision lens controllers come in manual or computerized varieties. Manual lens controllers are composed of switches and a power supply. When the operator actuates a switch, a function of the lens is enabled. Manual control requires an operator to view the image through the lens in which adjustment is taking place. Manual lens controllers are the most common and are frequently used in CCTV security systems. Computerized lens controllers are composed of a computer, electronic switches such as H-Bridges or relays, a power supply, and an electronic interface. A remote computer sends a command to the lens controller through an RS232, RS485, USB, or Ethernet interface to actuate a lens function. The lens controller will then perform the command automatically. If a lens is equipped with presets, potentiometers attached to lens components that measure the position of that function, then the controller can work in a closed loop and move to a specific position. If the lens is not equipped with presets, then the controller can only move a lens function to an approximate position.

Supercell had originally released a d≈çjin (independent) version at Comiket 74 on August 16, 2008, before the band signed a record deal with Sony Music. The album contains twelve music tracks written by Ryo and the singing synthesizer Hatsune Miku was used to provide the vocals. The major release of the album featured two songs not on the independent (indie) version, \\"Melt\\" and \\"Hajimete no Koi ga Owaru Toki\\", but which had already previously been released online and on the Nico Nico Douga video sharing website. All of the music on the indie release was remixed and remastered for the major release to greatly improve the sound quality. The album was released in limited and regular editions, each containing a bonus DVD containing music videos for four of the songs, but only the limited edition came bundled with a special illustration booklet titled Supercell Works; the indie release also came with the booklet. Supercell peaked at No. 4 on the Japanese Oricon weekly albums chart, and in June 2009 was awarded a Gold Disc by the Recording Industry Association of Japan for having exceeded 100,000 copies shipped in a single year. Production Original recordings of songs on Supercell date back to the release of the song \\"Melt\\" online on the Nico Nico Douga video sharing website on December 7, 2007. Composer and lyricist Ryo used the Vocaloid singing synthesizer software Hatsune Miku for the vocals and continued to use the program for the remaining songs on the album. The video of \\"Melt\\" posted online used an illustration of Miku without the permission of the drawing's illustrator 119 (pronounced Hikeshi). After Ryo contacted 119 with an apology, 119 responded with great interest in \\"Melt\\" and began to work together with Ryo, thus forming Supercell. Supercell continued to gain members‚Äîincluding the illustrators Shirow Miwa, Redjuice, and Huke‚Äîand released three more songs online in 2008: \\"Koi wa Sens≈ç\\" on February 22, \\"World is Mine\\" on May 31, and \\"Black Rock Shooter\\" on June 13. Ryo continued to be the sole member involved in musical composition and the writing of lyrics, while the other members provided illustrations, animation, design, and photography in album booklets, cases, and music videos. At Comiket 74 on August 16, 2008, Supercell released a d≈çjin (independent) version of Supercell containing the three songs released earlier that year, in addition to seven previously unreleased songs; \\"Melt\\" was not included on the indie release. The album also came with a DVD containing music videos for three of the songs. On December 12, 2008, Supercell released \\"Hajimete no Koi ga Owaru Toki\\" on Nico Nico Douga, and was the last song Supercell posted on the website. By that time, Supercell had signed a record deal with Sony Music, which announced plans to re-release Supercell in March 2009 with remastered tracks to greatly improve the sound quality of the music, as well as plans to include \\"Melt\\" and \\"Hajimete no Koi ga Owaru Toki\\" on the album. With the exception of the synthesized percussion used in the songs, the five songs originally released online, and the songs on the album's indie version, are substantially different compared to the major release. Like the indie version, the album would come bundled with a DVD containing music videos for four of the songs, including the six music videos previously released with the indie version, plus three more. By the time Supercell made its major debut, the group contained 11 members, not including 119 who left the group after the indie release of Supercell. =Composition= Supercell boasts a diversity of subjects and themes in regards to the lyrics and musical style. \\"Koi wa Sens≈ç\\" (literally \\"Love is War\\") uses the concept of never giving up in regards to love, and was composed with the intention of it being the first track on the album. Ryo wanted the song to have a \\"cool\\" feeling, and cited The White Stripes' \\"Blue Orchid\\" as an influence, as it too is the first song on their fifth album Get Behind Me Satan. Ryo began writing the lyrics for \\"Koi wa Sens≈ç\\" on New Year's Day 2008, and by mid-January, the song's composition was also complete. \\"Sono Ichiby≈ç Slow Motion\\" (literally \\"That One Second Slow Motion\\") features the concept of love at first sight‚Äîspecifically the single moment when this occurs; for all the songs on the album, Ryo described the song as a typical pop song he would create. Ryo experimented with other music genres, such as using the image of a \\"garage band's vigorous performance\\" for \\"Usotsuki no Parade\\" (literally \\"Liar Parade\\"). \\"Heartbreaker\\" was written to sound like a song from a somewhat old- fashioned band, and the aim for \\"Hinekuremono\\" (literally \\"A Rebel\\") was to make an oldies-like feeling song. Like \\"Koi wa Sens≈ç\\", powerful emotions are used as a concept in other songs, such as \\"Melt\\", which is described as a song that depicts a vibrant, trembling girl's emotions; or \\"World is Mine\\", which uses the concept of a selfish, but cute girl. \\"Parting\\" is used as the theme in \\"Hajimete no Koi ga Owaru Toki\\" (literally \\"When My First Love Ends\\") and was written to tell the story of an unrequited love. Ryo took about half a day to compose \\"Hajimete no Koi ga Owaru Toki\\", leaving the mixing and arrangement to take the most time. In contrast to the other songs, \\"Kurukuru Mark no Sugoi Yatsu\\" was written with a different impression where Ryo wanted to convey the fun of a comical song. For the song \\"Black Rock Shooter\\", Ryo was inspired by an illustration of an original character by Huke and created the song based on that character. When writing lyrics for the songs on Supercell, Ryo felt that writing without hesitation based on his initial ideas with minimal editing was best, because the singer, as a computer program, would not feel embarrassed about singing the lyrics. Ryo found it difficult at first with writing lyrics for songs meant to be sung by young women. He admitted that his friends would laugh when he played the songs, but he thought that \\"if a 16-year-old girl is supposed to be singing...it is best if she sings about romance.\\" In addition to Ryo using a synthesizer as the main musician, guitarist Okiya Okoshi and bass guitarist Miruku \\"Hime\\" Kokumaro are credited on the songs \\"Line\\" and \\"Sono Ichiby≈ç Slow Motion\\". Furthermore, Sariya provided the inhalation of breath for these two songs in order to make the vocals seem more authentic. Ryo cited an unnamed friend as providing the guitar in \\"World is Mine\\" and \\"Hajimete no Koi ga Owaru Toki\\". The major release of Supercell was mixed by Keiji Kondo, Yasuo Matsumoto, and Okuda Supa; Hidekazu Sakai provided the mastering. =Artwork= The limited edition of the major release of Supercell, as well as the indie version, came bundled with a 36-page illustration booklet titled Supercell Works. The booklet contains color illustrations for ten of the songs, as well as comments by the illustrators, an interview of Ryo, and other details about the songs and artwork, including lyrics. The two songs \\"Hajimete no Koi ga Owaru Toki\\" and \\"Mata ne\\" are excluded from the booklet. The albums' packaging, designed by Yoshiki Usa, includes the song lyrics and some of the illustrations featured in Supercell Works, but while the lyrics for \\"Mata ne\\" are included, no illustration is provided. The illustrators for the songs are members of Supercell (excluding the artist 119 who is a former member) and are listed below with the track listing. The cover art features an illustration of Hatsune Miku by Shirow Miwa on a cloudy sky background designed by Maque. Release and reception Supercell was released in limited and regular editions on March 4, 2009 as a CD, bundled with a DVD containing music videos for four of the songs, by Sony Music in Japan. For the week of March 3, 2009 on the Japanese Oricon daily albums chart, Supercell was reported to have sold approximately 20,000 copies on the first day of its release, peaking at No. 2. For the week of March 16, 2009 on Oricon's weekly albums chart, Supercell was reported to have sold about 56,000 copies in its first week of sales, peaking at No. 4, and charted for 40 weeks. This was a record for Hatsune Miku-related albums, having beaten out the previous record holder Re:package (2008) by Livetune, which peaked at No. 5. By the week of March 30, 2009 on Oricon's weekly albums chart, Supercell was reported to have sold over 70,000 copies, and ranked at No. 24. Furthermore, for the week of April 6, 2009 on Oricon's weekly albums chart, Supercell ranked at No. 36, along with three other Hatsune Miku-related albums: Re:Mikus by Livetune (No. 18), Unformed by Doriko (No. 26), and Exit Tunes Presents Vocarhythm feat. Hatsune Miku by Super Producers (No. 96). \\"World is Mine\\" was also ranked No. 3 on the Billboard US World Digital Song Sales Chart in October 2011. In June 2009, Supercell was awarded a Gold Disc by the Recording Industry Association of Japan for having exceeded 100,000 copies shipped in a single year. The sell ratio of those who reserved Supercell online was reported by the Asahi Shimbun to be 55%/45% for men/women. The album's producer Kazumitsu Shimizu stated that while it is not rare for something related to Japanese Internet culture to typically have a 90% support from males, the female support for the album was described as \\"very strong\\".

The M31 HEAT is a fin-stabilized anti-tank rifle grenade designed in the late 1950s to replace the Belgian ENERGA rifle grenade which was adopted by the US Army and US Marines as an emergency stop-gap measure during the Korean War. Like the ENERGA, it has a nose-initiated, based-detonated HEAT warhead, but unlike the ENERGA, the mechanical impact fuse system is replaced with a less complex and more reliable piezo-electric fuse system which also allows higher angles of impact, up to 65 degrees. History The M31 was originally designed to be fired only from the M1 Garand, but could also be fired from both the M14 and M16 rifles.http://www.dtic.mil/cgi- bin/GetTRDoc?Location=U2&doc;=GetTRDoc.pdf&AD;=AD0458570  Limited Range Test of the M16 Rifle with Eight Types of Rifle and Hand Grenades. By Dewey Calfee. January 1965. Directorate of Armament Development 4, Research and Technology Division, Air Force Systems Command, Eglin Air Force Base, Florida To launch the M31, a detachable spigot-type grenade launcher (M7A3 launcher for M1 rifle, and M76 launcher for the M14 rifle) is fitted to the muzzle of the rifle. A M3 ballistic cartridge (two are supplied in the packing container with each grenade and are crimped to indicate the cartridges are only for launching rifle grenades) is loaded into the rifle's chamber. The hollow tail unit of the rifle grenade is fitted over the grenade launcher.Jane's Infantry Weapon's System 1976, page 452, Watts Publishing Official military manuals recommend that the M31 HEAT be fired from either the standing or kneeling position and that it is only accurate against armored vehicles if fired at extremely close ranges. While claimed to be effective against main battle tanks (except in frontal engagements) and lightly armored vehicles when first introduced, in 1972 the US Army stated in its revised anti-armor warfare manual that the M31 HEAT was only effective against light tanks and thin- skinned vehicles.FM 23-3 Tactics, Techniques and Concept of Antiarmor Warfare, page 14, published US Army August 1972 Design On impact, the nose cover collapses, crushing a crystal-like material, which sends an electric current through a separate wire to the warhead's detonator, located in the base of the warhead. A mechanical safety, comprising a set back system located in the warhead's base, grounds the firing circuit and prevents the accidental explosion of the warhead. On firing, the sudden launch acceleration causes the set-back's three disks to rotate 90 degrees, each in succession to the other, with the rotation of the third disk removing the grounding after approximately 10 meters of flight and completing a firing circuit for the current to flow from the nose to the detonator in the base. Compared to the ENERGA, the M31 is slightly lighter in weight and has a smaller-diameter warhead‚Äîi.e. 75mm vs 66mm. Penetration for the M31 is estimated to be 200 mm / 8 inches for steel armor plating US Army publication September 30, 1977 \\"FM-7 The Mechanized Infantry Platoon/Squad Section B-21\\" specification for M72A2 LAW variant which uses a warhead almost identical to the M31 HEATNote - before the publication of FM-7 September 1977, various penetration specifications were given for the M72A2 and the M31 HEAT. Anywhere from 250mm to 305mm. In the mid 1970s the US Army decided in field test to truly determine the armour penetration under battlefield conditions again Russian tanks captured in 1973. The result was 200 mm (8 inches) the proceeding penetration specification is stated as it appears in FM-7 1977. and twice that estimate for concrete. The warhead technology developed for the M31 was used for the future M72 LAW antitank rocket. =Status= Various US military manuals issued in 1972 still had sections on the M31, but by the end of the Vietnam War, both the US Army and US Marines had essentially phased out muzzle-launched rifle grenades, in favor of the M72 LAW disposable rocket in the anti-armor role and the M203 under- barrel grenade launcher in the squad fire-support role. In the 1977 revision of US military anti-armor warfare manuals, the M31 HEAT was no longer listed.One of the reasons was that, with the phase-out of the heavier 7.62mm assault rifles for the lighter 5.56mm assault rifles, they no longer had an infantry weapon that could launch a heavy antitank rifle grenade The 2001 U.S. Army TM 43-0001-29 C2, \\"Data Sheets for Grenades\\" details the Grenade, Rifle, HEAT M31 on pages 3-3 and 3-4 with DODIC ordering codes.

The European Transportation Carrier (ETC) transports various payload items, such as commissioning items, science instruments, consumables, orbital support equipment, orbital replacement units, and resupply items, and science items, such as containers. This applies especially to European payload items that cannot be launched in their payload's rack due to limited stowage and transportation capabilities. On orbit, the ETC serves as a workbench and stowage facility, supporting the Biolab, Fluid Science Laboratory (FSL), European Physiology Module (EPM), and European Drawer Rack (EDR). Since its first use in the Columbus laboratory, the ETC has been used as a transport rack within the multi-purpose logistics module (MPLM). It allows for regular supply and return of all experiment and service items needed for continuous operation of the European payload facilities inside the Columbus module. The ETC can carry up to 410 kg (881 lb) of payload and experiment items, accommodated in standardized cargo transfer bags (CTBs). They are compatible with the ISS standards for transport in the MPLM and Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV) and the use on board the ISS partner modules like Destiny, Kibo, and Columbus. The ETC is equipped with six rigged stowage containers in optimized sizes. There are two smaller containers of 6 PU (1 PU = Panel Unit = 44‚Äì45 mm in height) for full and half-sized CTBs and four 12 PU containers that can be filled with any combination of CTBs, up to triple size. In addition, the ETC is equipped with three zero-gravity stowage pockets, one on the bottom and two on the top. These pockets extend the stowage volume capacity to 1000 l instead of the standard 800 l, but can be used and filled only in weightlessness.

The International Exhibition of Science, Art and Industry was the first of 4 international exhibitions held in Glasgow, Scotland during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It took place at Kelvingrove Park between May and November 1888. The main aim of the exhibition was to draw international attention to the city's achievements in applied sciences, industry and the arts during the Industrial Revolution. However, it was also hoped the Exhibition would raise enough money for a much-needed museum, art gallery and school of art in the city. The exhibition was opened by the Prince of Wales, as honorary president of the exhibition, on 8 May 1888. It was the greatest exhibition held outside London and the largest ever in Scotland during the 19th century. Design The buildings for the Exhibition were designed by competition winning Glaswegian architect James Sellars. Sellars decided on an oriental style which \\"lends itself readily to execution in wood.\\" The buildings were however temporary, and consideration had to be given to ease of dismantling them once the exhibition was over. The Main Building, which housed most of the exhibits, occupied an area of Kelvingrove Park between the River Kelvin and Sandyford Street which is now on the route of Sauchiehall Street. It featured a 170 ft high Dome erected on an iron framework covered in galvanised sheet iron. Four octagonal supporting towers around the Dome were made of brick, with minarets on top. Exhibits =Industrial= The Doulton Fountain Detail from the Doulton Fountain Scottish firms accounted for two-thirds of the exhibitors at the International Exhibition of 1888, with many Glasgow firms featuring prominently. The majority of the third that came from outwith Scotland were from England, with London providing the largest number, followed by Lancashire and Yorkshire. India and Canada were the principal origin of non-British exhibitors. Of the seventy firms from outwith the British Empire, most were from France, Germany, Italy and the USA. One of the main British commercial exhibitors was Doulton & Co, who presented the massive terracotta Doulton Fountain to the city after the International Exhibition of 1888. Originally situated in Kelvingrove Park during the exhibition, it was later moved to Glasgow Green in 1890. At 46 ft high, with its outer basin measuring 70 ft in diameter, it remains the biggest fountain of its kind in the world. =Recreation= More populist attractions which were intended to broaden the exhibition's appeal to the public were kept separate from the main academic and industrial exhibits, sited in an area between the University of Glasgow and the west bank of the River Kelvin. One of the most popular attractions was a switchback railway. Other popular attractions included a shooting gallery, a captive air balloon and regular musical performances by bands. Sports events such as football matches, cycle racing and highland games were held in the adjacent University Athletics Ground. The River Kelvin itself was an important feature at the International Exhibition of 1888. It was specially deepened and cleaned for the occasion. Exhibition goers could take trips on the river in electric and steam-powered launches as well as on a gondola imported from Venice. The latter proved particularly popular, as were the two gondoliers, nicknamed \\"Signor Hokey\\" and \\"Signor Pokey\\". Impact When the Exhibition closed in November 1888, the final attendance figure was 5,748,379. A profit of ¬£43,000 was further evidence of the Exhibition's success, with the money going towards the construction of the Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum, which functioned as the Palace of Fine Arts for the subsequent Glasgow International Exhibition, also held at Kelvingrove Park, in 1901.

Retrieved 2020-02-05. Neither his father nor his foster family encouraged his interest in music; however, he was able to prevail upon his foster parents to allow him to take lessons from the cantor at the local synagogue. At age 12 he was adopted by his grandfather, who moved with him to Solovio, where he continued his training under Cantor Dorfman. In 1904 he was appointed to the post of hazzan in Zhitomir, but he stayed there for only a few months before he was offered a position as assistant hazzan of Vilna. After several years the principal hazzan died and Hershman was appointed to the position. During World War I, Hershman was drafted into the Russian Army. Legend has it that his commanding officer was so impressed by his tenor voice that he released him from his duties. After the war, Hershman returned to his post in Vilna. The community granted him leave to lead the services on only two Sabbaths a month so that he could tour and give concerts for the rest of the time. Hershman appeared throughout Europe, singing both liturgical works and operatic arias. In 1920, Hershman emigrated to the United States, where he took up the position as chief hazzan at the Beth El Temple in Brooklyn, New York. He held that post for ten years. During his time at Beth El Temple and afterwards, he toured throughout America, Europe, and Palestine. As was customary for noted hazzanim of the time, Hershman released several records of cantorial and Jewish folk music. Hershman died in 1940. Hershman's voice Hershman ranks among the great cantors of the golden age of Jewish cantorial music at the start of the twentieth century. His mellow tenor voice thrilled his audiences, and his cantorial arias have become classics of the Ashkenazic cantorial repertoire. Some of his most famous melodies are \\"Aylu Devarim\\", \\"Akavia ben Mahalael\\" and \\"Modim Anachnu Lecha\\". In addition to liturgical material, Hershman also recorded Yiddish songs and opera selections. Many of his liturgical recordings were composed by the noted composer Yaakov (Jacob) Rapoport. Hershman himself did not compose music. In 1925, Pinchas Yasinovski composed a piece for Hershman entitled \\"At the end of days\\" (\\"Vehaya Beacharit Hayamim\\"), for the inauguration of the Hebrew University campus at Mount Scopus, near Jerusalem. The text is from the Book of Isaiah and the tune is based on traditional cantillation notes. Hershman recorded the piece in the United States, accompanied by strings and wind instruments, and it is considered one of his finest recordings.

He, and his son, held the office of rannair--a distributor of the food and provisions--to the King of Scots. Over the years, some historians have suggested that he was an ancestor of the Earls of Lennox; some made him the first earl, others made him a male-line ancestor of the first earl, another suggestion is that he is an ancestor of the first earl in the female-line. Biography David I, and young Malcolm IV, illustrated in a mid-12th-century charter. =Various names= Alwyn MacArchill appears in numerous contemporary sources during the reigns of David I and Malcolm IV.Jackson 1972: pp. 63-66. Historian G. W. S. Barrow noted that nineteen acts of David I were witnessed by Alwyn MacArchill. The 20th-century linguist Kenneth Hurlstone Jackson noted numerous sources and stated that his name appears four times as Alfwin; once as Alfwin; six times as Alwyn; and once as Algune (in the Book of Deer). Jackson stated that his father's name is recorded as: Arkil three times; Archill three times; Archil thirteen times; Arcill once (in the Book of Deer); and Arch- once. Jackson noted that his father's name, Arkil, an Old Danish name; and that the name Alfwin represents the Old English name √Ülfwine, although in England the name appears to have been borrowed into Old Danish as early as the 11th century. =Ancestry= It has been suggested that Alwyn's father may have been a Northumbrian noble. Jackson, however, disagreed with this proposal. He believed that the evidence of the names showed that he was of Anglo-Danish descent. Jackson noted that there is a charter in the reign of David I which mentions a man named Arkil who had lands between Haddington and Athelstaneford. If this man was the father of Alwyn, it would mean Alwyn had East Lothian connections. =Life= In one contemporary record his wife, Ede, is recorded. Barrow stated that he was in turn succeeded by his son, Gilleandrais the rannair. Barrow stated that Alwyn MacArchill was probably the man portrayed by Ailred of Rievaulx's biographer Walter Daniel, as \\"the jealous and foul-mouthed caluminator of Ailread who nevertheless repented of his hostility, became Ailread's friend, and was consequently promoted by the king. Barrow noted how Daniel wrote that Ailread stood at the king's table as chief steward, and served the dishes and divided the food for those present; Barrow stated that this would have been precisely the duties of Alfwin the rannair (the Gaelic rannair, means \\"sharer\\", \\"divider\\", i.e. 'the distributor of the food and provisions'). Barrow noted that Sir Maurice Powicke thought that Ailread's enemy was Walter, son of Alan.Barrow 1999: pp. 21, 35. Ancestor of the Earls of Lennox? Arms of the mediaeval Earls of Lennox. =In the male-line= It has been thought that the Earls of Lennox were descendants in the male line, of Alwyn MacArchill, and his father Archill. The 19th-century historian William Forbes Skene stated that this theory was first produced in 1716, by George Crawfurd. According to Sir James Balfour Paul, the theory of this descent was later elaborated by Sir Robert Douglas, and further expanded by Sir William Fraser. The theory was that Alwyn I, Earl of Lennox was identical to the Alwyn MacArchill, who appears as a witness on numerous charters of David I, down to at least the year 1154. This man's father was thought to have been Archillus, son of Aykfrith; and to have been a Northumbrian magnate, who was an exile of William the Conqueror. It was thought that this Archill/Archillus went to Scotland in 1070, where he received lands in the Lennox. Skene, however, stated that there was nothing to support this theory, other than the similarity in names. Alwyn MacArchill never appears in records with a title of earl; and that he does not appear in records after the year 1155, yet Alwyn I first appears in record in 1193. Between 1155 and 1193, Skene stated, the earldom of Lennox was in the possession of David, Earl of Huntingdon. Also, Paul noted that the mediaeval English chronicler Simeon of Durham only notes that Archill was made an exile; he does not mention him passing into Scotland.Paul 1908: pp. 324-326. Paul also noted another theory, which made the earls \\"Celtic\\" in the male line. This made Alwyn I, the son of Muireadhach, who was possibly a Mormaer of Lennox himself. For example, the 13th-century bard Muireadhach Albanach, employed for some time by the Lennox family, wrote a poem which outlined their ancestry which included Muireadhach. Paul followed this theory in his The Scots Peerage. This poem takes the male line ancestors of Alwyn I back several generations, According to Jackson, the genealogy is probably only reliable as far back as Muireadhach's father, Maol- Domhnaigh. William Buchanan of Auchmar also stated that Alwyn MacArchill was the ancestor of the earls, yet gave him a different ancestry. Buchanan stated that \\"Aluin MacArkill\\" was \\"a great favourite at court\\" during the reigns of David I and Malcolm IV. He was the son of Arkill, a contemporary of the Scots kings Edgar and Alexander I, and a person of note during their reigns. Buchanan stated that Arkill was the son of \\"Aluin, or Alcuin\\", a younger son of Kenneth III.Buchanan of Auchmar 1775: pp. 111-113. =In the female-line= It has also been suggested that Alwyn MacArchill is an ancestor of the Earls of Lennox in the female line. The first Earl of Lennox on record had Gaelic name Al√∫in, Ail√≠n. Muireadhach Albanach's poem states that his mother (who is unnamed) was the daughter of an Ail√≠n. The chronology could allow that this man could be Alwyn MacArchill. This could mean that the first earl's name could have been the Old English/Old Danish name assimilated into Gaelic.

In the first weeks of March 1933, there were 11,000 Communists arrested and by June 1933, more than half of the KPD district leaders were in detention.  Arrest and further resistance  Uhrig was arrested by the Gestapo in 1934 and sentenced to hard labor at the Zuchthaus in Luckau. After his release in summer 1936, he went underground, working in the leadership of the Berlin KPD. Starting in 1938, he led a network of resistance groups in over 20 factories in Berlin, which became part of one of the largest anti-fascist resistance organizations in Berlin. Through his relationships with Wilhelm Guddorf, John Sieg and others, he was in regular contact with the Red Orchestra and with groups in Hamburg, Mannheim, Leipzig, Munich and elsewhere. Starting in 1940-1941, he also worked extensively with Beppo R√∂mer. Around this period, he was regarded as the leader of KPD resistance in Berlin.

Woman with a Hat, 1905. San Francisco Museum of Modern Art Fauvism /f ävism/ is the style of les Fauves (French for \\"the wild beasts\\"), a group of early 20th-century modern artists whose works emphasized painterly qualities and strong color over the representational or realistic values retained by Impressionism. While Fauvism as a style began around 1904 and continued beyond 1910, the movement as such lasted only a few years, 1905‚Äì1908, and had three exhibitions.John Elderfield, The \\"Wild Beasts\\" Fauvism and Its Affinities, 1976, Museum of Modern Art, p.13, Freeman, Judi, et al., The Fauve Landscape, 1990, Abbeville Press, p. 13, . The leaders of the movement were Andr√© Derain and Henri Matisse. Artists and style Press clipping, Les Fauves: Exhibition at the Salon d'Automne, in L'Illustration, 4 November 1905 Besides Matisse and Derain, other artists included Albert Marquet, Charles Camoin, Louis Valtat, Jean Puy, Maurice de Vlaminck, Henri Manguin, Raoul Dufy, Othon Friesz, Georges Rouault, Jean Metzinger, Kees van Dongen and Georges Braque (subsequently Picasso's partner in Cubism). The paintings of the Fauves were characterized by seemingly wild brush work and strident colors, while their subject matter had a high degree of simplification and abstraction.Tate (2007). Glossary: Fauvism. Retrieved on 2007-12-19, Fauvism, Tate Fauvism can be classified as an extreme development of Van Gogh's Post-Impressionism fused with the pointillism of Seurat and other Neo-Impressionist painters, in particular Paul Signac. Other key influences were Paul C√©zanneFreeman, 1990, p. 15. and Paul Gauguin, whose employment of areas of saturated color‚Äînotably in paintings from Tahiti‚Äîstrongly influenced Derain's work at Collioure in 1905.Teitel, Alexandra J.

They are yellow. So, put in yellow; this shadow, rather blue, paint it with pure ultramarine; these red leaves? Put in vermilion.\\" Fauvism has been compared to Expressionism, both in its use of pure color and unconstrained brushwork. Some of the Fauves were among the first avant-garde artists to collect and study African and Oceanic art, alongside other forms of non-Western and folk art, leading several Fauves toward the development of Cubism.Joshua I. Cohen, \\"Fauve Masks: Rethinking Modern 'Primitivist' Uses of African and Oceanic Art, 1905-8.\\" The Art Bulletin 99, no. 2 (June 2017): 136-65. Origins Andr√© Derain, 1906, Charing Cross Bridge, London, National Gallery of Art, Washington, DC. Gustave Moreau was the movement's inspirational teacher;Freeman, p. 243 a controversial professor at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts in Paris and a Symbolist painter, he taught Matisse, Marquet, Manguin, Rouault and Camoin during the 1890s, and was viewed by critics as the group's philosophical leader until Matisse was recognized as such in 1904. Moreau's broad-mindedness, originality and affirmation of the expressive potency of pure color was inspirational for his students.Dempsey, Amy (2002). Styles, Schools and Movements: An Encyclopedic Guide to Modern Art, pp. 66-69, London: Thames & Hudson Ltd. Matisse said of him, \\"He did not set us on the right roads, but off the roads. He disturbed our complacency.\\" This source of empathy was taken away with Moreau's death in 1898, but the artists discovered other catalysts for their development. In 1896, Matisse, then an unknown art student, visited the artist John Russell on the island of Belle √éle off the coast of Brittany.\\"Book talk: The Unknown Matisse...\\", ABC Radio National, interview with Hilary Spurling, 8 June 2005. Retrieved 1 January 2008. Russell was an Impressionist painter; Matisse had never previously seen an Impressionist work directly, and was so shocked at the style that he left after ten days, saying, \\"I couldn't stand it any more.\\" The next year he returned as Russell's student and abandoned his earth-colored palette for bright Impressionist colors, later stating, \\"Russell was my teacher, and Russell explained color theory to me.\\" Russell had been a close friend of Vincent van Gogh and gave Matisse a Van Gogh drawing.

In parallel with the artists' discovery of contemporary avant-garde art came an appreciation of pre-Renaissance French art, which was shown in a 1904 exhibition, French Primitives. Another aesthetic influence was African sculpture, of which Vlaminck, Derain and Matisse were early collectors. Many of the Fauve characteristics first cohered in Matisse's painting, Luxe, Calme et Volupt√© (\\"Luxury, Calm and Pleasure\\"), which he painted in the summer of 1904, while he was in Saint-Tropez with Paul Signac and Henri-Edmond Cross. Salon d'Automne 1905 Henri Rousseau, The Hungry Lion Throws Itself on the Antelope, 1905, oil on canvas, 200 cm √ó 301 cm, Beyeler Foundation, Basel After viewing the boldly colored canvases of Henri Matisse, Andr√© Derain, Albert Marquet, Maurice de Vlaminck, Kees van Dongen, Charles Camoin, and Jean Puy at the Salon d'Automne of 1905, the critic Louis Vauxcelles disparaged the painters as \\"fauves\\" (wild beasts), thus giving their movement the name by which it became known, Fauvism. The artists shared their first exhibition at the 1905 Salon d'Automne. The group gained their name after Vauxcelles described their show of work with the phrase \\"Donatello chez les fauves\\" (\\"Donatello among the wild beasts\\"), contrasting their \\"orgy of pure tones\\" with a Renaissance-style sculpture by Albert Marque that shared the room with them.Louis Vauxcelles, Le Salon d'Automne, Gil Blas, 17 October 1905.

Henri Rousseau was not a Fauve, but his large jungle scene The Hungry Lion Throws Itself on the Antelope was exhibited near Matisse's work and may have had an influence on the pejorative used.Smith, Roberta (2006). \\"Henri Rousseau: In imaginary jungles, a terrible beauty lurks\\" The New York Times, 14 July 2006. Accessed 29 December 2007 Vauxcelles' comment was printed on 17 October 1905 in Gil Blas, a daily newspaper, and passed into popular usage.Elderfield, p.43 The pictures gained considerable condemnation‚Äî\\"A pot of paint has been flung in the face of the public\\", wrote the critic Camille Mauclair (1872‚Äì1945)‚Äîbut also some favorable attention. The painting that was singled out for attacks was Matisse's Woman with a Hat; this work's purchase by Gertrude and Leo Stein had a very positive effect on Matisse, who was suffering demoralization from the bad reception of his work. Matisse's Neo- Impressionist landscape, Luxe, Calme et Volupt√©, had already been exhibited at the Salon des Ind√©pendants in the spring of 1905.Salon d'automne; Soci√©t√© du Salon d'automne, Catalogue des ouvrages de peinture, sculpture, dessin, gravure, architecture et art d√©coratif.

The centerpiece of the exhibition was Matisse's monumental Le Bonheur de Vivre (The Joy of Life). Critics were horrified by its flatness, bright colors, eclectic style and mixed technique.Russell T.

Nasr's first entry into the Egyptian art scene happened in 1995 when he entered his work in a competition organized by the Egyptian Ministry of Culture and received third prize. However, he was criticized by fellow artists for being an \\"outsider\\" to the art scene, having not studied it academically. Art career Nasr broke into the international art scene in 2001 when one of the leading Italian art galleries, Galleria Continua, exhibited his work. Nasr has participated in many exhibitions since and has won many awards including: third place in the 7th Salon of Youth, a contest organized by the Ministry of Culture in 1995, the Prize of Painting in the Heliorama exhibition from the French Cultural center in Cairo in 1997, the Grand Prize in the 8th International Cairo Biennale in 2001, the Biennale Prize from Dakar Biennale in Senegal in 2002, the Ministry of Culture Prize, Dak‚Äôart Biennale, Dakar, Senegal in 2004 and the Grand Prize, Sharjah Bienniale, UAE in 2005. In November 2008, Nasr founded Darb 1718. Darb 1718 is an Egyptian contemporary art and culture center located in the Fustat area of Old Cairo. It is a registered non-profit organization with the stated mission of being \\"a trampoline to advance the burgeoning contemporary art movement in Egypt.\\" It also aims at presenting local and international contemporary art, archiving artwork and maintaining a comprehensive database of art in Egypt and the MENA area, as well as acting as an educational front by providing workshops, projects and film screenings. The center also aims to engage the local Fustat community through community service and outreach programs.

It was first identified as a conserved sequence region in 1997 and named after cystathionine beta synthase, one of the proteins it is found in. CBS domains are also found in a wide variety of other proteins such as inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase, voltage gated chloride channels and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). CBS domains regulate the activity of associated enzymatic and transporter domains in response to binding molecules with adenosyl groups such as AMP and ATP, or s-adenosylmethionine.  Structure  The CBS domain is composed of a beta- alpha-beta-beta-alpha secondary structure pattern that is folded into a globular tertiary structure that contains a three-stranded antiparallel Œ≤-sheet with two Œ±-helices on one side. CBS domains are always found in pairs in protein sequences and each pair of these domains tightly associate in a pseudo dimeric arrangement through their Œ≤-sheets forming a so-called CBS-pair or Bateman domain. These CBS domain pairs can associate in a head-to-head (i.e. PDB codes , , ) or a head-to-tail (i.e. PDB codes , ) manner forming a disk-like compact structure. By doing so, they form clefts that constitute the canonical ligand binding regions. In principle, the number of canonical binding sites matches the number of CBS domains within the molecule and are traditionally numbered according to the CBS domain that contains each of the conserved aspartate residues that potentially interact with the ribose of the nucleotides. However, not all of these cavities might necessarily bind nucleotides or be functional. Recently, a non-canonical site for AMP has also been described in protein MJ1225 from M. jannaschii, though its functional role is still unknown. center  Ligand binding  It has been shown that CBS domains bind to adenosyl groups in molecules such as AMP and ATP, or s-adenosylmethionine, but they may also bind metallic ions such as Mg2+. Upon binding these different ligands the CBS domains regulate the activity of associated enzymatic domains. The molecular mechanisms underlying this regulation are just starting to be elucidated. At the moment, two different type of mechanisms have been proposed. The first one claims that the nucleotide portion of the ligand induces essentially no change in the protein structure, the electrostatic potential at the binding site being the most significant property of adenosine nucleotide binding. This \\"static\\" response would be involved in processes in which regulation by energy charge would be advantageous. On the contrary, the second type of mechanism (denoted as \\"dynamic\\") involves dramatic conformational changes in the protein structure upon ligand binding and has been reported for the cytosolic domain of the Mg2+ transporter MgtE from Thermus thermophilus, the unknown function protein MJ0100 from M. jannaschii and the regulatory region of Clostridium perfringens pyrophosphatase.  Associated domains  CBS domains are often found in proteins that contain other domains. These domains are usually enzymatic, membrane transporters or DNA-binding domains. However, proteins that contain only CBS domains are also often found, particularly in prokaryotes. These standalone CBS domain proteins might form complexes upon binding to other proteins such as kinases to which they interact with and regulate. centre  Mutations leading to disease  Mutations in some human CBS domain-containing proteins leads to genetic diseases. For example, mutations in the cystathionine-beta-synthase protein lead to an inherited disorder of the metabolism called homocystinuria (). Mutations in the gamma subunit of the AMPK enzyme have been shown to lead to familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (). Mutations in the CBS domains of the IMPDH enzyme lead to the eye condition retinitis pigmentosa (). Humans have a number of voltage-gated chloride channel genes, and mutations in the CBS domains of several of these have been identified as the cause of genetic diseases. Mutations in CLCN1 lead to myotonia (), mutations in CLCN2 can lead to idiopathic generalised epilepsy (), mutations in CLCN5 can lead to Dent's disease (), mutations in CLCN7 can lead to osteopetrosis (), and mutations in CLCNKB can lead to Bartter syndrome ().

The participants were South Australia, New South Wales, Victoria and Western Australia. The series was won by Victoria in due to a controversial decision in the final game. They claimed their fifth Shield title. The 1956 Olympic Baseball team was selected from the tournament. Controversy The final game of the Shield erupted in controversy when South Australia played Victoria. Victoria stood with a 3‚Äì0 record, Western Australia with a 2-1 as well as South Australia. If South Australia won against Victoria in the final game, the winner would be determined on runs for and against. The game was tied 4‚Äì4 at the end and went to extra innings, with South Australia making the break through, going ahead 5-4 going into the bottom of 12. The South Australian team realised that a 1 run win would not be enough to win the series and needed to score more runs, therefore they had to allow Victoria to score so they could chance a bigger win in the 13th inning. With a Victorian runner on third base the pitcher attempted a pickoff, deliberately throwing the ball away. The umpire called a dead ball and sent the runner back to third. The next pitch, the South Australian pitcher deliberately balked, which would have allowed the run to score, but the home plate umpire called the game over and gave the game to Victoria 9-0 on the technicality South Australia brought the game into disrepute. Appeals by the South Australian team to the Australian Baseball Corporation were denied, so the championship was awarded to Victoria.

It is native to northern Mexico and the southwestern United States from California to Texas, where it can be found in rocky and sandy desert scrub habitat. This species grows into a small, short lived perennial shrub with branching slender stems measuring up to about 70 centimeters in maximum length. The stems are hairless and waxy in texture. The sparse waxy leaves are linear in shape and 1 to 5 centimeters in length. The herbage is glandular and aromatic with a strong scent. Glands located in cavities in the leaves, stems and phyllaries produce several volatile chemicals that act in synergy to repel insect predators.Guillet, G., et al., (1998).

Super-resolution imaging techniques rely on the near-field (photon-tunneling microscopy as well as those that utilize the Pendry Superlens and near field scanning optical microscopy) or on the far-field. Among techniques that rely on the latter are those that improve the resolution only modestly (up to about a factor of two) beyond the diffraction-limit, such as confocal microscopy with closed pinhole or aided by computational methods such as deconvolution or detector-based pixel reassignment (e.g. re-scan microscopy, pixel reassignment), the 4Pi microscope, and structured-illumination microscopy technologies such as SIM and SMI. There are two major groups of methods for super-resolution microscopy in the far-field that can improve the resolution by a much larger factor: # Deterministic super-resolution: the most commonly used emitters in biological microscopy, fluorophores, show a nonlinear response to excitation, which can be exploited to enhance resolution. Such methods include STED, GSD, RESOLFT and SSIM. # Stochastic super-resolution: the chemical complexity of many molecular light sources gives them a complex temporal behavior, which can be used to make several nearby fluorophores emit light at separate times and thereby become resolvable in time. These methods include Super-resolution optical fluctuation imaging (SOFI) and all single-molecule localization methods (SMLM), such as SPDM, SPDMphymod, PALM, FPALM, STORM, and dSTORM. On 8 October 2014, the Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to Eric Betzig, W.E. Moerner and Stefan Hell for \\"the development of super-resolved fluorescence microscopy\\", which brings \\"optical microscopy into the nanodimension\\".  History  By 1978, the first theoretical ideas had been developed to break the Abbe limit, which called for using a 4Pi microscope as a confocal laser- scanning fluorescence microscope where the light is focused from all sides to a common focus that is used to scan the object by 'point-by-point' excitation combined with 'point-by-point' detection. Some of the following information was gathered (with permission) from a chemistry blog's review of sub- diffraction microscopy techniques.Part I and Part II In 1986, a super- resolution optical microscope based on stimulated emission was patented by Okhonin.V.A. Okhonin, Method of investigating specimen microstructure, Patent SU 1374922, priority date 10 April 1986, Published on July 30, 1991, Soviet Patents Abstracts, Section EI, Week 9218, Derwent Publications Ltd., London, GB; Class S03, p. 4. Cited by patents US 5394268 A (1993) and US RE38307 E1 (1995). From the English translation: \\"The essence of the invention is as follows. Luminescence is excited in a sample placed in the field of several standing light waves, which cause luminescence quenching because of stimulated transitions...\\".  Super-resolution techniques  = Photon tunneling microscopy (PTM) = = Local enhancement / ANSOM / optical nano-antennas = = Near-field optical random mapping (NORM) microscopy = Near-field optical random mapping (NORM) microscopy is a method of optical near-field acquisition by a far-field microscope through the observation of nanoparticles' Brownian motion in an immersion liquid.US patent 2009/0116,024, priority date 7 April 2006: J. V. Mikliaev, S. A. Asselborn Method for obtaining a high resolution image NORM utilizes object surface scanning by stochastically moving nanoparticles. Through the microscope, nanoparticles look like symmetric round spots. The spot width is equivalent to the point spread function (~ 250 nm) and is defined by the microscope resolution. Lateral coordinates of the given particle can be evaluated with a precision much higher than the resolution of the microscope. By collecting the information from many frames one can map out the near field intensity distribution across the whole field of view of the microscope. In comparison with NSOM and ANSOM this method does not require any special equipment for tip positioning and has a large field of view and a depth of focus. Due to the large number of scanning \\"sensors\\" one can achieve image acquisition in a shorter time. = 4Pi = A 4Pi microscope is a laser- scanning fluorescence microscope with an improved axial resolution. The typical value of 500‚Äì700 nm can be improved to 100‚Äì150 nm, which corresponds to an almost spherical focal spot with 5‚Äì7 times less volume than that of standard confocal microscopy. The improvement in resolution is achieved by using two opposing objective lenses, both of which are focused to the same geometric location. Also, the difference in optical path length through each of the two objective lenses is carefully minimized. By this, molecules residing in the common focal area of both objectives can be illuminated coherently from both sides, and the reflected or emitted light can be collected coherently, i.e. coherent superposition of emitted light on the detector is possible. The solid angle \\\\Omega that is used for illumination and detection is increased and approaches the ideal case, where the sample is illuminated and detected from all sides simultaneously. Up to now, the best quality in a 4Pi microscope has been reached in conjunction with STED microscopy in fixed cells and RESOLFT microscopy with switchable proteins in living cells. = Structured illumination microscopy (SIM) = Comparison of the resolution obtained by confocal laser scanning microscopy (top) and 3D structured illumination microscopy (3D-SIM-Microscopy, bottom). Shown are details of a nuclear envelope. Nuclear pores (anti-NPC) red, nuclear envelope (anti-Lamin) green, chromatin (DAPI-staining) blue. Scale bar: 1¬µm. Structured illumination microscopy (SIM) enhances spatial resolution by collecting information from frequency space outside the observable region. This process is done in reciprocal space: the Fourier transform (FT) of an SI image contains superimposed additional information from different areas of reciprocal space; with several frames where the illumination is shifted by some phase, it is possible to computationally separate and reconstruct the FT image, which has much more resolution information. The reverse FT returns the reconstructed image to a super-resolution image. SIM microscopy could potentially replace electron microscopy as a tool for some medical diagnoses. These include diagnosis of kidney disorders, kidney cancer, and blood diseases. Although the term \\"structured illumination microscopy\\" was coined by others in later years, Guerra (1995) first published results in which light patterned by a 50 nm pitch grating illuminated a second grating of pitch 50 nm, with the gratings rotated with respect to each other by the angular amount needed to achieve magnification. Although the illuminating wavelength was 650 nm, the 50 nm grating was easily resolved. This showed a nearly 5-fold improvement over the Abbe resolution limit of 232 nm that should have been the smallest obtained for the numerical aperture and wavelength used. In further development of this work, Guerra showed that super-resolved lateral topography is attained by phase-shifting the evanescent field. Several U.S. patentsU.S. Patent Number 5,774,221, Apparatus and methods for providing phase-controlled evanescent illumination (1996); Number 5,666,197, Apparatus and methods employing phase control and analysis of evanescent for imaging and metrology of subwavelength lateral surface topography (1996), and Number 5,715,059, Dark field, photon tunneling systems and methods (1996) were issued to Guerra individually, or with colleagues, and assigned to the Polaroid Corporation. Licenses to this technology were procured by Dyer Energy Systems, Calimetrics Inc., and Nanoptek Corp. for use of this super-resolution technique in optical data storage and microscopy.

Like standard structured illumination, the SMI technique modifies the point spread function (PSF) of a microscope in a suitable manner. In this case however, \\"the optical resolution itself is not enhanced\\"; instead structured illumination is used to maximize the precision of distance measurements of fluorescent objects, to \\"enable size measurements at molecular dimensions of a few tens of nanometers\\". The Vertico SMI microscope achieves structured illumination by using one or two opposing interfering laser beams along the axis. The object being imaged is then moved in high-precision steps through the wave field, or the wave field itself is moved relative to the object by phase shifts. This results in an improved axial size and distance resolution.US patent 7,342,717, filed 10 July 1997: Christoph Cremer, Michael Hausmann, Joachim Bradl, Bernhard Schneider Wave field microscope with detection point spread function SMI can be combined with other super resolution technologies, for instance with 3D LIMON or LSI-TIRF as a total internal reflection interferometer with laterally structured illumination (this last instrument and technique is essentially a phase- shifted photon tunneling microscope, which employs a total internal reflection light microscope with phase-shifted evanescent field (Guerra, 1996)). This SMI technique allows one to acquire light-optical images of autofluorophore distributions in sections from human eye tissue with previously unmatched optical resolution. Use of three different excitation wavelengths (488, 568, and 647 nm), enables one to gather spectral information about the autofluorescence signal. This has been used to examine human eye tissue affected by macular degeneration.  Deterministic functional techniques  REversible Saturable OpticaL Fluorescence Transitions (RESOLFT) microscopy is an optical microscopy with very high resolution that can image details in samples that cannot be imaged with conventional or confocal microscopy. Within RESOLFT the principles of STED microscopy and GSD microscopy are generalized. Also, there are techniques with other concepts than RESOLFT or SSIM. For example, fluorescence microscopy using the optical AND gate property of nitrogen-vacancy center, or super-resolution by Stimulated Emission of Thermal Radiation (SETR), which uses the intrinsic super-linerarities of the Black- Body radiation and expands the concept of super-resolution beyond microscopy. = Stimulated emission depletion (STED) = Resolution improvement between traditional confocal microscopy and STED microscopy. Stimulated emission depletion microscopy (STED) uses two laser pulses, the excitation pulse for excitation of the fluorophores to their fluorescent state and the STED pulse for the de-excitation of fluorophores by means of stimulated emission. In practice, the excitation laser pulse is first applied whereupon a STED pulse soon follows (STED without pulses using continuous wave lasers is also used). Furthermore, the STED pulse is modified in such a way so that it features a zero-intensity spot that coincides with the excitation focal spot. Due to the non-linear dependence of the stimulated emission rate on the intensity of the STED beam, all the fluorophores around the focal excitation spot will be in their off state (the ground state of the fluorophores). By scanning this focal spot, one retrieves the image. The full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the point spread function (PSF) of the excitation focal spot can theoretically be compressed to an arbitrary width by raising the intensity of the STED pulse, according to equation (). : \\\\Delta r \\\\approx \\\\frac{\\\\Delta}{\\\\sqrt{1+I_\\\\max/I_s}} () : where ‚àÜr is the lateral resolution, ‚àÜ is the FWHM of the diffraction limited PSF, Imax is the peak intensity of the STED laser, and I_{s} is the threshold intensity needed in order to achieve saturated emission depletion. The main disadvantage of STED, which has prevented its widespread use, is that the machinery is complicated. On the one hand, the image acquisition speed is relatively slow for large fields of view because of the need to scan the sample in order to retrieve an image. On the other hand, it can be very fast for smaller fields of view: recordings of up to 80 frames per second have been shown. Due to a large Is value associated with STED, there is the need for a high-intensity excitation pulse, which may cause damage to the sample. = Ground state depletion (GSD) = Ground state depletion microscopy (GSD microscopy) uses the triplet state of a fluorophore as the off-state and the singlet state as the on-state, whereby an excitation laser is used to drive the fluorophores at the periphery of the singlet state molecule to the triplet state. This is much like STED, where the off-state is the ground state of fluorophores, which is why equation () also applies in this case. The I_{s} value is smaller than in STED, making super-resolution imaging possible at a much smaller laser intensity. Compared to STED, though, the fluorophores used in GSD are generally less photostable; and the saturation of the triplet state may be harder to realize. = Saturated structured illumination microscopy (SSIM) = Saturated structured- illumination microscopy (SSIM) exploits the nonlinear dependence of the emission rate of fluorophores on the intensity of the excitation laser. By applying a sinusoidal illumination pattern with a peak intensity close to that needed in order to saturate the fluorophores in their fluorescent state, one retrieves Moir√© fringes. The fringes contain high order spatial information that may be extracted by computational techniques. Once the information is extracted, a super-resolution image is retrieved. SSIM requires shifting the illumination pattern multiple times, effectively limiting the temporal resolution of the technique. In addition there is the need for very photostable fluorophores, due to the saturating conditions, which inflict radiation damage on the sample and restrict the possible applications for which SSIM may be used. Examples of this microscopy are shown under section Structured illumination microscopy (SIM): images of cell nuclei and mitotic stages recorded with 3D-SIM Microscopy.  Stochastic functional techniques  = Localization microscopy = Single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) summarizes all microscopical techniques that achieve super-resolution by isolating emitters and fitting their images with the point spread function (PSF). Normally, the width of the point spread function (~ 250 nm) limits resolution. However, given an isolated emitter, one is able to determine its location with a precision only limited by its intensity according to equation (). : \\\\Delta \\\\mathrm{loc} \\\\approx \\\\frac{\\\\Delta}{\\\\sqrt{N}} () : where Œîloc is the localization precision, Œî is the FWHM of the PSF and N is the number of collected photons. This fitting process can only be performed reliably for isolated emitters (see Deconvolution), and interesting biological samples are so densely labeled with emitters that fitting is impossible when all emitters are active at the same time. SMLM techniques solve this dilemma by activating only a sparse subset of emitters at the same time, localizing these few emitters very precisely, deactivating them and activating another subset. Considering background and camera pixelation, and using Gaussian approximation for the point spread function (Airy disk) of a typical microscope, the theoretical resolution is proposed by Thompson et al. and fine-tuned by Mortensen et al.: : \\\\sigma^2 = \\\\frac{\\\\sigma_{PSF}^2+a^2/12}{N_{sig}}(\\\\frac{16}{9}+\\\\frac{8 \\\\pi N_{bg}(\\\\sigma_{PSF}^2 + a^2/12)}{N_{sig} a^2}) : where : * œÉ is the Gaussian standard deviation of the center locations of the same molecule if measured multiple times (e.g. frames of a video). (unit m) : * œÉPSF is the Gaussian standard deviation of the point spread function, whose FWHM following the Ernst Abbe equation d = Œª/(2 N.A.). (unit m) : * a is the size of each image pixel. (unit m) : * Nsig is the photon counts of the total PSF over all pixels of interest. (unitless) : * Nbg the average background photon counts per pixel (dark counts already removed), which is approximated to be the square of the Gaussian standard deviation of the Poisson distribution background noise of each pixel over time or standard deviation of all pixels with background noise only, œÉbg2. The larger the œÉbg2, the better the approximation (e.g. good for œÉbg2 >10, excellent for œÉbg2 >1000). (unitless) : * Resolution FWHM is ~2.355 times the Gaussian standard deviation. Generally, localization microscopy is performed with fluorophores. Suitable fluorophores (e.g. for STORM) reside in a non-fluorescent dark state for most of the time and are activated stochastically, typically with an excitation laser of low intensity. A readout laser stimulates fluorescence and bleaches or photoswitches the fluorophores back to a dark state, typically within 10‚Äì100 ms. In points accumulation for imaging in nanoscale topography (PAINT), the fluorophores are nonfluorescent before binding and fluorescent after. The photons emitted during the fluorescent phase are collected with a camera and the resulting image of the fluorophore (which is distorted by the PSF) can be fitted with very high precision, even on the order of a few Angstroms. Repeating the process several thousand times ensures that all fluorophores can go through the bright state and are recorded. A computer then reconstructs a super-resolved image. The desirable traits of fluorophores used for these methods, in order to maximize the resolution, are that they should be bright. That is, they should have a high extinction coefficient and a high quantum yield. They should also possess a high contrast ratio (ratio between the number of photons emitted in the light state and the number of photons emitted in the dark state). Also, a densely labeled sample is desirable, according to the Nyquist criteria. The multitude of localization microscopy methods differ mostly in the type of fluorophores used.  Spectral precision distance microscopy (SPDM)  Single YFP molecule super resolution microscopy / SPDMphymod A single, tiny source of light can be located much better than the resolution of a microscope usually allows for: although the light will produce a blurry spot, computer algorithms can be used to accurately calculate the center of the blurry spot, taking into account the point spread function of the microscope, the noise properties of the detector, etc. However, this approach does not work when there are too many sources close to each other: the sources then all blur together. Spectral precision distance microscopy (SPDM) is a family of localizing techniques in fluorescence microscopy which gets around the problem of there being many sources by measuring just a few sources at a time, so that each source is \\"optically isolated\\" from the others (i.e., separated by more than the microscope's resolution, typically ~200-250 nm), if the particles under examination have different spectral signatures, so that it is possible to look at light from just a few molecules at a time by using the appropriate light sources and filters. This achieves an effective optical resolution several times better than the conventional optical resolution that is represented by the half-width of the main maximum of the effective point image function. The structural resolution achievable using SPDM can be expressed in terms of the smallest measurable distance between two punctiform particles of different spectral characteristics (\\"topological resolution\\"). Modeling has shown that under suitable conditions regarding the precision of localization, particle density, etc., the \\"topological resolution\\" corresponds to a \\"space frequency\\" that, in terms of the classical definition, is equivalent to a much improved optical resolution. Molecules can also be distinguished in even more subtle ways based on fluorescent lifetime and other techniques. An important application is in genome research (study of the functional organization of the genome). Another important area of use is research into the structure of membranes. = SPDMphymod = Dual color localization microscopy SPDMphymod/super-resolution microscopy with GFP & RFP fusion proteins Localization microscopy for many standard fluorescent dyes like GFP, Alexa dyes, and fluorescein molecules is possible if certain photo-physical conditions are present. With this so-called physically modifiable fluorophores (SPDMphymod) technology, a single laser wavelength of suitable intensity is sufficient for nanoimaging in contrast to other localization microscopy technologies that need two laser wavelengths when special photo- switchable/photo-activatable fluorescence molecules are used. A further example of the use of SPDMphymod is an analysis of Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) particles or the study of virus‚Äìcell interaction. Based on singlet‚Äìtriplet state transitions it is crucial for SPDMphymod that this process is ongoing and leading to the effect that a single molecule comes first into a very long- living reversible dark state (with half-life of as much as several seconds) from which it returns to a fluorescent state emitting many photons for several milliseconds before it returns into a very long-living, so-called irreversible dark state. SPDMphymod microscopy uses fluorescent molecules that emit the same spectral light frequency but with different spectral signatures based on the flashing characteristics. By combining two thousands images of the same cell, it is possible, using laser optical precision measurements, to record localization images with significantly improved optical resolution. Standard fluorescent dyes already successfully used with the SPDMphymod technology are GFP, RFP, YFP, Alexa 488, Alexa 568, Alexa 647, Cy2, Cy3, Atto 488 and fluorescein.  Cryogenic Optical Localization in 3D (COLD)  Cryogenic Optical Localization in Three Dimensions (COLD) allows to determine the four biotin binding sites in the protein streptavidin. Cryogenic Optical Localization in 3D (COLD) is a method that allows localizing multiple fluorescent sites within a single small- to medium-sized biomolecule with Angstrom-scale resolution. The localization precision in this approach is enhanced because the slower photochemistry at low temperatures leads to a higher number of photons that can be emitted from each fluorophore before photobleaching. As a result, cryogenic stochastic localization microscopy achieves the sub-molecular resolution required to resolve the 3D positions of several fluorophores attached to a small protein. By employing algorithms known from electron microscopy, the 2D projections of fluorophores are reconstructed into a 3D configuration. COLD brings fluorescence microscopy to its fundamental limit, depending on the size of the label. The method can also be combined with other structural biology techniques‚Äîsuch as X-ray crystallography, magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and electron microscopy‚Äîto provide valuable complementary information and specificity.  Binding- activated localization microscopy (BALM)  fBALM Super-resolution single molecule localisation microscopy using DNA structure fluctuation assisted binding activated localisation microscopy Binding-activated localization microscopy (BALM) is a general concept for single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM): super-resolved imaging of DNA-binding dyes based on modifying the properties of DNA and a dye. By careful adjustment of the chemical environment‚Äîleading to local, reversible DNA melting and hybridization control over the fluorescence signal‚ÄîDNA-binding dye molecules can be introduced. Intercalating and minor-groove binding DNA dyes can be used to register and optically isolate only a few DNA-binding dye signals at a time. DNA structure fluctuation-assisted BALM (fBALM) has been used to nanoscale differences in nuclear architecture, with an anticipated structural resolution of approximately 50 nm. Imaging chromatin nanostructure with binding-activated localization microscopy based on DNA structure fluctuations. Recently, the significant enhancement of fluorescence quantum yield of NIAD-4 upon binding to an amyloid was exploited for BALM imaging of amyloid fibrils and oligomers.  STORM, PALM, and FPALM  Stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM), photo activated localization microscopy (PALM), and fluorescence photo-activation localization microscopy (FPALM) are super-resolution imaging techniques that utilize sequential activation and time-resolved localization of photoswitchable fluorophores to create high resolution images. During imaging, only an optically resolvable subset of fluorophores is activated to a fluorescent state at any given moment, such that the position of each fluorophore can be determined with high precision by finding the centroid positions of the single-molecule images of a particular fluorophore. One subset of fluorophores is subsequently deactivated, and another subset is activated and imaged. Iteration of this process allows numerous fluorophores to be localized and a super-resolution image to be constructed from the image data. These three methods were published independently over a short period of time, and their principles are identical. STORM was originally described using Cy5 and Cy3 dyes attached to nucleic acids or proteins, while PALM and FPALM were described using photoswitchable fluorescent proteins. In principle any photoswitchable fluorophore can be used, and STORM has been demonstrated with a variety of different probes and labeling strategies. Using stochastic photoswitching of single fluorophores, such as Cy5, STORM can be performed with a single red laser excitation source. The red laser both switches the Cy5 fluorophore to a dark state by formation of an adduct and subsequently returns the molecule to the fluorescent state. Many other dyes have been also used with STORM. In addition to single fluorophores, dye-pairs consisting of an activator fluorophore (such as Alexa 405, Cy2, or Cy3) and a photoswitchable reporter dye (such as Cy5, Alexa 647, Cy5.5, or Cy7) can be used with STORM. In this scheme, the activator fluorophore, when excited near its absorption maximum, serves to reactivate the photoswitchable dye to the fluorescent state. Multicolor imaging has been performed by using different activation wavelengths to distinguish dye-pairs, depending on the activator fluorophore used, or using spectrally distinct photoswitchable fluorophores, either with or without activator fluorophores. Photoswitchable fluorescent proteins can be used as well. Highly specific labeling of biological structures with photoswitchable probes has been achieved with antibody staining, direct conjugation of proteins, and genetic encoding. STORM has also been extended to three-dimensional imaging using optical astigmatism, in which the elliptical shape of the point spread function encodes the x, y, and z positions for samples up to several micrometers thick, and has been demonstrated in living cells. To date, the spatial resolution achieved by this technique is ~20 nm in the lateral dimensions and ~50 nm in the axial dimension; and the temporal resolution is as fast as 0.1‚Äì0.33s.  Points accumulation for imaging in nanoscale topography (PAINT)  Points accumulation for imaging in nanoscale topography (PAINT) is a single-molecule localization method that achieves stochastic single-molecule fluorescence by molecular adsorption/absorption and photobleaching/desorption. The first dye used was Nile red which is nonfluorescent in aqueous solution but fluorescent when inserted into a hydrophobic environment, such as micelles or living cell walls. Thus, the concentration of the dye is kept small, at the nanomolar level, so that the molecule's sorption rate to the diffraction-limited area is in the millisecond region. The stochastic binding of single-dye molecules (probes) to an immobilized target can be spatially and temporally resolved under a typical widefield fluorescence microscope. Each dye is photobleached to return the field to a dark state, so the next dye can bind and be observed. The advantage of this method, compared to other stochastic methods, is that in addition to obtaining the super-resolved image of the fixed target, it can measure the dynamic binding kinetics of the diffusing probe molecules, in solution, to the target. Combining 3D super-resolution technique (e.g. the double-helix point spread function develop in Moerner's group), photo-activated dyes, power- dependent active intermittency, and points accumulation for imaging in nanoscale topography, SPRAIPAINT (SPRAI=Super resolution by PoweR-dependent Active Intermittency) can super-resolve live-cell walls. PAINT works by maintaining a balance between the dye adsorption/absorption and photobleaching/desorption rates. This balance can be estimated with statistical principles. The adsorption or absorption rate of a dilute solute to a surface or interface in a gas or liquid solution can be calculated using Fick's laws of diffusion. The photobleaching/desorption rate can be measured for a given solution condition and illumination power density. DNA-PAINT has been further extended to use regular dyes, where the dynamic binding and unbinding of a dye-labeled DNA probe to a fixed DNA origami is used to achieve stochastic single-molecule imaging. DNA-PAINT is no longer limited to environment-sensitive dyes and can measure both the adsorption and the desorption kinetics of the probes to the target. The method utilizes the camera blurring effect of moving dyes. When a regular dye is diffusing in the solution, its image on a typical CCD camera is blurred because of its relatively fast speed and the relatively long camera exposure time, contributing to the fluorescence background. However, when it binds to a fixed target, the dye stops moving; and clear input into the point spread function can be achieved. The term for this method is mbPAINT (\\"mb\\" standing for motion blur). When a total internal reflection fluorescence microscope (TIRF) is used for imaging, the excitation depth is limited to ~100 nm from the substrate, which further reduces the fluorescence background from the blurred dyes near the substrate and the background in the bulk solution. Very bright dyes can be used for mbPAINT which gives typical single-frame spatial resolutions of ~20 nm and single-molecule kinetic temporal resolutions of ~20 ms under relatively mild photoexcitation intensities, which is useful in studying molecular separation of single proteins. The temporal resolution has been further improved (20 times) using a rotational phase mask placed in the Fourier plane during data acquisition and resolving the distorted point spread function that contains temporal information. The method was named Super Temporal-Resolved Microscopy (STReM).  Label-free localization microscopy  Label-free Localisation Microscopy SPDM ‚Äì Super Resolution Microscopy reveals prior undetectable intracellular structures Optical resolution of cellular structures in the range of about 50 nm can be achieved, even in label-free cells, using localization microscopy SPDM. By using two different laser wavelengths, SPDM reveals cellular objects which are not detectable under conventional fluorescence wide-field imaging conditions, beside making for a substantial resolution improvement of autofluorescent structures. As a control, the positions of the detected objects in the localization image match those in the bright-field image. Label-free superresolution microscopy has also been demonstrated using the fluctuations of a surface-enhanced Raman scattering signal on a highly uniform plasmonic metasurface.  Direct stochastical optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM)  dSTORM utilizes the photoswitching of a single fluorophore. In dSTORM, fluorophores are embedded in a reducing and oxidizing buffering system (ROXS) and fluorescence is excited. Sometimes, stochastically, the fluorophore will enter a triplet or some other dark state that is sensitive to the oxidation state of the buffer, from which they can be made to fluoresce, so that single molecule positions can be recorded.Heilemann et al, 2008, Angewandte Chemie and van de Linde et al, 2011, Photochem. Photobiol. Sci Development of the dSTORM method occurred at 3 independent laboratories at about the same time and was also called \\"reversible photobleaching microscopy\\" (RPM), \\"ground state depletion microscopy followed by individual molecule return\\" (GSDIM), as well as the now generally accepted moniker dSTORM.  Software for localization microscopy  Localization microscopy depends heavily on software that can precisely fit the point spread function (PSF) to millions of images of active fluorophores within a few minutes. Since the classical analysis methods and software suites used in the natural sciences are too slow to computationally solve these problems, often taking hours of computation for processing data measured in minutes, specialised software programs have been developed. Many of these localization software packages are open-source; they are listed at SMLM Software Benchmark. Once molecule positions have been determined, the locations need to be displayed and several algorithms for display have been developed. = Super-resolution optical fluctuation imaging (SOFI) = It is possible to circumvent the need for PSF fitting inherent in single molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) by directly computing the temporal autocorrelation of pixels. This technique is called super-resolution optical fluctuation imaging (SOFI) and has been shown to be more precise than SMLM when the density of concurrently active fluorophores is very high. = Omnipresent Localization Microscopy (OLM) = Omnipresent Localisation Microscopy (OLM) is an extension of Single Molecule Microscopy (SMLM) techniques that allow high-density single molecule imaging with an incoherent light source (such as a mercury-arc lamp) and a conventional epifluorescence microscope setup. A short burst of deep-blue excitation (with a 350-380 nm, instead of a 405 nm, laser) enables a prolonged reactivation of molecules, for a resolution of 90 nm on test specimens. Finally, correlative STED and SMLM imaging can be performed on the same biological sample using a simple imaging medium, which can provide a basis for a further enhanced resolution. These findings can democratize superresolution imaging and help any scientist to generate high-density single-molecule images even with a limited budget.  Combination of techniques  = 3D light microscopical nanosizing (LIMON) microscopy = 3D Dual Colour Super Resolution Microscopy with Her2 and Her3 in breast cells, standard dyes: Alexa 488, Alexa 568 LIMON Light MicrOscopical Nanosizing microscopy (3D LIMON) images, using the Vertico SMI microscope, are made possible by the combination of SMI and SPDM, whereby first the SMI, and then the SPDM, process is applied. The SMI process determines the center of particles and their spread in the direction of the microscope axis. While the center of particles/molecules can be determined with a precision of 1‚Äì2 nm, the spread around this point can be determined down to an axial diameter of approximately 30‚Äì40 nm. Subsequently, the lateral position of the individual particle/molecule is determined using SPDM, achieving a precision of a few nanometers.Baddeley D, Batram C, Weiland Y, Cremer C, Birk UJ.: Nanostructure analysis using Spatially Modulated Illumination microscopy. In: Nature Protocols 2007; 2: 2640‚Äì2646 As a biological application in the 3D dual color mode, the spatial arrangements of Her2/neu and Her3 clusters was achieved. The positions in all three directions of the protein clusters could be determined with an accuracy of about 25 nm. = Integrated correlative light and electron microscopy = Combining a super-resolution microscope with an electron microscope enables the visualization of contextual information, with the labelling provided by fluorescence markers. This overcomes the problem of the black backdrop that the researcher is left with when using only a light microscope. In an integrated system, the sample is measured by both microscopes simultaneously.  Enhancing of techniques using neural networks  Recently, owing to advancements in artificial intelligence computing, deep- learning neural networks have been used for super-resolution enhancing of optical-microscope photographic images, from 40x to 100x, from 20x with an optical microscope to 1500x, comparable to a scanning electron microscope, via a neural lens, and with positron-emission tomography and fluorescence microscopy.

Biermann re-joined the KPD, and resumed working with the German Resistance. Biermann and Riebodt began working with Michaelis, with Rieboldt reporting to him about the armaments work, and especially about the production of airplane motors and warships. In 1937, the Resistance group disclosed a secret weapons shipment from Adolf Hitler to Spain's Francisco Franco.Hans Michael Kloth. \\"Mein Nachbar, der KZ-Kommandant\\" (\\"My neighbor, the concentration camp commandant\\"). Spiegel Online (January 21, 2008) Biermann learned of the shipment from his brother-in-law, Karl Dietrich, a ship captain. Biermann and other shipyard workers decided to collect whatever evidence they could of the shipment bound for Spain. Michaelis had contacts living abroad, in exile, who could help spread the word. One example of evidence was discovered in March 1937, when Dietrich slipped two unusual rifle cartridges to Biermann. Unlike normal munitions, these cartridges were unmarked, having no indication of manufacturer, date, or type of bullet. Michaelis passed such information, along with reports of ship movements towards Spain and other materials, to the head of the KPD in Basel, where it was then made public.Heinz J√ºrgen Schneider. \\"(K)ein Ehrenb√ºrger\\" Article about Dagobert Biermann from Junge Welt.

He claims to have healed ailments in many cricket players, Mr. Lasith Malinga, [ He is not a registered medical practitioner. While some sources claim that he has rendered cures to a great number of patients, others describe him as a 'quack' and a 'soothsayer'. Early life Eliyantha White is of British heritage.'Miracle Doctor', Hi! Magazine, 2010, Month and Issue Unknown, Wijeya Newspapers, Sri Lanka. He appears to have grown up in the town of Kalubowila, Sri Lanka and began his treatments at the age of 12 by treating someone who was suffering from an incurable cancer. He claimed to be able to materialise medicine through spirits of Rishis., which he then used to cure people. He studied traditional medicine in both Sri Lanka and India. Eliyantha White now utilises herbs and supernatural powers to produce medicine. Rise to fame Eliyantha White giving medications to Sachin Tendulkar White initially started treating people at Eeyamporuwa Temple in Madiwela. From here, his popularity rose to a point where he was apparently hounded in the streets and was treating over a thousand patients a day. He was always committed to treating people free of charge. In March 2010, Eliyantha invited David Beckham to Sri Lanka for treatment of an injury. He claimed to be able to put Beckham back on the field in three days. It is unclear whether Beckham took up this offer. Controversies Eliyantha White's status and treatments have been the subject of intense controversy. In May 2011, Upul Tharanga, a Sri Lankan cricketer failed a dope test conducted by ICC and it was rumoured that Tharanga had been treated by White and the medication given by White contained the banned substance, due to which Tharanga failed the dope test. However, Tharanga has not officially confirmed that he was treated by White. But Sri Lankan sports minister confirmed that White treated Tharanga. However Tharanga had been treated by other doctors as well. On 15 July 2011, the International Cricket Council's Independent Anti-Doping Tribunal decision in the case of Tharanga discussed in some detail the question whether Eliyantha White's medicine may have contained banned substances. Despite claims that Eliyantha is the Sri Lankan president's personal physician, this fact is sometimes disputed. Political status On April 2012, during an adjournment debate in Parliament on legal recognition to alternative systems of treatment, members were unanimous in complimenting the physician‚Äôs performance. Several opposition parliamentarians praised White for his abilities and requested more security for him. MP A. H. M.

However, there are important differences between the two. Emotional literacy was noted as part of a project advocating humanistic education in the early 1970s.Lotecka, L. (1974) A project advocating humanistic education: An evaluation of its effect on public school teachers. Journal of Drug Education, 4(2), 141-149. Available at http://elguides.cc/AProject.pdf (accessed April 2013). Definition The term was used extensively by Claude Steiner (1997)Steiner, C. with Perry, P. (1997) Achieving Emotional Literacy. London: Bloomsbury. who says: Emotional literacy is made up of 'the ability to understand your emotions, the ability to listen to others and empathise with their emotions, and the ability to express emotions productively. To be emotionally literate is to be able to handle emotions in a way that improves your personal power and improves the quality of life around you. Emotional literacy improves relationships, creates loving possibilities between people, makes co-operative work possible, and facilitates the feeling of community. Steiner breaks emotional literacy into five parts: > #Knowing your feelings. #Having a sense of empathy. #Learning to manage our > emotions. #Repairing emotional problems. #Putting it all together: emotional > interactivity. Having its roots in counseling, it is a social definition that has interactions between people at its heart. According to Steiner emotional literacy is about understanding your feelings and those of others to facilitate relationships, including using dialogue and self-control to avoid negative arguments. The ability to be aware and read other people's feelings enables one to interact with them effectively so that powerful emotional situations can be handled in a skillful way. Steiner calls this \\"emotional interactivity\\". Steiner's model of emotional literacy is therefore primarily about dealing constructively with the emotional difficulties we experience to build a sound future. He believes that personal power can be increased and relationships transformed. The emphasis is on the individual, and as such encourages one to look inward rather than to the social setting in which an individual operates. British context In Britain, the term emotional literacy is often used and has developed, building on the work of Steiner and GolemanGoleman, D. (1996) Emotional Intelligence. Why it can matter more than IQ. London: Bloomsbury. as a social construction ‚Äì as opposed to the more individualistic 'emotional intelligence' with the attempts to measure it as if emotions were measurable in a relatively rational way.Boler, M. (1999) Feeling power: emotions and education. New York: Routledge.Matthews, G., Zeidner, M. and Roberts, R. D. (2004) Emotional intelligence: science and myth. Cambridge, Mass: MIT PressBurman, E. (2009) Beyond 'emotional literacy' in feminist and educational research, British Educational Research Journal, 35(1): 137-155. Educators did not like the way that 'emotional intelligence' focused so much on the individual and there were clear attempts to avoid the narrow EQ tests that were in use for two reasons: #The idea of an EQ test had resonance with discredited psychometric measures of intelligence such as IQ tests. #People were also concerned with the way that pupils could be subject to even more control through the introduction of emotional intelligence into the curriculum.Matthews, B. (2006) Engaging Education. Developing Emotional Literacy, Equity and Co-education. Buckingham: McGraw-Hill/Open University Press.Ecclestone, K. and Hayes, D. (2008) The Dangerous Rise of Therapeutic Education. London: Routledge The National Curriculum in England and Wales emphasized a range of cognitive skills that were controlled through exams. Educators saw the need to expand the range of skills that pupils required and were also concerned with social inclusion. The Labour Government provided an overarching rationale for this with its promotion of well-being.DfCSF (2007) The Children's Plan: Building brighter futures. London: Department for Children, Schools and Families.DfCSF (2008) Indicators of a school's contribution to well-being. London: Ofsted However, when the Department of Children, Schools and Families developed a scheme for schools ‚Äì called the Social and Emotional Aspects of Learning (SEAL) ‚Äì it was based on Goleman's definition of emotional intelligence.Goleman, D. (1996) Emotional Intelligence. Why it can matter more than IQ. London: BloomsburyDepartment for Education and Skills (2007) Social and Emotional Aspects of Learning for secondary schools (SEAL) Introductory Guide. Ref: 00043-2007DWO-EN-04 London: HMSO. Hence any distinctions between the terms emotional intelligence and emotional literacy were blurred. Even so, key educators in Britain continued to use the term emotional literacy. Emotional literacy took on an aspect that was concern with personal growth. For example, the importance of developing relationships is, to a degree, in Weare's definition: > The ability to understand ourselves and other people, and in particular to > be aware of, understand, and use information about the emotional states of > ourselves and others with competence. It includes the ability to understand, > express and manage our own emotions, and respond to the emotions of others, > in ways that are helpful to ourselves and others.Weare, K. (2003) Developing > the emotionally literate school. London: Paul Chapman. p2 Similarly, the organization AntidoteAntidote (2010) Definition of Emotional Literacy. Available at http://www.antidote.org.uk/learning/about.php (accessed April 2010). defined emotional literacy as: > the practice of interacting with others in ways that build understanding of > our own and others' emotions, then using this understanding to inform our > actions. These definitions acknowledge both the individual and other people and so inter-personal relationships and the need for dialogue are included. SharpSharp, P. (2001) Nurturing Emotional Literacy. London: David Fulton. has taken a broad approach to emotional literacy in a Local Education Authority (LEA) where he considers its development is important for teachers as well as pupils. However, there was still an underlying assumption about the individual and how they develop as if they were culturally isolated and separate from factors such as religion and gender. Also, the development of emotional literacy was justified by arguing that its introduction would help to improve other factors such as behavior, attendance and academic achievement. Boler researched four of the emotional programs in America. She pointed out that the programs tended to view pupils as individuals who are in need of development through enabling them to control their impulses. This can mean that pupils are to become responsible for their own control and that other social factors can be ignored. It is possible that these programs can open the way for greater control of pupils with even their emotions being assessed. On the one hand the development of emotional literacy programs can be seen as progressive, but on the other the focus seems quite inward, as there is little reference leading to any broader concept of social and political reform. In the same way that Goleman discusses emotional intelligence educational programs, emotional literacy programs can also be more about coping with the social and political status quo in a caring, interactive and emotionally supportive environment than with any systematic attempt to move beyond it to social improvement. Culturally situated Matthews (2006) argues against the concept of 'emotional intelligence' and for a developed definition of 'emotional literacy'. His starting point is that all social and emotional interactions take place in a cultural context and that generally all emotions are felt because of interactions with other people. He argues that a group may, for example, contain men and women and people from a range of ethnicities. One could judge a person's emotional literacy by observing what they brought to the situation, the way they interacted and the degree to which they showed empathy, and, the recognition of \\"self\\" and \\"others\\". The way that one can reliably gauge the emotional literacy of a person is to see them interacting in a group and see how they behave towards other people of different genders, sexuality and social class. Hence, it makes little sense to talk about emotional literacy of a person as if it were separate from such factors ‚Äì someone may be able to empathize with people of their own sex, but not different sexualities or religions. Also, one may think that they can empathize with the other sex, or another religion, but the other person may not agree with them. Indeed, the views of other people are essential in deciding upon such factors. There is always a social context and in any context power differentials operate. Any form of paper and pen test will only give access to what a person thinks, not to the important view of how others think. For example, many men (and women) would say that they were not sexist, yet a person from the opposite sex may not agree. A person cannot tell how well they, say, empathize, only other people tell them if they are. A manager may think they are self-confident, open and friendly, but others find him or her aggressive and bullying. Hence, according to Matthews, emotional literacy is a social process that takes place in a social setting, is something that is never really achieved, and has to be seen in conjunction with others. This indicates that key components of emotional literacy, which is a continual process, that includes dialogue, acceptance of ambiguity and the ability to reflect. Judgments are made on a person's individual-in-group emotional literacy. He argues: On this view emotional literacy is developed to help people understand themselves, others and the power connections between them. Matthews links emotional literacy to equality and social justice. Emotional literacy is not just to be \\"nice\\", but also to know when to stand up for viewpoints and fight for a case. It is not about more control over people, but less. As McIntosh and StyleMcIntosh, P. and Style, E. (1999) Social, Emotional and Political Learning, in Cohen, J. (ed.) Educating Minds and Hearts. Social and Emotional Learning and the Passage into Adolescence. New York: Teachers College. p137 argue schools are always involved in social, emotional and power relations, yet \\"power relations are a taboo subject in K-12 schooling and in the majority culture of the United States. Power relations are therefore little understood systemically. Students, however, learn about power by watching, by imitating, by avoidance of what they fear\\". In education In general, most of the criticisms of courses to promote pupils' emotional development have been directed at those that develop emotional intelligence. For example, there are the courses developed in the USA and Britain.Casel (2003) Safe and Sound. An educational leader's guide to evidence-based social and emotional learning programs. Chicago: University of Chicago Press (Available at: www.casel.org/downloads/Safe%20and%20Sound/1A_Safe_&_Sound.pdf).Elias, M., Zins, J., Weissberg, R. and Frey, K. (1997) Promoting Social and Emotional Learning. Virginia USA: Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development. The critiques of these courses include that: # Emotional intelligence/literacy courses can lead to more control over pupils with them being more defined in their behavior. # The assessment of emotional intelligence/literacy can lead to pupils being labeled as inadequate. # Emotional intelligence courses can locate problems in the individual that are also a function of how society is organised. # When courses are taught it is often assumed that pupils are emotionally ready to deal with what is on the curriculum, whereas they may not be. # The whole agenda of teaching emotional development can lead to pupils being seen as deficit in emotional control and so can depress their potential to have faith in future goalsEcclestone, K. and Hayes, D. (2008) The Dangerous Rise of Therapeutic Education. London: Routledge. # Emotional intelligence courses have moral and ethical aspects that are not made explicit.Rietti, S. (2009) Emotional intelligence and moral agency: Some worries and a suggestion, Philosophical Psychology, 22(2): 143-165. Matthews has tried to avoid some of the difficulties. For example, his strategies for the classroom mean that pupils only develop when, and in what areas, they are able. Emotional development between the genders has been the focus of researchMatthews, B. (2004) Promoting emotional literacy, equity and interest in KS3 science lessons for 11- to 14-year-olds; the 'Improving Science and Emotional Development' project, International Journal of Science Education, 26(3): 281-308.Matthews, B., Kilbey, T., Doneghan, C. and Harrison, S.

He became publicly known after having leaked sensitive NATO documents during the Kosovo war, for which he served a jail sentence in 2001‚Äì2002. He later worked in construction and as a writer on Islamic extremism and the Serbian War. Career After graduating from the prestigious military academy of Saint-Cyr, he entered the French Army in 1972 and obtained the rank of major. During the Gulf War, he was an aide to General Michel Roquejeoffre. Leaking of sensitive NATO operational documents At the end of 1998, when he was a member of the French delegation to NATO's military committee at the headquarters in Brussels, he admitted of having passed sensitive operational documents to Serbian officials, after which he was accused of treason. He admitted of having passed these documents between July and October 1998 to Serbian colonel Jovan Milanoviƒá. Documents indicated the future strikes in Serbia during the Kosovo War. While newspapers alleged a traditional pro-Serb bias in the French military, he claimed to be acting under orders of French intelligence services with the object of convincing the sceptical Serb government that the NATO threat of bombing was real, but change his story claiming that he did it because of personal reasons, mainly hatred toward United States. On 15 December 2001 he was condemned by a military tribunal, demoted in rank and sentenced to five years in prison. Three years were suspended, he was freed from La Sant√© Prison in the Spring of 2002. When asking for a five-year term for Bunel, state prosecutor Janine Stern said at the tribunal: 9/11 attacks and publishing In 2002, he collaborated in the book by Thierry Meyssan, Le Pentagate, for which he wrote chapter 4 entitled \\"The effect of a shaped charge.\\" The book disputes the official version of the attack on the Pentagon in 2001 and alleges that the attack was made by a missile. He has also translated into French the works of David Ray Griffin, a philosopher of religion and philosophy, who contests the official version of the September 11 attacks.

Her castaway crew waited a year for a ship to come to their rescue, which, it soon became apparent, would not come. Six months later, three men decided to set out in a dinghy and managed to cross a distance of to Stewart Island, south of New Zealand's South Island. They then funded a rescue mission to pick up their remaining companions. The crew spent a total of 18 months on the sub-Antarctic island, and despite their ordeal, all survived.  Last voyage  Fran√ßois √âdouard Raynal Grafton was hired by a business consortium of Francois Edouard Raynal, Captain Thomas Musgrave, Charles Sarpy and Musgrave's uncle for a voyage to Campbell Island and the Auckland Islands to investigate mining and sealing opportunities. Raynal had spent six years at sea and eleven years in the Australian goldfields before a mine collapse had necessitated his move to Sydney for recuperation. He had decided to return to France when he was approached by a friend who had good grounds for believing that a mine of argentiferous tin existed in Campbell Island. The friend, a draper known as Charles Sarpy, and his business partner suggested that Raynal could survey this island and discover the mine. Even if no mine was discovered it was suggested that Raynal could take advantage of the large number of seals and hunt them for skins and oil. Raynal agreed to the proposition but on the understanding that he would not undertake the command of the vessel. Sarpy's partner suggested his nephew for the command and Thomas Musgrave was offered the command of the ship. The ship left Sydney for the Campbell Islands on 12 November 1863, with a crew of five. After reaching Campbell Island, Raynal fell very ill and was unable to complete his survey for the tin. Musgrave carried on with the search but was unable to find any trace of tin. With limited numbers of seals and an unsuccessful search for tin at Campbell Island the crew headed to Auckland Islands to hunt seals. = Shipwreck = Grafton entered one of the sounds of the Auckland Islands on 31 December. A heavy gale came on New Year's Day of 1864, which continued into midnight of 2 January when the anchor chains parted, and the vessel struck a rocky beach and foundered. The crew were able to get ashore and managed to salvage food, tools, navigation equipment, Raynal's gun, powder and shot and canvas as well as other material from the wreck. Despite only being provisioned for two months they survived for a year and a half on seal meat, birds, fish and water. They originally made a tent from portions of the spars and sails of the wreck before building a permanent cabin from wreck timber and stone. Raynal had experience in building huts from his time in the goldfields and guided the crew in building a solid cabin with a stone chimney, furnished with stretchers, a dining table and writing desk. However it took some time to build as the only available tools were an axe, an adze, a hammer and a gimlet. The men named the cabin \\"Epigwaitt\\", an American Indian word meaning \\"a dwelling by the water\\" suggested by Musgrave. The men manufactured clothes from sealskin and hunted and fished for food. For entertainment Captain Musgrave started reading classes and Raynal manufactured a chess set, dominoes and a pack of cards. However he found Musgrave to be such a bad loser that he judged it best to destroy the cards. To help ward off scurvy as well as to provide some variety to their diet, Raynal was even able to brew \\"a passable beer\\" from the Stilbocarpa rhizomes which were abundant on the island, boiling and then fermenting them in their own sugar. Captain Musgrave and Raynal had both been hopeful that a ship would be sent by their business partners to investigate what had happened to Grafton, but after 12 months without sighting a single ship, the decision was made to use the timbers from the wreck to \\"make something that will carry us to New Zealand\\". The crew used the tools they had salvaged from the wreck and Raynal created a pair of blacksmith's bellows from metal from the wreck, wood and sealskin. Remains of the Grafton at Carnley Harbour He used the bellows to forge more tools from metal from the wreck. The castaways had made progress on sections of the proposed vessel but were unable to complete it as Raynal found it impossible to manufacture an auger despite a number of attempts. The seals were less numerous than the previous year and the castaways were facing another winter with a greater threat of starvation. The decision was made to work on the ship's clinker dinghy. They enlarged the dinghy by raising the gunwales, adding a false keel and decking it over. Captain Musgrave made sails from the Graftons sails which had previously been on the roof of the cabin. When they tested the boat they found that it was too unsteady with five men so Musgrave was forced to leave Harris and Forg√©s behind. Musgrave, Raynal, and McLaren then set sail on 19 July 1865, arriving at Port Adventure, Stewart Island on 24 July, after five days of bad weather. Captain Cross of Flying Scud took them into his house for a meal, a warm bath and a good night's sleep and then sailed them to Invercargill the next day. Public fundraising in Invercargill raised enough funds for Captain Musgrave to pay Captain Cross of Flying Scud to return him to the Auckland Islands to rescue his two remaining crew members. After successfully retrieving Harris and Forg√©s, Musgrave returned to Invercargill and reunited all the crew. Musgrave also fetched Raynal's bellows back for him. McLaren, Raynal and Forg√©s returned to Melbourne on the schooner Swordfish; Musgrave returned on a steamer captained by a friend of his; Harris remained in New Zealand and headed for the gold fields. Captain Musgrave had kept a diary while being on the island. When he ran out of ink, he continued writing with seal's blood. Both Musgrave and Raynal wrote books about their experience. Raynal's pair of blacksmith's bellows, a pair of boots made of tanned sealskin, and a needle made of bone from the wing of an albatross are said to be in the collection of Melbourne Museum.  Invercauld  The wreck of Grafton occurred four months before the wreck of Invercauld. Both vessels had survivors on the Auckland Islands at the same time but at different ends of the main island. The two groups of survivors were unaware of each other's existence until the Flying Scud visited to pick up the last two of the Grafton castaways. Smoke from a fire was spotted but not investigated. When Flying Scud visited Erebus Cove the crew found the body of a man lying beside the ruins of a house. The man had been dead for some time. The house was one of the Enderby Settlement buildings but the identity of the body was a mystery (the corpse was the 2nd mate of the Invercauld, James Mahoney). A roofing slate beside the man had some illegible writing on it. One foot was bound with woollen rags and the implication was that he starved after no longer being able to fend for himself. The differences in the two castaway groups' survival rates can be put down to the Grafton group, led by Captain Musgrave, being better resourced and organised. They retrieved larger stocks of food, a dinghy with which to travel around the coast, a gun to shoot birds and seals and also had a wreck from which to salvage useful material. The Invercauld group had none of these advantages.

Biography He was a son of a pastor and became a merchant, working at Erfurt and Leipzig. As a strictly religious young man, he saw Napoleon's occupation as the sole reason for the misery of the German people, and thus became his opponent. He set out to assassinate Napoleon, going first to Vienna, and, from there, on 13 October, to Sch√∂nbrunn, where Napoleon was to observe a military parade. One of Napoleon's aides, General Rapp, became suspicious of the young man approaching the emperor despite having previously been refused an audience, and had him arrested. A knife was found and Staps then admitted his plans to kill the emperor. Napoleon asked if Staps would thank him if he was pardoned, to which Staps replied: \\"I would kill you no less.\\" He was executed by firing squad on 17 October 1809.

However, with the development of railways (especially after the opening of the road to Balashov in 1895) in 1896‚Äì1901, the station was expanded and modernized by architect I. Zagoskin, (and completed by architect J. Caune), became one of the largest in the Russian Empire. The current (third) station is built in the \\"Stalin Empire style\\" with elements of classicism. It was opened on 2 November 1952 to replace the previous station, which was destroyed during World War II. Architects ‚Äì G. I. Voloshin, B. S. Mezentsev, E. A. Lymar; engineer S. Owls.

The volume of the station is 80,000 m3, height of the hall is 26 m, the height of the towers is 42 m, the diameter of the clock in the South tower is 4.25 m. In 1950, canopies were constructed over the platforms. Between 1978 and 1982, the building was expanded to the South (to the left of Station Square) in a contemporary style by the project of the Institute Khargiprotrans (architects Y. Murygin, L. V.

One of the more intense storm cells passed directly over the capital city of Perth between 3:30pm and 5:00pm on Monday 22 March 2010. It is the costliest natural disaster in Western Australian history, with the damage bill estimated at A$1.08 billion.\\"Perth's monster March storm damage bill tops $1billion\\" 28 March 2010 Retrieved 17 November 2010 [www.perthnow.com.au \\"Perth Now\\"] 2010 http://www.perthnow.com.au/business/perths-monster-storm-cost- tops-1b/story-e6frg2qc-1225911284768 The storms brought extensive hail, strong winds and heavy rain, causing extensive damage to vehicles, property and trees, and flash flooding, as well as the first significant rainfall in Perth since 20 November 2009. The hail stones are the largest ever known to have occurred in Perth and were around in diameter, which caused extensive damage to property across the city, including schools, hospitals, universities and power infrastructure. Wind gusts were recorded at around . At the peak, around 158,000 homes in Perth, Mandurah and Bunbury lost electric power. Telephone lines were cut to thousands of homes until the next day, and the storms led to an estimated A$200 million worth of insurance claims within three days, with $70 million within the first 24 hours. It was identified as the most expensive natural disaster in Western Australia's history, and was declared a natural disaster by the Premier, Colin Barnett, allowing federal and state funds to be used for disaster relief. The storm brought an end to a lengthy dry spell in Perth, with of rain falling at Mount Lawley ‚Äî the fifth highest daily rainfall recorded for a March day in Perth. Over half of this fell in just 10 minutes. This was the first significant rainfall since 20 November 2009; only had fallen in the entire period. It was similar to storms which struck Melbourne on 6 March 2010. Storm timeline During the warmer summer months, low-level surface troughs normally cross over the west coast of Australia, which often leads to isolated thunderstorm development in inland Western Australia, only occasionally reaching the coast (such as on 20 December 2009, when a storm developed south of Perth and gave the city of Mandurah of rain for the month). However, on 21 and 22 March 2010, high surface dew points and temperatures combined with a low to the west of WA caused rare northerly winds to occur. This meant any storms that formed would be pushed southwards instead of the normal easterly pattern. 21 March 2010 Storms formed in the Geraldton region during the afternoon, putting an end to the city's fourth-longest dry spell, with of rainfall recorded at Geraldton. The township of Badgingarra (halfway between Perth and Geraldton) bore the brunt of storms on both days, receiving . Storms also developed in inland parts of the Gascoyne, where Cue got over of rainfall and Mount Magnet received . 22 March 2010 The Geraldton storm moved out towards the coast during the morning, skipping Perth, but not before putting an end to nearby Mandurah's dry spell with of rainfall and later Bunbury where fell. Seven pole-top fires cut power to 1,200 homes across both cities. A severe thunderstorm warning was later declared for the central west (around Geraldton), lower west (including the cities Perth and Mandurah), central Wheatbelt, Great Southern and southern Gascoyne regions of Western Australia at 9.45am. It was amended at 2.30pm to indicate the threat to Perth. As predicted, storms began to develop in the Jurien Bay area around 2pm, bringing another to an already sodden Badgingarra. At 3pm, the main storm moved over Gingin, dropping the temperature from at 3.06pm to at 3.33pm, and delivering to the township. Perth was next in line for the storms, which first hit the northern suburbs around the Cities of Joondalup and Wanneroo, where fell in two hours at the suburb itself. Hailstones with diameters of 3‚Äì5 cm were reported around suburbs like Osborne Park, Nollamara and Craigie, while hailstones were measured in the inner Perth suburb of Wembley. By 4pm, the Perth storm had reached the southern suburbs and damaging wind gusts had been reported at the suburb of Jandakot (96 km/h). Jarrahdale, to the southeast of Perth, received in half an hour, exceeding the conditions required for a 1 in 100-year flood in terms of a period from 15 to 30 minutes. However, the storm began to lessen in intensity and become larger, forming a multi-squall line as it moved further south. A second wave of storm activity developed behind the first set, delivering further falls to northern Perth. Around 4.30pm, a severe thunderstorm warning was issued for Mandurah and surrounding areas. However, the storm had begun to move further inland, resulting in no hail reported in Mandurah or Rockingham and 17.4/13.4 mm at Garden Island and Mandurah respectively while inland towns such as Dwellingup and Waroona received 30.2 and 26.8mm respectively. Building damage Flash flooding at an intersection in Wellington Street, Perth Damage to a sign on a skyscraper in Perth city caused by hail Around 12,000 individual insurance claims were made in the 24 hours after the storms. The damage zone was defined by a loop from Geraldton to Mandurah through Cue, Merredin and Katanning. A week after the storm, the damage bill was estimated to have reached A$650 million, and was still climbing, making it the most expensive catastrophe in Western Australian history.http://au.news.yahoo.com/thewest/a/-/breaking/7007093/storm-was-most- expensive-catastrophe/ Over 100 people were evacuated from apartments near Kings Park in central Perth after heavy rain cause a large mudslide. Several high schools in Perth's northern suburbs did not open on 23 March due to extensive storm damage. According to the Education Department there was damage to about 70 per cent of classrooms at Ocean Reef High School. Shenton College, Mindarie Senior College, Duncraig Senior High School, Tuart College and Heathridge Primary School were also closed, as was Perth Modern School for students in years 8, 9 and 10.  Car damage  Tens of thousands of cars were damaged by the hail. The cost of fixing the dented panels is high, so many of these damaged cars were written off by the insurance companies covering the damage. The storm dropped a lot of large hail on both a major vehicle retail area Osborne Park damaging millions of dollars of new and used cars (both directly and indirectly when buildings were damaged) and on the Kwinana Freeway.

Modelled after the 400-Series Highways in Ontario, 400-series designations were introduced in 1964 in conjunction with the completion of the Trans-Canada Highway freeway between Vancouver and Clearbrook (present-day Abbotsford); however, unlike their Ontario counterparts, both routes had signalized sections. The 400-series system never expanded beyond two freeways, and in 1973 Highways 401 and 499 were renumbered 1 and 99 respectively, while the former routes were assigned the 'A' suffix. Highway 401 Highway 1 originally followed portions of Old Yale Road and Fraser Highway from Rosedale to Highway 99 (King George Highway) in Surrey, where the two routes shared a common alignment across the Pattullo Bridge and followed a series of streets including Kingsway and Main Street into downtown Vancouver. In 1959, Highway 1 was extended to Horseshoe Bay via the Lions Gate Bridge and Taylor Way in West Vancouver. Major freeway construction commenced in the late 1950s, with the Second Narrows Bridge over Burrard Inlet opening in 1960 in conjunction with Upper Levels Highway opening through North Vancouver; however, it was an expressway had a mix of interchanges and signalized intersections. In 1962, Highway 1 was re-routed to a new expressway. The original Port Mann Bridge opened in 1964 in conjunction with a new highway between Vancouver and Clearbrook and was designated as Highway 401; the Clearbrook-Rosedale section of Highway 1 was restored to its original alignment and the expressway became part of Highway 401\\\\. The Trans-Canada Highway was designated along the newly constructed Highway 401, while Highway 1 between Rosedale and West Vancouver was signed as British Columbia Highway 1 and had a regular provincial highway shield. Highway 401 was a freeway for the majority of its length with exception of some traffic signals along the Upper Levels Highway and small section in Vancouver where it followed Cassiar Street (the sections were replaced by interchanges in the 1990s). Highway 401 was renumbered to Highway 1 in 1973, with former sections of Highway 1 becoming Highway 1A. Highway 499 Highway 99 originally followed the King George Highway from the U.S. border to Highway 1 (Fraser Highway) in Surrey, where the two routes shared a common alignment across the Pattullo Bridge and followed before following a series of streets including Kingsway and Main Street into downtown Vancouver. The 1950s saw a series of Highway improvements connecting Vancouver and Richmond, with the completion of the Oak Street Bridge was built in 1957 across the North Arm Fraser River, and the completion of the Deas Island Tunnel in 1959 across the Fraser River (renamed the George Massey Tunnel in 1967). As part of the project, an expressway was constructed connecting the Deas Island Tunnel to Highway 10 ‚Äì the route connecting downtown Vancouver to Highway 10 was designated as Highway 99B. In 1962, the freeway was extended to 8th Avenue in Surrey and the route (including Highway 99B) was re-designated as Highway 99\\\\. In 1964, Highway 99 was moved back to its former alignment and the freeway was designated as Highway 499, which also followed Oak Street and Granville Street into downtown Vancouver where it linked with Highway 1 and Highway 99\\\\.

It was first released in Japan on December 17, 2011, and in North America, Europe, and other international territories beginning on February 22, 2012. The console is the successor to the PlayStation Portable, and a part of the PlayStation brand of gaming devices; as part of the eighth generation of video game consoles, it primarily competed with the Nintendo 3DS. The original model of the handheld includes a OLED multi-touch capacitive touchscreen, two analog joysticks, and front and shoulder push-button input, and supports Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and optional 3G. The Vita features a quad-core ARM Cortex-A9 MPCore CPU and a quad-core SGX543MP GPU. The PS Vita 2000 series, a revised version of the system, was released across 2013 and 2014. It has all of the same features with a slightly smaller size, extended battery life, and an LCD screen instead of OLED. Sony released the PlayStation TV, a short-lived, re-purposed version of the Vita that uses a television screen like a home video game console, discontinued at the end of 2015. The Vita's design was intended to meld the experience of big budget, dedicated video game platforms with the then up-and- coming trend of mobile gaming as seen on smart phones and tablets. However, in the year after the device's successful launch, sales of the hardware and its bigger budget games stalled, threatening to end its lifespan. A concentrated effort to attract smaller independent developers in the West, combined with strong support from mid-level Japanese companies, helped keep the platform afloat. Though this led to less diversity in its game library, it strengthened support in JRPGs, visual novels, and Western-developed indie games. This built moderate sales in Japan, and a smaller, yet passionate userbase in the West. Though Sony has not released exact sales figures, late-lifespan sales estimates are around 15 to 16 million units. In the platform's later years, Sony promoted the PlayStation Vita's ability to work in conjunction with its other gaming products, such as Remote Play of PlayStation 4 games, similar to the Wii U's function of Off-TV Play. Production of the system and physical cartridge games ended in March 2019. History =Background= After the success of Nintendo's Game Boy family of handheld game consoles throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, with little market competition, and Sony's massive success with its PlayStation and PlayStation 2 home video game consoles around the same time, Sony entered the handheld market as well. In 2004, it released the PlayStation Portable (PSP) to compete with the Nintendo DS as part of the seventh generation of video game consoles. After a slow start in the worldwide market, it was invigorated in Japan with multiple releases in the Monster Hunter series. With the series being less popular in western regions, it failed to revive the platform in the same way. The PSP ended up being a mixed result for the company. It was seen as a success in that it was the only handheld video game platform that had ever significantly competed with Nintendo for market share, with almost 80 million units sold in its lifespan, roughly the same amount as Nintendo's Game Boy Advance had during the sixth generation of video game consoles. This is only a little more than half of the sales of its actual market competitor, the DS, which was more than 150 million units by the end of 2011. Rumors of a successor to the PSP came as early as July 2009 when Eurogamer reported that Sony was working on such a device, which would utilize the PowerVR SGX543MP processor and perform at a level similar to the original Xbox. Through mid-2010, websites continued to run stories about accounts of the existence of a \\"PSP 2\\". Reports arose during the Tokyo Game Show that the device was unveiled internally during a private meeting during mid-September held at Sony Computer Entertainment's headquarters in Aoyama, Tokyo. Shortly after, reports of development kits for the handheld had reportedly already been shipped to numerous video game developers including both first-party and third-party developers to start making games for the device, a report later confirmed by Mortal Kombat Executive Producer Shaun Himmerick. By November, Senior Vice President of Electronic Arts, Patrick Soderlund, confirmed that he had seen that the PlayStation Portable successor existed, but could not confirm details. In the same month, VG247 released pictures of an early prototype version showing a PSP Go-like slide-screen design along with two analog sticks, two cameras and a microphone, though the report mentioned that overheating issues had since caused them to move away from the design in favor of a model more similar to the original PlayStation Portable device. Throughout 2010, Sony would not confirm these reports of a PSP successor, but would make comments regarding making future hardware. Shuhei Yoshida, President of Sony Computer Entertainment Worldwide Studios revealed that his studio, despite usually being more involved with software, had a continued role in future hardware development at the time. In December, Sony Computer Entertainment CEO Kazuo Hirai stated that Sony aimed to appeal to a wide demographic of people by using multiple input methods on future hardware; buttons and joysticks for traditional handheld game system users, and touchscreens for smart phone users. The device was officially announced by Sony on January 27, 2011, at their \\"PlayStation Meeting\\" press conference held by the company in Japan. The system, only known by its code name \\"Next Generation Portable\\", was announced to be a handheld gaming device that aimed for PlayStation 3 quality visuals, which was later clarified to not be taken at a literal level because, according to David Coombes, platform research manager at Sony Computer Entertainment America, \\"Well, it's not going to run at 2 GHz [like the PS3] because the battery would last five minutes and it would probably set fire to your pants\\". Its power was later described by Sony engineers as about halfway between the PSP and PS3. As rumors had suggested, the device was designed to present \\"the best of both worlds\\" between mobile and handheld gaming, including a 5-inch OLED touchscreen, a rear touchpad coupled with physical buttons and dual analog sticks. Sony also revealed that the device would be using a mix of retail and digital distribution of games. Further details were announced at Game Developers Conference 2011, including that Sony would be dropping the PSP's UMD disc format in favor of small game cartridges of 2 GB or 4 GB size variants. along with two cameras, facial detection, head detection and tracking capabilities. =Launch and early years= On June 6, 2011, at E3 2011, Sony announced that the device's official name would be the PlayStation Vita, with the word \\"vita\\" being Latin for \\"life\\". Despite reports of the 2011 earthquakes in Japan delaying the release of the device, Sony reconfirmed that it was on track for a late 2011 release in Japan and a February 2012 release date for other major regions of the world. The release date was later narrowed down to a December 17, 2011, release in Japan, and a February 22, 2012 release date for America and Europe, although a limited edition was released a week earlier in North America on February 15, 2012, which included the 3G/WiFi model of the device, the game Little Deviants, a limited-edition carry case, and a 4 GB memory card. The Vita launched with 26 titles in Japan, with Sony announcing that there were over 100 titles in development prior to the system's release overall. The Vita launched in the west with 25 titles, including original titles such as Uncharted: Golden Abyss and Wipeout 2048, and ports of games such as FIFA 12 and Rayman Origins. The sales of the Vita started strong at launch, but then stalled and greatly underperformed. The Vita had a strong launch in Japan, selling over 300,000 units in its first week of availability, though figures shortly afterwards shrunk down 78% to under 73,000 sold in its second week, and then settled into about 12,000 sold per week in the following weeks. Similarly, in the United States, the system debuted with 200,000 units sold in the first month, before slinking down into an amount of about 50,000 a month. 1.2 million units were reported as sold as of February 26, 2012 ‚Äì after it had launched in most regions. The system continued to get high-profile games over the course of 2012, including Gravity Rush, LittleBigPlanet PS Vita, Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed, Persona 4 Golden, Assassin's Creed III: Liberation, and Call of Duty: Black Ops: Declassified. Despite this, the system still only managed to sell 4 million units worldwide in its first 10 months on the market, and estimated by analysts to only be at 6 million units sold after two years of availability. After 2012, Sony ceased releasing direct sales figures of the Vita, instead opting to release combined sales figures with it and the PSP. Still, the system under-performed; while Sony projected selling 16 million units of combined Vita and PSP systems, it had to slash its forecast twice in the same year‚Äîdown to 12 and then 10 million units sold. With higher profile games not pushing the system sales enough in 2012, big third party companies like Ubisoft and Activision started reducing or eliminating support for the system, especially in the West. Additionally, while the Monster Hunter series had significantly boosted the sales of the PSP, its absence instead hurt the Vita. Its developer, Capcom, had decided to release Monster Hunter Tri and future Monster Hunter games exclusively on the Nintendo 3DS, where it would sell millions of copies for Sony's main competitor. With support diminishing, Shahid Ahmad, Sony's Director of Strategic Content, instead began a new approach to software, through directly reaching out to, and making accommodations for, smaller, independent developers who were previously release games for mobile and PC platforms. While not completely reversing the sales trends of the Vita, the lower costs of making or porting smaller-budget games made it easier for developers to make a profit on the systems's smaller userbase, and in turn, increased consumer attention on the console, keeping the device afloat. Fez, Spelunky, Hotline Miami, and OlliOlli all found success with releases on Vita. Ahmad also maintained interest in the device by directly interacting with consumers on social media; the game Tales of Hearts R was localized into English only because it was number one in a survey of games desired on the platform. Sony continued to support the system with games through 2013 as well, albeit lesser so, with titles such as Killzone: Mercenary and Tearaway, along with a handful of other Western-developed ports such as FIFA 13 and Rayman Legends. While the focus on indie games kept the device afloat in the West, in Japan, no such measures were necessary, as the Vita maintained moderate hardware sales. While it was routinely outsold by its main competitor, the Nintendo 3DS, the Vita still managed to be one of the top consoles sold overall, partially due to Japan's preference towards handheld gaming. Strong support by Japanese developers also helped, with companies such as Bandai Namco, Falcom, Koei Tecmo, 5pb, Compile Heart, Spike Chunsoft, and Atlus releasing many games in the JRPG and visual novels genre to help kept a steady flow of mid-level releases coming to the system. Additionally, big games such as Final Fantasy X/X-2 HD Remaster sold well and roughly in-line with their home console counterparts. The heavier support from Japan, in turn, also helped support the system in the West as well, with many games in the Atelier, Ys, Danganronpa, Persona, and The Legend of Heroes series localized into English on the Vita, or made playable through the system's backward compatibility with digital PSP games. While the system managed to stay afloat as a minor success, other issues continued to persist, including the high price of the system in comparison to its main competitor, the Nintendo 3DS, and its sibling device, the PS3, the high price of its memory cards used for game and data storage,Sony Will Not Cut Price of PS Vita Outside of Japan. IGN (February 21, 2013). Retrieved on July 16, 2013. and the increasing popularity of smartphones and tablets. In August 2013, Sony addressed the first two, dropping the price to $199 in North America and ‚Ç¨199 in Europe, and cutting the suggested retail price of the memory cards as well. The price cut also coincided with the release of a slight redesign of the system, the \\"PS Vita 2000\\" model. The redesign included making the system 20% thinner and 15% lighter, while adding 1 GB of internal storage, and an extra hour of battery life. However, the redesign did remove the OLED screen in favor of a cheaper LCD screen. =Shifting focus= Towards the end of 2013, around the launch of Sony's next video game device, the home video game console the PlayStation 4, Sony began making comments in regards to the change in focus with the Vita. Yoshida stated that Sony would be releasing fewer first party games for the platform. Sony Computer Entertainment's Product Planning & Platform Software Innovation Director Don Mesa stated that the \\"economics simply don‚Äôt work with the traditional process\\". Sony addressed the \\"economics of Vita game development\\" issue with beginning on focusing on the fact that almost all PlayStation 4 games could be streamed and played through a Vita through Remote Play. Sony attempted to attach the device to the PS4 due to its extreme popularity; it took only a few weeks for the sales to surpass the sales of the Vita over the course of almost two years. In July 2014, Yoshida stated that the company would focus on it less as a dedicated handheld video game console, and more on its combination of uses, stating \\"it's not about individual Vita games any more. It's more about how Vita can have multiple uses ‚Äì with PS4 Remote Play, PS3 games with PS Now, and the dedicated games. The whole ecosystem with PS4 at the center, the Vita's a part of that.\\" Sony later announced that the Vita will have PlayStation VR integration in the form of a second screen as well. Open beta trials for PlayStation Now functionality on the PS Vita began on October 14, 2014 in North America. The PlayStation TV, released across late 2013 and 2014, also aimed to expand the system's userbase by allowing for Vita games to be played on a television like a home console, though the device was discontinued in the West by the end of 2015, and did not fare well in Japan's handheld-focused region either. In November 2014, SCEA president Shawn Layden suggested that the new approach was working on hardware level, stating that Vita sales had increased since the implementation of PS4 Remote Play, though he and another Sony representative did not give specific figures. Sony continued to make games for the device, though in smaller number than in past. The last major Sony-developed title, Freedom Wars, still found success, selling over 188,000 copies in its first week of release in Japan. The debut was the highest Sony game debut for the system, and the second highest, only to Namco Bandai's late 2013 release of God Eater 2 on the platform. In September 2015, Yoshida stated that Sony had no current plans for a Vita successor, stating that \\"climate is not healthy for now because of the huge dominance of mobile gaming.\\" At E3 2015, he had stated that Sony would not be making any more AAA, big budget games to the system, but by October, the comment had been revised that Sony would not be making any more games for it at all. Reasons cited included the company focusing on supporting the PS4, and the fact that it felt that third party Japanese developers and Western indie developers were sufficiently supporting the device. In March 2016, Sony announced that instead, it would be forming a new company, \\"Forward Works\\", and be instead concentrating on bringing PlayStation-based games to mobile platforms like iOS and Android. Despite Sony's focus on the PS4 and mobile for the future, the Vita still continued to receive substantial third party company game support in the way of Japanese-style role-playing games and visual novels and Western-style indie video games through 2017. Minecraft in particular was successful for the platform, with it selling over 1.2 million physical copies in Japan alone as of September 2017. The device is considered to have sold fairly well in Japan, and still a crucial part of Sony's overall strategy in the region, while Sony has acknowledged that the device still has a very vocal and passionate user-base in the West as well, with the company still encouraging third party companies to create games for the device. At the 2016 Game Developers Conference, research analyst firm EEDAR estimated the sales of the Vita to be about at 10 million unit sold through the end of 2015. Multi-platform releases with the PS4 have also incidentally helped sustain the Vita's stream of software, even in the west, through 2016 and 2017; games receive a Vita version more to appeal to Japan's larger Vita user-base, and receive a PS4 version more to appeal to North America's larger user-base. The March 2017 launch of the Nintendo Switch, which operates on a similar concept of providing high budget video games on a portable unit, further overshadowed the Vita, though niche support through indie games and JRPGs continued into the year. In mid-2017, Glixel estimated the Vita userbase to be around 15 million. On September 20, 2018, Sony announced at Tokyo Game Show 2018 that the Vita would be discontinued in 2019, ending its hardware production. Worldwide production of new physical Vita games ceased by the end of Sony's 2018 fiscal year, which ended on March 31, 2019. At the time of the announcement, USgamer estimated that the Vita userbase had grown to approximately 16 million units. Production of Vita hardware officially ended on March 1, 2019. Hardware center In line with Sony's ambition to combine aspects of traditional video game consoles with mobile devices like smartphones and tablets, the Vita contains a multitude of input methods. The device features a \\"super oval\\" shape similar to the design of the original PlayStation Portable, with a qHD OLED capacitive touchscreen in the centre of the device. The device features two analog sticks, a D-pad, a set of standard PlayStation face buttons (Triangle, Circle, Cross and Square), two shoulder buttons (L and R), a PlayStation button and Start and Select buttons. Motion control is also possible through Sony's Sixaxis motion sensing system, consisting of a three-axis gyroscope and a three-axis accelerometer. In addition to these input methods, specific to just the Vita, is a secondary touchpad that is on the back of the device. Other hardware includes stereo speakers, a microphone, built-in Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth 2.1+EDR connectivity, and two cameras. The cameras are both 0.3 megapixel and run at 640√ó480 (VGA) at 60 frames/s, or at 320√ó240 at 120 frames/s. They can be used to take photos or videos using built-in applications on the system. The two cameras feature the abilities of face detection, head detection, and head tracking. The platform also launched with a model with 3G mobile data support, which required a separate data plan through a data provider. The 3G service has been partnered with NTT DoCoMo in Japan, AT&T; in the US, Rogers in Canada and Vodafone in Europe and Australia. The 3G model was discontinued in 2013 and not made available in the system's future revised models. Internally, the device features a custom system on chip with a quad-core ARM Cortex-A9 MPCore processor and a quad-core GPU SGX543MP4+. Sony has stated that the Vita generally runs well under its full clock speed due to overheating and battery consumption issues that would ensue, instead placing its processing power \\"around halfway between the current PSP and the PS3\\". The Vita's internal battery has between 3‚Äì5 hours of power for game playing, depending on the processing power required for the game, screen brightness, sound level and network connections, as well as other factors. Additionally, the battery can supply about five hours for video watching, and up to nine hours of music listening with the screen off. The system does allow for additional external battery solutions as well. The PlayStation Vita has 512 MB of system RAM and 128 MB of VRAM. The amount of RAM allows cross-game chat to be used on the system. Software for the PlayStation Vita is distributed on a proprietary flash memory card called \\"PlayStation Vita game card\\" rather than on Universal Media Discs (UMDs) as used by the PlayStation Portable. The size and shape of the card itself is very similar to an SD card. 5‚Äì10% of the game card's space is reserved for game save data and patches. The PS Vita is incompatible with standard memory cards, such as SD cards, and instead stores data on proprietary PS Vita memory cards, which are available in sizes of 4 GB, 8 GB, 16 GB, 32 GB and 64 GB. A maximum of 500 applications and games can be stored on the device at a time, regardless of data storage available.PS Vita System Software Update 3.10 Coming Soon. PlayStation Blog. Retrieved on March 25, 2014. When the limit is reached, applications or games must be moved or deleted in order to access those beyond the limit. =Remote Play interactivity with PlayStation 4= All games developed for the PlayStation 4, with the exception of games requiring the use of special peripherals such as PlayStation Camera, are playable on the Vita through Remote Play. With the use of a Vita, PS4, and PS4 game, this allows a PS4 game to be run on the PS4, but its output transmitted to the Vita, with the Vita being used for the controller input, and the image and sound being transmitted to the Vita's screen and speakers instead of a television. The end result is similar to what a Wii U console does with its GamePad controller through Off-TV Play. The Vita technically has Remote Play functionality with the PlayStation 3 as well, though very few PS3 games supported the feature due to limitations with the less-powerful PS3 hardware. More PS3 games are available for streaming on the Vita through Sony's cloud gaming service PlayStation Now, though they are streamed over the internet in the form of cloud computing rather than directly from a physical PS3 console. First implemented in 2014, the service was announced to be discontinued on the Vita on August 15, 2017. =Revised model= The second generation PS Vita system, PCH-2000 A revised model of the Vita was released in Japan on October 10, 2013, in Europe on February 7, 2014 and in North America on May 6, 2014. The revised model, officially called the PCH-2000 series2013-09-09, „ÄêÈÄüÂ†±„ÄëÊñ∞ÂûãPS Vita„Åå10Êúà10Êó•„Çà„Çä19929ÂÜÜ(Á®éËæº)„ÅßÁô∫Â£≤ÔºÅ„ÄêSCEJA„Éó„É¨„Çπ„Ç´„É≥„Éï„Ç°„É¨„É≥„Çπ„Äë, Famitsu and commonly referred to as the PS Vita Slim, is 20% thinner and 15% lighter compared to the original model. While it largely maintains the original's overall structure and layout, the original's OLED screen has been replaced with a lower-cost LCD display. The model also roughly added about an extra hour of battery life. The newer model also comes with 1 GB of internal storage memory, although it is not possible to use both the internal memory and memory card concurrently.2013-10-11, PS Vita Slim internal storage not usable with a memory card, JustPushStart Upon inserting a PS Vita memory card, the system will offer to copy the existing data from the internal memory to the new card. This model has a micro USB Type B port, which can be used to charge the device along with any standard micro USB cable. The model was released in six colors in Japan (white, black, light blue, lime green, pink, and khaki), although it was only released in black and light blue in North America and Europe. =PlayStation TV= A picture of the PlayStation Vita TV, showing the ports on its back side The PlayStation TV is a non-portable variant of the Vita; instead of featuring its own display screen like a handheld video game console, it connects to a television via HDMI like a traditional home video game console, and is controlled though the use of a DualShock 3 or DualShock 4 controller. Due to the difference in controller input between the Vita and a DualShock controller, Vita games that are dependent on the system's touch- screen, rear touchpad, microphone, or camera are not compatible.2013-09-09, SONY COMPUTER ENTERTAINMENT INTRODUCES PLAYSTATION(R) VITA TV (Corporate Release), Sony Computer Entertainment It also shares the Remote Play and PS Now functionality of a regular Vita. The system was released in Japan in November 2013, in North America in October 2014, and in Europe on November 14, 2014.2014-08-12, Gamescom 2014: PlayStation TV Launches in October, Bringing PS4 Remote Play to Your TV, Gamespot The device did not fare well and had a short retail shelf life in North America and Europe, where it was discontinued at the end of 2015. Software =Game library= Physical software for the Vita is distributed on a proprietary flash memory card called \\"PlayStation Vita game card\\". All Vita games are also made available to be downloaded digitally on the PlayStation Network via the PlayStation Store, although not all games are released physically. Since its launch, digital-only releases have slowly become more prominent, partially in an effort to reduce production costs for release on the platforms comparatively smaller user-base, and partially due to the influx smaller-scale indie mobile phone games that have always been digital-only releases. Like the PS3 and PS4, the Vita contains Trophy support for games. The system was designed so that it would be easy for developers to extract PS3 game assets and in turn use them to make Vita versions of games. Prior to the Vita's release, several third-party studios showcased tech demos of the device by exporting existing assets from their PlayStation 3 counterpart and then rendering them on the device, high budget examples including Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots, Yakuza 4, and Lost Planet. While none of these particular high budget tech demos materialized into actual game releases, and few big-budget Western games would be made for both outside of PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale, many Japanese development teams would go on to develop mid-level games that would release for both platforms, including Falcom's Trails of Cold Steel duology, Compile Hearts' original Hyperdimension Neptunia trilogy, and many entries from Tecmo Koei's Atelier and Dynasty Warriors series. The trend continued on the PS4 as well, with Vita/PS4 releases becoming common due to the spread of their userbases ‚Äì Vita versions for Japan, where the Vita was larger in its initial years, and PS4 versions of games for North America and Europe, where the PS4 userbase was substantially larger. Few PlayStation 2 titles were ported to the Vita due to the PS2's complicated infrastructure ‚Äì games that did, such as Final Fantasy X/X2 Remaster and Persona 4 Golden required extensive reworking, or were based on their PS3 counterparts, such as Jak and Daxter Collection, Ratchet and Clank Collection, and Sly Cooper Collection. Towards the end of its lifespan, Vita versions of games began to be cancelled, in favor of PS4 or Nintendo Switch releases. =Backward compatibility= The device is backward compatible with most PSP games; however, its lack of a UMD disc drive limits this capability to those titles which have been digitally released on the PlayStation Network via the PlayStation Store, but not physical PSP games or films. The Vita is also backward compatible with the majority of the PS one Classics ‚Äì the group of PlayStation 1 games Sony has made available digitally for download, and PlayStation Minis ‚Äì small-budget downloadable titles originally created for the PSP and PS3. Games from Sony's PlayStation Mobile initiative had initially been compatible, but were removed when the service was shutdown in September 2015. In Japan, select downloadable PC Engine and PocketStation titles became backward compatible as well.2013-11-04, Play Chocobo World On Vita, PocketStation Is A Downloadable App In Japan, Siliconera =Applications= A number of applications are available to run on the Vita, some initially pre-loaded on the device, while others are available via Sony's PlayStation Store. Pre-loaded apps include an internet browser, a \\"Content Manager\\" app for monitoring data saved to the device, an email app, a music playing app, a photo app, and a video playing app. The system's web browser supports HTML5, cookies, and JavaScript, but not Adobe Flash. Also included was \\"Near\\", a social media/GPS like app that allowed the user to see other Vita players in the area, and what games or applications they had been using, with the opportunity for some limited interactivity and communication, although most of its functionality was disabled in 2015. A number of other third party apps commonly found on mobile devices have also been made available on the Vita: Crunchyroll, Facebook (removed in 2015), Flickr (broken), Google Maps (removed in 2015), Hulu, LiveTweet (Sony's third-party client for Twitter), MLB.tv (broken), Netflix, Redbox Instant (discontinued), Skype (removed in 2016), TuneIn (broken), Twitch, WeatherNation and YouTube (removed in 2015). Facebook, Flickr, Google Maps and YouTube no longer function as Vita apps, but continue to be available by using the Vita's web browser. =System software= LiveArea, the user interface for the Vita Unlike the PSP and PlayStation 3, the PlayStation Vita does not use the XrossMediaBar interface. Instead, it uses a touchscreen-based UI dubbed LiveArea, which includes various social networking features via the PlayStation Network. Each game or application is represented by its own circle icon, and selecting it leads the user to a panel with multiple options present, including running software itself, going to its respective website through the internet, seeing if there are downloadable updates available for the software, and seeing a newsfeed-like list of activities related to it, such as installing it or obtaining trophies, for both the user and others the user has interacted with recently. Reception and sales According to review aggregator Metacritic, the Vita's original hardware release was generally well-received with critics, although a few concerns persisted as well. Metacritic editor Jason Dietz noted that reviewers tended to praise the Vita's actual hardware design and operating system, but expressed some concern on its practicality, namely competing in 2012 onward, with a large size and price, where mobile phones with large screens and cheap games were prevalent as an alternative. As of its initial Western launch in February 2012, out of 44 professional critic reviews, 9 fell in the \\"Great\\" rating, 29 in the \\"Good\\" rating, 6 in the \\"Mixed\\" rating, and 0 in the \\"Bad\\" or \\"Awful\\" rating. Its initial launch sales were generally seen as positive, selling over 300,000 units in Japan, and 200,000 units in North America. However, a large dropoff occurred in both regions. In Japan, second-week sales dropped 78%, and leveled off at selling about 12,000 units per week. Similarly, sales dropped off to about 30,000 to 50,000 units sold per month for the year after launch in North America. Overall, Sony fell far short of the worldwide sales targets of 10 million Vitas sold by the end of March 2013. The device sold 1.2 million units as of the end of February 2012, 4 million by the end of 2012, and were only estimated by analysts to have reached 6 million by the end of 2013, figures that have not been confirmed due to Sony's ceasing to release Vita sales figures after hitting the 4 million mark at the end of 2012. Views on the hardware dropped to more moderate levels in 2013, after the platform's initial sales lulls. Surveys in Japan showed that consumers were not purchasing the device due to its high retail price and perceived lack of software variety, and that current Vita owners only showed a 46% rate of approval for the device and its software library. Similarly, many Western critics felt that the low sales through 2013 would lead to an early death for the product. From 2013 onward, Sony was able to reverse the trajectory of the system by changing focus, aiming to be more of a niche product than one with mass market appeal ‚Äì focusing more on small Western mobile phone games and mid-level Japanese developed games, and attaching it to the rise of popularity of its PlayStation 4 platform with its remote play connectivity functions. Sony also released the Vita model revision, the PCH-2000, which was generally well received by critics as well for addressing a number prior complaints about the system, which included a price and size reduction. However, reviewers felt more mixed on the decision to change from OLED to LCD screen in the revised model, with some feeling it led to a minor downgrade in image quality. While not giving specific figures, Sony stated that Vita sales beat projections in North America in 2014, which it was happy and surprised with, sometimes even falling out of stock. Similar response was found in the UK as well. The platform has been considered to have sold well in Japan, where it outsold the PS4 in 2015, and reached 5 million units sold in 2016 according to sales tracker Media Create. It also obtained million-selling software in the same year, with the Japanese Vita release of Minecraft. By the end of 2015, research firm EEDAR estimated the sales of the Vita worldwide to be around 10 million. Despite the smaller userbase, the platform continued to be viable for game releases into 2017 due to the high attach rate of software sold per hardware user. Limited Run Games and various indie game developers praised the platform for its wide selection of more original and niche video games, and the strong respective sales of them. In mid-2017, Glixel estimated that approximately 15 million units of the system had been sold, while by September 2018, USGamer estimated it had grown to about 16 million units.

It is no longer in business. History Gibson's of Moffat was formed by James and Elizabeth Gibson in 1919. It initially operated a service between Moffat and Dumfries.Moffat Probus Club meeting. Dumfries and Galloway Standard, 7 April 2010 The war saw heavy loading on buses on the Dumfries services, which served army camps on route. Moffat served as a training area for many nationalities throughout the Second World War. By 1946 the firm had six vehicles, employed five conductresses and four drivers. A new route between Whitehead and Dumfries railway station was introduced in 1986 following deregulation. This route later passed to MacEwan's. In 1993 a humanitarian trip was undertaken to war-torn Croatia and the 2,500 mile round trip lasted 10 days. Clothing and money donated by the people of south west Scotland were taken to give to the needy there. On 21 November 2007, Gibsons of Moffat ceased trading.Dumfries Courier - 15 April 1994Dumfries & Galloway Standard 8 April 1994Moffat News 22 November 2007 Vehicles Gibson's first vehicle was a Ford Model T which carried both passengers and goods. Fleet renewal before and after the Second World War saw four Albion PK115s and a PHl14 along with an Irvine-bodied Leyland LTSA in service by 1948. By 1949 the firm had a Leyland TD4c and a Leyland-bodied Leyland PD2 demonstrator, that was actually paid for with a suitcase full of ¬£750 in notes. Two Scottish Aviation-bodied Albions joined the fleet in 1950, followed in 1950 by a Guy Arab 1-decker in 1954 and a Guy Arab IV in 1963. New Ford R-Series coaches were bought in the 1970s - one was a fairly rare Willowbrook 002 model, after which a Plaxton Panorama Elite example and two with Duple Dominant body's were added. After the Fords, a Bedford with Van Hool bodywork which was destined not to operate in the fleet after type approval issues caused too much of a delay to its entry into service. In 1978 the first new heavy weight coach was added to the fleet, OSM 588S, being the first of three 12 metre Leyland Leopards with Plaxton Supreme Bodywork. While most of the fleet were single- deckers, Gibson's continued a long history of having double deckers in the fleet. An ex-Edinburgh PD2/20 was operated in the early 1970s while the tenth and last double decker, a Northern Counties-bodied Leyland PS1 was bought in 1975 and retired in August 1978. Changes in bus demand and car ownership made the single-deckers the best choice on local bus routes. A Volvo B10M coach was ordered with Van Hool Alizee bodywork in 1982 and remained in the fleet right up until the end, some 25 years later. The B10M continued to feature in the fleet with various second hand examples being added, including a Berkhof Esprit, and a Duple Caribbean. The move to rear engined coaches started with the purchase of a new Van Hool Alicron which had an MAN drive train. A second- hand example was also added to the fleet and both coaches went on to give many years of service. There was a brief return to Volvo in 1989 when an Ikarus Danube was added to the fleet, An example of the rare Volvo C10M was bought in 1994, and was sold on in 1997. New coaches appeared again in 2000 when a new Bova Futura was added to the fleet. Another new example was bought two years later along with two second hand examples in 2003. The biggest intake of new vehicles occurred in 2006 when five new Setras were added to the fleet. These cost of ¬£1.2million to purchase.

It works with partners in industry on a range of activities, including translating research discoveries into products, making knowledge and research expertise available through consultancies, contract research and provision of analytical services, as well as partnering industry in training both undergraduate and postgraduate students.  Research  Across the RAE 2008 assessment period (7 years), the School won ¬£38.5 million in peer-reviewed, competitive grant funding, representing an annual external funding rate of almost ¬£5 million. Over 90% of research income is won from the UK Research Councils, the EU, or research charities. Research in the School of Biological Sciences also has links with national organisations such as the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquacultural Science, the Public Health Laboratory Service, and connections to international organisations as diverse as the US Department of Energy, the Norwegian Institute for Nature Research, and Birdlife International. Research is split into 3 major themes: * The Organisms and the Environment theme investigates an array of basic and strategic questions in evolutionary biology, organismic biology, ecology and biodiversity conservation using a combination of field and laboratory studies on a range of animal and plant taxa. Emphasis is placed on understanding specific adaptations simultaneously at the gene and whole-organism level, and on applying sound basic scientific principles to tackling pressing questions in conservation and applied biology.AL Perry, PJ Low, JR Ellis, J. D. Reynolds (2005). Climate change and distribution shifts in marine fishes. Science. 308: 1912-1915. * The Cells and Tissues theme focuses on understanding tissue specification and function in health and disease. A multidisciplinary approach is taken to define mechanisms that direct development and tissue maintenance and the role environmental factors play in the pathogenesis of disease. Strengths in cell and developmental biology, extracellular matrix and pericellular protease research and medically oriented studies of human diseases provide a basis to improve therapeutic manipulations in translational research.G Duncan, IM Wormstone, CSC Liu, JM Marcantonio, PD Davies (1997). Thapsigargin coated intraocular lenses inhibit human lens cell growth. Nature Medicine: 3, 1028-1030. * The Molecules and Pathways theme has broad interests which address many aspects of the fundamental molecular properties of biological phenomena. These range from the molecular structural biology of metallo-enzymes, through to the role of lipids in the pathogenic properties of trypanosomes.DX Xie, BF Feys, S James, M Nieto-Rostro, JG Turner (1998).

The Human Research Facility Holter Monitor (Holter) is a battery-powered, noninvasive electrocardiogram (ECG) device that accurately measures the heart rate of crew members over an extended period of time (up to 24 or 48 hours). ECG information is stored on a Portable Computer Memory Card International Adapter (PCMCIA) card and downlinked to Earth for analysis after monitoring is complete.http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/science/experiments/Holter.html Description Facility Summary : * The Human Research Facility Holter Monitor (Holter) is a modified commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) device that accurately records the electrical activity of a crew-member's heart over an extended period of time (up to 24 or 48 hours). This noninvasive electrocardiogram (ECG) device is available to support future experiments. * The Holter is a three-channel, seven-lead ECG that can be placed in a variety of configurations, powered by one, two, or three 9V alkaline batteries, depending on the length of recording and desired sampling rate. * The Holter contains a removable Portable Computer Memory Card International Adapter (PCMCIA) card that allows the data to be stored, downloaded to a personal computer, and downlinked. The Human Research Facility Holter Monitor (Holter) measures and records the electrical activity of a crew member's heart. The Holter is a battery-powered digital recorder that is capable of recording the electrocardiogram (ECG) data continuously for up to 24 or 48 hours. The Holter currently in use on the International Space Station is manufactured by Spacelabs Healthcare, Incorporated, of Issaquah, Washington. The Holter measures heart rates ranging from 0 to 240 beats per minute (bpm) at a sampling rate of 128 or 256 Hz. It measures ECG signals ranging from -2.5 to +2.5 mV (normal mode) and -5 to +5 mV (half-gain mode) at a sampling rate of 128 Hz or 256 Hz with an accuracy of +/- 2 percent of full range. Operations The Human Research Facility (HRF) Holter accessories kit is stowed during launch and landing. Prior to using the Holter, the crew-member takes the HRF Holter accessories kit from stowage, uses the razor to shave the electrode sites, wipes the area clean with biocide wipes, and applies the electrode pads to the chest in the configuration depicted on the placard. The crew-member then dons the hardware, attaches the Holter harness to the main unit, and activates the hardware. At the end of the recording period, the crew-member deactivates, doffs, and stows the hardware. For data download, the crew-member removes the hard disk card assembly from the main unit, plugs the card into the HRF personal computer (PC), and downloads the data to the HRF PC. Downlink of the Holter data is accomplished as part of HRF rack activities.

The mountain has two main summits, the lower western peak (Kang Yatze II) is easier (Alpine PD) and more frequently climbed, although lower at about 6270m. The higher eastern peak is the true summit (Kang Yatze I) although less frequently climbed as it is across a technically difficult knife-edge traverse. An alternative is to climb the North East ridge then directly up the steep snow face (Alpine AD+/D-). Approach Route - 6270 meter peak is mainly done from mid-June till September end. There are two approach routes to this peak. One is from Chilling and trekking through the Markha Valley, passing by the villages of Skiu, Markha and Hankar. Another approach starts from the village of Shang Sumdo and steeply climbs up the Markha Gorge passing by the campsite of Chyuskirmo, Lartsa and then climbing the Gongmaru La, a 5130 meter high pass to reach Nimaling. This route climbs up very fast and one needs to rest in Nimaling to acclimatize better before trekking to the base camp at 5000 meters. Climbing Kang Yatse Peak 2 (elevation ) is easier compared to the main peak and does not require any technical mountaineering skills. The climbing team usually starts the summit attempt between 12 AM to 2 AM and it takes about 6 ‚Äì 8 hours to reach the summit. The route climbs on scree zone before climbing up on steep snow slope. Early in the season in June and July can have snow from the base camp itself making the climb more slow and difficult. From the top distant peaks of East Karakoram are visible on a clear day. Climbing Kang Yatse 1 requires an intermediate Camp to be set up. The climb to Camp 1 is a short one but over a steep scree zone. There is an alternative route following the Glacier where Camp 1 can be set up too. From Camp 1, the climb gets technical. The last 500 meters of the peak is very steep and requires fixed ropes.

Geography The monastery is situated to the west of the city of Rapperswil, below the Lindenhof of Rapperswil Castle on the shore of Lake Z√ºrich on a peninsula called the Endingerhorn.  History  The friary was established in 1606, consisting originally of only four patres (priests) and three brothers (friars), as a Roman Catholic counterpart to the centre of the Reformation in Z√ºrich. The monastic buildings were built by the citizens of Rapperswil, and belong to the locality of Rapperswil, while Endingen - the site of the buildings - belongs to Einsiedeln Abbey.Kapuzinerkloster Rapperswil official website The friary was dedicated on 23 September 1607 by bishop Johannes V Flugi von Aspermont and is still in use. In 1662 the buildings were fortified: a small fort was built at Endingerhorn, and the monastery became part of the town walls as a fortified tower to the west of the city of Rapperswil.  Sights  The friary is renowned for its location by the lake on a rocky peninsula. It overlooks Lake Zurich in the Kempratner Bucht (\\"Bay of Kempraten\\"). The rose gardens and the Antoniusgrotte, dedicated to Saint Anthony of Padua, attract pilgrims. The lakeside location of its church is also popular for weddings. The Einsiedlerhaus is in origin the medieval bailiff's house of Einsiedeln Abbey, whence the name, and is situated at the former late 10th century ferry gate to the islands of L√ºtzelau and Ufenau.  Activities  In November 1992 the monastery opened its doors for guests, both men and women, to participate for at least one week with the monastic community. In addition, the Swiss chapter of the order allowed the community to seek new forms of prayer and liturgy. As of 2010, nine brothers and two nuns (Orders of Baldegg and Menzingen) are living in the monastery.

These are Sites of Special Scientific Interest, and are being targeted for development as a possible tourist and educational resource.The Caves , Minera Quarry Trust History The area shows signs of use by Neolithic and Bronze Age farmers, and evidence of early inhabitants of the area exists in the form of several stone cairns and other features.Abandoned Landscapes - A Short But Wild Road Through The Hills, megalithic.co.uk, accessed 23-03-10 The Making of the Vale of Llangollen and Eglwyseg Historic Landscape, Clwyd-Powys Archaeological Trust The high ground was good summer pasture, and in the mediaeval period there are references to hafodydd (summer houses for those overseeing the grazing flocks) in the possession of Valle Crucis Abbey on the northern part of Esclusham Mountain. Though there may have been small-scale mining of lead on the mountain in earlier periods, development of the area's mineral resources started in earnest from the eighteenth century and into the nineteenth, with the application of techniques brought from Cornwall. The mines were further developed in the nineteenth century under the guidance of the mining engineer and entrepreneur John Taylor: at their peak they were the most productive lead mines in Britain. Landscape and wildlife The lower eastern slopes of the mountain have a landscape of pastureland, small farms and woods.Landscape Character - Eastern Slopes of Ruabon Mountain, Wrexham County Borough The higher moorland above Fron-d√™g, known as the Fron-d√™g Flat, has typical moorland vegetation of heather, bilberry and sedge; rarer plants include the dark red helleborine. Hill farming is still practised, with sheep grazing across the moor. There are still surface remains of former lead workings, particularly in the areas known as Pool Park and Gwter Siani, with the foundations of old engine-houses, managers' residences and chimneys being visible in some places. The moorland supports a rich variety of wildlife including black grouse, red grouse, short- eared owl and ring ouzel. A single-track road runs across the northern part of the mountain from Minera, through Pool Park and Gwter Siani, to Eglwyseg and on towards Llangollen. Several footpaths, popular with ramblers, also run across the mountain, including the Offa's Dyke Path.

The Second War arose from lingering issues from the First. The Treaty of Edinburgh‚ÄìNorthampton by which the First War had been settled had never been popularly accepted among the English, and it had created a new group of disenfranchised nobles called the \\"disinherited\\" who felt unduly deprived by it of their rights to Scottish lands. One of these \\"disinherited\\" was Edward Balliol, son of a former Scottish king. With the discreet backing of Edward III of England, Balliol demanded the return of his ancestral lands, and when these were not forthcoming invaded Scotland, following which he had himself crowned King of Scots, despite the young David II already holding the title. What followed became both a war of succession and civil war, as some Scottish citizens rose in defense of David II and others cast their lot with Edward Balliol, who was soon joined in his efforts by the English king. David II was forced to take shelter under the \\"Auld Alliance\\" with Philip VI of France until he reached his majority, while a series of guardians including future Scottish king Robert Stewart fought back and forth battles with Balliol and Edward III for territory in Scotland. Upon his majority, he returned, but was not long in Scotland before he was captured by the English, following which he served for the rest of the Second War as a bargaining point. The politics of the situation were ever complex. The Scottish faced discord in their own ranks, as various nobles jockeyed for position and power both before and after the majority of David II. Balliol's English allies grew distracted from his cause by their own growing preoccupation with France, with whom they were poised to enter the Hundred Years' War. The same conflict weakened the ability of the French to aid the Scots in their battles. Eventually, after several decades of repeated engagements, the Second War of Scottish Independence was settled with the signing of the Treaty of Berwick in 1357. Balliol had already relinquished his claim to the Scottish crown to Edward III, who dropped his pursuit of Scotland and released the then-captive David II in return for a pledge of 100,000 merks. Background The First War began when the English invaded Scotland in 1296, forcing the Scottish King John Balliol to abdicate, and ended shortly after Edward II of England was deposed and killed in 1327. Following Edward II's death, Robert the Bruce invaded Northern England and, on 1 May 1328, forced the adolescent Edward III of England to sign the Treaty of Edinburgh‚ÄìNorthampton which recognised the independence of Scotland with Bruce as King. To further seal the peace, Robert's very young son and heir David married Joan, the likewise youthful sister of Edward III. When Robert the Bruce died in 1329, he left his five-year-old son David heir to his throne. David II was crowned and anointed king of Scotland on 24 November 1331.Lang, 243. Until his own sudden death in 1332, Thomas Randolph, 1st Earl of Moray, would serve as regent. But the so-called \\"Peace of Northampton\\" was to be short-lived.Creighton, 219. Edward III had not acted under his own auspices, but under the pressure of his regent, Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March, and his mother Isabella of France.Weir, 314. Dubbed by the English \\"the shameful peace\\", the Treaty had failed to make war reparations to a group of nobles with land and position in both England and Scotland whose property and titles had been bestowed on the Bruce's allies.Weir, 313‚Äì314.In 2002, Cameron and Ross challenge the widely held assumption that no provisions for restorations were made in the Treaty, but suggest that instead a clause that did make such provisions was not honoured. With a depleted treasury and an increasingly unpopular regent controlling the throne, the outraged English people and the minor king of England were not yet in position to attempt to do anything about it. But the year following the coronation of David II, 1330, two significant events occurred: Edward III had his regent executed, taking control of his crown and country,Creighton, 229. and Edward Balliol made an appeal to the English king. Edward Balliol was the eldest son of John Balliol, who had been forced to abdicate the Scottish throne following the invasion of 1296, and Isabella de Warenne, daughter of John de Warenne, 6th Earl of Surrey and Alice of Lusignan. An important figurehead and chief among the disinherited, Edward Balliol wanted the return of certain ancestral lands, and at the end of the year Edward III conveyed his demands to David II's regent, Thomas Randolph. When Thomas Randolph delayed response, Edward III pressed the matter, repeating the request on 22 April 1332. And though Edward III did not openly give his support, Balliol and his followers began preparing for invasion of Scotland.Brown, 232. The repelled invasion of Edward Balliol ‚Äì 1332 The first skirmish of the Second War of Scottish Independence took place in August 1332, when Edward Balliol and his Disinherited followers took the day at the Battle of Dupplin Moor.Liddy, 59. The decisive victory left the invaders well placed in Scotland, where their ranks swelled as those who had not supported the Bruce cast their lots. Particularly prominent among Balliol's supporters were residents of Fife and Strathearn.Brown, 234. On 24 September, Edward Balliol was crowned the King of Scots, under which title he continued to rally supporters and to march across the country, settling in Roxburgh.Brown, 234‚Äì235. There, on 23 November, Edward Balliol offered his loyalty to Edward III as his liege, offering also to wed David II's sister and to give Edward III substantial lands in Scotland.Lang, 246. He also pledged his support to Edward III's future battles on penalty of all of Scotland and its isles. Afterward, he withdrew to Annan, but did not long remain there before he was driven from Scotland in a battle led by Sir Archibald Douglas and John Randolph, 3rd Earl of Moray.Brown, 235.Boardman (2004). David II's resistance had been hampered even before the first skirmish by the unexpected illness and death of his Guardian. Thomas Randolph was briefly replaced by Domhnall II, Earl of Mar, but the new Guardian died days after his appointment in the Battle of Dupplin Moor, and another Guardian had to be quickly located. Sir Andrew Murray was appointed to the position and took off in pursuit of Edward Balliol, but Murray was taken prisoner and had to himself be replaced. The next to be chosen Guardian was the military leader who had succeeded in rousting Edward Balliol, Archibald Douglas. Edward III invades: 1333 ‚Äì 1334 Edward III of England Cassell's History of England ‚Äì Century Edition After being rousted from Annan, Edward Balliol again offered homage to Edward III, and though the idea of returning to war against Scotland did not have universal appeal, Edward III gave Balliol his backing. The English king claimed that the violation of the Treaty of Northampton was not his own, but those Scots who crossed the borders after Edward Balliol's ouster. Balliol returned to Scotland in March 1333, besieging Berwick-upon-Tweed. In response, Archibald Douglas counterattacked, which Edward III took as excuse to justify open battle. He traveled to Northumberland in May, where he and the pretender to the Scottish throne began preparing for battle, while elsewhere Archibald Douglas did the same. There was particular urgency to Scottish preparations, for Berwick had agreed to surrender to the English if it were not liberated by 20 July.Conduit, 27. On 19 July 1333, Sir Archibald Douglas and his men came to face the troops of Balliol and Edward III at the Battle of Halidon Hill, just to the north-west of Berwick. Though greater in number, the Scottish forces were severely hampered by the lay of the land. Their cavalry was forced to dismount by boggy earth and proceed on foot uphill against English archers, who picked them off in great number.Conduit, 28. Once weakened, they were overrun by the English cavalry, who claimed among their many victims Sir Archibald Douglas himself. The loss of the Guardian was a severe blow for loyalists to David II, who would soon be carried into exile in France, there to remain until 1341.Spaltro and Bridge, 69. Quite quickly, Edward Balliol made formal his promises to Edward III. Andrew Lang records that in a Parliament held in February 1334, Balliol \\"acknowledged fealty and subjection to his English namesake, and surrendered Berwick as an inalienable possession of the English crown\\", following which in July the same year Balliol yielded considerably more to Edward III, including Roxburgh, Edinburgh, Peebles, Dumfries, Linlithgow, and Haddington.Lang, 249-50. Edward III did not displace the Scottish laws governing his new territories, but he put his own men in charge of his new territories. New unrest among the Scots Territory ceded to England by the 1334 Treaty of Newcastle. But while David II was safely removed and Edward III attending to other things, Edward Balliol was troubled not only by unrest among Scottish nationalists but also by discord among his own allies.Lang, 250. The common goal attained, his allies began to look to their own self interests, which did not always accord with each other's or Balliol's own. His three primary allies had been Richard Talbot, Henry de Beaumont and David III Strathbogie.Tytler, 410. When Alexander de Mowbray petitioned Balliol for the lands of his brother, who had died with only daughters, these three stood for the daughters and, when Balliol granted the petition, withdrew severally to take matters into their own hands.Tytler, 410‚Äì411. At the same time that Balliol's allies were leaving him, his enemies seemed to be gathering strength. Scottish ships of war waited off the coast to disrupt supplies sent by Edward III, and the captive Sir Andrew Murray, formerly Guardian of David II, was released to return home. Balliol attempted to placate his three primary allies by withdrawing his support of de Mowbray, but only succeeded in convincing de Mowbray to throw in with the son of the Bruce.Tytler, 411. Balliol's allies, divided, proved easier targets. Talbot was taken by loyalist William Keith of Galston and imprisoned in Dumbarton Castle, where once David II had taken shelter. Murray and de Mowbray pursued Beaumont, besieging him in Dundarg Castle and forcing him to retire to England. Balliol had given Strathbogie the lands of Robert Stewart, one day to be king but at that time the deposed High Steward of Scotland though only an adolescent. Heir to the throne currently claimed by David II, Stewart joined together with Sir Andrew Murray as co-Regents.Sumption, 148. Stewart rallied support to attack Strathbogie, driving him to Lochaber where in evident \\"fear of his life\\" he decided to surrender and support the loyalists. Balliol, for his part, retreated to Berwick. There, though he managed to convince Edward III to spend the winter of 1334‚Äì1335 in Roxburgh, he could not convince his men to stop defecting to join those loyal to David II.Brown, 238. And though Balliol and the English king both led excursions into the surrounding western lowlands, destroying the property of friend and foe alike, they found no evidence of Scottish troops.Sumption, 142. The entry of France to the conflict: 1334/35 Philip VI receiving David II and Joan Jean Froissart, 15th century Relations between France and England were already tense, with the English in control of the fief of Gascony and both sides struggling to impose their own interpretations of what precisely their relationship was. It had only been a few years, since 1331, that Philip VI and Edward III had begun to settle, after Edward had paid proper homage to Philip.Rogers, 241. While offering shelter to David II, Philip VI of France was also offering a clear message that, in the words of Spaltro and Bridge, \\"no Anglo-French peace settlement could scant the interest of France's ally Scotland.\\" France and Scotland had been joined in an \\"Auld Alliance\\" since Edward Balliol's father John had signed a treaty with Philip IV of France against Edward I of England in 1295, pledging mutual defence. David II's new co-regents sent a plea for help to Philip VI, who in November 1334 advised Edward III that he was sending an ambassador to England to discuss the matter. Accordingly, when Edward III returned from Roxburgh in February 1335, it was to find the Bishop of Avranches waiting, demanding to know why Edward III was acting against David II and David's queen, Edward's own sister Joan. Edward III deferred his answer, but in the meantime agreed to allow the ambassadors to try to negotiate peace between England and Scotland. As serious as the French ambassadors may have been at their task, they were unable to make headway with the co-regents of David II, who were at this time divided by their own disagreements about governance.Sumption, 143. What they did do, unwitting as they may have been, was allow time for the English to restore their finances.Sumption, 142-43. The return of Edward III: 1335 In March 1335, Edward III began seriously mustering his forces, timing his invasion to the expiration of the French-engineered temporary truce. Aware of his plans, Scottish loyalists were also preparing for war, setting aside their personal differences and evacuating the lowlands in preparation for invasion. Edward III summoned an army of 13,000 men, the largest assemblage he had ever managed for an invasion of Scotland, and set off in July with a plan for a three-front invasion.Sumpton, 144. With a naval force waiting near the Clyde, Edward III would lead part of this troop north from Carlisle while Balliol would take the rest west from Berwick. They encountered little resistance. After the armies met up at Glasgow, Edward III settled in the area of Perth. In France, lacking an answer to his question or satisfactory settlement of his truce, Philip VI openly assembled an army of 6,000 soldiers to send to support the Scottish troops, to whom he had also been sending supplies since February of that year.Sumption, 145‚Äì146. Notice was sent to Edward III, informing him that if he did not submit the dispute to the arbitration of France and the Pope, the French soldiers would be deployed. Edward III flatly refused the demand. Meanwhile, the situation among the Scottish loyalists had worsened, but only temporarily. England was regaining ground, and both Strathbogie and Robert Stewart surrendered to Edward III, Strathbogie so enthusiastically that he was later known for his tyranny against the loyalists.Brown, 239 The remaining loyalists gathered at Dumbarton Castle, with the sole remaining regent, Sir Andrew Murray. To discuss terms, Murray and Edward III established a truce, which ultimately lasted from mid-October through Christmas, but the truce did not govern Balliol or Balliol's followers.Sumption, 149. When Strathbogie lay siege against Murray's wife at Kildrummy Castle, Murray went after him, and with the assistance of the recently ransomed William Douglas, Lord of Liddesdale, killed Strathbogie and routed Strathbogie's troops at the Battle of Culblean. It was the first of a number of victories against Balliol and his followers that gradually pushed Balliol to shelter in the shadow of the English king.Sumption, 150. Edward III seems at this point to have been primarily interested in maintaining the eight counties which Balliol had given him, which he was restoring to military strength. In spite of his flat refusal to meet Philip VI's demands, he was concerned about the potential actions of the French, particularly against his inherited lands in that country.Sumption, 150‚Äì151. Through the winter, the treaty remained under discussion, promoting the idea that the middle-aged Edward Balliol might retain the throne and David II ‚Äî who would relocate to England ‚Äî be named his heir.Sumption, 153. Philip VI, David II's protector and adviser, had been persuaded by Pope Benedict XII to postpone his own military action, but in March 1336 he persuaded David II to reject the treaty, which evidently his regent had been prepared to accept.Sumption, 154. There were just weeks to go in the treaty, following which Edward III intended to press on with the war. In May 1336, Edward III sent Henry of Lancaster to enter Scotland, where the Scottish leaders were involved in sieges at Lochindorb and Cupar.Sumption, 158. Lancaster paused for reinforcements at Perth, sending Sir Thomas Rosslyn ahead to fortify the ruined castle of Dunnottar. Edward III was receiving grave and probably inflated intelligence of the amassing forces of Philip VI, which were intending to land in Scotland and invade England from the north, and he determined to thwart the plan by eliminating the most likely port for their arrival: Aberdeen.Sumption, 159‚Äì161. In June, Edward III arrived in Scotland via Newcastle with a force of 400 men, picking up an additional 400 from Lancaster's troops with which to march on Lochindorb, ending that siege, and thence to the Moray Firth.Sumption, 161. He destroyed everything he encountered from there through Aberdeen, which he burned to the ground. Later that same month, Carrick Clydesdale were likewise devastated by an attack of several thousand men under the command of John of Eltham, Earl of Cornwall.Sumption, 162. France joins the fight: 1336 Meanwhile, an English embassy empowered by the Great Council of June 1336 had been attempting to negotiate with Philip VI and David II. In August, Philip VI gave the English ambassadors his final answer, that he intended to invade England and Scotland immediately with the fleet and army he had gathered.Sumption, 163. The ambassadors sent urgent word to the Council of England, but two days before the messenger's arrival, on 22 August, four French privateers attacked the English town of Orford. Soon after the messenger arrived and was dispatched to call Edward back to England, French privateers captured several royal ships and loaded merchantmen anchored at the Isle of Wight.Sumption, 164. It was the middle of September before Edward III received that word and returned to England, abandoning his immediate plans to attack Douglas of Liddesdale in light of the greater threat. Too late to strike at the French ships, Edward III aggressively raised funds and returned to Scotland, beginning a series of wins and losses of castles before settling to winter at the fortress in Clyde.Sumption, 166. Douglas of Liddesdale kept up a campaign of harassment against the king, while Murray destroyed Dunnottar, Kinneff and Lauriston in order to prevent Edward III using them to his own advantage.Sumption, 166‚Äì167. Famine and disease exacted harsh tolls throughout Scotland. In England, though French naval attacks were dying down, French political and legal pressures were increasing. Edward III again returned to England in December 1336 and began to plan a force to enter Gascony in the spring.Sumption, 173. Scottish resurgence: 1336 ‚Äì 1340 The Scottish loyalists pressed the advantage of Edward III's distraction. Murray and Douglas of Liddesdale made incursions into the English strongholds of Perth and Fife and met no real resistance.Sumption, 179. Shortly thereafter, they negotiated terms with the troops garrisoned at Bothwell Castle, immediately afterward destroying the English fortifications. This was only the start. By the end of March, the Scottish troops had reclaimed most of Scotland north of the Forth and done serious damage to the lands of Edward Balliol. Edward III continued to focus on France, though he made clear his intentions of addressing Scotland when time permitted.Sumption, 180. But at the same time that Edward III was considering how best to deal with the French, the French were continuing to pour supplies into Scotland, and as the year progressed the Scottish forces began to encroach even into northern England, laying waste to Cumberland.Sumption, 214. Such actions forced Edward III to take the Scottish threat seriously, and in October he sent William Montagu, 1st Earl of Salisbury, to Scotland to see what he could do to contain the situation. Salisbury proved able to do little. He took his forces to Dunbar, launching an attack in January 1338 against its Countess, \\"Black Agnes\\" Randolph, the daughter of the former regent Thomas Randolph and the wife of one Patrick de Dunbar, 9th Earl of March.Lang, 254. With the aid of Alexander Ramsay of Dalhousie, she withstood, and Salisbury withdrew on Edward III's command after six months of effort in June. Salisbury would, however, feature in the Second War again in 1341 when, as a prisoner of the French, his return to the English would be a bargaining point for the release of the Scottish John Randolph. While not to say that Scottish victory was imminently on the horizon, the early winter and spring of 1338 were a turning point for the Scottish campaign.Brown, 241. Murray in particular was ruthless, and while suffering his own defeats left such destruction in his wake that thousands of Scottish civilians were left without food to sustain themselves, much less to fuel Balliol's cause. However, it was his dying blow. Early in the year, Murray died of an illness, but not before he had, in the words of Michael Brown, \\"ended the possibility of Edward III establishing stable lordship over southern Scotland.\\" Meanwhile, William Douglas had settled in the area of Liddesdale, from which position he harassed the allies of the English. In Spring 1339, Stewart ‚Äî sole Guardian after Murray's death ‚Äî brought a large force against the shrinking region under Balliol's control around Perth and Cupar. English reinforcements were held back by Scottish and French ships, and Stewart won the day in August, when his enemies surrendered. David II leading Scotland: 1341 ‚Äì 1346 The Battle of Neville's Cross Jean Froissart In 1341, David II reached the age of 18. He returned to Scotland on 2 June of that year with his wife, Edward III's sister, Joan.Webster, \\"David II\\" (2004). While the battles with the English had cooled in recent years, infighting amongst the Scottish loyalists had once again become an issue, and David II was eager to establish his own authority and surround himself with his own people.Brown, 244‚Äì245. These urges caused David II to make some questionable decisions that probably had the opposite effect of what he had intended. David knew that Douglas had an interest in Liddesdale, but he bestowed it instead on Stewart in 1342. Stewart ‚Äî more interested in Atholl, which had already been bestowed on Douglas ‚Äî was willing to swap, an act which not only increased the powers of Douglas and Stewart but also suggested little respect for David II's authority.Brown, 245. Perhaps in response, David II rewarded Alexander Ramsay of Dalhousie for retaking Roxburgh Castle from the English by appointing him sheriff. This act enraged Douglas, who had tried to retake Roxburgh himself several times and who had by some reports already been given the position. He imprisoned Ramsay and took brutal revenge, starving him to death in Hermitage Castle. Although himself dismayed by the death of Ramsay,Brown, 247. Stewart intervened between Douglas of Liddesdale and the king, and Douglas was pardoned.Lang, 256. Fighting with the English also continued. David II conducted several raids into England, as did John Randolph. In February 1343, the French and English entered into a treaty that also involved Scotland. While this was meant to last until 29 September 1346, several skirmishes in the intervening years did disturb the peace. But it was not until late in 1346, when Philip VI appealed to his ally David II for support, that circumstances would undergo a major change. Having sustained serious losses at the Battle of Cr√©cy in August and fearing further losses in an English invasion, Philip VI asked David II to himself invade England. Notwithstanding rivalries and divisions within his own troops, David summoned a massive army to Perth in September 1346. But David II's approach was indirect, and the English had time to muster forces of their own. These armies engaged in the Battle of Neville's Cross on 17 October 1346, near Durham. For the Scottish forces, it proved a disaster. The battle had already begun to go poorly for the Scots when Robert Stewart and Patrick de Dunbar withdrew with their rearguard, leaving the rest of the troops to defeat. By the time the battle was over, John Randolph was among the slain and William Douglas of Liddesdale among the captives. David II as well, was captured, taken wounded from the field. The captivity of David II: 1346 ‚Äì 1357 David II would remain captive to the English until 1357, during much of which time he resided in the Tower of London. Among the combatants at Neville's Cross, Edward Balliol set about recruiting forces to join him on an excursion back into Scotland, while Henry Percy and John Neville swiftly pressed the English advantage in the borders.Brown, 248. But though Balliol's subsequent campaign did restore some of the Southern communities to Edward III, on the whole he made little headway. Edward III was far more interested in the situation in France, and the Scottish locals were far less willing to submit to Balliol's demands. In the absence of the king, the Scottish forces rallied again behind Robert Stewart, supported by de Dunbar and Uilleam Ross, among others. Stewart could be depended upon to defend Scotland from Edward III and Edward Balliol, but otherwise was more interested in securing his own power than looking after that of his king.Brown, 249. As Stewart looked after himself, voids left by Neville's Cross were being filled as well in other parts of Scotland. Notably, to fill the gap left by William Douglas, Lord of Liddesdale, came his namesake and ward, the son of Sir Archibald Douglas, to assume the lordship of Douglas, from which position he became a powerful leader for the Scottish in the war.Lang, 258. With David II in his custody, Edward III had a good opportunity to try to reach terms, though Edward Balliol's interests were a sticking point.Webster \\"Balliol, Edward\\" (2004) He had evidently prepared to overlook them by the time he made his first offer, in 1348, which seems to have been that David II would hold Scotland as a fief for England, naming Edward III or one of his sons as his successor, should he die without children. This had altered somewhat by 1350 when Edward III sent Douglas of Liddesdale, also in custody in the Tower of London, to see if the Scots would be willing to take different terms: to ransom David II for a fee of ¬£40,000, the restoration of the disinherited lords, and the naming of Edward III's young son John of Gaunt as David's successor, should he die without children.Duncan (2004)Brown, 251. David himself is credited with removing Edward III's name from the line of succession in Scotland, and the Scots seem to have been willing to entertain the idea as they sent Douglas of Liddesdale back for further negotiation and David II was himself permitted to briefly return to Scotland in early 1352 to try to seal the deal. Stewart would obviously be disinclined to support terms that removed him from succession, but he seems ultimately not to have been alone. The Parliament convened in March 1352 did not find the prospect of submitting to the English a fair trade for the freedom of their king. David II was sent back. Still preoccupied with the war in France, Edward III tried again in 1354 with a simple demand of ransom, without settlement of the claim of England to superiority, but the Scots rejected this as well, perhaps because Robert Stewart was contemplating instead a stronger alliance with France. It was with French backing around 1355 that the Scottish forces began again to escalate against England.Brown, 253. They launched a successful assault against Berwick, which fell under Scottish control. Edward III reacted swiftly. In early 1356, along with Edward Balliol, he invaded Scotland, leading to an episode that would become known as the Burnt Candlemas. After recapturing Berwick and overwintering at Roxburgh, he spent ten days at Haddington, where he sacked the town and destroyed most of the buildings. His army ravaged the whole of Lothian, burning Edinburgh and the Shrine of the Virgin at Whitekirk.Major et al., 296‚Äì297. Treaty of Berwick (1357) The episode demonstrated to both Scotland and England the fruitlessness of their struggles. Thereafter, with France's fortunes falling and England's rising, the terms came to seem more favourable to the Scots, and in 1357 they were accepted after all, formalized in the Treaty of Berwick, under the terms of which Scotland would pay England 100,000 merks over a ten-year period. With the signing of the Treaty of Berwick, the Second War of Scottish Independence was effectively over. Even before the signing of the treaty, in January 1356, Edward Balliol ‚Äî weary and ill ‚Äî had relinquished his claim in the kingdom of Scotland to Edward III in exchange for an annuity of ¬£2000. He retired to live the rest of his life in the area of Yorkshire. David II returned to Scotland, to try again to deal with the rivalries of his lords as well as now among his ladies, as his wife Joan evidently objected to the English mistress he had taken during his 11 years in captivity. The treaty did impose a financial hardship on Scotland, but David II stopped paying after only 20,000 merks of the debt had been met, following which renegotiation led ultimately to a reduction in the debt and a 14-year truce.

History The Manor House is noteworthy for several reasons throughout history. Its land is the site of a Norman castle settlement which has hosted a number of Lords throughout its history, the most famous of whom was Sir John Oldcastle, the figure Shakespeare based his character of Sir John Falstaff upon in his play Henry IV in the late 16th century. It was also the home of English geologist and political economist George Poulett Scrope throughout the 19th century. He lived at the Manor House from the start of his first marriage until the death of his wife Emma (the great-granddaughter of Sir Robert Long), in 1866; his wife's family had owned the land since the 14th century.Page, L.E.. ed. 1970-1990. Dictionary of Scientific Biography. New York: Scribner, p. 261. Scrope was responsible for the creation of the grounds' Italian, Classical and medieval Gothic styled gardens and summerhouse in the mid-19th century, which can still be seen today. During World War II, the New Zealand Forestry Officers had the Manor House as their headquarters. In 1947, the owner of the Castle Combe estate sold the houses of the estate and the Manor House became a country club. After 18 months the club left the premises, and the house was shortly thereafter sold to Bobbie Allen, an amateur hotelier, and her husband. Over time, they established the Manor House as a premier country hotel, run almost as a club. A quite glamorous clientele ensued. Certain of the London hotels would refer guests in search of authentic England to the Manor House. Mrs. Allen was a noted horsewoman, and the grounds of the Manor House were known for their suitability for riding. Mrs. Allen was from Lancashire, and known for her directness. She wrote a book of her experiences, From Claridge's to Castle Combe, which reflects her character and the post World War II era. After many years, the Allens sold the Manor House to Mr. and Mrs. Oliver Clegg, who sold it to the present owners in 1988. https://www.exclusive.co.uk/our-story/ The building was recorded as Grade II listed in 1960.

The cable stayed bridge of Old Madras road crosses the tracks just near the station. Structure & Expansion Krishnarajapuram station has about 4 platforms and 2 thorough tracks for non stopping trains. Most of the long distance trains stop at platform 4, while incoming trains heading to Bangalore City stop at platform 3. Platform 1 is long enough only for eight coaches so it is used for goods and mail trains. And apart from that existing platforms could accommodate only 19 coaches whereas all the trains which stop here have 24 coaches which causes inconvenience to the passengers. So the extension of the platforms were approved by the railways which was completed in fifteen days. Junction Krishnarajapuram railway station is a junction on the Bangalore-Chennai main line with a line from Guntakal joining the track into the station. However the Guntakal track is mostly used by freight trains and oil tankers from Whitefield, though a few express trains from Tamil Nadu and Kerala heading towards the north do use this line, bypassing Bangalore in the process. With the commencement of the Yeshvantapur Railway Station all trains moving towards Bangarpet from Yeshvantapur are given a stop here.

David was forced to halt his studies in Philosophy and History in September 1941 when the university ceased allowing Jews to study anymore. The family did not go into hiding because they had received an exemption and believed they were safe. Still, in 1943, they were captured and transported to Camp Vught on 11 February. David spent some of his time teaching children at the camp. In July, he received a ‚ÄúSperre‚Äù (temporary exemption from deportation) from Frits Philips and joined his ‚ÄúPhilips Commandos‚Äù. In June 1944, the \\"Philips-Jews\\" were transported to Auschwitz- Birkenau from where they would be sent to other camps to work for electronic companies. David's mother and brother Max survived the war. David, however, fell ill and died during a transport for ill people to the concentration camp in Dachau due in part to his illness as well as hypothermia in February 1945. His father died of exhaustion in LangenBilau, a subcamp of Gro√ü-Rosen. Koker had published in 1941 Modern-Hebreeuwse po√´zie. The booklet (87 pages) was a bilingual edition of Modern Hebrew Poetry with translations in Dutch. Cotranslator was J. Melkman, pseudonym of Jozeph Michman (1914-2009). Publisher was Joachimsthal in Amsterdam. The Diary During his internment, he wrote a diary which was smuggled out of the camp, pieces at a time. The diary is maintained complete, starting on 11 February 1943 and ending on 8 February 1944. In addition to standard entries, David also used the diary to write poetry. On 2 June 1944, while the family was being transported to Auschwitz-Birkenau, David managed to throw a letter from the train, an excerpt of which read: > : Lieve vrinden, we zijn nu dicht bij de grens. Het is wel teleurstellend, > maar we waren erop voorbereid en zijn vol vertrouwen. Ik denk veel aan > jullie. (...) Ik heb alle brieven en foto's bij me. M'n liefste bezit. > Wanneer zien we elkaar weer? Dat zal nu wel lang duren. Maar erdoor komen > we. (...) Heel veel liefs jongens, bedankt voor alles.

I've got all your letters and photos with me. My dearest possessions. > When will we see each other again? That will take a long time. But we shall > survive. (...) Lots of love guys, thanks for everything. Goodbye. The diary was published in 1977 with the name Dagboek geschreven in Vught (Diary Written in Vught). The editor was Koker's best friend Karel van het Reve, a professor of Slavic languages and literature, who during the war collected and kept the smuggled diary pieces. The manuscript was stored at the Dutch Institute for War Documentation (NIOD). It has been translated into English and was published in 2012 under the title At the Edge of the Abyss: A Concentration Camp Diary, 1943-1944.

The 12th- and 13th-century church, restored in the Victorian era, serves a large rural area of the Sussex Weald, covering three villages (each with current or former chapels of ease of their own) as well as the ancient settlement of Slaugham. It also controlled the church in the market town of Crawley‚Äînow one of the area's largest towns‚Äîfor the first few centuries of its existence. A locally important family built a private chapel in the church in the 17th century, and a series of memorials to deceased family members are considered to be excellent examples of their type. English Heritage has listed the building at Grade II* for its architectural and historical importance. History By the time of the Norman Conquest, the historic county of Sussex was divided into six areas called rapes, each based on a town with a castle. One such division was the Rape of Lewes, which covered a large part of eastern and central Sussex bounded (clockwise from the north) by Surrey, the Rape of Pevensey, the English Channel coast and the Rape of Bramber. The parish of Slaugham, long from north to south but narrow, followed the western boundary of the rape for a long distance. Its manor and village existed in the 11th century: although not mentioned in the Domesday survey of 1086, it was held by William de Warenne's Lewes Priory by 1098 (and possibly from as early as 1091), in common with many manors and estates in central Sussex. William de Warenne and his wife Gundred supported the construction of churches in the Rape of Lewes, and may have founded a church at Slaugham. No trace of any 11th-century building remains, though, and the existence of a church at that time is a matter of conjecture. The present structure is presumed to be built on top of its foundations. The oldest parts date from the early 12th century and consist of the north wall, a single doorway and other fragmentary remains in the nave, and the font. A chancel would have been built at that time as well to make a simple two-cell church, but no 12th-century fabric survives: it was rebuilt in the early 14th century. Earlier, in the late 13th century, the first stage of the tower had been added at the west end of the church. Its simple entrance door in the west wall is chamfered. The chancel arch, also 13th-century and unusually broad, similarly has chamfering to the walls of the nave. The 13th-century layout of the church was completed when a two-bay south aisle was built in about 1290. It was connected to the nave by means of an unusually wide arcade with chamfered arches. A single lancet window was inserted in the west wall. The interior looking towards the east window, showing the wide chancel arch The font The simple layout was gradually added to over the centuries. The east window in the chancel, in the Decorated Gothic style, dates from the early 14th century. Buttresses were added at the northwest and southwest corners of the tower a century later; and in the 16th century, two square-headed windows were added to the north wall of the nave, flanking the blocked Norman doorway. A major change came in 1613: William Covert, a member of the family who had held the manor of Slaugham since the late 15th century, built a private chapel (the Covert Chapel) on the south side next to the chancel. Its main feature is a memorial of \\"exceptional quality\\", considered one of the best in Sussex: it depicts Richard Covert (who died in 1579) kneeling with seventeen other figures representing his wives, sons and daughters. The first letter of each person's name is shown above their head. The intricately carved stone wall-tomb has Corinthian columns, pilasters and a moulded frame, and a straight balustraded top section consisting of an entablature and frieze with carved flowers. Richard Covert himself wears a suit of armour, while his three adult sons have military dress. Both wives are reading prayer books on lecterns. At the top are three funeral helms, two of which bear versions of the Covert coat of arms. Many churches in Sussex, including Slaugham's, were restored or rebuilt in the Victorian era. Some work had already been carried out on the south aisle in 1827‚Äîit was enlarged to hold an extra 200 seats‚Äî but most of the work was done between 1857 and 1860 by Gothic Revival architect Joseph Clarke. He added the top section of the tower, widened the south aisle further and removed most of the wall between it and the Covert Chapel (creating an archway instead), added a third bay between the chancel and the Covert Chapel, and built a vestry and organ chamber on the north side. In the west wall of the south aisle, a 13th- century lancet window remains, but Clarke added a rose window. Alterations continued later in the 19th century: a second vestry was built on the north side in 1879, the organ was moved again, and the tower was given a clock-face in 1881. A 17th-century pulpit was donated to the church and installed in 1890. The churchyard is very large, reflecting the size of the parish. Burials include Catherine Matcham, one of Lord Nelson's sisters; and a table-tomb dated 1615 is one of the oldest such graves in Sussex. There are also wooden graveboards, sometimes used as a cheaper alternative to gravestones, and a pair of gate-like iron grave-markers. The lychgate at the north entrance was erected in 1903. A very broad yew tree, known to be over 600 years old, occupies part of the churchyard behind the church. Eccentric and bad behaviour by clergy and parishioners was a common theme at Slaugham in earlier centuries. Church attendance was made compulsory after the changes brought about by the English Reformation of the late 16th century, and especially in the early years detailed records would be kept of non-attendance or inappropriate behaviour in church. Ecclesiastical court records show that St Mary's Church was the scene of a violent crime in 1601, when Richard Woods was \\"charged with breaking Thomas Mutton's head in the churche\\" ; while on 29 June 1621 another man was found beating his wife instead of attending the Sunday service. In 1857, when Reverend Sergison was the vicar at St Mary's, a disagreement developed over some of the pews. He overcame the problem by paying some boys to enter the church and burn the pews in question. The half- crown bribe was successful in keeping his actions secret until after his death. St Mary's Church was listed at Grade II* by English Heritage on 28 October 1957. Such buildings are defined as being \\"particularly important ... [and] of more than special interest\\". In February 2001, it was one of 54 Grade II* listed buildings, and 1,028 listed buildings of all grades, in the district of Mid Sussex. Architecture and fittings St Mary's Church from the northwest, showing the lychgate The east window St Mary's Church does not have a homogeneous external appearance and cannot be attributed to one era: the gradual change and growth of the building over the centuries is more apparent. The plan consists of a west tower with an entrance, chancel with a wide chancel arch, nave with an aisle on the south side, south (Covert) chapel next to the chancel, south porch, two vestries and an organ chamber. Sussex stone rubble is the main building material, although there is some ashlar as well (for instance in the walls of the Covert Chapel). Slates and tiles, some of Horsham stone, are laid on the roofs. The chancel roof retains a single 14th-century tie-beam but has otherwise been renewed. The east window of the chancel is an early-14th-century lancet with three trefoils. The exterior is hood-moulded. The north wall of the chancel also has a lancet window: this has quatrefoils and ogee headings. The Covert Chapel has three windows, all with pointed-arched heads: that in the east wall has three cinquefoils (five-lobed lights), while the two in the south wall are simpler two-light windows. The nave's north wall has one 19th-century window flanked by two dating from the 16th century and the blocked Norman doorway. All three are simple two-light windows with straight heads. Two windows in the south aisle also date from the Victorian restoration, as does the single window in the west wall. Charles Eamer Kempe designed several stained glass windows for the church in the 1890s. The tower rises in three stages, of which the lower two are local rubble and the upper (Victorian) part is of ashlar. The horizontal divide can still be discerned. Diagonally splayed buttresses were added at the northwest and southwest corners in the 15th century. Only the lowest and highest storey have windows. There is a single-light trefoiled lancet above the entrance and small round-arched windows in the side wall on the lowest storey; at the top the north wall has a clock and there are 19th-century lancets in the other three faces. This section also holds a ring of eight bells hung for change ringing. There were originally five bells cast in 1773 by Thomas Janaway; two of these remain as the second and third of the present ring of eight, for which the other bells were cast in 1934 by Gillett & Johnston. The tower is topped by a pyramid-style tiled roof. Memorials and monuments are the principal architectural feature of the church. As well as the 1579 memorial to Richard Covert (designed by a sculptor called Flynton at a cost of ¬£30 (¬£ in )), the Covert Chapel has a brass monument representing John Covert (who died in 1503); it sits below a brass canopy. In the chancel, a recess forms an Easter sepulchre containing brass monuments to an earlier Richard Covert (who died in 1546) and his three wives with a depiction of the Resurrection of Jesus, and next to it a memorial to his granddaughter Jane Covert in a columned surround topped with a pediment. Nelson's sister Catherine Matcham has a wall-mounted memorial in the east end of the chancel. The interior had 12th-century wall paintings, a common feature of Sussex churches. These do not survive, but illustrations of the scenes (which represented the Passion) exist. One surviving feature from the 12th century is the square font of local marble, which now stands on a modern base but retains many original features including a carved fish design (unique in Sussex), arcades and tendril-style ornamentation. A 15th-century altarpiece was removed from the church and installed in St Laurence's Church in Goring-by-Sea near Worthing when that church was built in the 1930s. Parish All Saints Church, Handcross Former St Andrew's Church, Warninglid Former Church of the Ascension, Pease Pottage Slaugham has always been a large parish: it covered in 1940, most of which was sparsely populated Wealden countryside. The three other villages in the parish‚ÄîHandcross, Pease Pottage and Warninglid‚Äîeach had their own chapel of ease for Anglican worship, controlled from St Mary's Church; the three buildings survive, but only one is still in religious use. Handcross is a linear village of mostly Victorian buildings on the old London‚ÄìBrighton road. All Saints Church, at on the road to Horsham, is a small structure of red brick with a large, distinctive bell-turret at its west end. When the A23 London‚ÄìBrighton road was diverted in the late 1950s to run past the village and widened at the same time, the church had to give up some of its land. The tiny building now sits next to an overbridge and overhangs the bypass. Warninglid, a hamlet with one main street, is south of Slaugham in the south of the parish. Architect Francis G. Troup designed a basic chapel of ease for the community in 1935, about a century after one had first been suggested. The cruciform structure was of brick and had some vividly coloured stained glass by J. Hogan of the firm James Powell and Sons, a long-established London-based stained glass company. The chapel, which cost ¬£1,200 (¬£ in ) and had a tall vaulted interior lit by lancets, was sold in 2009, and Mid Sussex District Council gave planning permission for its conversion into a house. It stands at on the road to Cuckfield. Pease Pottage is a small village on the southern edge of Crawley, separated from it only by the A264 road. A chapel of ease to St Mary's, later called the Church of the Ascension, was granted a licence in 1875. The small Gothic Revival-style building, at , has been converted into an office. It has multicoloured brickwork, a bell-turret and round-arched windows. Crawley, north of Pease Pottage on the London‚ÄìBrighton road, developed as a market town from 1202, when its market charter was granted. It was just within the Rape of Lewes (the boundary with the Rape of Bramber ran up the middle of the London‚ÄìBrighton road), and at first lay within Slaugham's parish. Soon after the market was founded, the long-established Poynings family were granted most of the land in the area by the descendants of William de Warenne; and by 1267, they had founded a chapel of ease at Crawley. It later became a chantry for the benefit of the Poynings family, members of which held the manor and lordship of Crawley until 1429 when the last descendant died. The church was later dedicated to St John the Baptist and opened for public worship in the growing town. It remained a daughter church to St Mary's Church at Slaugham until the 16th century, although in practice the relationship lapsed somewhat earlier and St John the Baptist's was effectively an independent parish church. St John the Baptist's Church is still the Anglican parish church of Crawley, and has Grade II* listed status. The approximate north and east boundaries of Slaugham's present-day parish are the M23 motorway, part of the main railway line between Balcombe and Three Bridges, the B2110 road and the A23 road; on the south and west sides, field boundaries and minor roads form the border with adjacent parishes.

The Microgravity Science Glovebox (MSG) is a glovebox aboard the International Space Station. It provides a safe contained environment for research with liquids, combustion and hazardous materials in the microgravity conditions of the ISS. Without the MSG, many types of hands-on investigations would be impossible or severely limited on board the Station. The Microgravity Science Glovebox (MSG) occupies a floor-to-ceiling rack inside the Destiny module of the International Space Station (ISS). It is more than twice as large as gloveboxes flown on the Space Shuttle and can hold larger investigations that are about twice the size of an airline carry-on bag. Microgravity Science Glovebox (MSG) - NASA. A follow on sister facility, managed by the same group at Marshall Space Flight Center, is intended to further support biological experiments with the Life Science Glovebox. Description The Core Facility of MSG occupies the upper half of the overall rack and includes the large work volume (WV), an airlock and electronics for control, housekeeping and investigation resources. The WV holds the experiment and related equipment. The work volume is approximately wide, high, and deep with a usable volume of about 255 litres. This area can be sealed and held at a negative pressure, isolating the crew and the Station from possible hazards associated with the investigations that are taking place inside. An airlock under the WV can be accessed to bring objects in safely while other activities are going on inside MSG. The MSG has 40 cm diameter side ports (equipped with rugged gloves that are sealed to prevent leaks) for setting up and manipulating equipment in the WV. A cold-plate provides cooling for experiment hardware and the air can be continuously circulated and filtered. Experiments are provided with 1 kW of power and cooling. Vacuum, venting, nitrogen gas dilution (that can keep the work volume oxygen volume fraction below the standard ISS atmosphere (nominally 21% by volume) down to 10 percent or less), power and data interfaces are also provided within MSG. A video system consists of a self- standing subsystem of four colour cameras, two monitors, two analogue recorders and two digital recorders integrated into an International Sub-rack Interface Standard (ISIS) drawer. The command and monitoring panel monitors the facility status and performance and provides for manual operation of MSG by the crew. MSG was delivered to ISS during Expedition 5, whereupon it was installed in the Destiny module. On March 21, 2008, during Expedition 16, MSG was relocated to the Columbus module. On October 21, 2010, during Expedition 25, MSG was transferred back to the Destiny module. Description Summary * The Microgravity Science Glovebox (MSG) makes it possible to do investigations in microgravity that are similar to those carried out in ground-based laboratories. Without containment, liquids and particles involved in experiments on board the Space Station would float about the cabin. This could cause damage to equipment or harm the crew. * Crewmembers access the work area through ports equipped with rugged, sealed gloves that can be removed when contaminants are not present. A video system and data downlinks allow for control of the enclosed experiments from the ground, if desired. * In addition to doing complete, laboratory-like experiments, the MSG allows scientists to test small parts of larger investigations in a microgravity environment and to try out new equipment in microgravity. * The MSG can support all key areas of microgravity research as well as other scientific fields. This makes it a useful laboratory resource for scientists in many different fields conducting a wide variety of investigations. Operations The MSG accommodates small and medium-sized investigations from any disciplines including biotechnology, combustion science, life sciences, fluid physics, fundamental physics and materials science. Many of these experiments use chemicals, burning or molten materials or other hazards that must be contained. Results The MSG on the ISS has been utilized for a large body of research. The MSG has operated on orbit for more than 3500 hours; used by various types of investigations, including material science, thermal management, protein crystal growth, life sciences, fire detection, combustion and technology demonstration. The versatility of the resources MSG provides makes it an ideal platform for microgravity research (Spivey 2006 - 2008).

Since 1964, Fly Fishers International (FFI) has been an organized voice for fly fishers around the world. They represent all aspects of fly fishing, from the art of fly tying and casting to protection of the natural systems that support healthy fisheries and their habitats, which is essential to the sport. Today, the organization's mission is to ensure the legacy of fly fishing for all fish in all waters. They focus on conservation, education, and a sense of community. Origins In May 1964, the McKenzie River Flyfishers was organized in Eugene, Oregon with the expressed goal of forming a national fly fishing organization. A gathering of prominent fly fishermen from the West Coast of the United States and Gene Anderegg of the Theodore Gordon Flyfishers of New York City occurred in September 1964 in Aspen, Colorado. Gene Anderegg orchestrated a correspondence among many fly fishing clubs, aided by the support of angling notables Lee Wulff and Ed Zern that resulted in the first conclave being held in June 1965. All the original clubs were from California, Oregon and Washington, with the exception of the Theodore Gordon Flyfishers. The Federation was first organized as the Federation of Fly Fishermen but the name changed to its current status in the early 1980s. By 1974 there were 120 clubs and over 7000 members across the United States in the Federation. Lew Bell and Lee Wulff drafted the original constitution for the Federation and its preamble read: A great many notable anglers and sportsmen have been members and participants in the Federation of Fly Fishers--Ted Trueblood, Ed Zern, Pete Hidy, Polly Rosborough, Dan Bailey, Bud Lilly, Arnold Gingrich, Joan Wulff, Lee Wulff, Roderick Haig-Brown, Tom Brayshaw, Lefty Kreh, Enos Bradner, Nick Lyons, Paul Schullery, John Gierach, Steve Raymond, Thomas McGuane, Gary LaFontaine, George Grant, Curt Gowdy, Dave Whitlock, Gary Borger, Dave Hughes, Ernest Schwiebert, Charles Brooks, Eric Leiser, Charles Fox, Bob Clouser, Bob Jacklin, Art Flick, Mel Krieger, Mike Swederska, Tim Rajeff. Goals Fly Fishers International exists to: * Cultivate and advance the art, science and sport of flyfishing as the most sporting and enjoyable method of angling and the way of fishing most consistent with the preservation and use of game fish resources; * Be the voice for organized fly fishing; * Promote conservation of recreational resources; * Facilitate and improve the knowledge of fly fishing; * Elevate the standard of integrity, honor, and courtesy of anglers; * Cherish the spirit of fellowship among anglers everywhere; * Establish and maintain liaison with other organizations of anglers and conservationists and government agencies concerned with the sport of angling. Clubs and Councils The organization is composed of 17 regional councils to which belong over 300 fly fishing clubs as well as individual members. The goal is to support fisheries conservation and educational programs for all fish and all waters. Anywhere fly fishers have an interest, the organization plays a role in furthering its goals through its councils, clubs and members. * Eastern Rocky Mountain * Eastern Waters * Florida * Great Lakes * Gulf Coast * Mid Atlantic * North Eastern * Northern California * Ohio * Oregon * South Eastern * Southern * Southwest * Texas * Upper Midwest Council * Washington State * Western Rocky Mountain Programs =Annual Awards= The Federation of Fly Fishers Awards Program was established to recognize those individuals, clubs and other organizations that have made outstanding contributions to the environment, fishery resources, angling literature, the fly tackle industry and the Federation.

The Fly Fishing Fair and Conclave is the Federation's annual education and fundraising event. The Fair offers workshops, programs, demonstrations on fly tying, fly casting, fly fishing tactics, aquatic entomology, fly rod building, angling ethics, water safety and many related topics. Anglers and fly fishing experts from around the world attend to support Youth and Women's programs, conservation and education forums, photo contests, and author book signings. The show includes an exhibit hall where fishing tackle companies, retailers, artists, travel services and other companies that cater to the fly fishing lifestyle offer exhibits and sales of their products. The 2012 International Fly Fishing Fair and Conclave will be held in Spokane, Washington in July 2012. =Certified Casting Instructor Program= In 1992, the Federation established the Certified Casting Instructor program with the goal to enhance the sport of flyfishing in three important areas: * 1. To educate flycasting instructors * 2. To establish communication between instructors * 3. To offer learners a more accepted entry into our sport and a more qualified group of instructors. Noted fly caster, Mel Krieger led the effort to establish The Casting Board of Governors (BOG) at the Calgary, Alberta conclave in July 1992. Its founding members are iconic figures in American fly casting or fly fishing. They were: Gary Borger, Leon Chandler, Chico Fernandez, Jim Green, Lefty Kreh, Mel Krieger, Al Kyte, Steve Rajeff, Bruce Richards, Allan Rohrer, Barbara Rohrer, Doug Swisher, Lou Tabory, Dave Whitlock and Joan Wulff. The first BOG meeting was held at Park High School in Livingston, Montana, during the 1993 conclave. The program trains and certifies casting instructors in two tiers‚ÄîCertified Casting Instructor and Master Casting Instructor. Certification requires candidates to pass a written and performance test. =Fly Fishing Discovery Center= The Federation runs the Fly Fishing Discovery Center, a museum and education center in Livingston, Montana. The museum's Tackle Room chronicles the history of fly fishing with displays of rods, reels, lines, float tubes and art. The Fly Room features thousands of flies tied by masters from around the world. The museum houses the Lewis A. Bell Memorial Fly Fishing Library, a large collection of fly fishing books and journals available for public viewing and research. =Fly tying Group= Fly tying demonstration The Fly Tying Group was established during the 2007 Conclave in Livingston, Montana as a group of fly tiers whose goal is to develop the art of fly tying at the local, regional, council, national, and international levels. The group hosts workshops that teach demonstration fly tying and run fly tying classes at annual conclaves. =Guides Association= The Guides Association is administered by the Federation as a service to its member guides and to the fly-fishing public. The association aims to connect professional guides with potential clients as well as provide guides some marketing support via the Federation's publications. =National Conservation Committee= Conservation is one of the founding principles of the Federation of Fly Fishers. Participating in over 40 years of conservation work, the Federation of Fly Fishers contributes to the protection of fisheries and angling opportunities for the future. The National Conservation Committee is composed of representatives from each Federation of Fly Fishers Council. The Conservation Committee advises and supports conservation efforts with perspective from each Council.

It was written by Henry Alonso Myers and Chris Black. The episode was directed by Paul Holahan. It originally aired on the ABC network in the United States on March 24, 2010. Guest stars in this episode include Neal Bledsoe, Halley Feiffer, Ryan McGinnis, Donna Murphy and Kathy Najimy. In the episode, Betty Suarez (America Ferrera) finally has her braces removed, but only after she enters a dream sequence in which she sees what her life would be like if she had had perfect teeth. At the same time, Justin Suarez (Mark Indelicato) tries to contact Austin (Ryan McGinnis), who he kissed in the previous episode and Daniel Meade (Eric Mabius) secures the Million Dollar Bra for a MODE cover shoot. Meanwhile, Amanda Tanen (Becki Newton) reveals that her relationship with Tyler (Neal Bledsoe) is getting serious. According to the Nielsen ratings system, the episode was watched by 4.63 million households during its original broadcast, and received a 1.7 rating/5 share among viewers in the 18‚Äì49 demographic. Plot Betty (America Ferrera) wakes up in a good mood as she is finally having her braces removed and can get her first ID picture without them. At her orthodontist's office, Betty tries to hurry along Dr. Frankel (Kathy Najimy) and just as she stops her from talking, the fire alarm goes off. At MODE, Betty is depressed that her braces haven't been removed, so Marc (Michael Urie) photoshops her image into a blond haired and braceless woman on her ID. Justin (Mark Indelicato) tries repeatedly to call Austin who seems to be hiding from him after they kissed. Claire (Judith Light) has come back from France and Daniel (Eric Mabius) is cold towards her as she lied to him about Tyler. Meanwhile, Amanda (Becki Newton) has let Tyler sleep over for the night after their dinner date due to him being jet lagged from the flight. After Tyler kisses her for the first time the next morning, Amanda later tells Daniel that she is getting serious with Tyler and Daniel tells her to leave. At the editors meeting, Daniel announces that he has secured the 'Million Dollar Bra' for a cover shoot. Wilhelmina (Vanessa Williams) is surprised that Daniel's done something right for a change, until she reads the itinerary for the bra and tells Daniel that the Bra is due to be shipped to Cairo at the same time as the shoot. Betty tells Daniel she will contact her friend, Alison, who works for Eve, the president of the company that owns the Bra. Betty goes to the Guggenheim Museum to meet Alison, but is stopped by security and when she produces her ID, the security man does not believe it is her. Her braces then set off the metal detector and when she calls out Allison's nickname, A-Bomb, she gets tackled to the ground by security and hits her head. When she wakes up, Betty finds that she is in an It's a Wonderful Life-type dream sequence where is she beautiful and rich. She no longer has braces and is working at MODE as Wilhelmina's right hand woman. Dr. Frankel is her guardian angel and explains that because she had perfect teeth, everything is different. Hilda (Ana Ortiz) is the ugly sister, Justin was never born, Ignacio gambles and Daniel and Amanda are married. When Betty finds out that she and Wilhelmina had planned to sabotage the 'Million Dollar Bra' shoot, Betty tries to change the course of events, but ends up hitting her head again. She wakes up to find herself back in the real world and thinking Wilhelmina is going to steal the Bra, Betty rips off Wilhelmina's shirt before backing into the Bra and getting her braces stuck to it. Dr. Frankel then arrives and removes Betty's braces. Daniel apologizes to Amanda and says he is okay with her and Tyler's relationship. Tyler sees them hug and confronts Amanda, who tells him that Daniel has given them his blessing. Tyler isn't happy and Amanda tells him they need some time apart until Tyler and Daniel work on their issues with each other. Back at the Suarez house, Betty is celebrating with her family and eating the foods that she could not eat before with her braces. The doorbell rings and Justin opens the door and finds Austin standing there. Production Kathy Najimy guest stars as Betty's orthodontist and guardian angel. \\"Million Dollar Smile\\" was directed by Paul Holahan, and written by executive producer Henry Alonso Myers and co-executive producer Chris Black.

It‚Äôll still be Betty, but you‚Äôll see some growth in that direction.\\" Following the series' cancellation, it was announced that Betty was to undergo a make over and her braces were to be removed during \\"Million Dollar Smile\\". Broadway theatre actress Kathy Najimy joined the cast of Ugly Betty in February 2010, as the orthodontist who would be removing Betty's braces. Najimy's role would also see her act as Betty's guardian angel during a dream sequence. Najimy succeeded Jesse Tyler Ferguson, who played Betty‚Äôs first orthodontist, Gabe Farkas, in season 1. Donna Murphy appeared in this episode as Eve, an \\"ice queen lingerie executive.\\" Other guest stars included Halley Feiffer as Betty's friend, Allison, Ryan McGinnis as Austin and Neal Bledsoe in his ongoing role of Tyler. Reception In its original American broadcast, \\"Million Dollar Smile\\" was watched by 4.63 million households, according to the Nielsen ratings system. It received a 1.7 rating/5 share among viewers in the 18‚Äì49 demographic, meaning that 1.7 percent of all people in that group, and 5 percent of all people from that group watching television at the time, watched the episode. This was an increase from the previous episode, \\"All the World's a Stage\\", which was watched by 3.3 million American viewers. Television website TV Fanatic said the episode \\"was entirely far fetched, but, it was highly entertaining nonetheless\\". The website also praised how the writers marked Betty's braces being removed, saying \\"job well done\\". Tanner Stransky from Entertainment Weekly called \\"Million Dollar Smile\\" \\"a stunning episode\\" and added that it was \\"truly heartwarming\\". However, New York magazine called the dream sequence \\"a downer\\" and labelled it \\"downright uncomfortable\\".

Musical career In the 1980s, Joshua was active as a DJ and producer in the early days of the house music scene. His earliest productions were released on the Trax Records label. In the early 1990s, Joshua began producing remixes of songs by artists like Ce Ce Peniston, Malaika and many pop artists, including Michael Jackson. He continues to remix to this day. Joshua is best known for his 1989 number one Billboard Hot Dance Club Play chart hit \\"This Is Acid (A New Dance Craze)\\". The hit version of this song was a remix by British DJ Les Adams, who pitted its spoken male vocals by \\"Hot Hands Hula\\" Malone against a combination of regional house music sounds of the day, including samples of sirens and sexual screaming voices in the background. Joshua's most famous production work was with Kim English and pop group Destiny's Child. His partnership with the group's leader Beyonc√© was compared to the partnership of Mariah Carey and David Morales, because like Carey and Morales, Joshua and Beyonc√© often work closely together to have Beyonc√© re-sing her vocals for club mix versions of her hit singles.

It promotes multi-national cartographic research in order to solve problems related to web-based cartography. The commission enhances cartographic education related to the Internet. In addition, the commission promotes professional and technical standards for maps available through the Internet. Like all commissions of the International Cartographic Association, formal members are assigned by individual countries. However, anyone can become a corresponding member. Corresponding members receive all commission correspondence and invitations to meetings. Activities of the commission include e-mails to members, meetings, workshops, promotion of standards, and publications. Commission background The Internet has redefined how maps are used (see Web mapping). No longer restricted to paper, maps are transmitted almost instantly and delivered to the user in a fraction of the time required to distribute maps on paper. They are viewed in a more timely fashion. Some maps, such as those showing weather patterns, are updated continuously throughout the day. It is the interactive nature of the Internet map that is considered the most important development. Online maps are accessed through a hyperlinking structure that makes it possible to engage the map user on a higher-level than is possible with a map on paper. The Internet is making it possible to more easily distribute cartographic displays such as map animations. The Internet presents the map user with both a faster method of map distribution and different forms of mapping. Commission Terms of Reference * Focus attention on disseminating maps and spatial data through distributed electronic networks. Product: Journal articles and web pages. * Examine Internet map usage to better serve user needs. Product: Oral or published report. * Examine the use of new Internet mapping technologies for social interaction and empowerment with online maps. Product: Oral or published report. * Examine differences in the application of Internet maps between countries. Product: Oral or published report. * Examine the potential of Internet map metadata. Product: Oral or published report. * Promote the exchange of information about effective Internet mapping for an international audience. Collaboration / coordination with the ICA commission on visualization and virtual environments. Product: Workshop(s) and web pages. * Promote instruction on Internet mapping through collaboration / coordination with agencies for research and mapping. Product: Materials to be used in workshops. Research Questions Broader research questions associated with the commission: * Determine the extent and type of Internet map usage. It is difficult to determine the number of maps that are distributed through the web. This effort could culminate in a 'map counter' that would estimate the number of maps that have been so distributed, on a regular basis. * How are maps being used? Research is needed that examines the users in order to determine how cartographers can better serve their needs. * Promote international user interfaces for maps on the web. This would involve developing an iconic vocabulary of map symbols that are simple and clear, and a consistent color vocabulary. * Promote the creation of international web map servers. International web map servers would distributed maps that could be used by an international audience. * Develop a database of web maps with specific themes or authors, areas (coordinates), resolution, dates, etc. A large number of maps reside on the web but it is difficult to find them, and particularly to find anything out about them. Maps on the web should be accompanied by a metafile with a description of the contents (e.g. map, soils, Netherlands, 1987, in a standardized format like MARC 2). The metafiles would be aggregated into a database that would point to map files available on the web without having to go to each home page. * Develop guidelines for the design of web maps. Initially this might focus on the relatively common static maps, and perhaps offer some suggestions about fonts, colors, avoiding things that retard downloading, etc. * Develop instructional materials (syllabi, topics, exercises, project websites, etc.) for Internet cartography. Many instructional materials are already available on the web. This effort would involve making these materials available from a central source. * Collaborative map use through the web. How can maps delivered through the Internet be used by groups of people in collaborative problem-solving. * Delivering cartographic data and services through the Internet. Cartographic data sets are huge, and the distributed processing times are not compatible with the computational complexity of our cartographic modeling operations. Methods need to be found to distribute cartographic data more efficiently. Meetings of the Commission The commission meets annually. Past meetings have been held in Orleans, France; Orlando, Florida (2010); Valparaiso, Chile (2009); Warsaw, Poland (2007); Seoul, Korea (2006); Madrid, Spain (2005); Tokyo, Japan (2004); Stellenbosch, South Africa (2003); Karlsruhe, Germany (2002); Guangzhou, China (2001); Knoxville, Tennessee (2000) and; Ottawa, Canada (1999). Workshops With the support of host institutions, the commission offers instructional workshops that cover online mapping. Workshops have been offered at universities or government mapping institutions in Malaysia, Germany, Austria, Cuba, Brazil, China, Canada, South Africa and USA. Workshops can be as short as half a day or up to two weeks.

The Muscle Atrophy Research and Exercise System (MARES), part of the Human Research Facility (HRF), was launched on 5 April 2010 (STS-131) in a stowed position inside the HRF MARES Rack, integrated into a Multi-Purpose Logistics Module (MPLM) and transported to the International Space Station. When deployed, MARES was attached to the seat tracks of an International Standard Payload Rack (ISPR) located in the Columbus Laboratory. MARES provides a flexible and accurate tool for studying the muscle-skeletal system in the microgravity environment. It will serve both the space research/human physiology communities, as well as the Medical Operations (MEDOPS) officers, who are responsible for maintaining crew health during long-duration space flight. MARES is capable of providing quantifiable stimuli to a wide range of space flight participants and accurately measuring these crew-members' muscle performance. Muscle Atrophy Research and Exercise System (MARES) Components The hardware can be divided into five main components. thumb =Main electro-mechanical box= The main electro-mechanical box contains the powerful MARES direct drive motor which provides the core mechanical stimulus of the facility. The motor is capable of producing torques in the range of 3 Nm to 900 Nm. To give some examples of common torque values from \\"everyday life\\", a Black and Decker Cordless drill has about 12 Nm of torque, a 20 cm wrench with 120 N of force applied gives 24 Nm of torque and a 2002 Ford Focus ZTS running at 4500 RPM has 183 Nm of torque. This MARES direct drive motor is capable of producing rotation at angular velocities between 5 degrees/sec and 515 degrees/s, or 343 degrees/s for eccentric motion. The main box also contains power, control, supervision, and servo drive electronics, cooling fans, and a connector panel used to connect the HRF workstation and other external devices to MARES, such as PEMS II. The MARES motor may need up to 8 kW to accelerate but only for some tens of milliseconds. To minimize peak external power usage, MARES employs a battery, housed in the main box, which distributes these short power spikes over longer time periods. Using the battery as a buffer, MARES will consume an average of 150-200 W during a typical experimental session. =Human restraint system= The human restraint system includes the fully adjustable chair that the crew- member sits on, as well as a set of adjustable levers, connectors, pads, restraints, and hand-grips designed by biomechanics experts to support the nine joint configurations with subjects ranging from 5 to 95 percentile in size. The restraint system aims to isolate muscle groups under study and maintain the alignment of the joint and motor axes, while maintaining an acceptable subject comfort. The restraint system also includes a pantograph, which is capable of translating and rotating the chair into a wide range of positions relative to the main box. =Linear adapter= The linear adapter is used to convert the motor rotation into linear movements. It can be used for exercising one or both arms or legs at any inclination and includes force and torque sensors at the hand-grips. =Vibration isolation= The vibration isolation frame is used to keep facility forces internal to MARES by mechanically isolating MARES from the ISPR seat track and the ISS. =Laptop= The laptop allows for the crew-member to control and monitor MARES operations, including set-up procedures, experiment steps, data display, data processing, results summaries, and programming of a desired experiment/exercise scenario. The MARES software is designed to clearly guide the subject/operator through all steps with tailored instructions, including text, graphics, and interaction prompts. It is fully programmable, allowing the user to set up complex movements by selecting from a pre-defined set of basic control algorithms for the motor, known as basic motion units (BMUs), and building up a sequence of exercise steps or routines. There is a BMU for each mode of muscle contraction, including: isometric (muscle contraction at a fixed length, i.e. no movement), isotonic concentric (muscle shortens as it contracts at a constant torque), isokinetic concentric (muscle shortens as it contracts but at a constant velocity), isotonic and isokinetic eccentric (muscle extended). In addition, there are eleven more BMUs used to support more sophisticated experimental setups, including: spring, friction, additional moment of inertia or mass, pseudo-gravitational, position control, velocity control, torque/force control, power control, physical elements, extended torque or force control and quick release. BMUs can be combined into distinct MARES profiles to create complex motions and to simulate common exercise routines used on Earth. These profiles can be developed on the ground by collaborating scientists and medical operations officers and uplinked to the MARES.

It is loosely based on Matt Baglio's book The Rite: The Making of a Modern Exorcist, which itself is based on supposedly real events as witnessed and recounted by American then-exorcist-in-training Father Gary Thomas and his experiences of being sent to Rome to be trained and work daily with veteran clergy of the practice. The film stars Anthony Hopkins, Colin O'Donoghue, Alice Braga, Ciar√°n Hinds, and Rutger Hauer. Shot in Rome, Budapest, and Blue Island, it was released on January 28, 2011 and grossed $32 million domestically. Plot Michael Kovak (Colin O'Donoghue) is the son of a successful funeral home owner and businessman, Istvan (Rutger Hauer). Disillusioned with his job as a mortician, Michael decides to enter a seminary and renounce his vows upon completion, thereby getting a free college degree. Four years later, Michael is being ordained to the rank of deacon at the seminary, after which he writes a letter of resignation to his superior, Father Matthew, citing a lack of faith. Father Matthew (Toby Jones), apparently wanting to talk to Michael, attempts to catch up to him on the street. He trips over a curb, causing a cyclist Sandra (Marija Karan), to swerve into the path of an oncoming van, and get critically injured. Seeing Michael's clerical garb, she asks him for absolution before her last breath. The hesitant Michael is unable to refuse; he comforts her and performing a blessing ritual to absolve her of her sins. Seeing how calmly Michael handled the situation, Father Matthew tells Michael that he is called to be a priest despite his unwillingness. He also tells Michael that with the rise in demonic possessions every year, the Church needs more exorcists and says that he has the potential to become one. Father Matthew advises him to go to the Vatican in Rome to attend an exorcism course taught by his friend Father Xavier (Ciar√°n Hinds). Michael agrees after Father Matthew tells him that the Church might convert his scholarship into a student loan that would cost him $100,000 if his resignation is accepted before he takes his vows. If Michael attends the exorcism classes and still wants to leave, then it can be discussed (hinting that he may be free to leave). In Italy, Michael meets Angelina (Alice Braga), also taking the course. He soon learns that she is a reporter who has been asked to cover the course for a newspaper article in the Dominican. Father Xavier notes Michael's skepticism and very tentative faith and asks him to meet a renowned friend, a Welsh Jesuit exorcist named Father Lucas (Anthony Hopkins). Michael meets Father Lucas at his home, where he also meets one of the priest's patients: a pregnant sixteen-year-old girl named Rosaria (Marta Gastini), who is possessed and Lucas is trying to exorcise. It is later revealed that she had been raped and abandoned by her father, which led to her possession. However, Michael remains skeptical, even after witnessing several preternatural events, such as the girl coughing up three long nails and speaking English fluently. She even pointedly reminds Michael of the last patient he anointed and of his loathing for his own father. Angelina requests Michael to relay any information he gets from Father Lucas to her, as the latter has always refused to be interviewed by her, which Michael declines. Rosaria tries to drown herself and is hospitalized. In the hospital, Father Lucas performs another exorcism. Rosaria miscarries; the baby dies from cardiac arrest, and the mother from major hemorrhaging. Disheartened, Father Lucas feels he has failed her. After this Michael decides to confide with Angelina. After Rosaria's death, Father Lucas begins behaving strangely. Michael and Angelina find him sitting outside his house in the rain. Father Lucas takes them into his house and, knowing himself to be possessed, requests that Michael bring Father Xavier to perform the exorcism. Angelina and Michael try desperately to contact and find Father Xavier, but the latter has gone to Civitavecchia for three days. Michael decides to perform the exorcism himself with Angelina. After constant rebuking by the demon and a long, drawn-out fight, Michael regains his lost faith and is able to force the demon to reveal its name, Baal. He completes the exorcism, saying that he believes the demon exists, and he believes in an all powerful God as well. The demon leaves Father Lucas. Michael bids goodbye to Father Lucas, returning to the United States. The film ends with Father Michael Kovak, receiving a letter that Angelina has published an article on exorcism, and entering a confessional to hear a girl's confession in the church Cast * Anthony Hopkins as Father Lucas Trevant * Colin O'Donoghue as Michael Kovak * Alice Braga as Angelina Vargas * Ciar√°n Hinds as Father Xavier * Rutger Hauer as Istvan Kovak * Marta Gastini as Rosaria * Maria Grazia Cucinotta as Aunt Andria * Toby Jones as Father Matthew * Chris Marquette as Eddie * Marija Karan as Sandra * Torrey DeVitto as Nina Production Mikael H√•fstr√∂m began working on the exorcism thriller in February 2010. H√•fstr√∂m began casting in March for the lead roles of Father Lucas and Michael Kovak, deciding on Anthony Hopkins and Colin O'Donoghue. The film was produced by Beau Flynn and Tripp Vinson (The Exorcism of Emily Rose) under their Contrafilm Studios company. =Background= Actress Torrey DeVitto portrayed Nina in the film The film is based on the book The Making of a Modern Exorcist by Rome-based Matt Baglio, which was published in 2009. To research the book, Baglio participated in a seminar on exorcism by the Vatican-sponsored Pontifical Athenaeum Regina Apostolorum where he met Father Gary Thomas, a parish priest from Sacred Heart Church in Saratoga, California, who was tasked by the local bishop in San Jose, California to become an exorcist for the diocese. Initially skeptical and reluctant, Father Gary becomes an \\"apprentice\\" to a Rome-based exorcist and his skepticism is soon replaced by the cold reality of evil and the ways it sometimes takes the form of demonic possession. The book traces Father Gary's life prior to and subsequent to their acquaintance in 2005 which involved Baglio observing over twenty exorcisms performed by Father Gary. Baglio indicates that the experience in writing the book \\"was just a very spiritual process and in a lot of ways, it helped me reconnect to the Church and understand the value of faith. This isn't something that is silly and prayer, it's very important.\\" While Baglio was still researching his book, producers Tripp Vinson and Beau Flynn (who had already produced The Exorcism of Emily Rose) learned about Baglio's book proposal and decided to purchase the movie rights. The producers contacted Michael Petroni (who was one of the writers for The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader) to write the screenplay. Petroni, a practicing Catholic, coordinated the development of his screenplay with Baglio, who was now writing the book at about the same time. Director H√•fstr√∂m was invited to direct the film \\"intrigued by the fact that he would be working from facts, not just someone's imagination.\\" While the film is focused on demonic possession and exorcism, H√•fstr√∂m also believes that \\"this story is about a young man finding himself and finding his way.\\" In preparation for the film, H√•fstr√∂m attended some exorcisms in Rome although never being present in the actual room, he could hear what was taking place. Father Gary Thomas served as a consultant on the set of \\"The Rite\\" and indicated that the exorcisms in the film were \\"very accurate\\" with some \\"expected licenses\\" taken. Release Warner Bros. released the film on January 28, 2011. Reception The film was generally well received within the Catholic community although questioning its classification as \\"horror\\". The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops noted: \\"Though shaky on a few details, director Mikael H√•fstr√∂m's conversion tale resoundingly affirms faith and the value of priestly ministry. Yet the effort to showcase the main character's spiritual journey as an old-fashioned chillfest weakens its ultimate impact.\\" It received negative reviews from mainstream critics, where it has a 21% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 158 reviews stating that while \\"Anthony Hopkins is as excellent as ever, but he is no match for The Rites dawdling pace and lack of chills, as well as Colin O'Donoghue's tentative performance in the leading role.\\" Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film 3 out of 4 stars and said, \\"I admire The Rite because while it delivers what I suppose should be called horror, it is atmospheric, its cinematography is eerie and evocative, and the actors enrich it.\\" See also * List of ghost films * Baal * Christian demonology * Demonic possession * Exorcism * The Exorcism of Emily Rose * The Exorcist References External links  * * Category:2011 films Category:2011 horror films Category:2011 horror thriller films Category:2010s supernatural horror films Category:American films Category:American horror thriller films Category:American supernatural horror films Category:American supernatural thriller films Category:Demons in film Category:English-language films Category:Films about exorcism Category:Films based on horror novels Category:Films directed by Mikael H√•fstr√∂m Category:Films produced by Beau Flynn Category:Films scored by Alex Heffes Category:Films set in Rome Category:Films set in Vatican City Category:Films shot in Budapest Category:Films shot in Rome Category:Horror films based on actual events Category:Hungarian films Category:Hungarian horror films Category:Hungarian thriller films Category:Hungarian-language films Category:Italian films Category:Italian supernatural horror films Category:Italian horror thriller films Category:Italian-language films Category:Latin-language films Category:New Line Cinema films Category:Russian-language films Category:Films about spirit possession Category:Warner Bros. films Category:Welsh-language films ","title":"The Rite (2011 film)"},{"id":"26695341","text":"Leonard H.

Rajamani provided the background score.  Plot  Ex-underworld don Zakkir Ali Hussein, after giving up violence, is settled peacefully in the suburbs of Kochi. It was under the strong influence of his foster father, Bappu Haji Mustafa, that he left Mumbai. An unsuccessful assassination attempt on Haji Mustafa in Mumbai by Raman Naik, an underworld don ignites old wounds in Zakir. He, despite repeated pleas from Haji Mustafa and Ilanthaloor Rama Varma, a father like figure, sets out to Mumbai along with his trusted lieutenant Hamid Plavilakandi Mather, alias Malayalees. With the help of his friend Arjun, Zakir kills down Raman Naik and reaches back in Kochi. On his way back, at Kochi, he meets up with Maya Mary Kurien, Asst. Commissioner of Police, who slowly starts developing a crush on him. Zakir Hussein is visited by Balaraman, a liquor baron and a former M.P and M.L.A, who warns Zakkir of dire consequences if he continues to interfere in the Mumbai crime world. He also attempts to woo Zakir, but the latter refuses to bow down, sending strong warning to Balaraman and his group. Balaraman, along with Devadevan Nambiar, alias DD, and Arun Naik, the brother of Raman Naik in Mumbai, is planning to finish off Zakir Hussein and Haji Mustafa to regain the lost turf in Mumbai. They are supported by Lahayil Vakkachan, the tainted, savagery and double- faced Home Minister of Kerala. Joseph Madachery, the I.G of police conducts a raid at Haji Mustafa's poor home on behalf of Vakachan, and beats up Rama Varma Thirumulpad brutally, but the sudden arrival of Zakir saves him. Joseph is severely beaten by Zakir in full public presence, which infuriates Balaraman and DD, who try to demoralize Zakir by publishing fabricated stories about his relationship with ACP Maya Kurein and inmates of Haji Mustafa Trust's destitute home. Lahayil Vakachan tries to create a truce between Zakir and Balaraman, but fails miserably and gets violently berated and stripped in the presence of a lady M.L.A by Zakir. This leads to a series of problems, including the arrest of Jaganathan (Appu), a close buddy of Zakir, on false narcotic drug charges from Haji Mustafa Trust. Left with no other option, Zakir decides to meet the Chief Minister for Appu's release from unlawful apprehension. Then, Joseph arrests Zakir for providing refuge to Appu and hoarding drugs in the trust's medicine store (a forged charge) - later, Zakir is released. A well coordinated murder attempt is made on Zakir by professional assassins hired from Bombay, he escapes valiantly - defeating the hitmen. Jaganasthan is killed in police custody. Balaraman and DD kills Rama Varma Thirumulpad, which prompts Zakir to take the law in his own hands. At a public gathering - a three day convention organised to commemorate the 50th Anniversary of Vakkachan's political entry - while addressing thousands of party workers, Zakir Hussein enters by duping police and kills Balaraman, Lahayil Vakkachan, Devadevan and Joseph.

Discovery The species name was after Noel Williamson, a political officer at Sadiya who was murdered in 1911. The murder led to an expedition in the Abor region by the British government in India. Stanley Wells Kemp, then an assistant superintendent at the Indian Museum at Calcutta was a zoologist attached to this expedition. The first specimen was found near the gorge of the Dihang River near Rotung. Although the nearest known velvet worm species, from Malaya, are typically found in dead wood, these were found mainly under large stones near the roots of trees. It is the only South Asian species in the phylum. Description These velvet worms have no eyes. The colour of the upperside is a deep umber brown with the tips of the antennae slightly paler brown. The papillae on the skin have pale tips and the underside is pale brown. Some individuals have a dark dorsal stripe. It has 19 to 20 pairs of oncopods, the inner jaw has a serrate edge. The oncopods have coxal glands, four complete and spiny pads and the feet have two papillae. Although Kemp believed that the species was closer to neotropical forms than to Southeast Asian forms, modern studies place them close to Eoperipatus of Southeast Asia.

S. Suresh Babu and written by Dennis Joseph, loosely based on a novel by Muttathu Varkey. It stars Mammootty in the title role as Kunjachan, with Ranjini, Innocent, KPAC Lalitha, Sukumaran, Babu Antony, and Prathapachandran appearing in supporting roles. Produced by M. Mani, the plot was set in the Kottayam-Catholic backdrop in Kerala, with characters speaking the native Kottayam dialect. Plot Mikhael (Innocent) is a family man and good Christian who lives in the mostly tranquil village of Odaangara, with his wife Aleyamma (KPAC Lalitha). They have two daughters, Mollykutty (Ranjini) and Susie and a son, Kuttappan. They have been involved in a long-standing dispute with their neighbour, Kanjirappalli Paappan (Prathapachandran), who wants to buy their land so that his bungalow would have a better front view and a road for his car. Paappan's ruthless son, Jimmy (Babu Antony) is all for ejecting them by force, while Paappan is wary of what Aleyamma's siblings, the Uppukandam Brothers, who are infamous thugs, might do in retaliation. When negotiations fail, Paappan resorts to underhanded tactics and scuttles Mollykutty's marriage proposal to Kuzhiyil Joy (Ravi Vallathol) and beats up Mikhael who questions it. Aleyaamma get her brothers involved, and Paappan and his son are beaten and humiliated by the Uppukandam brothers, led by Korah (Sukumaran) the eldest. Later, Joy visits Mollykutty and expresses his interest in her. Meanwhile, 'Kottayam' Kunjachan (Mammotty), an erstwhile thug, has just been released from jail. He has served a sentence of 7 years, for killing a man in a fight gone bad. He makes a dramatic entrance to Kottayam town and goes to collect his promised compensation. After an altercation with his previous employers, he is arrested and later bailed out by his guardian, a Christian priest (Jose Prakash) who found him as an infant in a garbage heap, and raised him as his own. Following his father's advice, he leaves Kottayam and its bad influences for Odaangara. He starts a technical institute, accompanied by Bosco (Baiju), his assistant. He generally endears himself to the village populace. It is there that he meets Mikhael and his wife, and gets in their good books by rescuing Mollykutty from a kidnap attempt by Jimmy and gang. Aleyamma convinces Mikhael to rent out their outhouse to Kunjachan, as a deterrent from further attacks by Paappan or Jimmy. Mikhael then convinces Kunjachan to go to confession, and start living as a good Christian. Kunjachan takes a liking to Molly, who despises him for his past. However, when her parents attempt her to coerce her into another marriage, Molly has Susie enlist Kunjachan's help to scuttle it, which he does masterfully. Kunjachan assumes that she returns his affections. His attempts to talk to Molly are mistaken for a rape attempt by Aleyamma. Mikhael throws him out and Kunjachan is too shocked to react. He is later beaten up by the Uppukandam brothers. Molly doesn't intervene, and she is reprimanded by Susie who realizes that Molly has used Kunjachan. Shortly afterwards, Mikhael and Korah are ambushed and killed by Jimmy and Kunjachan is the prime suspect. Kunjachan goes into hiding, and angrily confronts Molly and Susie when he gets an opportunity. Molly is aghast that Joy never showed up in her time of need and throws herself at Kunjachan's mercy. He learns that Aleyamma is missing, and Kuttappan, her son has gone in search. He convinces them that he is innocent, and goes off to find Aleyamma. He manages to rescue her and her son from Jimmy's thugs, but returns to find Molly and Susie missing and the rest of the Uppukandam brothers on the scene. They learn after beating up Paappan that the women have been taken to their plantation by Jimmy, and mount a rescue mission. Molly and Susie are rescued in the nick of time by Kunjachan, who consoles Molly after her near-rape by Jimmy. The next morning, Kunjachan is visited at his institute by the Brothers. He fears another confrontation, but they reveal that they are there to propose Molly's marriage to Kunjachan.

Later in Jan 2020 he said he is dropping the sequel idea, because lack of story idea to prove justice to the original film. Production The screenplay was loosely based on a novel titled 'Veli' written by Muttathu Varkey. The protagonist character Kunjachan, played by Mammootty, was adapted from the antagonist character of the same name in the novel. It was Muttathu Varkey's literary style that inspired the makers to feature the Kottayam accent in the movie. Varkey wrote his novel in a complete regional dialect. As a person who hails from Ettumanoor village of Kottayam district, screenwriter Dennis Joseph felt writing dialogues for characters easy and familiar to his native style. According to Joseph, the five years long graduate education at Deva Matha College, Kuravilangad and the hostel life of there also helped him to form the dialogues more truthfully. He said that the character of 'Kuttappayi' from the film Samgham (1987) was also created by him in the same pattern. Mammootty whose native place also belongs to the Kottayam district could brought in the accent with perfection. Mammootty said, \\"I am from the northern edge of Kottayam. Therefore the accent has never influenced me, but I have absorbed it.\\" Mammootty received the whole script from Dennis Joseph before the filming began. Though the plot is based on Kottayam, the producer M. Mani wanted to shoot the film in Thiruvananthapuram. The makers found the village Amboori, near Neyyattinkara in Thiruvanathapuram district. The place was exactly look-alike a village in Kottayam with the features resembling such as rubber and black pepper plantations, big churches, unpaved roads, etc. The place was shot as 'Odaangara', the fictional village in the film.

Hayward was official architect of The Exeter Diocesan Architectural Society, which meant that all new designs for the churches in the Exeter Diocese passed through him for approval, and a member of Cambridge Camden Society, later The Ecclesiological Society. So popular was his work on local churches that St Andrew's, Exwick was described by The Ecclesiologist in July 1842, as the \\"best specimen of modern church we have yet seen.\\" This accolade soon led to further work; in Scotland, Lady Cecil Chetwynd-Talbot, the Marchioness of Lothian, commissioned Hayward to design St John's Church, Jedburgh in 1844, and in Oxfordshire he designed St. James' Church in Little Milton, Oxfordshire, to which he added the west tower in 1861. But probably his most famous design was for The Royal Albert Memorial Museum, Exeter. which opened in 1868 as a practical memorial to Prince Albert, and is the largest museum in the city. Whilst many of his designs were for religious use, he also designed schools and worked on other buildings, including The Hall, Pembroke College, Oxford,1844 http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=63889 which Nikolaus Pevsner described as \\"the most ambitious of all halls except Wolsey's\\" at Christ Church College, and Exeter Prison on New North Road, Exeter, which was based upon the plans of the new model prison at Pentonville. Hayward died on 7 May 1891. His son, Pearson Barry Hayward, worked under him, but died before his father in 1888; their practice was known as Messrs Hayward & Son.

It is widespread in the northern hemisphere in both rivers and lakes with good water quality. Description Red pondweed is a perennial herb anchoring in the mud substrate via a creeping rhizome. It produces a cylindrical unbranched stem, up to 2.8 m in length. It has sessile lance-shaped submerged leaves that are typically 70‚Äì180 mm long and 10‚Äì25 mm wide with 4-7 lateral veins on either side and a slightly hooded apex, with an untoothed margin. Floating leaves may also be produced. The inflorescence is a spike of flowers a few centimeters long rising above the water surface. Turions are absent, but in winter each stem dies back to a resting bud with a short length of root, which acts as a functional turion. Red pondweed Potamogeton alpinus and shoreweed Littorella uniflora growing in a stream pool in North Wales. Red pondweed is a reasonably distinctive plant and is not likely to be confused with any other pondweed. Early in the growing season it could be confused with P. polygonifolius, but the submerged leaves of the latter have petioles and are relatively longer. P. praelongus is generally greener with noticeably white, zig-zagged stems that generally branch, never produces floating leaves, and its submerged leaves clasp the stem. Fresh specimens often, but not always, show a reddish tint, but this becomes much more obvious in dried material. Despite its name it is neither restricted to alpine regions or unique among pondweeds in having a reddish colouration. Chromosome counts show that, like most other broad-leaved pondweeds, P. alpinus is tetraploid, with 2n=52 chromosomes. Hybrids have been described with P. crispus (P. √ó olivaceus Baag√∏e ex G.Fisch.), P. gramineus (P. √ó nericius Hagstr.), P. natans (P. √ó exilis Z.Kaplan & Uotila), P. nodosus (P. √ó argutulus Hagstr.), P. lucens (P. √ó nerviger Wolfg.), P. perfoliatus (P. √ó prussicus Hagstr.), P. polygonifolus, (P. √ó spathulatus Schrad. ex W.D.J.Koch & Ziz), and P. praelongus (P. √ó griffithii A. Benn.). All are rather rare, but where they do occur they may be locally abundant and long- lived. Taxonomy Potamogeton alpinus was described by the Italian botanist Giovanni Balbis in 1804. The species name means 'alpine'. Like many other pondweeds, the variability in growth form of P. alpinus in response to environmental conditions (phenotypic plasticity) and across its geographical range has led to it accumulating a number of synonyms. Distribution Red pondweed is native to much of the Northern Hemisphere, including Asia (Afghanistan, China (Heilongjiang), India (Assam), Japan, Kazakhstan, Korea, Myanmar, Pakistan, Russia, Uzbekistan), Europe (Austria, Belgium, Britain, Denmark, Estonia, France including Corsica, Germany, Ireland, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Spain (Pyrenees), Sweden, Switzerland), Greenland, Canada, and the northern United States, especially the Rockies. Ecology and conservation Potamogeton alpinus generally grows in neutral to mildly acid (but not very base-poor) water bodies such as lakes, slow-moving rivers and streams, and ponds. P. alpinus needs a deep fine substrate such as sand, silt or peat to root in and appears to avoid exposed situations. It is, mainly restricted to fairly nutrient-poor waters. In European rivers, it is associated with high quality environments. In a large- scale study of the plant communities of 3447 British lakes, red pondweed was found in 169, with a preference for circumneutral, moderate alkalinity lakes. Unlike other broad-leaved pondweeds, the stolons of red pondweed die back in winter, leaving constellations of resting buds rooted in the substrate, which regrow in spring. In rivers, red pondweed can persist entirely by asexual means (rooting of stem fragments and turion-like resting bodies, and growth in summer) though this may reflect weed cutting suppressing flowering and seed set. In Britain P. alpinus has declined markedly, especially in the south, though it still occurs throughout Britain. In Wales red pondweed was recently assessed as Critically Endangered, and in England it is categorised as Vulnerable. Declines have also been reported elsewhere in Europe and North America; it is Regionally Extinct in Luxemburg and Pennsylvania, Critically Endangered in Spain, Vulnerable in Germany and the Netherlands, Endangered in the Czech Republic, the Carpathian region, Flanders and New Jersey and threatened in New Hampshire and New York. This is likely related to a combaination of eutrophication, infilling of ponds and canalization of rivers. It is still widespread in Scotland and Ireland and presumably in other more sparsely populated parts of its range such as Canada, Scandinavia and Siberia. Red pondweed is one of the so-called Magnopotamion group of pondweeds. These are a characteristic floristic component of the protected Habitats Directive habitat Type 'Natural eutrophic lakes with Magnopotamion'. Cultivation Potamogeton alpinus is not in widespread cultivation, and seems to be rather difficult to maintain, competing poorly with other pond plants. It is possible that this is related to its preference for a deep fine substrate. In common with other pondweeds of this group it roots poorly from stem cuttings and is best propagated by division of the rhizomes. Red pondweed (Potamogeton alpinus) in cultivation (Wales, UK). The smaller, greener leaved plant is Potamogeton gramineus.

Cretors & Company is an American manufacturing company, specializing in popcorn machines and other concessions equipment. It was established in 1885 with the invention of the first large-scale commercial popcorn machine to pop corn in oil. C. Cretors & Co. is in Wood Dale, Illinois and is still owned by the Cretors family.\\"Cretors celebrates 125th anniversary\\" , filmjournal.com, 14 January 2010. History Charles D. Cretors, Bud Cretors, Andrew Cretors, and Beth Cretors =1880s through 1890s= Charles Cretors was originally from Lebanon, Ohio, but eventually made his way to Decatur, Illinois, where he opened a bakery and eventually a confectionery shop. He purchased a peanut roaster for his shop to broaden his product line to include freshly roasted peanuts. Not satisfied with the new machine, he redesigned it for better function. He moved to Chicago seeking success by selling his new machine. He purchased a vendors license to test his machine in front of his shop. The license, dated December 2, 1885, marks the inception of C. Cretors & Co.Popcorn Popper History at Pop Maize The new roaster was driven by a small steam engine, which automated the roasting process. By 1893, Cretors had created a steam powered machine that could roast peanuts as well as popcorn in oil. Cretors' machine design offered several advantages over the hand-operated process. Cretors‚Äô machine became the first automated machine that could pop popcorn uniformly in its own seasonings. As a result, the product was uniform every time. Cretors applied for a patent on his automated peanut roaster and popcorn popper machine, which was granted in 1893. A chance meeting happened between Cretors and J. M. Savage, a traveling salesman who purchased a bag of roasted peanuts. Savage was intrigued with the new peanut roaster and offered to sell it in his territory. Cretors agreed to the proposal, and hired his first salesman. Charles Cretors took his new popcorn wagon to the Midway of Chicago's Columbian Exposition in 1893 and introduced the new corn product. After a trial period where Cretors gave away samples of his new popcorn product, people lined up to purchase bags of the hot, buttered popcorn. The smell of roasting peanuts and of hot buttered corn being popped in its seasoning before the buyers' attracted attention and sales.History of Popcorn - Popper History at popcorn.org =1900s through 1930s= By 1900, Cretors introduced the Special, the first large horse-drawn popcorn wagon. It was an immediate success. Three variations of this wagon were created. This was when electricity was becoming available. Cretors created the first popcorn machine with an electric motor. Thus, C. Cretors and Company holds one of the oldest active Underwriters Laboratories numbers (EA175) for electrically operated machinery.Planet Popcorn The electric poppers soon took to market and electricity became the choice of power, as steam power had a reputation for being complicated and dangerous. Lithograph of Cretors' \\"Improved No. 2 Wagon\\" As movie theater attendance grew through the 1920s, Cretors began designing machines that could pop and hold more of the product. Popcorn continued to grow in popularity through the Great Depression due to its low cost. =During World War II= C. Cretors and Company adapted when faced with World War II. In 1941 the War Production Board issued L-65, stopping all non-war-related production. Cretors became a government supplier in the war effort. Cretors purchased new production equipment and produced aircraft oil line fittings and mechanical radio components, among other things. After the war, the company faced a shortage of materials. Cretors introduced the Super 60, a popcorn machine with an all walnut cabinet. Since then they have continued designing new poppers and features to meet the new needs of theaters, concession stands, and customers. =Further expansion= Cretors has continued to expand their product line to include other food service equipment including warming cabinets, expanded topping and dispensing systems, hot dog, nacho cheese, and caramelizing and nut roasting equipment.

The local TIPANET agent collects payment instructions and converts them into the TIPANET message format, which complies with the SWIFT MT 102+ message structure. The TIPANET format handles credit transfers and money-cheques. After collecting the payment orders, the local agent compiles payment blocks and sends composite instructions to the respective foreign agents, who then convert the TIPANET message format into its domestic equivalent for local execution. The latest time for the exchange of files on any working day is 4 p.m. local time of the receiving bank for next-day execution.

He was the son of a prosperous factory owner. Nevertheless, at the height of the Industrial Revolution in Spain, he was an early proponent of the natural connection of the Christian faith with the working class, who were suffering in miserable working and living conditions. On January 10, 1874 he founded the religious congregation of the Servants of St. Joseph in Salamanca, Spain, together with Saint Bonifacia Rodr√≠guez y Castro. She was from a very poor background and had lived supporting herself as a ropemaker, when she met him. The congregation they founded was to live in the same manner as Jesus and St. Joseph, in their home in Nazareth, while simultaneously helping their neighbors, especially women, realize the realities of their lives in the light of the Gospel, that they might be free and critical members of their society. In April of that same year, as a result of the anti-clerical decrees of the First Spanish Republic, he was expelled from Spain along with the entire Society of Jesus, of which he was a member. He continued to support the community in Salamanca through correspondence. After the fall of the Republic at the end of the year and the re-establishment of the Spanish monarchy, he was able to return. At that time, he settled in his native region of Catalonia. He continued his preaching of his vision of a proletariat Catholicism, even though the hierarchy of the Roman Catholic Church sought to re-establish its position as a bulwark of stability as it had been for centuries past. He remained in correspondence with Mother Bonifacia during this time, urging her to come to Catalonia to establish communities of the Servants of St. Joseph there. This she was unable to do at the time, partly due to the still unsettled times. As a consequence, in February 1875 Butiny√† founded several houses of Religious Sisters himself in that region. He continued to urge Rodr√≠guez to come and establish a formal connection of these communities with the original community in Salamanca which she headed. The Reverend Mother finally set out for Catalonia in 1882 for this purpose. During a stay in Zaragoza to consult with Butiny√†, while on her way back to Salamanca, Mother Bonifacia received a letter from the community in Salamanca, which was signed by a member there who called herself the Religious Superior of the community. Subsequent efforts at reconciliation with that community proved fruitless, and Rodr√≠guez had to start over in another city. As another result of this chain of events, the communities Butiny√† had founded in Catalonia decided not to proceed with any union with the Castilian communities. They formed themselves into a new congregation, the Daughters of St. Joseph in 1885. On November 15, 2006, at the joint petition of the two Religious Congregations of Sisters he had founded, the Congregation for the Causes of Saints in Rome accepted the request to start the process of Fr. Butiny√†'s canonization.  Published works  * Un tractat de mec√†nica. Observacions meteorol√≤giques.

During the war, she was involved in the assaults on Tripoli in North Africa and on the island of Rhodes in the eastern Mediterranean Sea. She was obsolescent by World War I and was slated to be broken up in 1914‚Äì15, but the need for warships granted Emanuele Filiberto a respite. She spent the war as a harbor defense ship in Venice. She was stricken from the naval register in June 1920 and subsequently broken up for scrap.

In 1902-03, Emanuele Filiberto was in the main Italian fleet with her sister, the three Re Umbertos and two of the s; while in their normal peacetime training routine, the ships of the main fleet were kept in commission for exercises for seven months of the year. For the remaining five months, they were kept in a partial state of readiness with reduced crews.Brassey (1903), p. 60 In October 1906, the ship participated in major fleet maneuvers under the command of Vice Admiral Alfonso di Brochetti in the Ionian Sea.

The two units met on 17 April off the island of Stampalia, after which the combined fleet steamed north. The following day, the ships cut submarine telegraph cables between Imbros, Tenedos, Lemnos, Salonica, and the Dardanelles. Most of the fleet bombarded the fortresses protecting the Dardanelles; in the meantime, Emanuele Filiberto and the torpedo boat steamed to the port of Vathy on the island of Samos and bombarded the Ottoman army barracks there. Ostro then torpedoed an Ottoman gunboat in the harbor, after which the Italian ships left.

The threat from these underwater weapons to his capital ships was too serious for him to use the fleet in an active way.Halpern 1995, p. 150 Instead, Revel decided to implement a blockade at the relatively safer southern end of the Adriatic with the battle fleet, while smaller vessels, such as the MAS boats, conducted raids on Austro-Hungarian ships and installations. Meanwhile, Revel's battleships would be preserved to confront the Austro-Hungarian battle fleet in the event that it sought a decisive engagement. As a result, Emanuele Filiberto and the rest of the Italian battle fleet did not see significant action during the war.Halpern 1995, pp. 141‚Äì142 Once Italy entered the war, Emanuele Filiberto was used as a harbor defense ship in Venice to protect the port from Austrian naval attacks. She was aided in this task by her sister and the old battleship , along with two cruisers and several smaller craft.Sondhaus, p. 274 The ship remained in the Italian Navy's inventory for only a short time after the end of the war in 1918, and she was stricken from the naval register on 29 March 1920 and subsequently broken up for scrap.

Rebar detectors are less sophisticated devices that can only locate metallic objects below the surface. Due to the cost-effective design, the pulse-induction method is one of the most commonly used solutions. Method The pulse-induction method is based on electromagnetic pulse induction technology to detect rebars. Coils in the probe are periodically charged by current pulses and thus generate a magnetic field. On the surface of any electrically conductive material which is in the magnetic field eddy currents are produced. They induce a magnetic field in opposite directions. The resulting change in voltage can be utilized for the measurement. Rebars that are closer to the probe or of larger size produce a stronger magnetic field. Modern rebar detectors use different coil arrangements to generate several magnetic fields. Advanced signal processing supports not only the localization of rebars but also the determination of the cover and the estimation of the bar diameter. This method is unaffected by all non conductive materials such as concrete, wood, plastics, bricks, etc. However any kind of conductive materials within the magnetic field will have an influence on the measurement.

This new drug has successfully finished Phase I, Phase II, and Phase III human clinical trials. It has shown superiority to cisplatin in combination with paclitaxel as a chemotherapy regimen in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) adenocarcinomas. Mechanism of action Lipoplatin evades immune surveillance thus escaping clearance from macrophages, circulates for long periods in body fluids after intravenous administration with a half-life of ~120 h, and extravasates through the compromised endothelium of the vasculature in tumors created during the process of neoangiogenesis Extravasation Figure. Thus, lipoplatin nanoparticles are concentrated to the primary tumor and metastases. Human studies have shown 40- to 200-fold higher platinum concentration compared to the adjacent normal tissue in specimens from human biopsies 20 post-infusion of the drug. Lipoplatin nanoparticles once inside the tumor cell mass can fuse with the cell membrane because of the presence of the fusogenic lipid DPPG in their lipid bilayer; an alternative mechanism proposed is that lipoplatin is taken by endocytosis by tumor cells as shown from lipoplatin containing fluorescent lipids and imaging of the tumor cells in culture thus treated with fluorescent microscopy. These processes occurring at the cell membrane level are promoted by the lipid shell of the nanoparticles (disguised as nutrients). The technology allows lipoplatin to empty its toxic payload (cisplatin) inside the cytoplasm to kill the tumor cell. The cell membrane is considered a significant barrier to transportation of the toxic molecules of cisplatin across and inside the tumor cell. Trials The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) gave lipoplatin orphan drug status in 2007 in an ongoing registrational Phase II/III study as a first line-treatment in pancreatic cancer. Under the trade name Nanoplatin, lipoplatin received EMEA consent in 2009 to be tested as a first-line treatment for non-squamous cell non-small-cell lung cancers (ns-NSCLC) that are mainly composed of adenocarcinomas. The results of a Phase III trial were published in October 2011. This study used lipoplatin in combination with paclitaxel to treat ns-NSCLC, comparing response rates and toxicities to a similar group of patients treated with cisplatin plus paclitaxel and demonstrated a statistically significant (‚Äò‚Äôp‚Äô‚Äô-value = 0.036) increase in tumor response rate in the lipoplatin arm (59.22% of patients) versus the cisplatin arm (42.42% of patients). Most major toxicities of cisplatin, especially nephrotoxicity, were also reduced in the group of patients treated with lipoplatin and treatment did not require hospitalisation for lipoplatin patients. Median survival times were 10 months for the lipoplatin arm and 8 months for the cisplatin arm, with a ‚Äò‚Äôp‚Äô‚Äô-value of 0.155. The median duration of response was 7 months for the lipoplatin arm and 6 months for the cisplatin arm. Although not statistically significant, these results suggest the potential for superior overall survival for lipoplatin compared to cisplatin, a hypothesis that is being tested in a larger trial. Furthermore, among the responders to lipoplatin a subgroup of patients demonstrated a substantially higher overall survival than a comparable subgroup of cisplatin responders. After 10 months, 30% of patients in the lipoplatin arm, as compared with just 16% of patients in the cisplatin arm, were without disease progression. By the end of the trial, there were 32 patients alive, 21 from the lipoplatin arm (20.39%) and 11 from the cisplatin arm (11.11%). Thus, after 18 months, the number of surviving patients was approximately double for lipoplatin versus cisplatin. The clinical development of lipoplatin in adenocarcinomas establishes this drug as the most active platinum drug with significantly lower side effects. Preliminary investigations suggest the potential for lipoplatin to be a suitable agent for targeting ovarian cancer in patients with aggressive cisplatin resistance.

A relevant requirement in the development of gUSE was to enable the simultaneous handling of a very large number of jobs, even in the range of millions, without compromising the response time at the user interface. In order to achieve this level of concurrency, the workflow management back-end of gUSE is implemented based on the web service concept of Service Oriented Architecture (SOA).  Science Gateway Framework  There are many user communities who would like to access several DCIs in a transparent way but they don't want to learn the peculiar features of the used DCIs. They want to concentrate their scientific application - for them using a Science Gateway (SG) is the solution. An SG provides an interface between a scientist (or community) and the distributed computing infrastructures (DCIs). An SG framework, like gUSE, provides a specific set of enabling technologies as well as frontend and backend services that together build a generic gateway. SG frameworks are not specialized for a certain scientific area and hence scientists from many different areas can use them. An enabling technology such as gUSE provides the required software stack to develop SG frameworks and SG instances (provide a simplified user interface that is highly tailored to the needs of the given scientific community). Typical examples of such enabling technologies are: web application containers (Tomcat, Glassfish, etc.), portal or web application frameworks (Liferay, Spring, etc.), database management systems (MySQL, etc.), workflow management systems (gUSE itself, MOTEUR, etc.) SGs can have varying goals. In general, researchers who use gateways can focus on their scientific goals and less on assembling the e-Infrastructure that is required. An important goal is to make it easier for scientists to use (national) computing and storage resources, while creating and using collaborative tools for sharing data. The SG framework can be used by National Grid Initiatives (NGIs) to support small user communities who cannot afford to develop their own customized SG. The gUSE SG framework also provides two Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), namely the Application-Specific Module API and the Remote API, to create application-specific SGs according to the needs of different user communities.  Features  The gUSE provides with WS-PGRADE a graphical user interface to create and execute workflows on various Distributed Computing Infrastructures (DCIs). Among many other features, the main five capabilities of gUSE are as follows: (1) gUSE is a general-purpose SG framework under which users can access more than twenty different DCIs via the DCI Bridge service, and six different data storage types (HTTP, HTTPS, GSIFTP, S3, SFTP, and SRM) via the Data Avenue service. Both DCI Bridge and Data Avenue were developed as part of the WS-PGRADE/gUSE service stack, but they can also be used as independent services enabling their use from other types of gateways and workflow systems. (2) WS-PGRADE/gUSE is a workflow-oriented system. It extends the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)-based workflow concept with advanced parameter sweep (PS) features by special workflow nodes, condition-dependent workflow execution, and workflow embedding support. Moreover, gUSE extends the concrete workflow concept with the concepts of abstract workflow, workflow instance, and template. (3) WS-PGRADE/gUSE supports the development and execution of workflow-based applications. Users of gUSE define their applications as workflows. They can share their applications among each other by ex-porting them to the internal Application Repository. Other users can import such applications and execute or modify them in their user space. (4) gUSE supports the fast development of SG instances by a customization technology. gUSE can serve different needs, according to the community requirements about the computational power, the complexity of the applications, and the specificity of the user interface to fit the community needs and to meet its terminology. (5) The most important design aspect of gUSE is flexibility. Flexibility of gUSE is expressed *in exploiting parallelism: gUSE enables parallel execution inside a workflow node as well as among workflow nodes. It is possible to use multiple instances of the same workflow with different data files. *in the use of DCIs: gUSE can access various DCIs: clusters, cluster grids, desktop grids, supercomputers, and clouds. *in data storage access: gUSE workflow nodes can access different data storage services in different DCIs via the Data Avenue Blacktop service. Therefore, the file transfer among various storages and workflow nodes can be handled automatically/transparently. *in security management: For secure authentication it is possible to use users‚Äô personal certificates or robot certificates. *in cloud access: A large set of different clouds (Amazon, OpenStack, OpenNebula, etc.) can be accessed by WS-PGRADE/gUSE either directly (see Chap. 4) or via the CloudBroker Platform. *of supported gateway types: gUSE supports different gateway types: general-purpose gateways for national grids (e.g., for Greek and Italian NGIs), general-purpose gateways for particular DCIs (e.g., EDGI gateway), general-purpose gateways for specific technologies (e.g., SHIWA gateway for workflow sharing and interoperation) and domain-specific science gateway instances (e.g., Swiss proteomics portal, MoSGrid gateway, Autodock gateway, Seizmology gateway, and VisIVO). *in use of workflow systems: Users can access from the SHIWA Workflow Repository many workflows written in various workflow languages and use these workflows as embedded workflows inside WS-PGRADE workflow nodes.  Architecture  WS- PGRADE/gUSE Architecture The main goal of designing the multitier architecture of WS-PGRADE/gUSE was to enable versatile access to many different kinds of DCIs and data storage by different kinds of user interfaces. This access can be technically performed through the DCI Bridge job submission service which is in the bottom within the gUSE architectural layers, and via the Data Avenue Blacktop service that is an independent service provided by SZTAKI. DCI Bridge is a web service-based application providing standard access to various DCIs. It connects through its DCI plug-ins to the external DCI resources. When a user submits a workflow, its job components are submitted transparently into the various DCI systems via the DCI Bridge service using its standard OGSA Basic Execution Service 1.0 (BES) interface. As a result, the access protocol and all the technical details of the various DCI systems are totally hidden behind the BES interface. The job description language of BES is the standardized Job Submission Description Language (JSDL). The DCIs supported by DCI Bridge are the following: *Clusters (PBS, LSF, MOAB, SGE) *Grids (ARC, gLite, GT2, GT4, GT5, UNICORE, the Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment) *Supercomputers (e.g., via UNICORE) *Desktop grids (BOINC) *Clouds (via CloudBroker Platform, GAE, as well as EC2- and OCCI-based Cloud Access) The middle tier of the gUSE architecture contains the high-level gUSE services. The Workflow Storage stores every piece of information that is needed to define a workflow (graph structure description, input files pointers, output files pointers, executable code, and target DCI of workflow nodes) except the input files of the workflow. The local input files and the local output files created during workflow execution are stored in the File Storage. The Workflow Interpreter is responsible for the execution of workflows, which are stored in the Workflow Storage. the Information System holds information for users about workflows running and job status. Users of WS-PGRADE gateways work in isolated workspace, i.e., they see only their own workflows. In order to enable collaboration among the isolated users, the Application Repository stores the WS-PGRADE workflows in one of their five possible stages. (Physically all the five categories are stored as zip files.) The five categories of stored workflows are as follows, and the collaboration among the gateway users is possible via all these categories: *Graph (or abstract workflow) containing information only on the graph structure of the workflow. *Workflow (or concrete workflow) containing information both on the graph structure and on the configuration parameters (input files pointers, output files pointers, executable code and target DCI of workflow nodes). *Template: a workflow containing information on every possible modifiable parameter of the workflow if they can be changed by the users or not. These play an important role in the automatic generation of executable workflows in the end-user mode of a WS-PGRADE/gUSE gateway. *Application is a ready-to-use workflow that contains all the embedded workflows, too. It means that all the information needed to execute this workflow application is stored in the corresponding zip file. *Project is a workflow that is not completed yet and can be further developed by the person who uploaded it into the Application Repository or by another person (so collaborative workflow development among several workflow developers is supported in this way). At the top of the three-tier structure, the presentation tier provides WS-PGRADE, the graphical user interface of the generic SG framework. All functionalities of the underlying services are exposed to the users by portlets residing in a Liferay portlet container, which is part of WS-PGRADE. This layer can be easily customized and extended according to the needs of the SG instances to be derived from gUSE. The next section introduces the essential user-level elements of WS-PGRADE.

Symptoms  Seizures, frequent mood changes, and headaches are among the earliest symptoms of the tumor. Hemiparesis (physical weakness on one side of the body) is also common. Pathology Fibrillary astrocytomas arise from neoplastic astrocytes, a type of glial cell found in the central nervous system. They may occur anywhere in the brain, or even in the spinal cord, but are most commonly found in the cerebral hemispheres. As the alternative name \\"diffuse astrocytoma\\" implies, the outline of the tumour is not clearly visible in scans, because the borders of the neoplasm tend to send out tiny microscopic fibrillary tentacles that spread into the surrounding brain tissue. These tentacles intermingle with healthy brain cells, making complete surgical removal difficult. However, they are low-grade tumors, with a slow rate of growth, so patients commonly survive longer than those with otherwise similar types of brain tumours, such as glioblastoma multiforme. Diagnosis A continuous EEG recording of the brain's electrical activity may help to identify and localize seizure activity, especially in children. CT scans and MRI scans of the brain may show the presence of a diffuse mass that fails to light up when a contrast dye is given. In some cases, a biopsy may be required to confirm the nature of the tumour. Treatment Treatment options include surgery, radiotherapy, radiosurgery, and chemotherapy. The infiltrating growth of microscopic tentacles in fibrillary astrocytomas makes complete surgical removal difficult or impossible without injuring brain tissue needed for normal neurological function. However, surgery can still reduce or control tumor size. Possible side effects of surgical intervention include brain swelling, which can be treated with steroids, and epileptic seizures. Complete surgical excision of low-grade tumors is associated with a good prognosis. However, the tumor may recur if the resection is incomplete, in which case further surgery or the use of other therapies may be required. Standard radiotherapy for fibrillary astrocytoma requires 10 to 30 sessions, depending on the subtype of the tumor, and may sometimes be performed after surgical resection to improve outcomes and survival rates. Side effects include the possibility of local inflammation, leading to headaches, which can be treated with oral medication. Radiosurgery uses computer modelling to focus minimal radiation doses at the exact location of the tumour, while minimising the dose to the surrounding healthy brain tissue. Radiosurgery may be a complementary treatment after regular surgery, or it may represent the primary treatment technique. Although chemotherapy for fibrillary astrocytoma improves overall survival, it is effective only in about 20% of cases. Researchers are currently investigating a number of promising new treatment techniques including gene therapy, immunotherapy, and novel chemotherapies.

Zinc ferrite compounds can be prepared by aging solutions of Zn(NO3)2, Fe(NO3)3, and triethanolamine in the presence and in the absence of hydrazine, or reacting iron oxides and zinc oxide at high temperature. Spinel (Zn, Fe) Fe2O4 appears as a tan-colored solid that is insoluble in water, acids, or diluted alkali. Because of their high opacity, zinc ferrites can be used as pigments, especially in applications requiring heat stability. For example, zinc ferrite prepared from yellow iron oxide can be used as a substitute for applications in temperatures above . When added to high corrosion-resistant coatings, the corrosion protection increases with an increase in the concentration of zinc ferrite. A recent investigation shows that the zinc ferrite, which is paramagnetic in the bulk form, becomes ferrimagnetic in nanocrystalline thin film format.
