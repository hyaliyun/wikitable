First mentioned in the late 1980s, the purported sightings and damage attributed to the creature yielded a significant amount of newspaper, radio and television publicity. Professor of religious studies, Joseph P. Laycock, described the media frenzy and subsequent cult appreciation for this and other similar claims as following a predictable \\"chain of events ‚Äì a strange sighting, media attention, more sightings, followed by visits from curious tourists and monster hunters\\". Researcher Ben Radford states that this is a compelling story, \\"but several important aspects wither under skeptical scrutiny\\". History On July 14, 1988 the Lee County sheriff's office investigated a report of a car damaged overnight while parked at a home in the area of Browntown outside Bishopville, South Carolina, on the edges of the Scape Ore Swamp. The car reportedly had toothmarks and scratches with hair and muddy footprints left behind. Sheriff Liston Truesdale noted this was the start of various claims that eventually coalesced into a story about a lizard man in the swamp. Prompted by the news of the vehicle damage, 17-year-old local Christopher Davis reported to the sheriff that his car was damaged by a creature he described as \\"green, wetlike, about 7 feet tall and had three fingers, red eyes, skin like a lizard, snakelike scales\\" two weeks prior. According to Davis, he was driving home from working the night shift at a fast food restaurant when his car got a flat tire. After fixing it, he saw a creature walking toward him. Davis got in his car and began to drive, but the creature was soon on top of the car. He applied his brakes, causing the creature to roll off the car, giving Davis enough time to escape. Coverage by newspapers and media resulted in increased attention for his claims. Local businesses began selling \\"Lizard Man\\" T-shirts, and the local chamber of commerce encouraged the media attention as \\"good for the community\\".Horswell, Cindy (1989-07-1989) \\"'Lizard Man' legend, kicking\\", Houston ChronicleMilligan, Stephen (1988-08-07) \\"Sightings of a monster lizard from the swamp has struck terror into a small community in South Carolina\\", The Sunday Times.Horswell, Cindy (1989-07-30) \\"Lizard man leaves mark/Tale still told in sleepy S.C. town\\", Houston Chronicle The increase in newspaper and media publicity prompted further reports of sightings, and the area soon became a tourist attraction for visitors and hunters. Local radio station WCOS offered a $1 million reward to anybody who could capture the creature alive. On August 5, Kenneth Orr, an airman stationed at Shaw Air Force Base, filed a police report alleging that he had encountered the Lizard Man on highway 15, and he had shot and wounded it. He presented several scales and a small quantity of blood as evidence. Orr recanted this account two days later when he was arraigned for unlawfully carrying a pistol and the misdemeanor offense of filing a false police report. According to Orr, he had hoaxed the sighting in order to keep stories about the Lizard Man in circulation.The Washington Post (1988-08-14) \\"'Lizard Man' Claims a Casualty\\", The Washington Post Reports of the creature gradually declined at the end of the summer. Local law enforcement officials speculated that the sightings were likely to have been caused by a bear.Houston Chronicle (1988-08-13) \\"To keep a monstrous legend alive/Man admits lying about Lizard Man\\", Houston Chronicle In 2008, CNN mentioned the Lizard Man legend in a story about a couple in Bishopville, South Carolina who reported damage to their vehicle, including blood traces. The blood traces were subsequently found to be from a domestic dog, though the local sheriff suggested it might have been a coyote or wolf. In 2015, local television station WCIV featured photos and videos claimed to be Lizard Man, allegedly taken by unidentified individuals. In August 2017, the South Carolina Emergency Management Division sent a humorous tweet ‚Äúregarding possible paranormal activity‚Äù during the solar eclipse that passed over the area hinting that people of Lee and Sumter counties should ‚Äúremain vigilant‚Äù for sightings of the Lizard Man. Criticism Skeptical investigator Ben Radford states that the details of Chris Davis's story do not hold up under scrutiny. Sheriff Truesdale stated that Davis's story never wavered, but Radford writes that isn't true. Over weeks and months and repeated tellings, the details changed many times, from having scales to the \\"creature being packed with mud\\", how far away Davis was from the creature when he first saw it, and whether or not it attacked the car. Radford questioned how Davis was able to see details of the Lizard Man creature at 2AM when there was no lighting nearby in a heavily wooded area when the moon was not bright. If this was an aggressive creature, why were there no other credible sightings? According to Radford, the timing of Davis' story didn't make sense. If Davis saw the creature in the shadows while he was closing the trunk of his car, Davis still had to get back in the car and take off, yet Davis claims that the creature was so fast that it caught up to the car when he was doing 40mph. Reports vary with the source that Davis told the police about the attack two or more weeks later. After investigating, Radford states that the lie detector test administered to Davis may have been a \\"publicity stunt\\" by Southern Marketing, Inc. - a company \\"arrange(ing) personal appearances for Davis\\". Another curious issue was that there are no photographs of the damage to Davis's car which provide some evidence that something happened. Newspaper accounts give various descriptions of the damage to the car, and in one local newspaper Davis is quoted as saying '\\"he escaped with no more than a scratch on his fender'\\". Radford states that Davis's report \\"is quite literally incredible, riddled with both implausibilities and impossibilities. It may be sincere or it may be a hoax, but in either event no hard evidence of the creature has been found\\". Media In 2010, the TV program Destination Truth featured the legendary creature. Childrens books such as Manial Monsters and Bizarre Beasts include the monster in their bestiaries, and Linda Godfrey's American Monsters includes a chapter on the lizard man. The lizard man has also appeared on the SYFY show ‚ÄúFact or Faked\\" in an episode titled ‚ÄúReptile Rampage‚Äù. The original contemporaneous story ran in more than 100 newspapers across the country.https://www.newspapers.com/search/#query=%22Lizard+Man%22+%22Scape+Ore%22&offset;=127 See also * Reptilian humanoids * Loveland Frog * Thetis Lake Monster ReferencesExternal links *Bishopville Lizardman Festival *SC Office of Tourism \\"Beware the Lizard Man\\" Category:American legendary creatures Category:Lee County, South Carolina Category:South Carolina folklore ","title":"Lizard Man of Scape Ore Swamp"},{"id":"1632990","text":"Hausa may refer to: * Hausa (horse) or Dongola horse, an African breed of riding horse * Hausa Kingdoms, a historical collection of Hausa city-states * Hausa language, spoken in West Africa * Hausa music, the music of the Hausa people * Hausa people, one of the largest ethnic groups in West Africa See also * * Kannywood or Hausa movies, the Hausa-language film industry of Northern Nigeria * Xhosa (disambiguation) Category:Language and nationality disambiguation pages ","title":"Hausa"},{"id":"1633001","text":"left S√∏ren Norby, selfstyled as Severin Norbi (died 1530) was a Danish leading naval officer in the fleets of Danish kings Hans I and Christian II. He commandeered the greatest ship of the Danish fleet in naval wars against Sweden and L√ºbeck. Norby governed various land possessions in Scandinavia, ruling Gotland from 1517 to 1525. His rebellion against Frederick I of Denmark in 1525 was defeated, and he fled Denmark, ending his life in the employ of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor. Norby had two children with unknown women; a son named Olov and a daughter, of whom little is known. Biography Norby was of poor Funen nobility, probably born between the late 1460s and the early 1480s. The first mention of Norby is as a sailor for Swedish regent Svante Nilsson Sture during peace time in 1504. In 1507, he was a captain for Hans I of Denmark and pillaged √Öland. Norby commandeered the largest ship of Hans' fleet during the war against Sweden and L√ºbeck from 1507 to 1512, and served alongside Jens Holgersen Ulfstand. In 1510, Norby received a letter of marque from Hans, allowing him to commit piracy on all enemy vessels.S√∏ren N√∏rby, , Marinehistorisk Tidsskrift, vol. 3 / 2009. For his success in the war, Norby was rewarded with B√∂rringe Priory in Scania and also owned Haraldsborg near Roskilde.Bricka, Carl Frederik, Dansk Biografisk Lexikon, vol. XII [M√ºnch - Peirup], 1898. A. Heise, \\"S√∏ren (Severin) Norby\\", pp.310-318 Under new King Christian II of Denmark, Norby was sent as leader of a fleet to aid Charles II of Burgundy against Geldern in 1514. He was granted seignory of Iceland from 1515 to 1517, and in 1517 he was granted Visborg on Gotland, which was made a life-time grant in exchange for B√∂rringe Priory and Haraldsborg in 1518. During Christian II's war to win the throne of Sweden against L√ºbeck and Sweden from 1517 to 1520, Norby was the leader of the Danish fleet, and attacked both military and merchant vessels from his strategic position at Visborg. Norby was officially allowed to continue with piracy in 1518. He captured, and was subsequently granted, Borgholm on √ñland in 1519,S√∏ren Norby at Gyldendals √Öbne Encyklop√¶di and his blockade of Stockholm helped Christian II secure the Swedish throne in 1520. Norby helped make arrests during the Stockholm Bloodbath, but is said to have rescued many Swedes by sailing them out of Stockholm. He was then granted Kalmar Castle. Norby was tasked with finding a sea route to the West Indies via Greenland, but had to abandon his plans due to the rise of Gustav Vasa who was crowned King of Sweden in 1521. In the following years, Norby lost his possession of √ñland, but conquered Finland and Norrbotten. When Christian II abdicated under great pressure in April 1523, Norby was the only seignory who stayed loyal to him. Norby lost Kalmar and Finland that year, and fortified himself at Visborg. He was isolated and began minting his own coins in order to pay his men, bearing the name insignia Severin Norbi. He negotiated with both the new Danish king Frederick I, Sweden, and L√ºbeck to keep his possession of Visborg. After diplomatic machinations, Norby eventually stayed at Visborg, and he launched a rebellion in Blekinge in April 1525, in the name of Christian II. Frederick I's general Johan Rantzau defeated Norby, and he reached a settlement with Denmark, in which Norby exchanged Visborg for land in Blekinge. During the surrender of Visborg, Norby was double crossed by Frederick I's advisor Otte Krumpen and left for capture by L√ºbeck. However, he was promptly released as his men rejected leaving Visborg without him, and they then resettled in Blekinge as agreed. While in Blekinge, Norby continued his piracy against L√ºbeck and Sweden, and carried on supporting Christian II against Frederick I. His three enemies finally united to attack him in August 1526. Norby escaped to Livonia, and travelled to Vasili III of Russia in Moscow. With the help of King Ferdinand I of Bohemia, Norby travelled to Mechelen where he was reunited with Christian II around November 1528. As Christian II's position was too weak to attempt a reconquest of Denmark, Norby travelled to join Charles II of Burgundy, now known as Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, in 1529. He wrote to Christian II of his partaking in the Siege of Florence in February 1530, where he died shortly thereafter.

This practice was begun sometime after the Nuremberg Laws of 1935, and allowed exemption from most of Germany's racial laws. Mischling is a term used during the Third Reich era in Germany to denote persons deemed to have partial Jewish ancestry. This word literally means \\"mixed\\". In order to join the Nazi party and get a certificate, the candidate had to prove through baptismal records that all direct ancestors born since 1750 were not Jewish, or they could apply for a German Blood Certificate. These certificates were 300 mm (11¬æ in) by 210 mm (8¬º in), with a signature on the front and the red seal of the Office of Racial Research of the Nazi Party. The back listed the ancestry of the individual concerned, back to the grandparents of the father and the mother. Purpose of the German Blood Certificate The Nuremberg Laws, also known as the Anti-Jewish laws, were statutes created in Germany for the purpose of maintaining blood purity of the Aryan race. The laws indicating the necessity of obtaining a German Blood Certificate were implemented at the time relationships between Aryan and Jews were outlawed. German Blood Certificates were documentations that classified who was of \\"German or related blood\\". Aryans could face a prison sentence if they were to go against the established laws. Aryan and Jewish families already married with children were labeled as Mischling, and thus were encouraged to divorce. Such relationships were deemed as \\"blood treason\\". The Nuremberg Laws did not define people as Jewish by cultural values, but rather looked at how many generations of Jewish grandparents were before them. Specifically, those who had three or four generations of Jewish grandparents were considered Jews, despite any conversions to Christianity. Jews were seen as an inferior race by the Nazis, thus they saw the need to segregate the Jews from the German community. As a result of the Nuremberg Laws, Jewish people were denied German citizenship even though Germany was their homeland. The establishment of the Nuremberg Laws paved the path towards the Holocaust. The Law of Protecting German Blood and Honour Hitler outlined laws meant to regulate marriage conflicts between Aryans and non-Aryans. The law consisted of various paragraphs, four of which focused on Jews. The law prohibited relationships between those of German blood or related with Jews; it stated that violations could result in imprisonment. The law also made it clear that it was unlawful for Jews to employ German females or their family members under the age of 45. It was also deemed unacceptable for Jews to be associated with the Reich flag. People of Jewish descent and Germans who had Jewish spouses were persecuted by the Nazi regime. Everyone in Germany was required to carry around an identification card; however, Jewish people had specific identification marks stamped on their cards for police to easily determine and recognize who was Jewish. Those considered Mischlinge appeared to accept the Nuremberg Laws, although some people were oppressed. The Nazis put these laws to use in attempts to expel Jews and Mischlinge from the Aryan society. Use of Nazi propaganda The use of Nazi propaganda played a crucial role in spreading the message of the importance of blood purity. Hitler established a Reich Ministry in 1933 to ensure that the Nazi message was communicated freely by all means; it was headed by Joseph Goebbels. The media was pervasive in their methods of portraying Jews as sexual offenders in films, while stressing the consequences that would occur if any laws were broken. Nazi propaganda also led to campaigns protesting against Jews. Education Aside from the use of Nazi propaganda, education played a key role in spreading the message about blood purity. Teachers were given specific instructions on what they were to teach their students. Children were taught and warned about the consequences they would face if they were to engage in personal relationships with a non-Aryan.

(1991). A short introduction to the ecology, taxonomy and nomenclature of the genus Agaricus, 21‚Äì24. In L.J.L.D. Van Griensven (ed.), Genetics and breeding of Agaricus. Pudoc, Wageningen, The Netherlands.Capelli A. (1984). Agaricus. L.: Fr. (Psalliota Fr.). Liberia editrice Bella Giovanna, Saronno, Italy The genus includes the common (\\"button\\") mushroom (Agaricus bisporus) and the field mushroom (A. campestris), the dominant cultivated mushrooms of the West. Members of Agaricus are characterized by having a fleshy cap or pileus, from the underside of which grow a number of radiating plates or gills on which are produced the naked spores. They are distinguished from other members of their family, Agaricaceae, by their chocolate-brown spores. Members of Agaricus also have a stem or stipe, which elevates it above the object on which the mushroom grows, or substrate, and a partial veil, which protects the developing gills and later forms a ring or annulus on the stalk. Taxonomy 1855 field notes with synonymy of Hypophyllum (quoted literature) with Omphalia and Agaricus (added handwritten notes). For many years, members of the genus Agaricus were given the generic name Psalliota, and this can still be seen in older books on mushrooms. All proposals to conserve Agaricus against Psalliota or vice versa have so far been considered superfluous. Several origins of Agaricus have been proposed. It possibly originates from ancient Sarmatia Europaea, where people Agari, promontory Agarum and a river Agarus were known (all located on the northern shore of Sea of Azov, probably, near modern Berdiansk in Ukraine). Note also Greek , \\"a sort of tree fungus\\" (There has been an Agaricon Adans. genus, treated by Donk in Persoonia 1:180.) Dok reports Linnaeus' name is devalidated (so the proper author citation apparently is \\"L. per Fr., 1821\\") because Agaricus was not linked to Tournefort's name. Linnaeus places both Agaricus Dill. and Amanita Dill. in synonymy, but truly a replacement for Amanita Dill., which would require A. quercinus, not A. campestris be the type. This question is compounded because Fries himself used Agaricus roughly in Linnaeus' sense (which leads to issues with Amanita), and A. campestris was eventually excluded from Agaricus by Karsten and was apparently in Lepiota at the time Donk wrote this, commenting that a type conservation might become necessary. The alternate name for the genus, Psalliota, derived from the Greek psalion/œàŒ¨ŒªŒπŒøŒΩ, \\"ring\\", was first published by Fries (1821) as trib. Psalliota. The type is Agaricus campestris (widely accepted, except by Earle, who proposed A. cretaceus). Paul Kummer (not Qu√©let, who merely excluded Stropharia) was the first to elevate the tribe to a genus. Psalliota was the tribe containing the type of Agaricus, so when separated, it should have caused the rest of the genus to be renamed, but this is not what happened.Donk, M.A. (1962). \\"The generic names proposed for Agaricaceae\\". Beiheifte zur Nova Hedwigia 5: 1‚Äì320. ISSN 0078-2238 Phylogenetics The use of phylogenetic analysis to determine evolutionary relationships amongst Agaricus species has increased the understanding of this taxonomically difficult genus, although much work remains to be done to fully delineate infrageneric relationships. Prior to these analyses, the genus Agaricus, as circumscribed by Rolf Singer, was divided into 42 species grouped into five sections based on reactions of mushroom tissue to air or various chemical reagents, as well as subtle differences in mushroom morphology. Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis demonstrated this classification scheme needed revision. =Sections= This genus is divided into several sections: * Section Agaricus * Section Arvense Konrad & Maubl. :Contains 19 species in six subgroups similar to the horse mushroom, A. arvensis, it has versatile heterothallic life cycles. * Section Xanthodermatei :Outlined by Singer in 1948, this section includes species with various characteristics similar to the type species A. xanthodermus. The section forms a single clade based on analysis of ITS1+2. * Section Chitonioides * Section Sanguinolenti * Section Spissicaules (Hainem.) Kerrigan * Section Duploannulatae :Based on DNA analysis of ITS1, ITS2, and 5.8S sequences, this section (also known as section Hortenses) may be divided into six distinct clades, five of which correspond to well-known species from the temperate Northern Hemisphere: A. bisporus, A. subfloccosus, A. bitorquis, A. vaporarius and A. cupressicola. The sixth clade comprises the species complex A. devoniensis. List of species The fungal genus Agaricus contains about 200 species worldwide.

It forms the first serial in the Dalek Empire arc, which continues in The Apocalypse Element and The Mutant Phase. It concludes in The Time of the Daleks. Synopsis On the planet Kar-Charrat, the Seventh Doctor and Ace try to prevent the Daleks acquiring a technology called the Wetworks Facility. This episode addresses issues of scientific ethics. Plot Bev Tarrant and her salvage team arrive on the apparently uninhabited planet Kar-Charrat, in order to take possession of the mysterious and valuable Ziggurat. They soon discover though that there are Daleks on the planet, and maybe other creatures too. In the TARDIS, Ace finds some overdue library books which the Doctor explains are from the library on Kar-Charrat. They travel to the planet in order to return the books. The Doctor enters the library where he meets an old friend, the chief librarian Elgin. Ace dislikes Elgin because he is not keen for people to actually touch any of the library's vast collection of books. She gets fed up and leaves to go back to the TARDIS. Elgin gives her a DNA tag which would allow her to re-enter the library. Elgin shows the Doctor the amazing technological development housed at the library ‚Äî the wetworks facility. The Doctor is not particularly impressed until Elgin reveals to him that it contains all the knowledge in the Universe. The Doctor comments that not even the Time Lords had made such a break through using that technology, which is why the Matrix was built. Elgin mentions that aggressive aliens had been making threats against the library, and the Doctor eventually gets out of him that it is the Daleks. Ace makes her way back to the TARDIS, but on the way hears a scream, and going to investigate finds Bev Tarrant. When Ace describes the library to her, she is incredulous because to her the planet seems uninhabited. She does however agree to go back with Ace, but they are caught by a Special Weapons Dalek. \\\\---- The Daleks had used time corridor technology to deploy Daleks on every planet in the sector, and then waited hundreds of years to capture a time-sensitive Time Lord in order to penetrate the library's defences and allow them to seize the wetworks facility. Instead, the Daleks create a duplicate of Ace, which ‚Äî replete with the DNA tag ‚Äî will be able to get through the library's barriers. The Doctor sets out to find Ace and eventually finds her and Bev. After they have been brought back to the library, the Doctor leaves again to investigate the Ziggurat. However he does not realise the Ace left behind is in fact the duplicate. He discovers that the Ziggurat is in fact a Dalek hibernation unit, triggered to awaken the Daleks when the sound of the TARDIS was heard. He then sees the duplication machine and realises the truth about Ace. He and Elgin rush back to the library, but before they arrive, a Dalek battle cruiser lands at the library where the duplicate Ace has lowered the temporal shield. \\\\---- The Doctor heads back to the TARDIS with Elgin, the only course of action left open to him is to send an emergency message to the Time Lords. However, they arrive at the TARDIS to find it surrounded by Daleks, including the Dalek Supreme, and are forced to surrender. The Doctor is vital to the Daleks' plan as they could not download the knowledge of the Wetworks into a Dalek mind without a Time Lord's neural buffers. They take him to the facility, and connecting him to the machinery, they successfully download the entire knowledge of the Universe into a Dalek test subject. After the download is complete, Elgin thinks that the Doctor has been killed by the pain of the procedure. Meanwhile, Ace and Bev realise that mysterious noises they had overheard in the rainfall were in fact some kind of life form. Bev had seen her colleague Rappell, who had been exterminated, in what she thought was a dream. His body had been possessed by the creatures. Whilst the Daleks' download of the Wetworks is occurring, Rappell arrives and proceeds to rescue them, but they soon come face to face with the Dalek test-subject, ready to exterminate them‚Ä¶ \\\\---- The test-subject is out of control and disoriented after the download and misses completely when it tries to exterminate Ace, Ben and Rappell. It shoots a hole in the wall of the library, through which Ace and Bev make their escape, but Rappell stays behind to cover them and is exterminated. However, when the Dalek pursues the women, a heavy fall of rain falls on the Dalek. The rain contains the native creatures of Kar-Charrat, and they are able to penetrate the casing and kill the Dalek. The Doctor finds his consciousness still alive inside the Wetworks where he discovers to his outrage that the wetworks technology is based on the enslavement of the Kar-Charratians. The creatures are able to download the Doctor's mind back into his body, and he swears to free them. Soon reunited with Ace, Elgin and Bev, he plans to free the Kar-Charratians from the Wetworks by allowing Ace to use Nitro-9 on the library building. Elgin expresses remorse to the Doctor about the enslavement of the Kar- Charratians not realising that they were sentient, but the Doctor is not moved as the librarian and his people had not even tried to communicate with the natives. Trying to allow the Doctor to re-enter the surrounded TARDIS, the Kar-Charratians kill the Daleks surrounding the time machine, but the duplicate Ace arrives. The duplicate is impervious to the rain unlike the Daleks, and threatens to kill Elgin. However, the chief cataloguer Prink rushes to his aid and attacks the duplicate, damaging it. Although Prink was killed by the duplicate, the damage allowed the Kar-Charratians to penetrate the duplicate's insides, and they succeed in destroying it. The Doctor proceeds to the Wetworks with the intention of destroying it, using Ace to pretend to be her own duplicate to get past the Daleks. At the facility they encounter the Dalek test-subject and the Dalek Supreme arguing. Having obtained something of a conscience, the test-subject was refusing to destroy the Wetworks facility against the Supreme's orders. When Ace places Nitro-9 on the Wetworks facility, the test-subject fires at the Supreme to prevent it exterminating her. The Dalek Supreme retreats to its mother-ship leaving the Special Weapons Dalek to kill the test-subject, but the Nitro-9 succeeds in blowing up the machinery of the Wetworks, and the Kar-Charratians manage to escape. The remaining Daleks on the planet are drowned by the newly free natives. The TARDIS returns to the ruins of the library, and Ace and the Doctor ponder on whether the test-subject Dalek with the complete knowledge of the universe and a moral consciousness could have heralded a new era for the Doctor. Elgin rues the destruction of his life's work, but out of guilt for his treatment of the Kar-Charratians realises it was a crime. Reporting its failure to the Dalek Emperor on Skaro, the Dalek Supreme is ordered to self- destruct. The Emperor is not totally despondent, however, as it has more plans to extend the Dalek Empire‚Ä¶ Cast *The Doctor ‚Äî Sylvester McCoy *Ace ‚Äî Sophie Aldred *Rappell ‚Äî Daniel Gabriele *Bev Tarrant ‚Äî Louise Faulkner *Chief Librarian Elgin ‚Äî Bruce Montague *Cataloguer Prink ‚Äî Nicholas Briggs *Dalek Voices ‚Äî Alistair Lock and Nicholas Briggs *Phantom Voices ‚Äî Daniel Gabriele Trivia *The character of Bev Tarrant makes a further appearance in Dust Breeding as well as in the Bernice Summerfield audio drama, The Bellotron Incident. *This story forms the first serial in the Dalek Empire arc, a storyline that begins here with the Seventh Doctor, continues with the Sixth Doctor (The Apocalypse Element) and Fifth (The Mutant Phase) and concludes with the Eighth (The Time of the Daleks) Elements from these stories tie in the Dalek Empire series. *This story marked the first time the Daleks were used outside of books and comics since their final appearance in Remembrance of the Daleks in 1988. *The working title of this story was Wetworks and it is also named as such in trailers at the end of some of the preceding audio dramas in the Big Finish series. *The idea of a library with all knowledge contained within would be used again in the 2008 TV episodes \\"Silence in the Library\\" and \\"Forest of the Dead\\" starring the Tenth Doctor and Donna.

In mathematics, a toroidal graph is a graph that can be embedded on a torus. In other words, the graph's vertices can be placed on a torus such that no edges cross. Examples Any graph which can be embedded in a plane can also be embedded in a torus. A toroidal graph of genus 1 can be embedded in a torus but not in a plane. The Heawood graph, the complete graph K7 (and hence K5 and K6), the Petersen graph (and hence the complete bipartite graph K3,3, since the Petersen graph contains a subdivision of it), one of the Blanu≈°a snarks, and all M√∂bius ladders are toroidal. More generally, any graph with crossing number 1 is toroidal. Some graphs with greater crossing numbers are also toroidal: the M√∂bius‚ÄìKantor graph, for example, has crossing number 4 and is toroidal. Properties Any toroidal graph has chromatic number at most 7. The complete graph K7 provides an example of toroidal graph with chromatic number 7. Any triangle-free toroidal graph has chromatic number at most 4. By a result analogous to F√°ry's theorem, any toroidal graph may be drawn with straight edges in a rectangle with periodic boundary conditions. Furthermore, the analogue of Tutte's spring theorem applies in this case. Toroidal graphs also have book embeddings with at most 7 pages. Obstructions By the Robertson‚ÄìSeymour theorem, there exists a finite set H of minimal non-toroidal graphs, such that a graph is toroidal if and only if it has no graph minor in H. That is, H forms the set of forbidden minors for the toroidal graphs. The complete set H is not known, but it has at least 17,523 graphs. Alternatively, there are at least 250,815 non-toroidal graphs that are minimal in the topological minor ordering. A graph is toroidal if and only if it has none of these graphs as a topological minor. Gallery File:Cayley graphs of the quaternion group.pngTwo isomorphic Cayley graphs of the quaternion group.

Instances where an employee exchanges (cash) wages for some other form of benefit is generally referred to as a \\"salary packaging\\" or \\"salary exchange\\" arrangement. In most countries, most kinds of employee benefits are taxable to at least some degree. Examples of these benefits include: housing (employer-provided or employer-paid) furnished or not, with or without free utilities; group insurance (health, dental, life etc.); disability income protection; retirement benefits; daycare; tuition reimbursement; sick leave; vacation (paid and unpaid); social security; profit sharing; employer student loan contributions; conveyancing; long service leave; domestic help (servants); and other specialized benefits. The purpose of employee benefits is to increase the economic security of staff members, and in doing so, improve worker retention across the organization.Abenity: What Does It Cost To Replace An Employee? As such, it is one component of reward management. Colloquially, \\"perks\\" are those benefits of a more discretionary nature. Often, perks are given to employees who are doing notably well or have seniority. Common perks are take-home vehicles, hotel stays, free refreshments, leisure activities on work time (golf, etc.), stationery, allowances for lunch, and--when multiple choices exist--first choice of such things as job assignments and vacation scheduling. They may also be given first chance at job promotions when vacancies exist. Managerial perspective The Bureau of Labor Statistics,Bureau of Labor Statistics (2008). Online Glossary. Available at: http://www.bls.gov/bls/glossary.htm#B like the International Accounting Standards Board,International Accounting Standard 19: Employee Benefits, retrieved from: http://eifrs.ifrs.org/eifrs/bnstandards/en/2015/ias19.pdf defines employee benefits as forms of indirect expenses. Managers tend to view compensation and benefits in terms of their ability to attract and retain employees, as well as in terms of their ability to motivate them. Employees ‚Äì along with potential employees ‚Äì tend to view benefits that are mandated by regulation differently from benefits that are discretionary, that is, those that are not mandated but are simply designed to make a compensation package more attractive. Benefits that are mandated are thought of as creating employee rights or entitlements, while discretionary benefits are intended to inspire employee loyalty and increase job satisfaction. Canada Employee benefits in Canada usually refer to employer sponsored life, disability, health, and dental plans. Such group insurance plans are a top-up to existing provincial coverage. An employer provided group insurance plan is coordinated with the provincial plan in the respective province or territory, therefore an employee covered by such a plan must be covered by the provincial plan first. The life, accidental death and dismemberment and disability insurance component is an employee benefit only. Some plans provide a minimal dependent life insurance benefit as well. The healthcare plan may include any of the following: hospital room upgrades (Semi-Private or Private), medical services/supplies and equipment, travel medical (60 or 90 days per trip), registered therapists and practitioners (i.e. physiotherapists, acupuncturists, chiropractors, etc.), prescription requiring drugs, vision (eye exams, contacts/lenses), and Employee Assistance Programs. The dental plan usually includes Basic Dental (cleanings, fillings, root canals), Major Dental (crowns, bridges, dentures) or Orthodontics (braces). Other than the employer sponsored health benefits described above, the next most common employee benefits are group savings plans (Group RRSPs and Group Profit Sharing Plans), which have tax and growth advantages to individual saving plans. United States Employee benefits in the United States include relocation assistance; medical, prescription, vision and dental plans; health and dependent care flexible spending accounts; retirement benefit plans (pension, 401(k), 403(b)); group term life and long- term care insurance plans; legal assistance plans; medical second opinion programs, adoption assistance; child care benefits and transportation benefits; paid time off (PTO) in the form of vacation and sick pay. Benefits may also include formal or informal employee discount programs that grant workers access to specialized offerings from local and regional vendors (like movies and theme park tickets, wellness programs, discounted shopping, hotels and resorts, and so on).\\"Taxable Fringe Benefit Guide\\". Internal Revenue Service. 2012.\\"What Is An Employee Discount Program?\\". Abenity. Employers that offer these types of work-life perks seek to raise employee satisfaction, corporate loyalty, and worker retention by providing valuable benefits that go beyond a base salary figure. Fringe benefits are also thought of as the costs of retaining employees other than base salary. The term \\"fringe benefits\\" was coined by the War Labor Board during World War II to describe the various indirect benefits which industry had devised to attract and retain labor when direct wage increases were prohibited. Some fringe benefits (for example, accident and health plans, and group-term life insurance coverage up to $50,000) may be excluded from the employee's gross income and, therefore, are not subject to federal income tax in the United States. Some function as tax shelters (for example, flexible spending, 401(k), or 403(b) accounts). These benefit rates often change from year to year and are typically calculated using fixed percentages that vary depending on the employee‚Äôs classification. Normally, employer-provided benefits are tax-deductible to the employer and non-taxable to the employee. The exception to the general rule includes certain executive benefits (e.g. golden handshake and golden parachute plans) or those that exceed federal or state tax-exemption standards. American corporations may also offer cafeteria plans to their employees. These plans offer a menu and level of benefits for employees to choose from. In most instances, these plans are funded by both the employees and by the employer(s). The portion paid by employees is deducted from their gross pay before federal and state taxes are applied. Some benefits would still be subject to the Federal Insurance Contributions Act tax (FICA), such as 401(k). and 403(b) contributions; however, health premiums, some life premiums, and contributions to flexible spending accounts are exempt from FICA. If certain conditions are met, employer provided meals and lodging may be excluded from an employee's gross income. If meals are furnished (1) by the employer; (2) for the employer's convenience; and (3) provided on the business premises of the employer they may be excluded from the employee's gross income per section 119(a). In addition, lodging furnished by the employer for its convenience on the business premise of the employer (which the employee is required to accept as a condition of employment) is also excluded from gross income. Importantly, section 119(a) only applies to meals or lodging furnished \\"in kind.\\" Therefore, cash allowances for meals or lodging received by an employee are included in gross income. Qualified disaster relief payments made for an employee during a national disaster are not taxable income to the employee. The payments must be reasonable and necessary personal, family, living, or funeral expenses that have been incurred as a result of a national disaster. Eligible expenses include medical expenses, childcare and tutoring expenses due to school closings, internet, and telephone expenses. Replacement of lost income or lost wages are not eligible. Employee benefits provided through ERISA (Employee Retirement Income Security Act) are not subject to state-level insurance regulation like most insurance contracts, but employee benefit products provided through insurance contracts are regulated at the state level.. However, ERISA does not generally apply to plans by governmental entities, churches for their employees, and some other situations. Under the Obamacare or ACA's Employer Shared Responsibility provisions, certain employers, known as applicable large employers are required to offer minimum essential coverage that is affordable to their full-time employees or else make the employer shared responsibility payment to the IRS. Private firms in the US have come up with certain unusual perquisites.Times of India In the United States paid time off, in the form of vacation days or sick days, is not required by federal or state law. Despite that fact, many United States businesses offer some form of paid leave. In the United States, 86% of workers at large businesses and 69% of employees at small business receive paid vacation days. United Kingdom In the United Kingdom, employee benefits are categorised by three terms: flexible benefits (flex) and flexible benefits packages, voluntary benefits and core benefits. \\"Core benefits\\" is the term given to benefits which all staff enjoy, such as pension, life insurance, income protection, and holiday. Employees may be unable to remove these benefits, depending on individual employers' preferences. Flexible benefits, often called a \\"flex scheme\\", is where employees are allowed to choose how a proportion of their remuneration is paid or they are given a benefits budget by their employer to spend. Currently around a third of UK employers operate such a scheme. How flexible benefits schemes are structured has remained fairly consistent over the years, although the definition of flex has changed quite a lot since it first arrived in the UK in the 1980s. When flex first emerged, it was run as a formal scheme for a set contract period, through which employees could opt in and out of a selection of employer-paid benefits, select employee-paid benefits, or take the cash. In recent years increasing numbers of UK companies have used the tax and national insurance savings gained through the implementation of salary sacrifice benefits to fund the implementation of flexible benefits. In a salary sacrifice arrangement an employee gives up the right to part of the cash remuneration due under their contract of employment. Usually the sacrifice is made in return for the employer's agreement to provide them with some form of non-cash benefit. The most popular types of salary sacrifice benefits include childcare vouchers and pensions. A number of external consultancies (such as Barnett Waddingham, JLT, Thomsons and Benefex) exist that enable organisations to manage Flex packages centred around the provision of an Intranet or Extranet website where employees can view their current flexible benefit status and make changes to their package. Adoption of flexible benefits has grown considerably, with 62% of employers in a 2012 survey offering a flexible benefit package and a further 21% planning to do so in the future.Aon Hewitt Benefits Administration Survey 2012 This has coincided with increased employee access to the internet and studies suggesting that employee engagement can be boosted by their successful adoption. \\"Voluntary benefits\\" is the name given to a collection of benefits that employees choose to opt-in for and pay for personally, although as with flex plans, many employers make use of salary sacrifice schemes where the employee reduces their salary in exchange for the employer paying for the perk. These tend to include benefits such as the government-backed (and therefore tax-efficient) cycle to work, pension contributions and childcare vouchers and also specially arranged discounts on retail and leisure vouchers, gym membership and discounts at local shops and restaurants (providers include Xexec). These can be run in-house or arranged by an external employee benefits consultant. Fringe benefits tax In a number of countries (e.g., Australia, New Zealand and Pakistan), the 'fringe benefits' are subject to the Fringe Benefits Tax (FBT), which applies to most, although not all, fringe benefits. In India, the fringe benefits tax was abolished in 2009. In the United States, employer-sponsored health insurance was considered taxable income until 1954.Employer-Sponsored Health Insurance and Health Reform at National Bureau of Economic Research. Disadvantages In the UK, benefits are often taxed at the individual's normal tax rate,490 (2008) Employee Travel - A tax and NICs guide for employers which can prove expensive if there is no financial advantage to the individual from the benefit. The UK system of state pension provision is dependent upon the payment of National Insurance Contributions. Salary exchange schemes result in reduced payments and so are may reduce the state benefits, most notably the State Second Pension.

It works similarly to a scanning electron microscope: the sample is bombarded with an electron beam, emitting x-rays at wavelengths characteristic to the elements being analyzed. This enables the abundances of elements present within small sample volumes (typically 10-30 cubic micrometers or less) to be determinedWittry, David B. (1958). \\"Electron Probe Microanalyzer\\", US Patent No 2916621, Washington, DC: U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, when a conventional accelerating voltage of 15-20 kV is used. The concentrations of elements from lithium to plutonium may be measured at levels as low as 100 parts per million (ppm), material dependent, although with care, levels below 10 ppm are possible The ability to quantify lithium by EPMA became a reality in 2008..  History  The electron microprobe, also known as the electron probe microanalyzer, developed utilizing two technologies: electron microscopy ‚Äî the use of a focused high energy electron beam to interact with a target material, and X-ray spectroscopy ‚Äî identification of the photons resulting from electron beam interaction with the target, with the energy/wavelength of the photons being characteristic of the atoms excited by the incident electrons. The names of Ernst Ruska and Max Knoll are associated with the first prototype electron microscope in 1931. The name of Henry Moseley is associated with the discovery of the direct relationship between the wavelength of X-rays and the identity of the atom from which it originatedhttps://www.chemteam.info/Chem-History/Moseley-article.html. There have been at several historical threads to electron beam microanalytical technique. One was developed by James Hillier and Richard Baker at RCA. In the early 1940s, they built an electron microprobe, combining an electron microscope and an energy loss spectrometer. A patent application was filed in 1944. Electron energy loss spectroscopy is very good for light element analysis and they obtained spectra of C-KŒ±, N-KŒ± and O-KŒ± radiation. In 1947, Hiller patented the idea of using an electron beam to produce analytical X-rays, but never constructed a working model. His design proposed using Bragg diffraction from a flat crystal to select specific X-ray wavelengths and a photographic plate as a detector. However, RCA had no interest in pursuing commercialization of this invention. A second thread developed in France in the late 1940s. In 1948‚Äì1950, Raimond Castaing, supervised by Andr√© Guinier, built the first electron ‚Äúmicrosonde √©lectronique‚Äù (electron microprobe) at ONERA. This microprobe produced an electron beam diameter of 1-3 Œºm with a beam current of ~10 nanoamperes (nA) and used a Geiger counter to detect the X-rays produced from the sample. However, the Geiger counter could not distinguish X-rays produced from specific elements and in 1950, Castaing added a quartz crystal between the sample and the detector to permit wavelength discrimination. He also added an optical microscope to view the point of beam impact. The resulting microprobe was described in Castaing's 1951 PhD Thesis,, translated into English by Pol Duwez and David Wittry http://www.microbeamanalysis.org/history/Castaing-Thesis-clearscan.pdf is equivalent to https://the-mas.org/castaings-famous-1951-thesis/, in which he laid the foundations of the theory and application of quantitative analysis by electron microprobe, establishing the theoretical framework for the matrix corrections of absorption and fluorescence effects. Castaing (1921-1999) is considered the \\"father\\" of electron microprobe analysis. The 1950s was a decade of great interest in electron beam X-ray microanalysis, following Castaing's presentations at the First European Microscopy Conference in Delft in 1949http://www.geology.wisc.edu/~johnf/g777/Delft-1949_ProceedingsEMConference.pdf and then at the National Bureau of Standards conference on Electron Physicshttps://archive.org/details/circularofbureau527unse in Washington, DC, in 1951, as well as at other conferences in the early to mid-1950s. Many researchers, mainly material scientists, began to develop their own experimental electron microprobes, sometimes starting from scratch, but many times utilizing surplus electron microscopes. One of the organizers of the Delft 1949 Electron Microscopy conference was Vernon Ellis Cosslett at the Cavendish Laboratory at Cambridge University, a center of research on electron microscopyLong, J. V. P. \\"Microanalysis.\\" Micron 24, no. 2 (1993): 143-148. https://doi.org/10.1016/0968-4328(93)90065-9, as well as scanning electron microscopy with Charles Oatley as well as X-ray microscopy with Bill Nixon. Peter Duncumb combined all three technologies and developed a scanning electron X-ray microanalyzer as his PhD thesis project (published 1957), which was commercialized as the Cambridge MicroScan instrument. Pol Duwez, a Belgian material scientist who fled the Nazis and settled at the California Institute of Technology and collaborated with Jesse DuMond, encountered Andr√© Guinier on a train in Europe in 1952, where he learned of Castaing's new instrument and the suggestion that CalTech build a similar instrument. David Wittry was hired to build such an instrument as his PhD thesis, which he completed in 1957. It became the prototype for the ARLEklund, Robert L. \\"Bausch & Lomb-ARL: Where We Come From, Who We are.\\" Applied Spectroscopy 35, no. 2 (1981): 226-235. EMX electron microprobe. During the late 1950s and early 1960s there were over a dozen other laboratories in North America, the United Kingdom, Europe, Japan and the USSR developing electron beam X-ray microanalyzers. The first commercial electron microprobe, the \\"MS85\\" was produced by CAMECA (France) in 1956.. It was soon followed in the early-mid 1960s by many microprobes from other companies; however, all companies except CAMECA , JEOL and Shimadzu Corporation are now out of business. In addition, many researchers build electron microprobes in their labs. Significant subsequent improvements and modifications to microprobes included scanning the electron beam to make X-ray maps (1960), the addition of solid state EDS detectors (1968) and the development of synthetic multilayer diffracting crystals for analysis of light elements (1984). Later, CAMECA became also the pioneer on manufacturing a shielded version of the electron microprobe for nuclear applications. Several new advances in CAMECA instruments in the last decades allowed them to expand their range of applications on metallurgy, electronics, geology, mineralogy, nuclear plants, trace elements, dentistry, etc. Working A beam of electrons is fired at a sample. The beam causes each element in the sample to emit X-rays at a characteristic frequency; the X-rays can then be detected by the electron microprobe. The size and current density of the electron beam determines the trade-off between resolution and scan time and/or analysis time. =Detailed description= Low-energy electrons are produced from a tungsten filament, a lanthanum hexaboride crystal cathode or a field emission electron source and accelerated by a positively biased anode plate to 3 to 30 thousand electron volts (keV). The anode plate has central aperture and electrons that pass through it are collimated and focused by a series of magnetic lenses and apertures. The resulting electron beam (approximately 5 nm to 10 Œºm diameter) may be rastered across the sample or used in spot mode to produce excitation of various effects in the sample. Among these effects are: phonon excitation (heat), cathodoluminescence (visible light fluorescence), continuum X-ray radiation (bremsstrahlung), characteristic X-ray radiation, secondary electrons (plasmon production), backscattered electron production, and Auger electron production. When the beam electrons (and scattered electrons from the sample) interact with bound electrons in the innermost electron shells of the atoms of the various elements in the sample, they can scatter the bound electrons from the electron shell producing a vacancy in that shell (ionization of the atom). This vacancy is unstable and must be filled by an electron from either a higher energy bound shell in the atom (producing another vacancy which is in turn filled by electrons from yet higher energy bound shells) or by unbound electrons of low energy. The difference in binding energy between the electron shell in which the vacancy was produced and the shell from which the electron comes to fill the vacancy is emitted as a photon. The energy of the photon is in the X-ray region of the electromagnetic spectrum. As the electron structure of each element is unique, the series X-ray line energies produced by vacancies in the innermost shells is characteristic of that element, although lines from different elements may overlap. As the innermost shells are involved, the X-ray line energies are generally not affected by chemical effects produced by bonding between elements in compounds except in low atomic number (Z) elements ( B, C, N, O and F for Kalpha and Al to Cl for Kbeta) where line energies may be shifted as a result of the involvement of the electron shell from which vacancies are filled in chemical bonding. The characteristic X-rays are used for chemical analysis. Specific X-ray wavelengths or energies are selected and counted, either by wavelength dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (WDS) or energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). WDS utilizes Bragg diffraction from crystals to select X-ray wavelengths of interest and direct them to gas-flow or sealed proportional detectors. In contrast, EDS uses a solid state semiconductor detector to accumulate X-rays of all wavelengths produced from the sample. While EDS yields more information and typically requires a much shorter counting time, WDS is generally a more precise technique with lower limits of detection because its superior X-ray peak resolution and greater peak to background ratio. Chemical composition is determined by comparing the intensities of characteristic X-rays from the sample material with intensities from known composition (standards). Counts from the sample must be corrected for matrix effects (depth of production of the X-rays,Duncumb P. and Reed S.J.B., NBS Spec. Publ. 298, Heinrich K.F.J. ed., 1968, p. 133 Bishop H.E., 4th Int.

Newbury eds., Electron probe quantitation, Plenum Press, 1991) to yield quantitative chemical compositions. The resulting chemical information is gathered in textural context. Variations in chemical composition within a material (zoning), such as a mineral grain or metal, can be readily determined. Volume from which chemical information is gathered (volume of X-rays generation) is 0.3 ‚Äì 3 cubic micrometers. = Limitations = * WDS is useful for higher atomic numbers, therefore WDS cannot determine elements below number 3 (lithium). This limitation sets restrictions to WDS when analyzing geologically important elements such as H, Li, and Be. * Despite the improved spectral resolution of elemental peaks, some peaks exhibit significant overlaps that result in analytical challenges (e.g., VKŒ± and TiKŒ≤). WDS analyses are not able to distinguish among the valence states of elements (e.g. Fe2+ vs. Fe3+) such that this information must be obtained by other techniques (e.g. M√∂ssbauer spectroscopy or Electron energy loss spectroscopy). * The multiple masses of an element (i.e. isotopes) cannot be determined by WDS, but rather are most commonly obtained with a mass spectrometer.

It is particularly useful for assessing the composition of individual particles or grains and chemical changes on the scale of a few micrometres to millimeters. The electron microprobe is widely used for research, quality control, and failure analysis. =Mineralogy and petrology = This technique is most commonly used by mineralogists and petrologists. Most rocks are aggregates of small mineral grains. These grains may preserve chemical information adopted during their formation and subsequent alteration. This information may illuminate geologic processes, such as crystallization, lithification, volcanism, metamorphism, orogenic events (mountain building), plate tectonics. This technique is also used for the study of extraterrestrial rocks (i.e. meteorites), and provides chemical data which is vital to understanding the evolution of the planets, asteroids, and comets. The change in elemental composition from the center (also known as core) to the edge (or rim) of a mineral can yield information about the history of the crystal's formation, including the temperature, pressure, and chemistry of the surrounding medium. Quartz crystals, for example, incorporate a small, but measurable amount of titanium into their structure as a function of temperature, pressure, and the amount of titanium available in their environment. Changes in these parameters are recorded by titanium as the crystal grows. =Palaeontology= In exceptionally preserved fossils, such as those of the Burgess shale, soft parts of organisms may be preserved. Since these fossils are often compressed into a 2D film, it can be difficult to deduce what features were what: a famous example is that of triangular extensions in Opabinia, which were interpreted as either legs or extensions of the gut. Elemental mapping showed that they had a similar composition to the gut, favouring the second interpretation. Because of the thin nature of the carbon films, only low voltages (5-15 kV) can be used in such specimens. :For more information about element abundance in the Burgess shale, see Burgess shale type preservation#elemental mapping =Meteorite analysis= The chemical composition of meteorites can be analysed quite accurately using EPMA technique. This can reveal a lot of information about the conditions that existed in our Solar System many years ago. = Online Tutorials = *Jim Wittke's class notes at Northern Arizona State Universityhttps://www.cefns.nau.edu/geology/malabs/Microprobe/Probe.html *John Fournelle's class notes at University of Wisconsin- Madisonhttp://www.geology.wisc.edu/~johnf/g777/777Lectures2019.html *John Donovan's class notes at University of Oregon https://pages.uoregon.edu/epmalab/lecture.htm See also *Electron microscope *Electron spectroscopy ReferencesExternal links * *Electron Probe Laboratory, Hebrew University of Jerusalem - web page of a lab describing their modern EPMA Category:X-rays Category:Microscopes Category:Analytical chemistry Category:Scientific techniques ko:Ï†ÑÏûê ÌòÑÎØ∏Í≤Ω ","title":"Electron microprobe"},{"id":"1633081","text":"Karl Theodor Paschke is a former Under Secretary General for the United Nations.

At , it has been the tallest structure in Egypt and North Africa for about 50 years. It was the tallest structure in Africa for ten years until 1971, when it was surpassed by Hillbrow Tower in South Africa. One of Cairo's well-known modern monuments, sometimes considered Egypt's second most famous landmark after the Pyramids of Giza, it stands in the Gezira district on Gezira Island in the River Nile, close to downtown Cairo. History Built from 1954 to 1961, the tower was designed by the Egyptian architect Naoum Shebib, inspired by the Ancient Egyptian Architecture. Its partially open lattice-work design is intended to evoke a pharaonic lotus plant, an iconic symbol of Ancient Egypt. The tower is crowned by a circular observation deck and a revolving restaurant that rotate around its axis occasionally with a view over greater Cairo. According to documents published by Major General Adel Shaheen, the funds for the construction of the tower were originated from the Government of the United States through the CIA that represented by Kermit Roosevelt, which had provided around $US1-3 million to Gamal Abdel Nasser as a personal gift to him with the intent of stopping his support for Algerian Revolution and other African independence movements. Affronted by the attempt to bribe him, Nasser decided to publicly rebuke the U.S. government by transferring all of the funds to the Egyptian government for the use of the tower construction, which he stated that it would be \\"visible from the US Embassy just across the Nile, as a taunting symbol of Egypt's, Africa and the Middle East's resistance, revolutions and pride\\". The book also stated that the General Intelligence Service took full responsibility for everything related to the design and planning work, including the selection of the architect who was assigned to design, the construction work, and even providing the necessary materials for the building with the aim of giving the heroic character of the president. However, its design was controversial that the Egyptians called it as the \\"waqf Roosevelt\\" (\\"Roosevelt's endowment\\"), which then mistakenly interpreted by the Embassy of Egypt in Washington, D.C. as the \\"waqef Roosevlet\\" (\\"Roosevelt's erection\\"). Thus, prompted the Americans to react by calling it as the \\"Nasser's prick\\". Because of that, a local Islamic group issued a fatwa to demolish the tower in the 1990s, stating that it \\"could excite Egyptian women\\", but this was failed to be implemented due to its influence on national history and popularity among the nation and tourists. Between 2006 and 2009, the tower underwent an EGP 15 million restoration project that included a new installation of light decoration. It was stated that the project used the LED lamp for its efficiency on energy consumption.

This book depicts life in, and around Sydney streets, pubs, bars, galleries, and beaches.http://www.photoaccess.com.au/?q=taxonomy/term/8 Biography Plicka was born in 1926 in a mining town of Kladno, former Czechoslovakia. His father was a miner, often unemployed and as many others at that time, could not give the family a decent living.http://blankproject- carajayne.blogspot.com/2009/08/frank-plicka-streets-of-sydney-huw.html Starting a primary school meant a new happy life for Plicka. He finished school with best possible results, skipped high school and was enrolled in an elite school \\"Real Gymnasium\\" in 1937. After World War II, during which Czech universities were closed, he continued his studies at Charles University of Prague and graduated as a pedagog. Then until 1968, he was involved in sports professionally, coaching top Czech swimmers. In 1967, he was awarded a title Coach of the Year. In 1968, after Soviet invasion to Czechoslovakia, he fled to Australia. He settled in Sydney, taking different jobs at different places, and started concentrating on street photography. Besides Australia, he photographed one year in Africa (1970s) and three years in Asia (1980s). During last 35 years, he finished three books. At present time, only Streets of Sydney has been published. During recent years, Plicka held several exhibitions in Sydney, but prefers private life and does not seek a wider recognition. Work Cover of Plicka's first and only published book, Streets of Sydney From early age, Plicka was involved in sports and his desire to catch all moments led him to sports photography. As a sports photographer, he photographed in six European countries, including Russia. His trademark is candid black-and-white photography. He has been using different cameras during 65 years of work, but since 1952, he has been using Leica cameras, mainly his favourite Leica M3. He uses 35 mm and 50 mm lenses for his work. Plicka has been processing his photos on his own from his beginnings.

Biography She was born in Louis Trichardt (today South Africa‚Äôs Limpopo Province) just north of the Tropic of Capricorn. She was the second of six children born to Salahuddin and Mariam Shaikh. Her first school years were in Louis Trichardt, until the family moved to Pietersburg, just over 100 km South. After completing school in 1978, Shaikh studied at the University of Durban-Westville, which was reserved, under South Africa's apartheid laws, for students of Indian descent. In 1984 she completed her Bachelor of Arts Degree, majoring in Arabic and Psychology. These were politically charged years at university, and she got involved in the Azanian People's Organisation (AZAPO) for the next two years. In 1985 Shaikh was elected to the executive committee of the Islamic Society of UD-W. On 4 September 1985, she was arrested for distributing pamphlets that called for a consumer boycott of white-owned businesses in Durban. The boycott had been called by the Federation of South African Trade Unions (Fosatu), the largest trade union federation in the country and supported by the Muslim Students Association of South Africa (MSA), which had organised this particular pamphlet blitz. Shaikh spent the next few hours locked up at Durban's CR Swart Police Station (now Durban Central Police Station) with the president of the MSA, Na'eem Jeenah.. This was their first meeting and they would marry 2 years later. After completing her degree in 1985, Shaikh taught at the Taxila Primary and Secondary school in her hometown of Pietersburg (now called Polokwane). She married Jeenah on 20 December 1987 and moved to Johannesburg. She gave birth to Minhaj in September 1988 and to Shir'a in 1990. Work In 1989 Shaikh became involved with a Muslim community newspaper, al-Qalam, which was being edited by her husband. She also became increasingly involved in the Muslim Youth Movement of South Africa (MYM). Together with her fellow activists in the MYM, Shaikh was visible in 1989 and 1990 in the heightened political activity in Durban with campaigns against the Tricameral Parliament elections for the \\"Indian\\" and \\"Coloured\\" race groups; the defiance campaign of the Mass Democratic Movement; marches; demonstrations; mass rallies and solidarity campaigns. In 1993 Shaikh was elected the Transvaal Regional Chairperson of the Muslim Youth Movement, and was thus a member of its National Executive, only the second woman to hold such a position. That was also the year that catapulted Shaikh into the limelight with her famous \\"women in the mosque\\" campaign. That Ramadan, Shaikh and a number of other women linked to the MYM began to mobilise women to attend the tarawih prayers at the 23rd Street Mosque in Fietas in Johannesburg. This led to clashes between her and some of the members of the mosque committee and thrust her into the public eye. Later that year, she became the first national co-ordinator of the Muslim Youth Movement Gender Desk, a position that again put her on the MYM‚Äôs National Executive. She held the position until she resigned in the middle of 1996. Under Shaikh's leadership, the MYM Gender Desk rapidly became the most outspoken Muslim organisation on the question of Muslim women's rights and gender within the Muslim community and the leading organisation in the South African articulation of Islamic feminism. In her position as gender desk co-ordinator, Shaikh organised various workshops, seminars and campaigns. She spearheaded the MYM‚Äôs \\"Campaign for a Just Muslim Personal Law\\", the \\"Equal Access to Mosques\\" campaign and various others. Shaikh was very involved in the Muslim Forum on Elections ‚Äì a coalition of Muslim organisations that was calling on the community to vote in South Africa‚Äôs first democratic elections in April 1994, and to vote for those parties \\"that had formerly been part of the liberation movement\\" ‚Äì in particular, the African National Congress (ANC) and the Pan Africanist Congress (PAC). Also in 1994, Shaikh helped found and became the first chairperson of the Muslim Community Broadcasting Trust which applied for and was awarded a community radio licence for Johannesburg. She remained chair of the MCBT till her death. She was also involved, from 1994, with the founding and establishment of the Muslim Personal Law Board of South Africa and was a member of the Board until it was unilaterally shut down by the United Ulama Council of South Africa. That was also the year that she was diagnosed with breast cancer. As a result, she had to undergo a lumpectomy and radiation therapy. A year later, doctors found that the cancer had affected her entire skeleton. For this she was treated with high dose chemotherapy. After the cancer had thus disappeared, she had decided not to receive chemotherapy again, if the cancer recurred. She said she preferred to die with dignity and continue doing till the end what she loved rather than being sick in hospital. That same year, while battling cancer, she was appointed Managing Editor of Al-Qalam. Under her editorship, Al-Qalam became the flagship of a progressive expression of Islam in South Africa. In April 1997 Shaikh performed the hajj for the first time. After her return she and her husband began working on a manuscript about their hajj experiences. The result is \\"Journey of Discovery: A South African Hajj\\", published in 2000. In August 1997, the Muslim community radio station, The Voice, was launched - with Shaikh at its head. On 22 December 1997, Shaikh completed her final public engagement. She delivered a paper, \\"Women & Islam ‚Äì The Gender Struggle in South Africa: The Ideological Struggle\\" at the 21st Islamic Tarbiyyah Programme of the Muslim Youth Movement, at the As Salaam Educational Institute on South Africa's KwaZulu-Natal South Coast. Seventeen days later, on 8 January 1998 / 9 Ramadan 1418, Shaikh died. Death In 1996, Shaikh suffered a relapse of cancer and died on 8 January 1998, at her home in Mayfair. One of the four funeral prayers performed for her was led by her close female friend, Farhana Ismail, with women and men following - as per Shaikh's request. Further, her funeral services at a Johannesburg Mosque and at the Claremont Main Road Mosque in Cape Town as well as the burial were attended by many women. In Pietersburg, dozens of women were present at her burial. She is survived by her husband and 2 children.Death of a Muslim Joan of Arc The national liberation struggle and Islamic feminisms in South Africa See also *Women as imams *Islamic feminism Sources Category:1960 births Category:1998 deaths Category:Proponents of Islamic feminism Category:South African feminists Category:South African women's rights activists Category:South African Muslims Category:South African people of Indian descent ","title":"Shamima Shaikh"},{"id":"1633119","text":"KDE mascot Konqi debugging.

Bel√©m is located in western Lisbon, to the west of Ajuda and Alc√¢ntara and directly east of Lisbon's border with Oeiras. Bel√©m is famous as a museum district, as the home of many of the most notable monuments of Lisbon and Portugal alike, such as the Bel√©m Tower, the Jer√≥nimos Monastery, the Padr√£o dos Descobrimentos, and Bel√©m Palace (official residence of the President of Portugal). The population in 2011 was 16,528.Instituto Nacional de Estat√≠stica (INE), Census 2011 results according to the 2013 administrative division of Portugal History Archaeological evidence discovered along the margins of the Tagus indicates that human occupation in the area of Bel√©m dates to the Paleolithic era. =Middle Ages= Bel√©m Tower, a Manueline military outpost built in the Tagus river. With the establishment of the Kingdom of Portugal by Afonso III, royal surveys, or inquiri√ß√µes gerais (general inquiries), were made at his command to inspect titles of lands claimed by the nobility and clergy, determined that the population around Lisbon was dispersed throughout the lowlands, which were suitable for agriculture. Consequently, Bel√©m was connected to the neighbouring city by a bridge at Alc√¢ntara. Bel√©m's proximity to the River Tagus also encouraged the development of commercial activities in the small village of Aldeia do Restelo, which attracted mariners and other seafarers seeking safe anchorage and protection from the winds when they entered the river. In the 14th century, Moors settled on and cultivated the surrounding lands, providing the city with produce; other Moors, both free and enslaved, worked in the fishing industry. Meanwhile, settlement in Restelo grew slowly towards Lisbon. It was \\"to give religious and spiritual support\\" to the villagers that Henry the Navigator, as governor in the military-religious Order of Christ, initiated construction near the fishing port of a small church dedicated to Saint Mary. Henry also ordered the construction of a fountain and water trough in 1460 to provide drinking water for the people and their animals. The foundation of the church and the Jer√≥nimos Monastery by Manuel I around 1459 on the site of the older church resulted in its transfer from the Order of Christ to the Hieronymite monks, and at the same time in its being renamed Santa Maria de Bel√©m.Nuno Senos (2003), p.103 The existing structure was started on the orders of Manuel I (1469‚Äì1521) at the courts of Montemor-o-Velho in 1495, as a final resting-place for members of the House of Aviz, in his belief that an Iberian dynastic kingdom would rule after his death. In 1496, King Manuel petitioned the Holy See for permission to construct a monastery at the entrance of the Tagus. It was after the arrival of Vasco da Gama a year later with samples of gold he had discovered that the monastery became a symbol of Portuguese expansionism. The church became a house of prayer for seamen leaving or entering the port.Nuno Senos (2003), p.105Nuno Senos (2003), p.107 =Brigantine era= Jer√≥nimos Monastery in 1657. Bom Sucesso Convent, built 1639. With the restoration of Portuguese independence in 1640, the monastery regained much of its former importance, becoming the burial place for the royal pantheon; within its walls four of the eight children of King John IV were entombed: the Infante Teod√≥sio (1634‚Äì1653), the Infanta Joana (1636‚Äì1653), King Afonso VI (1643‚Äì1683) and Catherine of Braganza (1638‚Äì1705). On 29 September 1855, the body of King Afonso VI was transported to the royal pantheon of the House of Braganza in the Monastery of S√£o Vicente de Fora, along with his three brothers and sister. During the reign of Peter II, in 1682, the bodies of King Sebastian and Cardinal Henrique were buried in the transept chapels. The same monarch ordered construction of \\"a tower of four storeys\\" (in the words of Dami√£o de G√≥is) on a basaltic outcropping of rocks in the Tagus near its north bank, using some of the stones being collected to build the Jer√≥nimos Monastery. This was the foundation of the bastion of the Bel√©m Tower (Torre de Bel√©m). After completion of these two construction projects, a number of manorss in the surrounding countryside were established by the nobility. As the population continued to slowly grow, the demographics of the suburb changed sufficiently that Friar Nicolau de Oliveira indicated in 1620 that it was within the city limits. New convents appeared in the area, and between 1551 and 1591 (as noted by Vieira da Silva) the civil parish of Ajuda (Nossa Senhora da Ajuda) was created, consisting of a vast territory with clerics installed in the Monastery of Bel√©m. The Bel√©m district became increasingly popular after King John V acquired estates and properties in the area to develop defenses for Lisbon. Carvalho da Costa noted in his Corografia Portuguesa that \\"...immediately in front of is the locality of Bel√©m, so healthy and appreciable that the naturals and visitors want to live there, and those who for want of comfort can not live [there] are continually competing for that site. In it there are houses, noble estates, nobility, nobles of the first order in the Kingdom; and if the land permitted more palaces or buildings, the city would continue unto that site\\". Jos√© I of Portugal in 1759. In 1770, during the reign of Joseph I, the ecclesiastical parish of S√£o Pedro de Alc√¢ntara, including the territory east of the Alc√¢ntra River, was established, thus deannexing it from Ajuda. The barrio of Bel√©m was officially constituted with its own judicial and administrative authority, and included the ecclesiastical parish of Ajuda, part of Alc√¢ntra and Santa Isabel, as well as the parishes of Benfica, Belas, Barcarena and Carnaxide. Bel√©m and Ajuda were the areas around Lisbon suffering the least destruction in the great Lisbon earthquake and the following tsunami on 1 November 1755. Many of the survivors who lost their homes were installed in numerous tents and shacks in the region. King Joseph and his court moved to a complex of tents and barracks located on a part of the royal estates where the Ajuda National Palace would be built. This relocation by the King and his prime minister and Secretary of State, the Marquess of Pombal, attracted commerce and made Bel√©m-Ajuda the centre of the state bureaucracy during the third quarter of the 18th century. A military presence was also deemed important by the government: two regimental infantry barracks under the Count of Lippe, and a cavalry regiment under Mecklenburg were installed. These events consolidated the integration of Bel√©m-Ajuda into the city of Lisbon. Departure of the Portuguese Royal Family to Brazil from Bel√©m in 1807. During the latter part of the 18th century, the monarchy slowly extricated itself from Bel√©m-Ajuda. In 1794, a fire in Ajuda destroyed the Royal Tent (Tenda Real), forcing the royal family to abandon the location and take residence in the Queluz National Palace. A lack of funds had delayed completion of the Ajuda National Palace, so with the French invasion in 1807, the royal family fled to Rio de Janeiro. When they returned to Portugal in 1821, King John VI installed them in the Necessidades and Bemposta Palaces. Tropical Botanical Garden of the Overseas Empire, founded in 1906. Bel√©m gradually evolved into an industrial zone, particularly around Pedrou√ßos and Bom Sucesso, attracting factories of various kinds such as tanneries, metal stampers, glassmakers, earthenware manufacturers, textile makers, woollenware producers and a rope-making factory for shipping. On 28 December 1833, the civil parish of Santa Maria de Bel√©m, including the parish of Ajuda, was institutionalised with its seat in the Jer√≥nimos Monastery. Rapid industrialization began in this period and continued throughout the 19th century; an 1881 inquiry established that 25 factories produced goods in the Alc√¢ntara-Bel√©m region, employing 1,215 men, 812 women and 432 minors. The growth attracted many new residents and subsidised housing was constructed to support the manufacturing industry. Bel√©m subsequently had more autonomy: a separate municipality of Bel√©m actually existed between 11 September 1852 and 18 June 1885, presided over by its first president, the historian Alexandre Herculano. The municipality included the parishes of Nossa Senhora da Ajuda, Santa Maria de Bel√©m, part of S√£o Pedro de Alc√¢ntara, Santa Isabel and S√£o Sebasti√£o da Pedreira, as well as Nossa Senhora do Amparo de Benfica, S√£o Louren√ßo de Carnide and Menino Jesus de Odivelas. The royal family of King Louis of Portugal and Queen Maria Pia of Savoy began to reside in the Ajuda National Palace. =Republic= Bel√©m Palace became the official residence of the President of Portugal following the Revolution of 1910. Bel√©m was also the location for the development of many urban projects, such as the construction of a landfill, opening of many docks or the opening of a rail link to Cascais, which initially departed from Pedrou√ßos. Socially, the first recreational and cultural organizations were established, and the area was a place for leisure activities. On transitioning into the 20th century, Bel√©m had grown considerably, with the establishment of electrical services within the area and significantly with the 1940 Portuguese exhibition. The 1940 Expo resulted in the demolition of the older nucleus of Bel√©m, the Pra√ßa do Imp√©rio. and the beginning of a phase of monumental constructions which, along with pre-existing historic architecture (such as the Jer√≥nimos Monastery, Bel√©m Tower, and Bel√©m Palace) began to occupy the waterfront. This included the iconic Padr√£o dos Descobrimentos and the modern Centro Cultural de Bel√©m which helped to promote tourist and cultural exploration of the north margin of the Tagus. Until 2012, the area of Bel√©m had its own historic parish, named Santa Maria de Bel√©m. In 2012, the Administrative Reform of Lisbon resulted in the merging of the latter and the parish of S√£o Francisco Xavier, thus creating the new parish of Bel√©m. Geography An aerial view of Bel√©m's Pra√ßa do Imp√©rio (Imperial Square). The southwestern limit of the city of Lisbon, Bel√©m is delimited by the Tagus estuary to the south, the margins of the Alg√©s river and the IC17-CRIL highway, to the west, until the northern limit of the A5 highway). In addition, the Alc√¢ntara river and the former eastern limits of the parish of S√£o Francisco Xavier, until the Estrada de Queluz (Road of Queluz) reaches the A5 highway. It is bordered by the parishes of Alc√¢ntara in the east, Ajuda in the northeast, and Benfica in the north; and to the west by the municipality of Oeiras (Alg√©s). In addition to the historical buildings and avenues, Bel√©m is the location of the Jardim do Ultramar (), several blocks of green-spaces that includes the gardens of the Pra√ßa do Imp√©rio (), the Jardim Vasco de Gama (), Afonso de Albuquerque Square and Jardim Agricola Tropical (). These gardens cover a large portion of the waterfront area, encircling the buildings of the Rua de Bel√©m, and backs onto the gardens of the Palace of Bel√©m. Also in Bel√©m it's located the extreme southwest section of the Monsanto Forest Park. Architecture Tagus Power Station, built in 1908, now houses the Electricity Museum. Jer√≥nimos Monastery, built in the 16th century, is a magnum opus of Manueline architecture. Bel√©m is recognized for its concentration of national monuments and public spaces, including a mixture of historical buildings and modern symbols of Portuguese culture. This juxtaposition of famous icons developed from Bel√©m's important military position along the mouth of the Tagus; its role in the exploration in India and the Far East (the Caminho das √çndias); and 17th‚Äì18th century construction of royal residences and noble estates in the parish following the destruction stemming from the 1755 earthquake and tsunami. Bel√©m's main street and historical avenue is Rua de Bel√©m, a strip of 160-year-old buildings that have survived several years of change and modernization. This includes the famous pastry shop F√°brica de Pasteis de Bel√©m known for a specific Portuguese confectionery: pastel de Bel√©m (pl.: past√©is de Bel√©m), an egg tart made with flaky pastry. Champalimaud Foundation, one of the world's leading research centers. In the heart of Bel√©m is the Pra√ßa do Imp√©rio, an avenue of open- spaces and gardens, with a central fountain, which was laid-out during World War II. To the west of the gardens lies the Centro Cultural de Bel√©m, built in 1992 during Portugal's term in the revolving role at the helm of the European Union presidency. It is now an arts complex, containing Bel√©m's Museu Colec√ß√£o Berardo. To the southeast of the gardens is the Bel√©m Palace (1770), the official residence of the Portuguese President. Five hundred metres to the east of Pra√ßa do Imp√©rio lies Bel√©m's other major square Pra√ßa Afonso de Albuquerque. MAAT, the Museum of Art, Architecture and Technology. Bel√©m is home to a number of other museums: Museu da Electricidade (Electricity Museum), Museum of Art, Architecture and Technology, Museu do Centro Cient√≠fico e Cultural de Macau (Macau Cultural Museum), Museu de Arte Popular (Folk Art Museum), Museu Nacional dos Coches (Coach Museum), and Museu da Presid√™ncia da Rep√∫blica (Presidential Museum). Monument to the Combatants of the Portuguese Colonial War. Belenenses, a renowned sports club from Lisbon is based in Bel√©m, commonly known as the \\"fourth big team\\", because up until 1982 was one of the four Portuguese teams (the others are Benfica, Sporting and Porto) that never were never relegated to the second league. In its history Belenenses won the Portuguese Championship once and the Portuguese Cup for three times. =Civic= * Bel√©m Tower () ‚Äì constructed on the rocky outcropping/island along the northern margin of the Tagus River as part of a defensive system to protect access to the Tagus estuary envisioned by John II of Portugal, it is one of Bel√©m's iconic symbols of the parish. Originally, the Tower of Saint Vincent (), it was elaborated by Manuel I of Portugal (1515‚Äì1520) to guard the entrance to the port at Bel√©m. It stood on a little island in right side of the Tagus, surrounded by water. * Monument to the Discoveries () - located on the edge of the Tagus' northern bank, this 52 metre-high slab of concrete, was erected in 1960 to commemorate the 500th anniversary of the death of Henry the Navigator. The monument is sculpted in the form of a ship's prow, with dozens of figures from Portuguese history following a statue of the Infante Henry sculpted in bas-relief. Adjacent to the monument is a cal√ßada square in the form of a map, showing the routes of various Portuguese explorers, during the Age of Discovery. * Thai Pavilion () - Located inside Vasco Da Gama Garden, a gift from the Royal Thai Government honoring the 500th anniversary of the establishment of the bilateral relations between Thailand and Portugal. The Pavilion was inaugurated by her Royal Highness the Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn and the Mayor of Lisbon, Mr. Antonio Costa on the 21st of February 2012.Sala Thai. 2012. Vasco Da Gama Garden, Portugal. Built in Bangkok, the monument was shipped to Lisbon following the same route of Portuguese navigator-diplomat Duarte Fernandes in 1511. The monument reaffirms the diplomatic relations between Thailand and Portugal;Thailand's oldest alliance with a European nation. The red and golden structure is inspired by the Jeronimos Monastery, but follows Thai traditions such as assembly without the use of any metal, nails, or screws, and a roof covered with motifs resembling a dragon's scales. Being only one of four similar structures found outside Thailand, the Sala Thai is one of the most singular monuments in Lisbon.https://gailatlarge.com/blog/2014/07/09/25922 =Religious= * Jer√≥nimos Monastery () ‚Äì located along the Pra√ßa do Imp√©rio (Empire Square), across from the Padr√£o dos Descobrimentos (Monument to the Discoveries), it was originally built to support pilgrims who travelled in the region by Henry the Navigator; expanded and elaborated from 1501 by architects for King Manuel I of Portugal to serve as a resting-place for members of the House of Aviz; and as a church for seafearing adventurers who embarked during the Age of Discovery, after Vasco da Gama's successful voyage to India. Construction was funded by a tax on eastern spices, and over time came to represent Portuguese historical discoveries, becoming over time a national monument and UNESCO World Heritage Site, housing (in addition to the religious art and furniture from its past) artefacts and exhibitions like the Museu Nacional de Arqueologia (National Archaeological Museum) and the Museu da Marinha (Maritime Museum) within its walls.

The river flows south through one of the most remote and least explored areas of Nepal as the Karnali River. The Seti River drains the western part of the catchment and joins the Karnali River in Doti District north of Dundras hill. Another tributary, the long Bheri, rises in the western part of Dhaulagiri Himalaya and drains the eastern part of the catchment, meeting the Karnali near Kuineghat in Surkhet. Cutting southward across the Siwalik Hills, it splits into two branches, the Geruwa on the left and Kauriala on the right near Chisapani to rejoin south of the Indian border and form the proper Ghaghara.

It travels a distance of about and joins Ghaghara near Guthani, Siwan district of Bihar. The Chhoti Gandak River Basin is located between 26¬∞00' to 27¬∞20' N latitude and 83¬∞30' to 84¬∞15' E longitude. Right bank tributaries are Khekhra, Hirna, Jethan, Maun, Duhari, Kanchi and Koilar rivers; Khanua river joins from the left bank. The discharge of Chhoti Gandak is mainly controlled by rain, which is very high during the monsoon season and low during the summers. It has been observed that whenever precipitation is high in the catchment areas, there is flood in the downstream part of the Chhoti Gandak River Basin. The region exhibits upland terrace surface, river valley terrace surface, present-day river channel with narrow flood plains, natural levee, and point-bar deposits.

The significance of some of the protected areas is summarised below: Shey Phoksundo National Park in Dolpa District, established in 1984, is situated in the trans-Himalayan region of northwestern Nepal and represents the Tibetan Plateau ecosystem. The park, covering an area of , contains luxuriant forests mainly composed of blue pine, spruce, cypress, poplar, fir and birch. It provides habitat for the endangered snow leopard, the blue sheep and many bird species such as Himalayan monal, blood pheasant, cheer pheasant and snow partridge. It is a religious Buddhist site. Rara National Park is located in Mugu District with a small area in Jumla District in the mountain region of northwestern Nepal and is the smallest park with a size of . It includes Rara Lake, spread over , the biggest lake in Nepal, at an elevation of . The oval lake has a maximum length of and a width of . The vegetation of the park consists of coniferous trees such blue pine, rhododendrons, black juniper, west Himalayan spruce, oak and Himalayan cypress. The fauna includes musk deer, Himalayan black bear, leopard, goral, jackal, Himalayan tahr, yellow-throated marten, dhole, wild boar, gray langur, rhesus macaque and otter. Common bird species include migrant waterfowl, coot, great-crested and black-necked grebes, red-crested pochard, mallard, common teal, common merganser, Himalayan snowcock and chukar partridge. Bardia National Park is the largest and most undisturbed protected area in the Terai region of the Nepal Himalayas, covering on the southern slopes of the Sivalik Hills. It is bordered in the south by the Babai River, and to the west by the Girwa River, a tributary of the Karnali. At Chisapani Gorge, the swift-flowing Karnali River emerges from the Shiwalik Range onto the broad plain and flows purposefully through the semi-tropical jungle. The park is famous for two Asian elephant herds, several deer species, gaur, nilgai, Himalayan tahr, serow and goral. The Karnali supports the endangered mugger crocodile, the gharial, a few remaining South Asian river dolphins and the golden mahseer. Other protected areas include Dhorpatan Hunting Reserve and, as the river crosses the Nepal‚ÄìIndia border, the Katarniaghat Wildlife Sanctuary, a part of Dudhwa Tiger Reserve in Uttar Pradesh India.  Endangered species  Fish from Karnali River on sale in a shop at Chisapani, Kailali, Nepal The Karnali provides the upper range for the Gangetic river dolphin (Platanista gangetica), the largest freshwater mammals found on the Indian subcontinent. They are considered vulnerable species under CITES Appendix 1 and are classified as endangered on the IUCN Red List (IUCN, 2004). The river dolphins are legally protected animals in Nepal as endangered mammal and fall under Schedule I of the protected list of National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act, 1973. Living at the upstream range limit, dolphins in the Karnali River are particularly vulnerable to threats from habitat degradation. Dolphins need deep pools of water. They are often found in places where human activities are most intense and they are sometimes accidentally caught by the local people who live in the lower Karnali basin. The Karnali River supports the last potentially viable population of the Ganges river dolphin in Nepal. These dolphins are at their farthest upstream range and isolated by the Girijapur Barrage (a low gated dam), located about downstream of the Nepal‚ÄìIndia border.untitled A high dam has been planned for some time just upstream of the dolphins' current (or at least recent) range in the Karnali River, Nepal. If built, this structure would almost certainly eliminate the small amount of dolphin habitat in Nepal's last river with a potentially viable dolphin population. Disturbance and environmental degradation associated with geotechnical feasibility studies and bridge and road construction for the dam already may have contributed to a decline in the number and range of dolphins or susu above the Nepal-India border. The Ghaghara is the furthest upstream in the dolphin range.Gangetic dolphin Other important protected areas and their biological and religious significance are a) Khaptad NP at , 1984 - oak, fir, conifer, musk deer, leopard, black bear.

There are several attractive sites for the generation of cheap hydroelectric energy in this basin. The Master Plan Study for Water Resource Development of the Upper Karnali River and Mahakali River Basins (1993) identified 32 potential hydropower projects in the Karnali Basin. Despite the high potential of hydropower development (32,000 MW) in the Basin, only 2,245 kW capacities (from eight micro hydel schemes) has been developed so far. Considering the pace of hydropower development in Nepal (Out of 83,000 MW potential, only 705 MW hydropower has been generated throughout the country till the end of 12th national plan viz. 2009/10-2011-12) in general and in the Karnali Basin in particular, harnessing the total hydropower potential of the Basin is envisaged to take a long time. Based on recent water resources development planning and project progress, the likely large scale hydropower projects that will be operational in the Basin by 2025 are predicted to be: West Seti HEP (750 MW); Upper Karnali HEP (300 MW); Bheri-Babai Multipurpose Project (48 MW); and Lohore Khola HEP (58 MW). West Seti HEP (750 MW) The proposed West Seti HEP is located on the Seti River in the Far-Western Development Region of Nepal. The West Seti HEP catchment covers the upper of the Seti River Basin. The West Seti HEP is a large storage project with a rated capacity of 750 MW. The power station is located approximately upstream of the Seti River confluence with the Karnali River, with the dam site located a further upstream. All project sites, excluding the reservoir area and transmission line corridor, are located in either Doti and/or Dadeldhura Districts. The reservoir area is located in Doti, Dadeldhura, Baitadi and Bajhang Districts. The transmission line corridor is located in Doti, Dadeldhura, Kailali and Kanchanpur Districts. The project has been allocated for development as BOOT project under private sector. Upper Karnali HEP (900 MW) The proposed Upper Karnali HEP is located on the main course of the Karnali River and has a catchment area of . This project is one of Nepal's most economically attractive runoff- river diversion schemes (900 MW), with daily peaking capacity and high firm energy. Project facilities will be located in three districts: Surkhet, Dailekh and Achham. Project hydrology is based on data from station 240 at Asaraghat. The river is snow fed and the mean annual estimated flow at the headworks is . The project has been allocated to GMR of India for development on BOOT basis. Bheri-Babai Multipurpose Project (48 MW) The Bheri-Babai Multipurpose Project is an inter-Basin water transfer project prioritised for the development of irrigation in Bardia District . The intake of the Bheri-Babai (BR-1) diversion scheme lies on the Bheri River upstream of the confluence with the Karnali River. The tailrace outlet is located in the Babai River upstream of the existing Babai irrigation project diversion weir. The Bheri-Babai project aims to generate electricity and supply additional water to the Babai Irrigation Scheme in the Terai by diverting of water from the Bheri River into the Babai River. The project is yet to undergo a feasibility study. Lohore Khola HEP (LR-1) ‚Äì (58 MW) The Lohore Khola HEP is a proposed reservoir storage project situated on the Lohore Khola, a tributary of the Karnali River in Dailekh District. The project is located a few kilometers downstream from the confluence with Chham River and upstream of Dungeshowr. The catchment area of the Lohore River at the reservoir site is . Based on the isohyetal map of the Karnali River Basin, average annual rainfall for the basin is estimated to be . As there is no stream gauge on the Lohore River, its flow was estimated using data from Station 240 (1963‚Äì2000) located on the Karnali River at Asaraghat with a catchment area of . The sediment flow into the river is estimated to be 2.4 million tonnes per year. As the economic internal rate of return (EIRR) for the project is highest for the draft rate of 0.7, the flow for power generation was estimated for this draft rate. The riparian flow was assumed to be 10 percent of the monthly minimum flow; i.e., . Karnali (Chisapani) Multipurpose Project (10,800 MW) The site of the Karnali Multipurpose Project, also Chisapani Dam Project, is located in the Karnali Gorge, immediately upstream of the Terai. The project has a catchment area of , covering nearly 30 percent of Nepal. The long-term average river flow is , with an average dry season flow (November‚ÄìMay) of and an average wet season flow (June‚ÄìOctober) of . The Karnali (Chisapani) Multipurpose Project is a potential mega multipurpose storage project on the Karnali River at Chisapani, envisaging a high dam, with reservoir area of , with power station operating under a design head of to operate 18 units of 620 MW capacity each ( 10,800 MW installed capacity) and with a re-regulating weir downstream with power plant of 84 MW capacity operating under a head of . A large-scale irrigation development is also envisaged‚Äî in Nepal and in India. Project planning commenced in 1960, although the feasibility study for the project was only completed in 1989. Before this project is developed a number of significant underlying issues have to be resolved. These issues include: Nepal and India reaching a bilateral agreement on the downstream benefits of regulated river flows; the resettlement of over 60,000 people; the impact on and restoration of habitat within Bardia National Park; and, above all, the financial arrangements for project funding. Accordingly, it is predicted that the chances of this project being implemented before 2025 are very slim, although increasing international pressure on reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the energy generation sector may assist project initiation. While the likelihood of this project being developed by 2025 is low, Nepal and India could cooperate to develop this project to meet India's growing energy demand from renewable resources. IrrigationNepal= The major existing river use by volume in the Karnali Basin is irrigation. Three areas on the Nepal Terai and two areas in India are irrigated from the Karnali River. Within Nepal, two areas are irrigated in Bardiya District, , and a single site is irrigated in Kailali District, . The total demand for irrigation water from the Karnali River by these three areas represents a very small proportion of existing total annual river flows, amounting to a mean annual rate of . This is equivalent to 3.9 percent of the mean annual Karnali River flow into India.EIA - VOL 1b.pdf =India= In India, water is diverted from the Karnali River at the Girija Barrage into the Sarda Sahayak Irrigation Scheme and the Saryu Nahar Irrigation Scheme, which have command areas of and respectively. The combined annual irrigation demand of these two schemes is approximately . The Sarda Sahayak Irrigation Project uses the combined flows from the rivers Ghaghara and Sarda in the Girija Barrage built across the Ghaghara river below a catchment area of . This barrage is situated about downstream of Khatria Ghat Rly station and from the international border to Nepal in Bahraich district. It is linked to the Lower Sarda Barrage (built across the Sarda river, with a catchment area of , about northeast of Lakhimpur Kheri Rly station in Lakhimpur Kheri district) via a link canal from Girija Barrage to the Lower Sarda Barrage which is long and is designed to divert a discharge of from Gandak to Sarda river. The feeder channel taking off from the Lower Sarda Barrage is long, feeds the five branches of Dariyabad, Barabani, Haideganj, RaeBareil and Purva, and is designed to carry a discharge of . The Sarda Sahayak feeder channel meets the Haidergarh branch at and Raibareli branch at . The entire canal system is considered the largest in Asia and designed to provide irrigation to a Culturalable Command Area (CCA) of covering 14 districts in 168 blocks with a gross command area of . On account of high silt flows during the flood season, Sarda Sahayak supplies (from Karnali) are suspended for 100 days between June and October, when the Lower Sarda Canal (feeder canal) draws water from the Sarda River, which is then flooded.Parajuli, U.

WASSA Project Reports, Volume 3 download pdf  Navigation  In the past the Karnali River was considered to be attractive for the development of navigation right from the Indo‚ÄìNepal border till the confluence of this river and the Ganges. The lower reach of this river‚Äîcalled the Ghaghra in India‚Äîwas used in the past for navigation by steamers. Apart from in the foothills of the Himalayas where most of the streams were simply fast-moving water throughout the greater part of the year and not navigable when flowing rapidly, most of the rivers with steadier currents had boats on them. The Ganges, the Ghaghra, the Yamuna, the Gomti, the Sharda and the Rapti were the most important navigable rivers in the Northwestern provinces and Oudh. Many trade items such as timber, food grains, sugar, indigo, cotton seed, poppy seed and mustard seed were transported by boats. April, May and June were the most suitable months and were a busy trading period. Different kinds of cargo boats were used on the Ganges, the smaller ones were known as palwars, while the larger ones were known as katris. In the latter half of the 19th century when the railways came into existence, the significance of waterways as inland trade routes declined, as the railways were faster and safer. With the exception of eastern parts of Bengal where abundance of water in the natural network of channels sustained and continued to provide a suitable mode of transport of goods and people, the railways had almost entirely replaced the waterways as communication lines throughout the country by the end of the 19th century. The possibilities for further extension of the steamer services to the north had also been explored in the past. The Central Water and Power Commission of the Government of India had carried out hydrographical survey of the Karnali River from the Bahramghat to the confluence of this river and the Ganges a distance of . This survey was done in the years 1943‚Äì53 to explore the possibility of improvement and extension of navigation on this river by powered crafts. These surveys revealed that there were only 5 shoals under at low water between Burhaj and Bahramghat a distance of about . The minimum depth was . These depths were available without any river conservancy works. All other conditions of navigable channel such as the width and current of flow etc. were also found to be very favourable. The low water stage in this river is only for a short duration. There is a great urgency to carry out detailed study of the Karnali river to develop modern inland waterway by applying various channel improvement technologies.Wafed - Nepal See also * List of rivers of Nepal * List of rivers of India * Sarayu river * Battle of Ghaghra  References External links * Ghaghara River marked on OpenStreetMap * Nepal River Conservation Trust: The Karnali River * A very short description of Ghaghra River * Karnali Bridge in Far-Western Nepal Category:Rivers of Nepal Category:International rivers of Asia Category:Tributaries of the Ganges Category:Rivers of Uttar Pradesh Category:Rivers of the Tibet Autonomous Region Category:Rivers in Buddhism Category:Rivers of India Category:Ghaghara ","title":"Ghaghara"},{"id":"1633130","text":"The Western Fair is a fair held annually in London, Ontario, Canada in early September. History John Huse Saunders The first Western Fair was held in September 1868 in downtown London, northeast of the current location of Victoria Park. Organizers had hoped to use the Crystal Palace Barracks as the main exhibition area. Livestock shows took place on the parade grounds outside the Crystal Palace. In 1887, when the fair gained legal status through the Provincial Charter and Act of Incorporation, it moved to 900 King Street in east London, where the fairgrounds remain today. The present fairgrounds were purchased for $65,000. Except for an eight-year period between 1939 and 1947 when the Canadian Department of National Defence occupied the grounds, the Western Fair has operated on the new site. John Huse Saunders was President of the Western Fair Association (WFA) for 22 years. He devoted more than 50 years to the Western Fair and was known throughout North America as a poultry breeder. After receiving Honorary Presidential status the WFA changed the by- laws and limited the term to three years. In 2011, the former Western Fair Association re-branded itself as the Western Fair District, to better represent the reality that the grounds and building facilities had expanded beyond a 9-day fair to year-round activities. With 2020's cancellation on grounds of COVID-19 pandemic, the 145th was deferred to 2021. The fair The Western Fair runs during the second full week of September, starting on Friday and ending on Sunday. The original basis for the Western Fair was agricultural displays, arts and crafts, and vendors, with a heavy emphasis on competition. Later additions included the midway and booked entertainment acts. A seasonal harness racetrack was opened in 1961, with simulcast betting added later.http://www.westernfairdistrict.com/raceway The racetrack was later separated from the fair proper. The only 24-hour food vendor at the Western Fair, St. Anne's Church, served meals at the Western Fair from 1947 until 2015, with the proceeds going to local charities and to fund church activities. In 2016, St. Anne's Church did not renew its contract after new regulations restricted its operations to fair open hours only, which would have forced it to operate at a loss.https://lfpress.com/2016/09/13/western- fairs-seven-decade-food-vendor-st-annes-cant-swallow-loss-from-new-contract- packs-up-its-tent Facilities The Western Fairgrounds are open 12 months a year. In addition to the fair itself, the fairgrounds are also home to the Western Fair Raceway, the OLG casino slot machines, an agricultural complex, and several large buildings which are frequently rented out for events. It also used to be home to the former Western Fair Museum and Archives and the former IMAX theater, both of which closed in 2005. The IMAX theatre was taken over by London Musical Theatre Productions in 2007.http://mtplondon.ca A horse racing fan enjoys the harness racing from the infield area at Western Fair Raceway. =Raceway and slot machines= London's primary standardbred horse racing facility is the Western Fair Raceway. A slot machine facility on the site was opened to the public on September 28, 1999, as authorised by the Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation. As of April 2008, the facility contained 750 slot machines and has seen 9.4 million people, supported by a $15 million staff budget. Western Fair Medal circa 1900s =Museum and archives= The Western Fair Museum and Archives began with the efforts of Inge Sanmyia, who was working on her PhD in history at Wilfrid Laurier University in Waterloo, Ontario in 1997. Her three-month summer research project soon became the foundations for the Western Fair Museum and Archives. Since 1997 she has designed historical displays for the Fair and written its history: A Celebration of Excellence: The history of the Western Fair. During its existence, the WFA Museum and Archives accumulated material from the Western Fair, members of the public and historians, and catalogued the Western Fair Archives list of photographs. Through the acquisition of these materials, the museum put on regular short and long-term displays as well as distinct displays during each fall fair. For example: *Transportation and the Fair 1999 *The Great War 2001 *Ann May (Dingwall) Queen of the Cowgirls 2002 *Tings to Remember 2003 *London Firefighters 2004 In its efforts to record and catalogue the material it had acquired, an extensive systems of records and labelling was set up and a Finding Aid was designed and installed in the in-house computer system for easy access. The Museum was affiliated with: Canadian Museums Association, Canadian Heritage Information Network, and Virtual Museum of Canada.

S. Lewis (played by Anthony Hopkins) and American poet Joy Davidman (played by Debra Winger), her death from cancer, and how this challenged Lewis's Christian faith. It was directed by Richard Attenborough with a screenplay by William Nicholson based on his 1985 television film and 1989 stage play of the same name. The 1985 script began life as I Call It Joy written for Thames Television by Brian Sibley and Norman Stone. Sibley later wrote the book, Shadowlands: The True Story of C. S. Lewis and Joy Davidman. The film won the 1993 BAFTA Award for Outstanding British Film. The film marked the last film appearance of English actor Michael Denison. Plot In the 1950s, the reserved, middle-aged bachelor C. S. Lewis is an Oxford University academic at Magdalen College and author of The Chronicles of Narnia series of children's books. He meets the married American poet Joy Davidman Gresham and her young son Douglas on their visit to England, not yet knowing the circumstances of Gresham's troubled marriage. What begins as a formal meeting of two very different minds slowly develops into a feeling of connection and love. Lewis finds his quiet life with his brother Warnie disrupted by the outspoken Gresham, whose uninhibited behaviour sharply contrasts with the rigid sensibilities of the male-dominated university. Each provides the other with new ways of viewing the world. Initially their marriage is one of convenience, a platonic union designed to allow Gresham to remain in England. But when she is diagnosed with cancer, deeper feelings surface, and Lewis' faith is tested as his wife tries to prepare him for her imminent death. Cast * Anthony Hopkins as C. S. \\"Jack\\" Lewis * Debra Winger as Joy Davidman * Edward Hardwicke as Warren \\"Warnie\\" Lewis * Joseph Mazzello as Douglas Gresham * James Frain as Peter Whistler * Julian Fellowes as Desmond Arding * Michael Denison as Harry Harrington * John Wood as Christopher Riley * Peter Firth as Dr. Craig * Mandy Hazledine as train passenger Critical reception Shadowlands received positive reviews from critics. The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported that 97% of critics have given the film a positive review based on 30 reviews, with an average rating of 8.02/10. The site's critics consensus reads, \\"Thanks to brilliant performances from Debra Winger and especially Anthony Hopkins, Shadowlands is a deeply moving portrait of British scholar C.S. Lewis's romance with American poet Joy Gresham.\\" Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times called the film \\"intelligent, moving and beautifully acted.\\" Rita Kempley of The Washington Post described it as \\"a high-class tear-jerker\\" and a \\"literate hankie sopper\\" and added, \\"William Nicholson's screenplay brims with substance and wit, though it's essentially a soap opera with a Rhodes scholarship . . . [Winger] and Hopkins lend great tenderness and dignity to what is really a rather corny tale of a love that was meant to be.\\" In Variety, Emanuel Levy observed, \\"It's a testament to the nuanced writing of William Nicholson ... that the drama works effectively on both personal and collective levels ... Attenborough opts for modest, unobtrusive direction that serves the material and actors ... Hopkins adds another laurel to his recent achievements. As always, there's music in his speech and nothing is over-deliberate or forced about his acting ... Coming off years of desultory and unimpressive movies, Winger at last plays a role worthy of her talent.\\"  Year-end lists  * 3rd ‚Äì James Berardinelli, ReelViews * Top 10 (not ranked) ‚Äì George Meyer, The Ledger * Honorable mention ‚Äì Dan Craft, The Pantagraph Changes from the stage play or earlier television production The stage play opens with Lewis giving a talk about the mystery of suffering, whereas this film intersperses a similar talk several times throughout the narrative. The television film opens with Lewis giving a radio broadcast about the sanctity of marriage. In the stage play as in reality, Lewis and Davidman honeymoon in Greece. In the film, on their honeymoon they look for a \\"Golden Valley\\" in Herefordshire, England, as depicted in a painting hanging in Lewis' study. As in the stage play, though not the earlier television film, Joy has only one son. In the original television film, as in reality, Joy had two sons, Douglas and David.

It is part of the Chappaqua Central School District. It is consistently ranked among the top high schools in America. In 2015 it was listed as the No. 1 best public high school in the US by Best Colleges, and the No. 17 Smartest Public High School in the US by Business Insider. Distinctions Greeley is nationally respected for its high academic standards. The high school was ranked No. 46 nationally in the 2008 U.S. News & World Report rankings of \\"America's Best High Schools,\\"U.S. News & World Report ‚Äì \\"America's Best High Schools,\\" 2008 and No. 7 among those with open enrollment. It currently offers 17 advanced placement courses. Recent years have seen approximately one-tenth of graduating seniors recognized by the National Merit Scholarship committee. The class of 2004 included 25 National Merit semi-finalists, the class of 2005 had 16, and the class of 2007 had 22. The mean SAT score among graduating seniors in the Class of 2012 was 1927; 623 in Critical Reading, 652 in Mathematics, 652 in Writing. The school is strong in several extracurricular programs. Its academic challenge team won the National Academic Championship in 2003 and 2013, finished third in 200t, 2009 and 2010, and placed among the top six teams at the national tournament in five of the six years between 2000 and 2005. Chip Beall, the organizer of the tournament, noted in 2007 that Greeley's team had \\"the most airline miles logged at the National Academic Association's expense\\", a nod to their placement in the final rounds of the tournament more times than any other team in the tournament's history. The Horace Greeley Debate Team has been successful at many regional tournaments as well as national tournaments, and has sent debaters to the state competition every year since its inception in 2002. Additionally, the debate club has flourished under new leadership. The Madrigal Choir, a select group of students auditioned from the full chorus, has attended the prestigious Disney Honors festival in Orlando, Florida and has performed with other choirs at such venues as Carnegie Hall and Lincoln Center. In 2011, the Madrigal Choir received a gold award and came in second place at the Boston Heritage Festival. Programs at Horace Greeley include the LIFE (Learning Independently From Experience) school, an alternative school for grades 11‚Äì12 located on campus, and independent study and senior project options. Arts and athletic offerings are extensive. Classes are offered in five foreign languages: Spanish, French, Latin, Chinese, and, at the LIFE school, Italian. The school has been pushed in recent years to eschew classic languages like French and Latin in favor of more practical ones like Chinese . In the 2014‚Äì2015 school year, Spanish, French, Latin and Chinese were offered. In the 2005‚Äì2006 school year, Ancient Greek was taught for the first time, as an independent study. Students have the opportunity to take Syracuse University Project Advance courses in Earth Systems and Forensic Science. Students may take Marketing and Business & Personal Law for college credit from Mercy College. As of 2013, Greeley has two sister schools in China: Beijing National Day School and Shanghai Yanjing High School, and offers an exchange program for students interested in traveling to China.  Student clubs  The school is named for Horace Greeley, the editor of The New York Tribune who made his home in Chappaqua late in life. One of the school's three main publications, The Greeley Tribune, is an additional tribute to the newsman. The school's other two main publications are The Quake, a full color, student-run sports magazine with a staff of over fifty, making it the school's largest publication, and ADVO, a full color, student-run lifestyle and entertainment magazine. Other student organizations at Greeley include the Model United Nations, One World Study Circle, and community service groups. The largest service groups include S.A.V.E. (Supporting American Veterans Everywhere), S.H.A.R.E., S.A.D.D. (Students Against Destructive Decisions), AAPA (African Anti Poverty Association), Future Business Leaders of America (FBLA), Alliance for Equality (the first gay-straight alliance in Westchester), Students for Social Justice, AIDS Awareness, improvisational comedy troupe The Puritans, Engineering Club, Silent Earth: Greening Greeley, and Amnesty International. Peer leadership is also a popular student/faculty-run organization on campus that gives older students a chance to help acclimate younger students to the high school environment. Another main club is the Federal Reserve Challenge Club. The Fed Challenge Club is an economic club that sends students every year to the New York Federal Reserve to compete in the fed's annual High School Fed Challenge. Within the 2018‚Äì2019 school year, the Fed Challenge Club will branch out to compete in other economic challenges. The school has three a capella groups, The Enchords, a co-ed group, the Quaker Notes, an all female group, and the Acafellas, a male group. Athletics Sports are popular on campus. Among the diverse offerings are varsity programs in baseball, basketball, bowling, field hockey, football, golf, ice hockey, lacrosse, skiing, soccer, softball, swimming and diving, tennis, track and cross country, volleyball, and wrestling. The school's only state championship came in 2002 and was won by the cross country team. In 2001 the school's football team finished with a record of 11‚Äì2, losing 22‚Äì15 to Rochester's Aquinas Institute in the New York State Class A State Championship game. The 2002 boys' cross country team won the Class-B title, and remains the only Greeley sports team to win a state championship. Campus The school campus is made up of 11 buildings, all are named by letter. Buildings such as the Gym (A Building), Cafeteria (H Building), and Auditorium (B Building) are referred to as such and not by their letter name. Although the building letters span A through L, there is no I Building, for unknown reasons. Multiple athletic fields and a tennis court are also on campus. Controversy In 2015, drama teacher Christopher Schraufnagel resigned and was charged with the sexual abuse of three 15-year- old students. The crimes were alleged to have occurred between 2011 and 2015 on campus.Khimm, Suzy Drama at an Elite High School New York Magazine. October 6, 2016 The parents of three students subsequently filed a lawsuit against the school district. On November 7, 2016, Schraufnagel pled guilty.

The population in 2011 was 1,221,Instituto Nacional de Estat√≠stica in an area of 25.30 km¬≤.Eurostat History The valley wall that surrounds the parish of Boaventura Boaventura was a recent settlement, on the road between the southern part of Madeira and Curral das Freiras; the oldest settler was Pedro Gomes Galdo in this location, acquiring lands and establishing a chapel to S√£o Crist√≥v√£o (the place that still retains that name). From the Elucid√°rio Madeirense, it is unclear as to the origins of the local toponymy (which is even absent from the parochial archive), in addition to the variation that exists: Boaventura or Boa Ventura. It is assumed that the first form is the much older designation, more common and the standard illiteration. By conjecture, it has been assumed that the name originate from a place on the continent, from the original settlers, although there exists no place in continental Portugal that uses the same name. Alberto Artur Sarmento, in Freguesias da Madeira, believes that the name came from the first settler, whose name was likely Boaventura. Regardless, the fact is that the name appears just before the middle of the 16th century, preceding the establishment of the ecclesiastical parish. King John V of Portugal, by regal edict on 4 February 1733, authorized the creation of the ecclesiastical parish, while ignoring its jurisdiction and attributions. It was not until 18 November 1836, Ant√≥nio Alfredo de Santa Catarina Braga, governor of the bishop and vicar, issued a charter that formally elevated the clergy to ecclesiastical parish, removing it totally from the jursidaiction of the parish of Ponta Delgada. The seat of this parish was the Chapel of Santa Quit√©ria, constructed in the place of Serr√£o in 1731 (and later constructed in 1835). The lands of this parish belonged, for three centuries, to the civil parish of Ponta Delgada, only becoming independent in 1836. For a long time the lands were the domain of the hereditary estates of the Serr√£o and Silveira families, and more recently the Curado de Vasconcelos and Licio de Lagos. In addition to the Chapel of Santa Quit√©ira, there already existed hermitages in S√£o Crist√≥v√£o and Sant‚ÄôAna, and they were joined in 1918 by a chapel in the site of Faj√£ do Penedo, dedicated to the Cora√ß√£o Imaculado de Maria (Immculate Heart of Mary). Geography View of Boaventura Located 9.5 kilometres east of the municipal seat (S√£o Vicente), Boaventura is surrounded by the parishes of Arco de S√£o Jorge, Ponta Delgada, S√£o Vicente and Curral das Freiras, connected by the regional road that provides access to the western part of the island. The parish contains the localities Faj√£ do Penedo, Falca de Baixo, Falca de Cima, Santa Quit√©ira, Sant‚ÄôAna and S√£o Cristiv√£o. The civil parish is crossed by the Levada da Achada Grande, Levada Grande, Levada das Faias, Levada da Achada, Levada dos Alves and Levada do Pastel, as well as the Levada da Achada (or Levada do Serr√£o), all of which have their origin in the Ribeira dos Moinhos. A short distance from the coast are two islets, referred to as Ilh√©u Porco and Ilh√©u Vermelho, opposite the Ilh√©u Preto (another islet) that fronts a steep vertical cliff. The rugged escarpments divide the isolated settlements, such as Falca de Cima and Falca de Baixo, and it is served by a small port, at the mouth of the Ribeira da Boaventura, with its origin in the Serra das Torrinhas. Economy In the locality of S√£o Crist√≥v√£o there is a small roof-tile factory, utilizing the a dense clay, that is encountered in the region, and resistant to saltwater damage.

They can also be applied in other facilities used by vehicles to mark parking spaces or designate areas for other uses. Road surface markings are used on paved roadways to provide guidance and information to drivers and pedestrians. Uniformity of the markings is an important factor in minimizing confusion and uncertainty about their meaning, and efforts exist to standardize such markings across borders. However, countries and areas categorize and specify road surface markings in different ways‚Äîwhite lines are called white lines mechanical, non-mechanical, or temporary. They can be used to delineate traffic lanes, inform motorists and pedestrians or serve as noise generators when run across a road, or attempt to wake a sleeping driver when installed in the shoulders of a road. Road surface marking can also indicate regulation for parking and stopping. There is continuous effort to improve the road marking system, and technological breakthroughs include adding retroreflectivity, increasing longevity, and lowering installation cost. Today, road markings are used to convey a range of information to the driver spanning navigational, safety and enforcement issues leading to their use in road environment understanding within advanced driver-assistance systems and consideration for future use in autonomous road vehicles. Mechanical markers cat's eye, showing the iron base, rubber housing and lenses Raised-profile marking machine White raised pavement marker near \\"pea-structure\\" side-line on highway surface Mechanical devices may be raised or recessed into the road surface, and either reflective or non-reflective. Most are permanent; some are movable. * Cat's eye, invented by Percy Shaw in the 1930s, Cat's eyes equip many major routes in the British Isles. They consist of four reflective lenses mounted in a durable white rubber housing, two facing fore and two facing aft. The housing is mounted within a cast iron shoe, which the rubber housing sinks in to when driven over. This provides protection from snow ploughing and allows the lenses to be self-cleaning‚Äîthey pass a rubber blade when depressed. The lenses are available in a variety of different colours, mainly white, yellow/orange, green, red, and blue. * Botts' dots (low rounded white or yellow dots), named for the California Caltrans engineer Elbert Botts, who invented the epoxy that keeps them glued down, are one type of a mechanical non-reflective raised marker. Generally they are used to mark the edges of traffic lanes, frequently in conjunction with raised reflective markers. Botts' dots are also used across a travel lane to draw the drivers attention to the road. They are frequently used in this way to alert drivers to toll booths, school zones or other significant reduction of speed limit. They are normally only used in warm climates since snow plows usually remove them along with the snow. * Rumble strips are commonly used for the same purpose. A rumble strip can be a series of simple troughs, typically deep and wide, that is ground out of the asphalt. Other alternatives, similar to the Botts' dots, use raised strips, painted or glued to the surface. A specific form of raised strips using thermoplastic is called profile thermoplastic markings. The markings are created by fusing thermoplastic to the pavement and create alternating elevation and recession pattern. This can be done as inverted- profile markings or raised-profile markings. Inverted-profile markings are created by pressing a cog rolling over the markings while they are wet to make them corrugated. Raised-profile markings are created by extruding extra thickness of thermoplastic at a specific interval to create bumps. Raised- profile markings are sometime known as convex traffic lines. Uses of rumble strips can be across the travel direction (to warn of hazards ahead) or along the travel direction (to warn of hazards of not staying within a specific lane).' Their main way of function is creating a strong vibration when driven over that will alert a driver to various upcoming hazards both by sound and the physical vibration of the vehicle. * Reflective markers are used as travel lane dividers, to mark the central reservation (median) or to mark exit slip- roads. Incorporating a raised retro-reflective element, they are typically more visible at night and in inclement weather than standard road marking lines. The colour of markers varies depending on the country of use; freeways in the United States often use reflectors manufactured to appear white to drivers proceeding in the proper direction of travel, and appear red on the reverse to warn drivers that they are proceeding against the proper direction of travel, creating a danger of a head-on collision. Reflective markers are also referred to as raised pavement markers, road studs, and sometimes (generically) in the UK and Ireland as cat's eye, although this name refers to one particular brand of product. These markers can be used for other purposes such as marking the locations of fire hydrants (blue) or at gates of gated communities to indicate that emergency service vehicles have a code or device that allows them to open the gate. In the United Kingdom and elsewhere, raised markers are used to mark pedestrian crossings to assist the blind in crossing streets. In colder climates, reflective markers may be installed below ground using an elongated narrow triangle, cut into the road surface that allows the device to be installed below the road surface. Newer technology allows these to be placed above ground with snowplough-able rails that attempt to protect the reflective components from the snowplough blade. =Confusion with marks left by roadwork= Typical dash marks in the middle of the lane after dowel bar retrofit roadwork Sometimes the result of roadwork may leave visible marks on the pavements. An example is the dowel bar retrofit process to reinforce concrete slabs in order to extend the life of older concrete pavements. The completion of the process leaves a symmetrical pattern of dash marks on the roadway, as if there were an associated meaning to the pattern. When there are many of them along the roadway, motorists may interpret the marks as an unknown form of mechanical markers or strange road surface markings. When roads are under construction and the lanes are shifted laterally, those marks may interfere with temporary lane markings. As the marks from the dowel bar retrofit are not intended to be any form of road surface markings, the responsible agencies try to make these marks less visible to the motorists. Non-mechanical markersPaint= Paint, sometimes with additives such as retroreflective glass beads, is generally used to mark travel lanes. It is also used to mark spaces in parking lots or special purpose spaces for disabled parking, loading zones, or time-restricted parking areas. colours for these applications vary by locality. Paint is a low-cost marking and has been in widespread use since approximately the early 1950s. Paint consists of three main components: pigments, resins or binders, and water or solvents. Pigments are finely grounded materials that give out colours or block out the surface beneath it. They may contain other materials such as UV stabilizer, and fillers which bring out the colour pigments to the required level. Resins or binders are the glue of the paint to bind pigment and glass beads together to the road surface. The resins for the water-based paints are polyvinyl acetate latex, methyl methacrylate or acrylic resin. The resins for solvent- based paints are linseed or soya oils and alkyd resins. The pigments and resins are mixed with water for water-based paints and solvents for solvent- based paints so that they can be applied onto the road surface. Solvents that are use can be naphtha, toluene, methanol, methylene chloride, and acetone. Due to environmental concerns, some jurisdictions may have restrictions on solvent-based paints. :Pigment Yellow 10 is a common yellow colourant used for road marking on U.S. highways. Paint is usually applied right after the road has been paved. The road is marked commonly by a truck called a \\"striper.\\" These trucks contain hundreds of gallons of paint stored in huge drums which sit on the bed. The markings are controlled manually or automatically by the controller who sits on the bed. Paint is run through a series of hoses under air pressure and applied to the roadway surface along with the application of glass beads for retroreflectivity. After application, the paint dries fairly quickly. Sometimes the glass beads are mixed in with the paint and applied together, which is not a recommended method. The usual method is to use a separate gun to spray the glass beads on to the wet paint during the application. Painted symbols, such as turn-lane arrows or HOV lane markers, are applied manually using stencils. Painted markings usually last 9 to 36 months. There are some water-based paints that can be applied at double the level of thickness of typical latex paints. This technique can extend the life of the markings. =Stones= Stone traffic lane markings in Lisbon, Portugal In roads paved with setts (like in Belgian/Italian or Portuguese styles) or cobblestones, markings can be made with white blocks or stones, like marble or other light-coloured rocks. This kind of marking is long lasting, but could be slippery in rain or wet conditions unless surfaced with a matte or rough finish. =Thermoplastic= One of the most common types of road marking based on its balance between cost and performance longevity, thermoplastic binder systems are generally based on one of three core chemistries: hydrocarbons, rosin esters or maleic modified rosin esters (MMRE). Thermoplastic coatings are generally homogeneous dry mixes of binder resins, plasticizers, glass beads (or other optics), pigments, and fillers. Their use has increased over paints mainly due to the performance benefits of increased durability, retro- reflectivity, and a lack of VOC solvents. Thermoplastic markings are applied using specially designed vehicles. Usually, thermoplastic marking mode should apply with equipment called a road marking machine to coat traffic lines, and the road paint needs preheating by a device commonly called a preheater. The thermoplastic mix is heated in trucks to about before being fed to the application apparatus. This is often a screed box or ribbon gun. Immediately after the thermoplastic has been applied, glass beads are laid onto the hot material so that they embed before the plastic hardens. These beads provide initial retroreflection. As the marking wears during use and the initial beads are lost, the beads mixed with the binder are uncovered, providing long term retroreflectivity. These can be made exceptionally thick to produce a rumble strip effect. The thermoplastic marking coating sets quickly. The melt adhesion of a synthetic resin makes hot-melt paint adhere strongly to the road surface. Additives in the coating paint increases the coating plasticity, improving the anti-settling, anti-pollution, anti-tarnish. Thermoplastic marking paint is most commonly produced in yellow and white. The white marking paint mainly contains titanium white, zinc oxide, lithopone, while the yellow paint is mainly heat-yellowing lead. In warm climate areas, the thermoplastic markings can last three to six years. However, snowplows can damage the thermoplastics which would limit the usage in the cold climate areas. The filling materials of road paint can affect the mechanical strength, abrasion resistance and hue of the coating film. The particle size of the paint powder influences the flow, sedimentation, and the surface processing. Preformed thermoplastic Preformed thermoplastic markings ready to be applied to the road surface with a blow torch in Brussels, Belgium Preformed thermoplastic pavement markings (sometime called \\"tape\\", but not to be confused with preformed polymer tape) are thermoplastic cut into the final shapes by the manufacturers and ready to position onto an asphalt or concrete pavement surface. Preformed thermoplastics are put into place on the road surface and applied using a propane heat torch. Some models require heating the road surface prior to the placement of the preformed thermoplastics. These markings are used primarily because of their durability and cost-effective service life. Since the plastics are melted into the surface, they are not easily damaged by the snowplows. Typically, the preformed thermoplastic markings can last 3 to 6 years. The most common applications of preformed thermoplastic pavement markings are found at intersections as transverse markings such as stop lines, legends, crosswalks, arrows, bike lane symbols, and accessibility symbols. =Preformed polymer tape= Preformed polymer tapes used for crosswalk markings on a New York city street (notice tape failure on leftmost stripe) Commonly referred to as tape or cold plastic, this product is heavy- grade material with reflective beads embedded in the plastic. It is commonly used to mark crosswalks, stop bars, and traffic guidance such as turn lanes, HOV lanes, train crossings, pedestrian crossings, taxi lanes, bus lanes, and bike lanes. There are two ways to apply tape: * Overlay: The application being laid over the surface of the pavement. Using industrial-grade rubber cement, once the tape is combined with the pavement, it should last three years. Major obstacles to estimated life are snow-plows, salt, and mis-application. * Inlay: The tape physically becomes part of the asphalt. Using the heat generated in the paving process, road workers lay special tape on the asphalt in the hardening process, and rollers compress the two together. The life of the preformed polymer tapes can vary based on the applications. If applied correctly, they can last between 4 and 8 years. However, there have been cases where tape failures start soon after the installation. Conditions that may contribute to the tapes to peel off are the time of year of the installation that is too close to the winter, surface preparation, and workmanship. A technique that can be used to minimize the tape getting scraped off by snowplows is sandblasting a groove into the surface and fixing the tape onto this groove. This technique diminishes the advantage of low labor cost of the tapes. The preformed polymer tape markings are slippery when wet, especially in large sections such as crosswalks, and caution should be used due to poor wet traction. =Epoxy= Epoxy contains two parts which are a pigmented resin base and catalyst. The two parts are mixed in a specialized truck for epoxy marking application. The epoxy is then heated prior to spraying onto road surface. Retroreflective glass beads are applied using a separate bead gun behind the epoxy spray gun. Typically, epoxy markings last about 4 years. Epoxy has been in use since the late 1970s and has gained popularity over the 1990s as the technology has become more affordable and reliable. This material competes directly with plastic with respect to usage and cost. =Negative impacts to road surface= Road surface raveling and potholes found exclusively along pavement markings Non-mechanical markers are found to contribute to the deterioration of asphalt concrete road surface courses. The paint and tape markers can cause the road surface to crack, and in more severe cases, the markers contribute to road surface raveling (a process in which the aggregate particles are dislodged from the road surface, causing the surface texture to become deeply pitted and very rough) or potholes. This type of surface damage can be found exclusively underneath the pavement markings such as lane markings and turn-lane arrows. There is no definitive explanation of the relationship between pavement markings and surface deterioration, but there are several hypotheses. One is that water vapor may have been trapped underneath the road surface markings, causing the de-bonding of asphalt binder from the aggregate materials. Another hypothesis is that the reflectivity of the markings may create differences in solar heating and thermal expansion strains between the areas with and without markings. Small flaws caused by differential strains may be combined into longitudinal cracks along the markings. There are certain surface treatments that can make the road surface less susceptible to this type of distresses, such as slurry seals and stone mastic asphalt. = Glass beads = Incident light is refracted within glass beads on road surfaces and reflected into the driver's field of view. Glass beads composed of soda lime glass are essential for providing retroreflectivity in many kinds of road markings. Retroreflectivity occurs when incident light from vehicles is refracted within glass beads that are imbedded in road markings and then reflected back into the driver's field of view. In the United States, the demand for glass beads has led to importing from countries using outdated manufacturing regulations and techniques. These techniques include the use of heavy metals such as arsenic, antimony, and lead during the manufacturing process as decolourizing and fining agents. It has been found that the heavy metals become incorporated into the bead's glass matrix and may leach under environmental conditions that roads experience. Abrasion may dislodge these beads from the road marking itself, and the reaction of these beads with an aqueous environment vastly accelerates their decomposition and heavy metal release. During both routine road marking removal and harsh environmental conditions, these glass beads can degrade and leach incorporated heavy metals. There are other, non-toxic metals that can achieve the same results. These may include zirconium, tungsten, titanium, and barium. Road marking technique Thermoplastic road marking paint is a solid powder at room temperature. The thermoplastic paint is melted in a specialized machine called a thermoplastic heater-mixer, before being transferred into the paint tank of a marker. Larger marking machines may have internal heater- mixers. The molten coating is introduced into an insulated marking bucket. The marking bucket leads to a marking shoe that applies the material. Moving the shoe forward pulls a thin layer of paint onto the road. The thickness of this layer is controlled by the gap between the marking shoe and the road. A specialized attachment can spread an even layer of glass beads onto the paint as it is deposited. = Machine marking types = Air spray is a method of marking that uses compressed air to spray the paint onto the road surface. The finely atomized paint produces a thin and smooth layer, but the rebounding air flow causes significant paint scattering. This produces somewhat sloppy markings. High-pressure airless spraying uses a high-pressure airless pump to spray the paint. The atomized paint is not so fine and smooth as air spray, but there is no high speed air flow to scatter any rebounding paint. The marked lines are neat. This method can apply paints of high viscosity, and apply relatively thick layers in a single pass. = Auxiliary equipment = Other equipment is often used with road marking machines. The main auxiliary equipment includes thermoplastic paint pre-heaters, hand-push pre-markers and road marking removers. Thermoplastic paint pre-heater is used to melt the solid powder coating into a viscous liquid, providing a steady supply of paint to the marking machine. Pre-markers are used to draw a field sketch in advance to avoid faulty marking. Road marking removers are used to remove old or incorrect markings. Large self-propelled machines usually do not need any support equipment, as equivalent functionality is built in. Temporary markers Traffic cones are sometimes used to separate High-occupancy vehicle lanes from regular traffic lanes. They are also used in areas where lanes are used at different times for travel in both directions. These cones have shafts that drop into holes in the road surface. A good example of this type of use was the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco, before they switched to a moveable barrier system. Removable tapes can also be used in road construction sites as temporary markers. The tapes can be placed to shift the lanes and black tapes can be used to temporarily blackout the existing markings. At the end of the constructions or within 6 months, the tapes can be pulled out off the surface without using heat, solvents, or machines. Country specific informationThe Americas= Almost all countries in North and South America have solid and intermittent yellow lines separating traffic directions. However, Chile and Argentina have intermittent white lines separating traffic when overtaking is permitted from both directions, and solid yellow lines when overtaking is prohibited from both directions; when overtaking is permitted from only one direction, such countries separate traffic with a combination of white and yellow lines. Canada Yellow lines are used to separate traffic moving in opposite directions, and white lines are used to separate traffic moving in the same direction, and on the shoulders of paved roads. On one-directional roads, a yellow line appears on the left shoulder, and a white line on the right shoulder. Passing rules are denoted by dashed lines as in the United States. In Ontario, it is legal to cross a single or double solid yellow line along a straight road and the vehicle is not within 30 metres of a bridge or railway crossing. Orange painted lines are sometimes used when the direction of the road is altered temporarily for construction projects. However, the colour scheme was reversed before 1971, when white was formerly used to denote the separation of opposing traffic, and yellow lines, when used, to denote the separation of the paved road from the right-hand shoulder. Broken lines that are wider and closer together than regular broken lines are called continuity lines. Continuity lines on the left side of a lane denote that the lane is about to end and that motorists must soon merge left. Continuity lines on the right mean that the lane will continue, but traffic may merge into it ahead. In some areas, reflective markers (cat's eyes) recessed into the pavement are used, especially approaching curves in the road. A number of provinces have pavement marking test areas on major roads, to evaluate new pavement markings in relation to existing markings. In Ontario, a well-known location is the eastbound lanes of Highway 401 near Belleville. Other test sites are located on the westbound lanes on Highway 417, east of Ottawa, Highway 60 West of Renfrew, Highway 28 east of Bancroft, Highway 400 North of Honey Harbour and on Highway 37, South of Tweed. Pavement marking manufacturers from around the world supply a variety of materials for these sites to have their products evaluated and approved for use on provincial highways. Other provinces with road marking test areas include Quebec, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia. Quebec's is outside of Montreal on Autoroute 40; in New Brunswick, the area is outside of Fredericton on Highway 2; Nova Scotia's test area is north of Halifax on Highway 102. United States alt=An old photograph of a bend in a road surrounded by trees and power poles. There are wooden guardrails on either side of the road, with a white-painted center line separating the two lanes of traffic. Two old cars are approaching the curve which also has arrows to denote the direction of traffic. In the United States, the first documented use of a painted center line was in 1911 along Trenton's River Road in Wayne County, Michigan. According to the state of Michigan, the idea of using a painted center line was conceived in 1911 by Edward N. Hines, the chairman of the Wayne County, Michigan, Board of Roads, after watching a leaky milk wagon leave a white trail along a road. Hines was the fifth recipient of the George S. Bartlett Award for Highway Progress, and was inducted posthumously in 1972 into the Michigan Transportation Hall of Honor for his innovation, and was honored in 2011 with the first Paul Mijksenaar Design for Function Award. In 1917, the idea of using painted center lines on rural state highways was conceived and/or put into action in at least three states (Michigan, Oregon, and California), apparently completely independent of one another. At some point in 1917, a white highway center line was painted along \\"Dead Man's Curve\\" on what is now County Road 492 in Marquette County, Michigan, under the direction of Kenneth Ingalls Sawyer, who served as engineer-superintendent of the Marquette County Road Commission. Sawyer was inducted posthumously into the Michigan Transportation Hall of Honor in 1973. In Oregon in April 1917, a yellow center line was painted down the center of the Columbia River Highway, between Crown Point and Multnomah Falls, at the direction of Multnomah County Sheriff's Deputy Peter Rexford. Later in 1917, the same line was continued west of Crown Point. Rexford first conceived the idea of a yellow center line in early 1917 while riding on a bus from Salem, Oregon on a dark and rainy night, and advocated it as a safety measure on the Columbia River Highway, which Rexford patrolled as a traffic officer. When Multnomah County declined to fund the project, Rexford's boss, Chief Deputy Martin T. Pratt (later elected Sheriff), paid for the paint out of his own pocket so that the center line could be painted. Rexford later described the April 1917 line as the \\"first yellow center line ever painted on pavement\\" in the United States. An article published in The Oregonian upon Rexford's retirement claimed that a contest with a $10,000 reward was once held to determine the originator of the highway center line, but the contest was scrapped when information from Europe revealed that ancient civilizations had used white bricks to mark the center lines of their streets. In the fall of 1917, Dr. June McCarroll of Indio, California developed the idea of white center lines and began advocating for their use, after she was run off the road by a truck while driving along a highway that would later be incorporated into U.S. Route 99. Dr. McCarroll soon communicated her idea to the local chamber of commerce and the Riverside County Board of Supervisors, with no success. She then took it upon herself to hand-paint a white stripe down the middle of the road, thus establishing the actual width of the lane to prevent similar accidents. In 2002, a portion of Interstate 10 was designated and signed as \\"The Doctor June McCarroll Memorial Freeway\\" in her honor. The question of which colour to use for highway center lines (dividing opposing traffic) in the United States was the subject of considerable debate and changing standards over a period of several decades. It was the single most controversial and most heavily debated issue resolved by the promulgation of the 1948 edition of the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD), which mandated white as the standard colour of center lines nationwide. The only exceptions to this standard were for double center lines on multi-lane highways and for center lines in no-passing zones, where yellow was recommended but not mandatory. By November 1954, 47 of the 48 states had adopted white as their standard colour for highway centerlines, with Oregon being the last holdout to use yellow. In 1958, the U.S. Bureau of Public Roads adopted white as the standard colour for the new interstate highway system. The 1961 edition of the MUTCD mandated the use of yellow for the two specific exceptions where yellow had been previously recommended but not required, and concurrently banned white in those contexts. The drafters of the 1961 MUTCD gave three reasons for the change: \\"(1) It contrasts with the normal white center or lane lines and thus gives emphasis to the hazard; (2) Yellow has been accepted as a symbolic warning color in signs and signals; and (3) It is consistent with the standard for no-passing-zone markings approved by the American Association of State Highway Officials and is in use in more than two-thirds of the States for barrier lines.\\" The 1971 edition of the MUTCD mandated yellow as the standard colour of all center lines on all roads and highways in all contexts, and banned the use of white. The point was to establish a consistent colour code in pavement markings: from now on, yellow would always delineate opposing traffic flows and white would always delineate traffic flowing in the same direction. The changeover to the 1971 MUTCD standards took place between 1971 and 1975, with most repainting completed by the end of 1973, so for two years drivers still had to use the old and new. One odd exception was that white was still allowed as the left edge line color on the leftmost lane (closest to the median) on divided highways. The 1973 edition of the MUTCD fixed this by mandating yellow for left edge lines on divided highways. The major downside to the MUTCD white-yellow system is that yellow has slightly less contrast than white, especially at night, so for maximum contrast, bright yellow‚Äîand highly toxic‚Äîlead chromate was used to paint yellow lines through the end of the 20th century. As a result, U.S. transportation workers must take special precautions when disturbing or removing yellow lane markings. In 2002, the Texas A&M; Transportation Institute researched the viability of converting from yellow to white center lines for the Transportation Research Board. The researchers conducted a survey and discovered that 75% of American drivers associate dashed yellow center lines with dividing opposing traffic; this number rises to 85% for solid center lines. These findings implied that any conversion to white would require an enormously expensive driver education program on top of the cost of repainting center lines, and therefore the Texas researchers advised against conversion. A typical stretch of Valencia Boulevard in Valencia, California, where the lanes are marked only by Botts' dots. In the U.S., the type, placement, and graphic standards of traffic signs, and road surfaces are legally regulated‚Äîthe Federal Highway Administration's Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices is the standard, although each state produces its own manual based upon the Federal manual. In some areas, such as Colorado and Florida, black material is applied on the surface before a shorter white line is painted. This improves the contrast of the marking against \\"white\\" pavements, such as concrete or faded asphalt. In California, Botts' dots were commonly used to mark lanes on most freeways from the mid-1960s to the mid-2010s (when the state began transition back to painted lines to divide lanes). Many California cities also use Botts' dots on some (or all) major arterial roads. The notable exception is the city of Los Angeles which only uses paint. In California and Nevada, Botts' dots when present are usually the lines, and no paint is used for additional markings. Exceptions include: freeways built from white concrete where painted stripes are added to make the lanes more visible through sun glare, freeways built so wide that the risk of drifting out of lane is minimal (e.g., Interstate 5 in the Central Valley), and freeways in areas where it snows in the winter (since the snowplows would scrape off the Botts' dots). In general, single broken lines mean passing or lane changing is allowed, single solid white lines mean lane changing is discouraged or prohibited, and double solid white lines mean it is prohibited, as it often is in tunnels. On two-lane roads, a single broken center line means that passing is allowed in either direction, a double solid center line means passing is prohibited in both directions, and the combination of a solid line with a broken line means that passing is allowed only from the side with the broken line and prohibited from the side with the solid line. The solid white line on the right side is called the 'fog line' used to help cars stay in their lane during foggy conditions and help pedestrians stay off the road. Marked crosswalks are indicated at a minimum by a pair of white lines. On major boulevards, crosswalks are further highlighted by zebra stripes, which are large white rectangles in the crosswalk perpendicular to traffic. In order to maximize the longevity of zebra crossing stripes, they are usually applied to correspond with the portions of the lane on which the wheels of a car are not usually traveling, thereby reducing wear on the markings themselves. Pavement markings are used in addition to signs in the United States to designate regular and handicap parking spaces. Regular parking spaces are normally marked with white, although other colours are used. Handicap parking spaces are required to be located within a specified distance of an entrance. Blue markings are used to indicate the parking space is reserved for persons with a disabled parking permit. =Asia=Hong Kong Road markings in Hong Kong are basically identical with the United Kingdom, with longer dashed white lines to indicate lanes of opposing traffic, and shorter dashed white lines for lanes in the same direction. Solid double white lines are used to indicate that drivers are not permitted to change lanes. A solid white line with a broken white line indicates that crossing the line is allowed from the lane closer to the broken line. Double solid white lines are in place in all tunnels and underpasses. As in the UK, solid yellow lines are painted along the kerbside to indicate that no parking is allowed, with double solid yellow lines meaning no parking is allowed at any time. But unlike the UK loading and unloading are also prohibited in addition to parking.http://www.td.gov.hk/en/road_safety/road_users_code/index/chapter_5_for_all_drivers/where_not_to_stop_/ http://www.td.gov.hk/en/road_safety/road_users_code/index/chapter_8_the_language_of_the_road/signs_giving_orders_/index.html (Parking itself is prohibited on any street with lamp posts with or without the yellow markings on kerbside.)http://www.td.gov.hk/en/road_safety/road_users_code/index/chapter_5_for_all_drivers/where_not_to_park_/index.html Zig-zag lines are used on both ends of zebra crossings. Road studs are also used as in the UK. Japan Workers applying crosswalk road surface markings in the Tokyo area. In Japan, white always separates traffic in the same direction or indicates traffic in the same direction can use a buffered area that is striped in crosshatch patterns such as at right turns on two-way roads since Japan is a country that has left-side driving. White is also used on divided expressways with a solid raised center divider. Two-lane expressways where poles are the only physical barrier between opposing directions of travel always have yellow either side of the row of poles, and white is between the yellow striping and the poles. White is also used to denote passing allowed on other two-lane roads. Yellow indicates no passing is allowed. On all roads, yellow stripes are always solid. On expressways where there are many sharp turns and curves, seen especially in the largest cities, a yellow line indicates no passing between lanes, as follows: * Solid yellow beside solid white: no entry permitted from the lane the stripe is next to, but passing is permitted with caution. * Solid yellow beside broken white: passing is permitted from the side with the broken white line, but not from the side with the yellow line. * Solid yellow line alone: passing prohibited from either lane, used on very tight curves and in tunnels. Other markings include in the cities, destination and exit names painted in the lanes, which is done due to the very close proximity of exits, where in many cases it would be impractical to put up many overhead signs, although these are often seen approaching exits, a curved or slanted arrow points to the side of the expressway the exit will be on. A straight arrow following characters indicates the destination of the expressway. Where a solid white line appears between lanes, passing is generally allowed but with caution. =Europe= In general European countries follow the Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals, which describes what road signs and road markings shall look like. The convention has some flexibility so road markings vary somewhat between the countries. Most European countries reserve white for routine lane markings of any kind. Yellow is used to mark forbidden parking, such as on bus stops. However, for example Norway has yellow markings separating traffic directions. Many countries use yellow, orange, or red to indicate when lanes are being shifted temporarily to make room for construction projects. In Croatia, in addition to serving as temporary signage, yellow lines are used permanently to distinguish lanes and turn directions dedicated to public transport. In France on highways the outside lines are interrupted at a regular distance which allows drivers and police to check distance between moving vehicles. In Israel, white lines are used to separate both traffic driving in the same direction and in opposite directions, while yellow lines are used to mark the shoulder of the road. In the Netherlands, Germany, Sweden, and the UK, so- called \\"naked roads\\" have been trialed, whereby all visible road markings, kerbs, traffic lights, and signs are removed, on urban roads. When this was tested in Seend, a village in the UK county of Wiltshire in 2005, the county council reported that accidents fell by a third, with motorists' speed falling by an average of 5%. It has been suggested that naked roads force drivers to make eye contact with other road users, and that it is this nonverbal communication that is responsible for the reduction of accidents. Other have suggested that road markings, especially with middle marker, make the road look like a main road, triggering faster and more relaxed driving, while no marking makes the road look like a lower quality road. It is an experience from the introduction of marking, that at least on narrow roads and in curves, middle lines help make drivers stay on their side when meeting, and therefore reducing meeting accidents. Note that the 2005 experiment was on urban roads. In Sweden, local streets generally have no marking. Netherlands In the Netherlands all general lines are white, while yellow lines are used to mark forbidden stopping (solid yellow), forbidden parking (broken yellow) and for temporarily lining at construction projects. Shoulder lines are generally interrupted outside built-up area to make the driver be aware the presence of crossing bicycles and pedestrians, driveways and stopping cars. Wider roads sometimes have a single, but in most cases have a double centre line. Interrupted center lines mean overtaking is allowed, a solid line means overtaking is not allowed, depending on which side of a double line is solid. Smaller roads and roads where bicycles are allowed generally do not have center lines, and many country roads have no lines at all. Sometimes there is a center line only in sharp curves. Shoulder lines on expressways and motorways are solid to imply the general absence of crossing traffic and residential driveways, as well as the disallowance of leaving the road on places other than specified exits. Expressways always have double centre lines. Exit and acceleration lanes are separated by 'block marking'. Furthermore, several traffic signs are painted on the road, such as speed limits and warning sings. Norway In Norway, yellow lines are used to separate traffic moving in opposite directions and on the left shoulders of paved roads, and white lines are used to separate traffic moving in the same direction, and on the right shoulders of paved roads. On roads narrower than , the centerline is removed, and the shoulder lines are broken. Short, broken lines means passing is allowed, long, broken lines means passing is allowed but dangerous, and a double yellow line means passing is forbidden. Roads with speed limits below that indicate that passing is allowed but dangerous have a very short yellow line instead of a long one. On motorways, the left shoulder is a yellow line, like in the US. Most other European countries use white lines for all these types of lines. United Kingdom A box junction in London, pictured from atop the Monument in 1969 In the UK, the first \\"white line\\" road markings appeared on a number of dangerous bends on the London- Folkestone road at Ashford, Kent, in 1914. In England, the idea of painting a centre white line was first experimented with in 1921 in Sutton Coldfield, Birmingham. Following complaints by residents over reckless driving and several collisions, the Sutton Coldfield Corporation decided to paint the line on Maney Corner in the area of Maney. In 1971, a correspondent for the Sutton Coldfield News wrote an article in the newspaper recalling the event. During the World War II the Pedestrians Association lobbied for the government to make it safer for pedestrians to walk during the black out. As a result, white lines were painted on the sides of the road and pedestrians were allowed to use a small torch. In the UK, the first \\"white line\\" road markings appeared on a number of dangerous bends on the London-Folkestone road at Ashford, Kent, in 1914, and during the 1920s the rise of painted lines on UK roads grew dramatically. In 1926 official guidelines were issued by the Ministry of Transport that defined where and how white lines on roads should be used. A broken white line in the direction of travel, where the gaps are longer than the painted lines, indicates the centre of the road and that there are no hazards specific to the design and layout of the road, i.e. no turnings, sharp bends ahead etc. A broken white line in which the gaps are shorter than the painted lines indicates an upcoming hazard. Road mark in London The Ministry of Transport experimented with double-line road markings for the first time on sections of the A20 and A3 during Easter in 1957. The markings were cautionary, and had no legal status at that time, but motorists were advised that ignoring them could weigh heavily against someone involved in an accident in their vicinity. Further, \\"it is in order, if safe to do so, to cross the lines only when the broken one is on your side. It is not in order to cross when the solid line is on your side or to park there.\\" Despite the instruction about parking, it was observed that nine bus stops were located inside prohibited parking areas. A double solid white line indicates that the line may not be crossed, overtaking is permitted if it can be performed safely without crossing the line. Solid lines can be crossed in certain specific conditions (entering premises, overtaking a stationary vehicle, overtaking a vehicle, pedal cycle or horse travelling at less than 10 mph, or when directed to do so by a police officer). A solid white line with a broken white line parallel to it indicates that crossing the line is allowed for traffic in one direction (the side closest to the broken line) and not the other. Solid white lines are also used to mark the outer edges of a road. A double yellow line (commonly known as just a \\"Double Yellow\\") next to the kerb means that no parking is allowed at any time, whilst a single yellow line is used in conjunction with signs to denote that parking is restricted at certain times. Double and single red lines mean that stopping is not allowed at any time or between certain times respectively. On many roads in the UK, retro-reflective road studs, including those known as \\"cat's eyes\\" when referring to the Halifax type road stud, are placed in the road. These devices reflect the light from a car's headlights back towards the driver in order to highlight features of the road in poor visibility or at night. The colour of road studs differs according to their location. Those defining the division between lanes are white, red road studs are placed along the hard shoulder of motorways, dual carriageways and other roads to mark the left-hand edge of a running lane; and orange road studs are placed along the edge of the central reservation. Green road studs denote slip roads at grade-separated junctions and also road-side lay-bys. Comprehensive information about highway markings in the UK can be found in the Highway Code and on the gov.uk website. Russia In Russia, yellow lines may be used instead of white lines to separate oncoming traffic flows. They were authorized only recently, in 2018, and were first painted on a short stretch of federal highway A138 in Murmansk Oblast.https://iz.ru/727875/anzhelina-grigorian/na-rossiiskikh-dorogakh- poiavilas-zheltaia-razmetka Broken yellow lines at the edge of the road mean that you cannot park, but can stop for up to 5 minutes, or more if that is needed to load and unload people or cargo. A solid yellow line on the edge of the road denotes that stopping is prohibited. =Oceania= Australia  In Australia, white lines are generally used both to separate traffic flowing in the same direction and traffic flowing in opposite directions. Double solid white center-lines may not be crossed under any circumstances, unless avoiding an obstruction. Dashed lines may be crossed for overtaking, changing lanes or turning, and also in the case of double-line markings provided the dashed line is on your side of the markings. For this reason, dashed lines are usually used to mark multiple lanes traveling in the one direction. Yellow lines along road edges are used nationally to indicate \\"No Standing\\" areas not otherwise marked by signs. Solid white lines are also used to indicate kerbside parking, pedestrian and bicycle lanes, and other kerbside features. Yellow line markings are also used in areas that receive regular annual snowfall to provide contrast. Double-line markings are used to separate traffic flowing in opposite directions on busy roads. Solid white lines are used to mark an intersection that a driver must stop at before entering whilst obeying all right-of-way laws. Dashed white lines are used to mark an intersection at which a driver must give way. Dashed white lines are also commonly used to indicate turns in intersections and to indicate intersections where a diamond turn is possible (intersections in which two cars traveling in opposite directions turn to the same direction-of-travel as each other without coming into contact). Materials used are waterborne paint, thermoplastics, and cold applied plastic (PMMA), all with glass bead. Bead is generally 1mm for longitudinal marking. Currently moving to performance specified contracts with the primary performance indicator being retro-reflectivity measured with geometry instruments. Intervention levels vary generally from 100 to 150 mcd/lux/m2 (from 0.029 to 0.044 foot-lamberts). File:Yellow Lines used to contrast snow.pngIn areas with high levels of snow, such as Snowy Mountains NSW (where this picture was taken), yellow lines are used to contrast the white snow. The markers on the side of the road are also taller than other markers in NSW and pink, in order to increase visibility in snowy weather File:Where white meets yellow.pngThe bridge over the Thredbo River. One of the points in which the white lines become yellow as the amount of snowfall increases New Zealand Although New Zealand follows the convention of a solid yellow line to indicate no passing on roads with two-way traffic, it uses dashed white lines with a gap to indicate when passing against opposing traffic is allowed on two-lane roads and shorter ones to separate lanes going in the same direction. The New Zealand convention followed the USA MUTCD convention common between 1961 and the early 1970s.

In the West, where the fall of the Western Roman Empire was underway, its holders became puppets of a succession of barbarian kings. In the East, it began to assume autocratic trappings. Eugenius Arbogast, Valentinian II's general-in- chief, murdered him in May 392, and replaced him with a puppet Emperor, Eugenius, a former rhetorician. Eugenius was overthrown two years later by Theodosius I (see below), Valentinian II's brother-in-law. * Eugenius (\\"Imp. Caesar Flavius Eugenius P.F. Aug.\\"; b. Flavius Eugenius), 392-4\\\\. Theodosian dynastyTheodosius= Much as the Valentinianic dynasty was loosely connected to the Constantinian dynasty by marriage, the Theodosian dynasty was loosely connected to the Valentinian; the first Theodosian Emperor, Theodosius I (historically known as \\"the Great\\") was son-in-law of Valentinian I. Although he was a Hispano-Roman of military background, like Valentinian, he was no \\"Barracks Emperor\\"; he was lawfully and voluntarily elevated to the purple in the East by the reigning Emperor Gratian, his half-brother-in-law, on January 19, 379. He abolished paganism entirely and made Christianity the official religion of the Empire in 391, overthrew Arbogast and his puppet Emperor, Eugenius, in the West in 394, and was the last Emperor to rule both East and West. *Theodosius I (\\"Imp. Caesar Flavius Theodosius P.F. Aug.\\"; b. Flavius Theodosius), 379-5 =Final division of the Roman Empire in \\"East\\" and \\"West\\"= After Theodosius's death in 395, the Empire was permanently divided into East and West by his 17-year-old and 10-year-old sons, Arcadius and Honorius, respectively. Emperors in the East *Arcadius (\\"Imp. Caesar Flavius Arcadius P.F. Aug.\\"; b. Flavius Arcadius), 395-408 *Theodosius II (\\"Imp. Caesar Flavius Theodosius Arcadius P.F. Aug.\\"; b.

Flavius Marcianus), 450-7 ‚Äî Marcian is the first Emperor to be honored as a saint (by the Orthodox Church); his feast day (together with that of his wife, St. Pulcheria) is Feb. 17. Emperors in the West By the time the Visigoths under their king Alaric entered Italy and sacked Rome in 410 - the first time a foreign army had set foot in Rome since 390 BC, some 800 years earlier - Rome had ceased to be capital of the Empire either in East or West (the capital in the East was Nicomedia from 286 to 330, and Constantinople from 330 onward; in the West it was Milan from 286 to 402, and Ravenna from 402 onward); indeed, by that point in history, the Bishop of Rome was one of the few senior Ecclesiastical or Imperial officials in the Roman Empire to actually reside in Rome. *Honorius (\\"Imp. Caesar Flavius Honorius P.F. Aug.\\"; b. Flavius Honorius), 395-423 **Constantius III (\\"Imp. Caesar Flavius Constantius P.F. Aug.\\"; b. Flavius Constantius), 421 *Valentinian III (\\"Imp. Caesar Flavius Placidius Valentinianus P.F. Aug.\\"; b. Flavius Placidius Valentinianus), 425-55 =Dynastic Relationships= Theodosius I married twice; first to Aelia Flaccilla, who bore him two sons (Arcadius and Honorius), and second to Galla (daughter of Valentinian I by his second wife Justina, widow of Magnentius), who bore him a daughter (Galla Placidia). Arcadius's wife Aelia Eudoxia bore him a daughter (St. Pulcheria) and a son (Theodosius II), who became Emperor at age seven. After Theodosius II's death, his sister Pulcheria married Marcian, a Thracian soldier of common stock. Constantius III married Arcadius's and Honorius's sister Galla Placidia, and she bore him a son, Valentinian III. Valentinian III's wife Licinia Eudoxia (who after his death married Petronius Maximus, see below) bore him a daughter, Placidia, who married Olybrius (see below). After the Theodosian DynastyIn the West= The wealthy senator Petronius Maximus, who succeeded Valentinian III, had attempted to secure his position by marrying Valentinian's widow, Licinia Eudoxia. The final collapse of the Empire in the West was marked by increasingly ineffectual puppet Emperors dominated by their Germanic masters of the soldiers. The most pointed example of this is the Suebian general Ricimer, who became a \\"Shadow Emperor\\" by deposing Avitus, installing and subsequently deposing (and murdering) Majorian, installing (and possibly subsequently murdering) Libius Severus, ruling the Empire himself during an eighteen-month interregnum, deposing and killing Anthemius, and installing Olybrius. His position as \\"Shadow Emperor\\" was in turn held by his nephew Gundobad and Orestes; Odoacer simply overthrew Orestes's puppet Emperor, Romulus Augustus, in 476 and ruled Italy as nominal subordinate of the Emperor-in-exile, Julius Nepos, who continued to reign in Dalmatia until 480. *Petronius Maximus (\\"Imp. Caesar Petronius Maximus P.F. Aug.\\"; b. Petronius Maximus), 455 *Avitus (\\"Imp. Caesar Flavius Eparchius Avitus P.F. Aug.\\"; b. Flavius Eparchius Avitus), 455‚Äì456 *Majorian (\\"Imp.

Iulius Nepos), 474‚Äì475 (continued to rule in exile until 480) *Romulus \\"Augustulus\\" (\\"Imp. Caesar Flavius Romulus P.F. Aug.\\"; b. Flavius Romulus), 475‚Äì476 Petronius Maximus was killed trying to flee Rome - presently under imminent threat of attack by Geiseric's Vandals - eleven weeks after donning the purple; Rome was plundered (\\"Vandalised\\") but spared a full- fledged sacking due in large part to the intervention of the Bishop of Rome, Pope Leo I, who had previously averted an attack on Rome by Attila the Hun in 452. Petronius Maximus was succeeded by his master of the soldiers, Avitus, who was acclaimed at Tolosa with the backing of the Visigothic king, Theodoric II. Avitus was in turn overthrown (but not killed) by his own master of the soldiers, Ricimer, who was responsible for both the installation and removal of Majorian and of Libius Severus, the removal of Anthemius (installed as the Eastern Emperor's candidate), and the installation of Olybrius - husband of Valentinian III's daughter (and Petronius Maximus's stepdaughter) Placidia, and loosely a member of the Theodosian dynasty. Both Ricimer and Olybrius (who was never acknowledged and was considered a usurper by the Eastern Emperor) died in 472, and were replaced by the Burgundian prince Gundobad and his puppet Emperor Glycerius, a former court functionary. Glycerius was deposed (but not killed) by Julius Nepos, the candidate (and nephew-in-law) of the Eastern Emperor, who was in turn driven into exile in Dalmatia in 475 by his master of the soldiers, Orestes, who installed his own son Romulus \\"Augustulus\\" (\\"Little Augustus\\"). Orestes was killed and Romulus deposed (but not killed) by Odoacer in 476, and Julius Nepos continued to reign as Emperor- in-exile until his death in 480 (the Eastern Emperor did not recognise Romulus Augustulus and considered him a usurper). :For rulers of Italy after Romulus \\"Augustulus\\" and Julius Nepos, see list of barbarian kings. :For Roman Emperors in the West after Romulus \\"Augustulus\\" and Julius Nepos, see list of \\"Holy Roman Emperors\\". =The East: Leonine Dynasty= The Leonine dynasty was almost totally a marital one, conspicuous for its rather disorderly succession of Emperors. The first Leonine Emperor, the Dacian army officer Leo I (whose coronation is the first known to involve the Patriarch of Constantinople), came to power through the machinations of the late Marcian's Alan master of the soldiers, Aspar, who as a result of his barbarian birth and religious heterodoxy (Aspar as an Arian) was unable to don the purple for himself. The Leonine Emperors also mark the second time a female dynast directly influenced the Imperial succession by marriage: Zeno's widow Ariadne hand-picked Anastasius I to succeed her late husband and married him (cf. Marcian's accession to the purple by means of officially marrying the nun St. Pulcheria, Theodosius II's sister). Zeno was ruling in Constantinople during the \\"fall of Rome\\" in 476 (the actual events generally thought of as \\"ending\\" the Roman Empire in the West actually occurred at Ravenna), and both Odoacer and his over-thrower Theodoric of the Ostrogoths officially ruled Italy as Zeno's viceroys; this suzerainty was purely theoretical, however, and Imperial control of Italy was not actually reasserted until the conquests of Justinian I's strategos Belisarius in the 530s.

Flavius Anastasius), 491‚Äì518 =Dynastic Relationships= Leo I wife Verina bore him at least two daughters, one of whom married the son of Anthemius, whom Leo I installed as Emperor in the West in 467 (and whose daughter married the formidable \\"Shadow Emperor\\" Ricimer), and the other of whom was Ariadne, who married the Isaurian leader Tarasikodissa; Tarasikodissa was appointed master of the soldiers and adopted the name Zeno. Ariadne and Zeno had a son, Leo II, who succeeded his grandfather as Emperor in 474 (and was convinced by his mother and grandmother to elevate his father to co-Emperor); Leo II's death left his father sole Emperor in the East, producing the altogether curious spectacle of a grandson succeeding his grandfather without his father's predecease, and then in turn being succeeded by his own father. Zeno was temporarily displaced in Constantinople by Verina's brother (i.e., Leo I's brother-in-law and Leo II's great uncle-in-law) Basiliscus, but regained his position as emperor a year later. On his death, Ariadne married the court functionary Anastasius I, and thereby elevated him to Emperor by virtue of marrying the Empress. :For Byzantine emperors after Anastasius I, see list of \\"Byzantine Emperors\\".

Ovations were granted when war was not declared between enemies on the level of nations or states; when an enemy was considered basely inferior (e.g., slaves, pirates); or when the general conflict was resolved with little or no danger to the army itself. The general celebrating the ovation did not enter the city on a biga, a chariot pulled by two white horses, as generals celebrating triumphs did, but instead rode on horseback in the toga praetexta of a magistrate. The honoured general also wore a wreath of myrtle (sacred to Venus) upon his brow, rather than the triumphal wreath of laurel. The Roman Senate did not precede the general, nor did soldiers usually participate in the procession. Perhaps the most famous ovation in history is that which Marcus Licinius Crassus celebrated after his victory of the Third Servile War.

Allen played college football at Florida State University.  High school career  A native of Lake City, Florida, Allen attended Columbia High School, where he played linebacker and was an honor student as a senior. In his senior season, he recorded 159 tackles and 5.5 sacks, and also picked off four passes and returned three for scores. Allen was named third-team all-state Class 6A, and was looking forward to a scholarship offer by University of Florida in Gainesville, just down the Interstate 75 from Lake City. However, he was not recruited by the Gators, and eventually chose Florida State over Virginia Tech, South Carolina, and Clemson.  College career  After redshirting his first year in Tallahassee, Allen played all 12 games of the 1997 season as a back-up to Lamont Green and Deon Humphrey at strongside linebacker and on special teams. He finished fifth among FSU linebackers with 26 total tackles (10 solo). His season-best performance came in the 50‚Äì7 victory over Maryland, with five tackles, including one for loss. In his sophomore year, Allen played in 11 games and finished sixth on the team with 57 tackles (31 solo), including six for a loss of yardage and three quarterback sacks. Two of those came in the 26‚Äì14 win over in-state rival Miami (FL). His best game of the season, however, came in the 23‚Äì12 win over the Seminoles' other in-state rival, the Florida Gators. Allen was responsible for the only sack of Gators quarterback Doug Johnson, and added four tackles and two pass deflections, a performance for which he was named the Tomahawk Player of the Game by the coaching staff. As a junior, emerged as one of the top linebackers in the Atlantic Coast Conference. Starting all eleven games, he finished second on the team with 101 total tackles, behind only Tommy Polley and ahead of Bradley Jennings, which made them the first linebacker trio to lead the Seminoles in tackles since Daryl Bush, Derrick Brooks, and Sam Cowart in 1994. In six games, Allen had at least ten tackles, with a season-high 14 tackles in Florida State's regular season ending 30‚Äì23 win over Florida. Allen also made eight tackles for loss and broke up two passes, and ranked second on the team with five quarterback sacks, behind only Jamal Reynolds (7.0). He was named was named second team All-ACC. In his senior year, Allen tied Jennings for most tackles on the team with 102 on the season. He also accounted for six quarterback hurries, ten pass-breakups (second-best on the team behind Tay Cody's twelve), two fumble recoveries and also had an interception in the 37‚Äì3 win over Virginia.  Professional career  Allen was drafted in the third round (83rd overall) in the 2001 NFL Draft by the St. Louis Rams. He played three games during his rookie season, and was later allocated to the Houston Texans in the 2002 NFL Expansion Draft. However, he was released by the Texans before playing a game for the team. He was signed off waivers to the Carolina Panthers in 2002. He played mostly on special teams for the Panthers, and was part of the unit that ranked fifth in the NFL in 2003. He was released by the Panthers, and was signed to the Redskins on April 6, 2005. He was released by the Redskins in late 2005 due to a knee injury.  Post-playing career  Then Allen worked at Lyman High School. He worked as a Coach and American History Teacher at Lake Howell High School. He was recently selected as head coach for the Columbia High School Tigers in Lake City where he graduated from and played high school football.

The genre was popularized following the creation of Ensemble Aux Callebasses in (1955), which became Ensemble Nemours Jean-Baptiste In 1957. Compas is the main music of many countries such as Dominica and the French Antilles. This m√©ringue style is influential in part of Africa, the Caribbean, Portugal, France, part of Canada, South and North America.Peter Manuel, Musics of the Non-Western World, University Press 1988, p72-74 Etymology and characteristics In Creole, it is pronounced Konpa Dir√®k or Compas. The word \\"comp√°s\\" in Spanish means \\"beat\\" or \\"rhythm,\\" and one of the most distinctive characteristics of compas is the consistent pulsating beat tanbou, a trait common to many styles of Caribbean music. Compas Direct, literally means Direct beat. History Nemours Jean-Baptiste presented his \\"Ensemble Aux Calebasses\\" in 1955 (named after the club \\"Aux Calebasses\\" located at Carrefour, a western neighborhood of Port-au-Prince; Haiti's capital where the band used to perform on weekends). At the beginning (1955), Ensemble ‚ÄòAux Callebasses‚Äò Of Nemours Jean-Baptiste played rhythms such as Cuba's Guaracha/Cha Cha Cha, Haiti's Bannann Pouyak, Grenn Moudong, M√©ringue Lente etc. In 1957, Nemours Jean- Baptiste -with the assistance of conga player Kreudzer Duroseau ans accordionist Richard Duroseau- created Compas Direct which has its roots in Haitian traditional Meringue and the Vodou traditional rhythms. Its popularity took off likely due to the genre's ability to improvise and hold the rhythm section steady and the facility with which dancers could absorb, feel and express the new rhythm. Nemours Jean-Baptiste incorporated a lot of brass and, in 1958, the first electric guitar in Haitian urban dance music.All Music Guide, compas direct Compas is sung in Creole,Haiti, Guadeloupe, Cabo Verde and others English, Spanish, French, Portuguese, etc. Nemours' popularity grew in and out of the country. Its clean horn section was remarkable and the band featured m√©ringue tunes that gained instant popularity. For example, in Martinique, several music groups: Ensemble Abricot (bienvenue, festival compas), les djoubap's (Isabelle), combo jazz (electronique compas, pa gadem sou cote), Georges Plonquitte (fr) (vini dance compas direct), etc. have all within a year conquered the public with the many tunes or compositions of Nemours.Dominique Janvier, introduction on Nemour' album cover 1980, long vie to Nemours Later Nemours became a favorite of Dominican president, Joaqu√≠n Balaguer who often contracted the band.Tambour Battant p85 This is why hits like \\"Ti Carole\\", \\"Chagrin d'amour\\" featured by known Dominican stars Luis Miguel and others are also sung in Spanish. In the early 1960s Nemours and the Sicot Brothers from Haiti would frequently tour the Caribbean, especially Curaceo, Aruba, Saint Lucia, Dominica and mostly the French Islands of Martinique & Guadeloupe to spread the seed of the m√©ringue- Compas Direct and Cadence Rampa.All Music Guide 1994, compas direct Webert Sicot, Haiti's best saxophone player and the originator of ‚ÄúCadence Rampa‚Äù , recorded three LPs albums with French Antilles producers: two with \\"Celini disques\\" in Guadeloupe and one with \\"Balthazar\\" in Martinique. Haitian compas or cadence bands were asked to integrate Antillean musicians. Consequently, the leading \\"Les Guais Troubadours\\", with influential singer \\"Louis Lahens\\" along other bands, played a very important role in the schooling of Antilleans to the m√©ringue Compas Direct or Cadence Rampa music style. Almost all existing Haitian compas bands have toured these Islands that have since adopted the music and the dance of the m√©ringue. =Dance style= The dance-style that accompanied compas in 1957, is a two-step dance called Carr√© (square) introduced by Nemours Jean- Baptiste in 1962. As a m√©ringue, a ballroom dance, compas is danced in pairs. Sometimes partners dance holding each other tightly and romantically; in this case often most of the moves are made at the hips.Peter Manuel, Popular Musics of the Non-Western World, Oxford University Press, 1988: (Nemours Jean- Bapstiste adapted the m√©ringue to mambo-style big-band instrumentation and rhythmic patterns, coining the term Compas Direct for his innovation. For his part, Webert Sicot is credited with popularizing the rubric ‚ÄúCadence Rampa‚Äù for his similarly modernized meringue) Mini-jazz or small bands During and after the US occupation, the word jazz has become synonymous with music bands in Haiti. So the mini-jazz is a reduced m√©ringue-compas band. The movement started in the mid-1960s when young small neighborhood bands played Compas Direct featuring paired electric guitars, electric bass, drum set-conga- timbales and 2 cowbells, 1 for the timbales and the other to be played with the floor tom ; some use an alto sax or a full horn section, others use a keyboard, accordionPeter Manuel, Jocelyne Guilbault and many more have spoken about the mini-jazz in their books This trend, launched by Shleu-Shleu after 1965, came to include a number of groups from Port-au-Prince neighbourhoods, especially the suburb of P√©tion-Ville. Les Corvington, Tabou Combo, Les Difficiles, Les Loups Noirs, Les Fr√®res D√©Jean, Les Fantaisistes de Carrefour, Bossa Combo and Les Ambassadeurs (among others) formed the core of this middle-class popular music movement. From 1968 to the 1970s prominent bands like Bossa Combo, Volo Volo de Boston, Les Shleu-Shleu, Les Ambassadeurs, Les Vickings, Les Fantaisistes, Les Loups Noirs, Les Freres Dejean, Les Difficiles, Les Gypsies and mostly the majestic Tabou Combo have exerted a dominance on the Caribbean and many places in Europe and South America musical scene. For example, Tabou Combo has remained on the Paris hit parade for weeks with its \\"New York City\\" hit. Tabou did fill New York Central park in the same period.AMG 1994 These young musicians were critical in the creation of new technics that contribute to the fanciness of the style. Although Raymond Gaspard (Nemours) had already started it in the 1950s, however, guitar players such as Michel Corvington (Les Corvington), Henry Celestin (founder of Les Difficiles de P√©tion Ville), Robert Martino (Les Difficiles/Gypsies/Scorpio/Topvice...), Dadou Pasket (Tabou combo/Magnum Band), Jean Claude Jean (Tabou Combo/Super Star...), Serge Rosenthal (Shleu- Shleu), Hans Felix, (Les Ambassadeurs/Volo Volo de Boston), Ricardo/Tiplum (Les Ambassadeurs) Claude Marcellin (Les Difficiles/D.P. Express/Z√®kl√®...), Police Nozile (Les Fr√®res D√©jean/D.P. Express...) and many more have created intricate mostly rhythmic guitar styles that constitute a strong distinguishable feature of the m√©ringue. Compas in the world Throughout the world many popular artists have featured compas tunes. For instance, Carlos Santana-foo foo, Wyclef Jean-several CDs, Tabou combo-essentiall, French Antilles kassav-most CDs, Cabo Verdean Tito Paris-danca mi Creola + several tunes, Dominican Juan Luis Guerra-several tunes of Nemours, Oscar de Leon and Columbian kike Harvey-\\"guede zaina\\", Wilfrido Vargas and Bonny Cepeda - many tunes of DP Express and Tabou Combo, Don Omar-ayer la vi, danza kuduro, and other reggaeton artists like Dady Yankee, Los Salvajes-a quien le toco, toco, etc. African artists, Finally, artists from Martinique and Guadeloupe, Dominica, and other places have become master of the compas styles. M√©ringue-compas or cadence and its derivatives The m√©ringue-compas, deeply rooted in many countries, has been a strong influence in Caribbean islands. =Zouk= Zouk was a brief experiment; an attempt to develop a proper local music that should lessen or even eradicate the m√©ringue-kadans or compas influence from the French Antilles. When the MIDI technology came out, Kassav' used it fully, creating new sound in both their fast zouk b√©ton and kompa. The Antilleans were all over with zouk but as other bands from the Caribbean and Africa added the MIDI technology to their music, people got used to it. Because it was a jump up beat, the fast zouk b√©ton faded away, and Antilleans continue to play and dance m√©ringue-cadence or compas.Peter Manuel, Popular Musics of the Non-Western World, Oxford University Press, 1988. =Coladeira= There is a strong compas influence in Cape Verdean music.In the 1960s the coladeira emerged as a more lively, upbeat counterpart to the morna The coladeira is performed in fast duple meter, accompanying informal pop-style couple dancing. its primary influences appear to be an obscure folk processional music by the same name, Afro-American commercial music, the morna, and most important, modern French Caribbean pop...more often it is played by a modern dance band, that is, with drums, bass, electric guitars, and the like. Peter Manuel, Popular Musics of the Non-Western World, p. 95. Oxford University Press, 1988. During the 1960s-1980s Haitian artists and bands such as Claudette & Ti Pierre, Tabou Combo and mostly Gesner Henry alias Coupe Cloue and the Dominican group Exile One were very popular in Africa. In addition, the French Antilles Kassav and other French Antillean musicians, whose main music is compas, toured Cabo island on various occasions. Many Cape Verdean artists feature compas. Talented Tito Paris dan√ßa mami Criola (1994) is a good example; this CD featured music close to Haiti Tabou Combo, Caribbean Sextet, Tropicana and French Antilles Kassav, etc. Cape Verdeans artists have been exposed to konpa in the US and France....Acculturation has been further promoted by the growth of overseas communities (especially in New England) whose population now exceeds that of Cape Verde itself (around 300,000). Peter Manuel, Popular Musics of the Non-Western World, p. 95. Oxford University Press, 1988. Today the new generation of Cape Verdean artists features a light compas close to Haitian and French Antillean. Until Haitian musicians could tour Cabo verde, the tittle compas promoted as zouk by French Antillean artists would not be popular. =Cadence-lypso= Webert Sicot, the originator of cadence known for his great virtuosity, mostly harmonic skills, was well appreciated in the Caribbean. This is why the term cadence was more popular than compas. Cadence-lypso is the Dominican kadans. Cadence and calypso were the two dominant styles in Dominica hence the name cadence-lypso. The great majority of the songs are either calypso, reggae and mostly cadence or compas. If there is any fusion it should not be significant enough to be listed on album or CD covers. Finally cadence-lypso is danced the same way as compas. Originally the word cadence or kadans was on album covers, whether grammacks or exile one. They featured calypso, reggae and mostly cadence: Grammacks: (kadans), banana (sweet kadans), ou pa bon, (kadans), ou pitit (kadans), reggae down, disco live (kadans) this same tune is categorized as zouk retro by Deejay Zak (midlay kadans 11/24/2011) Exile one: , gade deye...(Midnight) get ready 1997, etc. Exile One, the leader of the word cadence-lypso, featured some reggae, calypso and mostly cadence music. For example: Album \\"Exile one - Gordon Henderson 40 volume 1\\" features 14 kadans out of 18 tunes. 1. Rosita 2. ba yo boi 3. jumbolo 4. jamais voir ca (calypso tune) 5. reflexion 6. n'homme ka batte n'homme 7. gadez deye 8. ah ta ta 9. Ico vole 10. pompilili 11. aki yaka 12. vivent les vacances aux Antilles (calypso tune) 13. Ilyne (calypso tune) 14. nous travail pou ayen 15. cadence lypso 16. sexile 17. come here (reggae tune) 18. interlude. The song cadence lypso is a kadans tune. A third album \\"Collector kadance lypso\\" features twelve m√©ringue cadence tunes. The album also features tunes from other kadans bands: 2. Rigrete (Midnight Groover), Serpent la (C Top 6), la vie vini plus raid (Belles combo) 9. Coq et perroquet (Liquid Ice) 12. mwen di ou fe (Black Affairs) 7. Chanson d'amour Ophelia (Exile one). It is not sure whether the band's intent was to fusion Trinidadian calypso with Haitian cadence or compas since little was done. The song \\"La Dominique\\" in the Album \\"Exile One Old School Session\\" could be an attempt, however, not often repeated. The band music repertoire is mostly cadence or compas with all the features of the style. The album \\"Exile one-Old school Session: Gree/Vert\\" features mostly m√©ringue cadence or compas: 6 out of 8 tunes. 1) fete commune 2) torti 3) famille Creole 4) d'leau 5) sauvez riviere la and 7) Sylvie of course the band had its personality; it was a great kadans band. In the early 1970s, The full- horn section kadans band Exile One led by the talented Gordon Henderson was the first to use the synthesizers to their music that other young cadence or compas bands from Haiti (mini-jazz) and the French Antilles emulated in the 1970s. Exile One toured many places with kadans music: Japan, the Indian Ocean, Africa, North America, Europe, The Cape Verde islands. Other Dominica cadence bands included the Grammacks. Review Exile one CD 40 anniversary, Grammack collection 74‚Äì76 and others available at amazon music: Black Roots, Black Machine, Naked Feet, Belles Combo, Mantra, Black Affairs, Liquid Ice, Wafrikai, Midnighte Groovers and Milestone, while the most famous singers included Bill Thomas, Chubby Marc, Gordon Henderson, Linford John, Janet Azouz, Sinky Rabess, Tony Valmond, Jeff Joseph, Mike Moreau and Anthony Gussie. Ophelia Marie is a popular singer of cadence in the 1980s. =Soca= In the 1970s with the frequent tours of the Sicot brothers, Exile One, and so many meringue bands, compas or cadence rampa has become very influential in several parts of the world, specifically the Caribbean. Its influence on the calypso gave rise to Soca, closer to cadence or compas. The calypsonian Lord Shorty of Trinidad was the first to really define his music and with \\"Indrani\\" in 1973 and \\"Endless Vibration\\" (not just the song but the entire album) in 1975, calypso music really took off in another direction. Later in 1975 Lord Shorty visited his good friend Maestro in Dominica where he stayed (at Maestro's house) for a month while they visited and worked with local cadence or compas artists. You had Maestro experimenting with calypso and cadence. Sadly a year later Maestro would die in an accident in Dominica and his loss was palpably felt by Shorty, who penned \\"Higher World\\" as a tribute. In Dominica, Shorty had attended an Exile One performance of kadans, and collaborated with Dominica's 1969 Calypso King, Lord Tokyo and two calypso lyricists, Chris Seraphine and Pat Aaron in the early 1970s, who wrote him some Creole lyrics. Soon after Shorty released a song, \\"Ou Petit\\", with words like \\"Ou dee moin ou petit Shorty\\" (meaning \\"you told me you are small Shorty\\"). Soca's development includes calypso, cadence/compas, and Indian musical instruments‚Äîparticularly the dholak, tabla and dhantal‚Äîas demonstrated in Shorty's classic compositions \\"√èndrani\\" and \\"Shanti Om\\".

John Wiley & Sons, New York, pp. 3-12.  Origins, key concepts, definitions, and applications  Ecological engineering emerged as a new idea in the early 1960s, but its definition has taken several decades to refine, its implementation is still undergoing adjustment, and its broader recognition as a new paradigm is relatively recent. Ecological engineering was introduced by Howard Odum and othersH.T. Odum et al. (1963), Experiments with Engineering of Marine Ecosystems, in: Publication of the Institute of Marine Science of the University of Texas, 9: 374-403. as utilizing natural energy sources as the predominant input to manipulate and control environmental systems. The origins of ecological engineering are in Odum's work with ecological modeling and ecosystem simulation to capture holistic macro-patterns of energy and material flows affecting the efficient use of resources. Mitsch and Jorgensen summarized five basic concepts that differentiate ecological engineering from other approaches to addressing problems to benefit society and nature: 1) it is based on the self-designing capacity of ecosystems; 2) it can be the field (or acid) test of ecological theories; 3) it relies on system approaches; 4) it conserves non-renewable energy sources; and 5) it supports ecosystem and biological conservation. Mitsch and JorgensenW.J. Mitsch and S.E. Jorgensen (1989), \\"Introduction to Ecological Engineering\\" In: W.J. Mitsch and S.E. Jorgensen (Editors), Ecological Engineering: An Introduction to Ecotechnology.

(2001), \\"Design Principles for Ecological Engineering\\", in: Ecological Engineering, 18: 201-210. defined ecological engineering as: 1) utilizing ecological science and theory; 2) applying to all types of ecosystems; 3) adapting engineering design methods; and 4) acknowledging a guiding value system. Barrett (1999) offers a more literal definition of the term: \\"the design, construction, operation and management (that is, engineering) of landscape/aquatic structures and associated plant and animal communities (that is, ecosystems) to benefit humanity and, often, nature.\\" Barrett continues: \\"other terms with equivalent or similar meanings include ecotechnology and two terms most often used in the erosion control field: soil bioengineering and biotechnical engineering. However, ecological engineering should not be confused with 'biotechnology' when describing genetic engineering at the cellular level, or 'bioengineering' meaning construction of artificial body parts.\\" The applications in ecological engineering can be classified into 3 spatial scales: 1) mesocosms (~0.1 to hundreds of meters); 2) ecosystems (~1 to 10s of km); and 3) regional systems (>10s of km). The complexity of the design likely increases with the spatial scale. Applications are increasing in breadth and depth, and likely impacting the field's definition, as more opportunities to design and use ecosystems as interfaces between society and nature are explored.Center for Wetlands, Ecological Engineering, webtext 2007. Implementation of ecological engineering has focused on the creation or restoration of ecosystems, from degraded wetlands to multi-celled tubs and greenhouses that integrate microbial, fish, and plant services to process human wastewater into products such as fertilizers, flowers, and drinking water. Applications of ecological engineering in cities have emerged from collaboration with other fields such as landscape architecture, urban planning, and urban horticulture, to address human health and biodiversity, as targeted by the UN Sustainable Development Goals, with holistic projects such as stormwater management. Applications of ecological engineering in rural landscapes have included wetland treatmentA.M. Nahlik and W.J. Mitsch. (2006), \\"Tropical Treatment Wetlands Dominated by Free-Floating Macrophytes for Water Quality Improvement in Costa Rica\\", in: Ecological Engineering, 28: 246-257. and community reforestation through traditional ecological knowledge.S.A.W. Diemont and others (2006), \\"Lancandon Maya Forest Management: Restoration of Soil Fertility using Native Tree Species\\", in: Ecological Engineering, 28: 205-212. Permaculture is an example of broader applications that have emerged as distinct disciplines from ecological engineering, where David Holmgren cites the influence of Howard Odum in development of permaculture.  Design guidelines, functional classes, and design principles  Ecological engineering design will combine systems ecology with the process of engineering design. Engineering design typically involves problem formulation (goal), problem analysis (constraints), alternative solutions search, decision among alternatives, and specification of a complete solution.E.V. Krik A temporal design framework is provided by Matlock et al.,M.D. Matlock and others (2001), \\"Ecological Engineering: A Rationale for Standardized Curriculum and Professional Certification in the United States\\", in: Ecological Engineering, 17: 403-409. stating the design solutions are considered in ecological time. In selecting between alternatives, the design should incorporate ecological economics in design evaluation and acknowledge a guiding value system which promotes biological conservation, benefiting society and nature. Ecological engineering utilizes systems ecology with engineering design to obtain a holistic view of the interactions within and between society and nature. Ecosystem simulation with Energy Systems Language (also known as energy circuit language or energese) by Howard Odum is one illustration of this systems ecology approach.Brown, M.T. (2004) A picture is worth a thousand words: energy systems language and simulation. Ecological Modelling 178(1-2), 83-100. This holistic model development and simulation defines the system of interest, identifies the system's boundary, and diagrams how energy and material moves into, within, and out of, a system in order to identify how to use renewable resources through ecosystem processes and increase sustainability. The system it describes is a collection (i.e., group) of components (i.e., parts), connected by some type of interaction or interrelationship, that collectively responds to some stimulus or demand and fulfills some specific purpose or function. By understanding systems ecology the ecological engineer can more efficiently design with ecosystem components and processes within the design, utilize renewable energy and resources, and increase sustainability. Mitsch and Jorgensen identified five Functional Classes for ecological engineering designs: # Ecosystem utilized to reduce/solve pollution problem. Example: phytoremediation, wastewater wetland, and bioretention of stormwater to filter excess nutrients and metals pollution # Ecosystem imitated or copied to address resource problem. Example: forest restoration, replacement wetlands, and installing street side rain gardens to extend canopy cover to optimize residential and urban cooling # Ecosystem recovered after disturbance. Example: mine land restoration, lake restoration, and channel aquatic restoration with mature riparian corridors # Ecosystem modified in ecologically sound way. Example: selective timber harvest, biomanipulation, and introduction of predator fish to reduce planktivorous fish, increase zooplankton, consume algae or phytoplankton, and clarify the water. # Ecosystems used for benefit without destroying balance. Example: sustainable agro-ecosystems, multispecies aquaculture, and introducing agroforestry plots into residential property to generate primary production at multiple vertical levels. Mitsch and Jorgensen identified 19 Design Principles for ecological engineering, yet not all are expected to contribute to any single design: # Ecosystem structure & function are determined by forcing functions of the system; # Energy inputs to the ecosystems and available storage of the ecosystem is limited; # Ecosystems are open and dissipative systems (not thermodynamic balance of energy, matter, entropy, but spontaneous appearance of complex, chaotic structure); # Attention to a limited number of governing/controlling factors is most strategic in preventing pollution or restoring ecosystems; # Ecosystem have some homeostatic capability that results in smoothing out and depressing the effects of strongly variable inputs; # Match recycling pathways to the rates of ecosystems and reduce pollution effects; # Design for pulsing systems wherever possible; # Ecosystems are self-designing systems; # Processes of ecosystems have characteristic time and space scales that should be accounted for in environmental management; # Biodiversity should be championed to maintain an ecosystem's self design capacity; # Ecotones, transition zones, are as important for ecosystems as membranes for cells; # Coupling between ecosystems should be utilized wherever possible; # The components of an ecosystem are interconnected, interrelated, and form a network; consider direct as well as indirect efforts of ecosystem development; # An ecosystem has a history of development; # Ecosystems and species are most vulnerable at their geographical edges; # Ecosystems are hierarchical systems and are parts of a larger landscape; # Physical and biological processes are interactive, it is important to know both physical and biological interactions and to interpret them properly; # Eco-technology requires a holistic approach that integrates all interacting parts and processes as far as possible; # Information in ecosystems is stored in structures. Mitsch and Jorgensen identified the following considerations prior implementing an ecological engineering design: * Create conceptual model of determine the parts of nature connected to the project; * Implement a computer model to simulate the impacts and uncertainty of the project; * Optimize the project to reduce uncertainty and increase beneficial impacts.  Academic curriculum (colleges) An academic curriculum has been proposed for ecological engineering, and institutions around the world are starting programs. Key elements of this curriculum are: environmental engineering; systems ecology; restoration ecology; ecological modeling; quantitative ecology; economics of ecological engineering, and technical electives.Diemont, S.W., T.J. Lawrence, and T.A. Endreny. \\"Envisioning Ecological Engineering Education: An International Survey of the Educational and Professional Community\\", Ecological Engineering, 36(4): 570-578, 2010. DOI: 10.1016/j.ecoleng.2009.12.004 Complementing this set of courses are prerequisites courses in physical, biological, and chemical subject areas, and integrated design experiences. According to Matlock et al., the design should identify constraints, characterize solutions in ecological time, and incorporate ecological economics in design evaluation.

He played collegiately at Tennessee State University. High school and college careers Anderson attended Cleveland Junior Naval Academy in St. Louis, Missouri where he was an all-district performer. He was a four-year letterman at Tennessee State (1996‚Äì99) where he started 43 of the 45 games in which he played during his career. He was a first-team All-Ohio Valley Conference pick as both a junior and senior, when he also earned the school‚Äôs leadership award by the ‚ÄúTree Coaches‚Äù (Tennessee State alumni coaches who sit under a tree watching practice).He was a first- team Black College All-America pick as a senior in 1999. Professional career2000= Anderson was initially signed by the St. Louis Rams in 2000 as an undrafted rookie free agent. He was waived by the team on July 19 and spent rest of the year out of football. =2001= Anderson resurfaced with the Chicago Enforcers of the now defunct XFL in the spring of 2001. He started at right guard for the Enforcers the entire season, paving the way for former NFL running backs LeShon Johnson and John Avery (also a former first- round pick by the Miami Dolphins). Later that year, Anderson would go on to play in all 16 regular season games with 13 starts at right guard for the Baltimore Ravens. After seeing action in a reserve role in the first two regular season games, he made the first start of his NFL career at the Denver Broncos on September 30 as the Ravens rushed for 112 yards and the line did not allow a sack in a 20-13 victory. Anderson also opened both playoff games. =2002= Anderson started all 16 games at right guard for the Ravens in 2002. He was one of only three Ravens offensive players to start all 16 games that year. He was part of a line that led the way for a running game that averaged 112.0 yards per contest and put together a 4.2-yard average per attempt as running back Jamal Lewis rushed for 1,327 yards and reached the 100-yard rushing mark in five games. =2003= Anderson opened all 15 regular season games in which he played at right guard for the Ravens in 2003. He dressed but did not play in the finale against the Pittsburgh Steelers. He was part of a line that paved the way for Jamal Lewis, who put together the second-best individual rushing performance in NFL history with 2,066 yards. Anderson also opened first-round playoff game against the Tennessee Titans on January 3, 2004. =2004= In his final season with the Ravens, Anderson played in all 16 contests, including 12 starts at right guard. He also saw action at left guard during the course of the season. He was an integral part of a line that led a running game which averaged 128.9 yards per contest and allowed 2.2 sacks an outing. Behind the line, running backs Jamal Lewis (4) and Chester Taylor (2) combined for six 100-yard rushing games. =2005= After the Ravens signed free agent offensive guard Keydrick Vincent from the Pittsburgh Steelers in early 2005, it became clear they had no interest in re- signing Anderson. He signed with the Buffalo Bills on March 19. The contract was a three-year deal worth $5.1 million. It also featured a $400,000 bonus if he met certain playing-time incentives. Anderson started 15 of the 16 games in which he appeared at left guard for the Bills. The only game he did not open was against the Kansas City Chiefs on November 13, when he was replaced by Mike Williams after struggling with pass protection. Anderson re-assumed the role after Williams was injured on November 27. During the year, Anderson was part of a line that led the way for running back Willis McGahee, who compiled his second straight 1,000-yard rushing season with 1,247 yards. =2006= Anderson was expected to have the edge on the starting left guard position for the Bills in 2006, but was waived by the team on June 9. On June 15, he signed a to a two-year contract with the Miami Dolphins. The move reunited him with Mike Mularkey, who was the head coach for the Bills in 2004 and 2005 before becoming the offensive coordinator in Miami. He initially assumed the starting right guard job after injuries to Seth McKinney and rookie Joe Toledo. Anderson started the first two games of the regular season at right guard before being injured on September 17 against his former team, the Buffalo Bills. The injury, which proved to be a torn triceps, landed Anderson on Injured Reserve. He was replaced by Kendyl Jacox and later L.J. Shelton at right guard. Personal life Bennie is married with three sons. He earned a degree in history at Tennessee State and has subsequently obtained his teaching certificate. He has said he would like to get into a career in education following his playing days, possibly even starting his own school in St. Louis, Missouri. Bennie is currently a lineman coach for Elite Football Academy of Chesterfield, Missouri.

According to the story, Gediminas, the Grand Duke of Lithuania, conquered Volhynia before turning his attention to Kiev. He was opposed by Prince Stanislav of Kiev allied with the Principality of Pereyaslavl and Bryansk. Lithuanians achieved a great victory and extended their influence to Kiev. There are no contemporary sources that attest to the battle. It is known only from late and generally unreliable Lithuanian Chronicles. Therefore, historians disagree whether it was an actual battle in the early 1320s or a fictional story invented by later scribes. Lithuanians gained full control of the city only in 1362 after the Battle of Blue Waters against the Golden Horde.Rowell (2000), p. 707 Account in the Lithuanian Chronicles As told by the Lithuanian Chronicles, having made peace with the Teutonic Order, Gediminas marched against Volhynia.Rowell (1994), p. 307 The Lithuanian Army successfully attacked and captured Volodymyr-Volynskyi. Prince Vladimir (most likely incorrect name for Andrew of Galicia) was killed during the battle.Rowell (1994), p. 97 His brother Leo II of Galicia fled to his brother-in-law in Bryansk. The Lithuanian Army spent the winter in Brest and, second week after Easter, marched against the Principality of Kiev. They captured Ovruch and Zhytomyr. At Belgorod Kievsky on the small Irpin River about south west of Kiev, Gediminas was stopped by the joint army of Stanislav of Kiev, Oleg of Pereyaslavl, Roman of Bryansk, and Leo II of Galicia. The Lithuanians achieved a decisive victory. Oleg and Leo were slain on the battlefield. Stanislav escaped first to Bryansk and then to Ryazan. Gediminas then captured Belgorod Kievsky and besieged Kiev for a month.Rowell (1994), pp. 307‚Äì308 Left without its ruler, Kiev surrendered. The Lithuanians also captured Vyshhorod, Cherkasy, Kaniv, Putyvl, as well as Pereiaslav. Algimantas, son of Mindaugas from the Al≈°ƒóni≈°kiai family, was installed in Kiev as Gediminas' viceroy.Rowell (1994), p. 308 Analysis The Kingdom of Galicia‚ÄìVolhynia (1245‚Äì1349) Information about the Lithuanian conquest comes from generally confused and unreliable Lithuanian Chronicles (second and third redaction) and Ukrainian (Gustynskaia Chronicle) produced many years after the events. No contemporary sources directly corroborate the story. In the 1880s, Ukrainian historian Vladimir Bonifatevich Antonovich was the first to critically evaluate the chronicles and dismiss the campaign and battle as fiction.Rowell (1994), p. 101 However, after careful analysis, modern historians believe that Antonovich was too critical and that there is some truth to the story. =Political situation= The Principalities of Galicia‚ÄìVolhynia attracted Gediminas' attention early on; he attacked Brest in 1315 and arranged marriage between his son Liubartas and Euphemia, daughter of Andrew of Galicia.Rowell (1994), p. 94 After the attack in 1315, the Principality allied with the Teutonic Order, a long-standing enemy of the Lithuanians. A links between this alliance and the Lithuanian attack was suggested by Bronis≈Çaw W≈Çodarski. Galicia‚ÄìVolhynia was also a rich land and offered access further south to Kiev. Letters of Gediminas from 1323 would suggest that commercial rivalry was a contributing factor in the attack. There were no known attacks by the Teutonic Knights on Lithuania between July 1320 and March 1322, which could indicate the peace mentioned in the chronicle. There was an attack on Lithuania by the Golden Horde in 1325; historians Feliks Shabuldo and Romas Bat≈´ra interpreted it as a direct reprisal for the Lithuanian expansion.Rowell (1994), p. 98 The Lithuanian takeover of Cherkasy, Kaniv, Putyvl probably refers to a campaign led by Vytautas in 1392.Rowell (1994), p. 105 It is known that brothers Andrew and Leo of Galicia‚ÄìVolhynia died sometime between May 1321 and May 1323. However, their death did not bring Lithuanian control to Galicia‚ÄìVolhynia. The brothers did not have a male heir and were succeeded by Boles≈Çaw Jerzy II of Mazovia, son of their sister Maria, and not by Liubartas.Rowell (1994), p. 99 Boles≈Çaw Jerzy was poisoned in 1340 bringing about the prolonged Galicia‚ÄìVolhynia Wars that split the territory between the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and Kingdom of Poland. Contemporary sources also do not indicate that the brothers were slain by the Lithuanians. Swiss chronicler John of Winterthur recorded that they were poisoned by their rebellious subjects. In a letter to Pope John XXII, Polish King W≈Çadys≈Çaw I the Elbow-high lamented that the death of Andrew and Leo left Poland vulnerable to an attack from the Golden Horde and made no mention of the Lithuania aggression.Baronas (2011), p. 457 =Personal names= Names recorded in the Chronicle are often confused. The Chronicle mentions Prince Vladimir of Volodymyr-Volynskyi. No such prince is known at the time of Gediminas' reign; the last Prince Vladimir III Ivan Vasilkovich died in 1289. However, it is a conceivable error ‚Äì a scribe might have accidentally transferred the name of the city to Prince Andrew of Galicia. The case for a simple mistake is bolstered by the fact that his brother's name is correctly recorded as Leo II of Galicia.Rowell (1994), pp. 101‚Äì102 Further, contemporary sources attest that brothers Andrew and Leo of Galicia‚ÄìVolhynia died sometime between May 1321 and May 1323.Rowell (1994), p. 95 Roman of Bryansk was a 13th-century prince; Dmitry Romanovich was Prince of Bryansk at the time. It could also be explained as an error and confusion of the patronymic name with the first name of more famous predecessor.Rowell (1994), p. 102 There is no evidence to prove or disprove whether Leo and Dmitry Romanovich were brothers- in-law. Historians had suggested that the three names were borrowed from an earlier campaign: the Hypatian Codex recorded a 1274 battle between the Lithuanians and Vladimir of Volodymyr-Volynskyi, Leo I of Galicia, and Roman of Chernigov and Bryansk at Drahichyn. However, historian S. C. Rowell found no other textual similarities between the 1274 battle in the Codex and the 1320s campaign in the Lithuanian Chronicles. Nothing can be said about Oleg of Pereyaslavl as nothing is known on princes of Pereyaslavl after its devastation in 1240 during the Mongol invasion of Rus'. Stanislav of Kiev is not found in any other sources and cannot be easily explained as an error. The Chronicles mention that he escaped to the Principality of Ryazan where he married a daughter of the local prince and succeeded to the throne. That contradicts known facts that Ivan Yaroslavich of Ryazan was succeeded by his son Ivan Ivanovich Korotopol in 1327.Rowell (1994), p. 103 S. C. Rowell found a mention of Ioann Stanislavich who, Rowell extrapolated, could have been a prince of Vyazma and son of Stanislav of Kiev (Stanislav is not a common name among East Slavs). The genealogy of the Shilovskys (:ru:–®–∏–ª–æ–≤—Å–∫–∏–µ), a boyar family from Ryazan, mentioned that they fled Kiev with Stanislav. If nothing else, this mention in the genealogy proves that the story of the Battle on the Irpin River well predates the chronicles. Algimantas, son of Mindaugas from the Al≈°ƒóni≈°kiai family, is the only Lithuanian, other than Gediminas, mentioned by the Chronicle.Rowell (1994), pp. 103‚Äì104 A list of Olshanskis found in the Pskov-Caves Monastery mentions Algimantas (Olgimont) who was baptized as Michael.Rowell (1994), p. 104 His son Ivan Olshansky was a prominent noble in the Grand Duchy and, in 1399, became viceroy in Kiev after Skirgaila's death. Historians struggled to reconcile Algimantas with Fiodor (Theodore) mentioned in 1331. At the time, newly consecrated archbishop Basil Kalika traveled from Volodymyr-Volynskyi home to Veliky Novgorod. He was stopped by Prince Fiodor of Kiev, a Tatar basqaq (tax collector), and fifty warriors. In 1916, new evidence was published that Fiodor was a brother of Gediminas and historians reinterpreted that the 1331 incident shows that Fiodor was still paying a tribute to the Mongols.Su≈æiedƒólis (1970‚Äì1978), pp. 446‚Äì447 Lithuanians gained full control of the city only in 1362 after the Battle of Blue Waters against the Golden Horde.

Tol did his undergraduate studies at Calvin College, Grand Rapids, Michigan, and then received his PhD in philosophy under D. H. Th. Vollenhoven, professor of philosophy at Vrije Universiteit. Tony Tol became an active proponent of a method for study of the history of Western philosophy and its systematics, the method which Vollenhoven had empirically built-up by studying 16,000 individual philosophers over the course of theoretical thought in the West. Called by Vollenhoven the Consequent Problem-Historical Method (CPHM), the approach proved fascinating to Tol, who became one of its prime users in his own philosophical research and a theorizer of the development of the philosophical movement which had given it birth. The movement gave rise to the school of thought known as Reformational philosophy, founded by Vollenhoven and his colleague at Vrije Universiteit, professor of law Herman Dooyeweerd. Tol, as part of his doctoral dissertation, assembled a critical edition of Vollenhoven's Isag√¥g√®.

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the San Francisco Giants from 2003 to 2007. College and the MLB Draft Lowry was first drafted out of Nordhoff High School, in Ojai, California, by the Texas Rangers in the nineteenth round of the 1999 MLB Draft, but instead opted to attend Pepperdine University. At Pepperdine, Lowry went 14-2 with a 1.71 ERA as a junior. In 2001, the San Francisco Giants drafted Lowry with the 30th and last pick of the first round in the 2001 MLB Draft. Major league career Lowry in bullpen Following a September call-up in 2003, Lowry enjoyed a very successful partial rookie year for the Giants in , going 6-0, and finishing with a 3.82 ERA in fourteen starts. He was named the National League's Player of the Week for the week of August 9. With an early victory to start off the 2005 season, Lowry began his career with a 7-0 record, the longest winning streak for any pitcher in San Francisco Giants history (and the second longest in Giants franchise history, behind Hooks Wiltse's 12-0 start in 1904). Lowry got eighteen starts before the 2005 Major League Baseball All-Star Game and compiled a 2.43 ERA after the break. His best month came in August, when he went 5-0 with a 0.69 ERA, earning him Pitcher of the Month honors. He finished the season with a 13-13 record, 3.78 ERA, and 172 strikeouts in 204‚Öî innings. Prior to the 2006 season, the Giants signed Lowry to a four-year deal with an option for a fifth year, valued at $9.25 million. At the time, it was the second largest contract for a pitcher with only one full season of big league service. Lowry received a $1 million signing bonus and $385,000 salary for 2006. The contract guaranteed him totals of $1.115 million for 2007, $2.25 million for 2008, and $4.5 million for 2009. The contract included a 2010 option for $6.25 million that would have been activated automatically if a certain number of starts, innings, and Cy Young Award vote placements was achieved. The 2010 option also included another $1.5 million in incentives. Injuries hampered his performance right from the beginning of the 2006 season. In his first start of 2006, Lowry was removed from the game in the second inning due to an oblique strain,In Lowry, Giants are looking out for No. 3 forcing him to miss the first month of the season. Lowry also suffered from an elbow injury in September. Despite a losing season for the Giants in 2007, and a season cut short by a forearm injury, Lowry won a career-high 14 games, the most for any pitcher on the Giants staff. He finished the season with a 14-8 record and a 3.92 ERA. Lowry was slated as the number three starter for the Giants in 2008, but the forearm injury that shut him down in 2007 kept him out of the 2008 season. After having trouble throwing strikes early on in spring training, Lowry was diagnosed with exertional compartment syndrome and had surgery on his left forearm on March 7. In September 2008, he also had an arthroscopic procedure to remove a bone spur from his left elbow.http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=4877765 In May 2009 Lowry had a rib surgically removed to relieve the continued pain in his shoulder and neck associated with his recent diagnosis of thoracic outlet syndrome. The new diagnosis brought the original diagnosis of exertional compartment syndrome into question, along with the necessity of his 2008 surgery.http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=4179864 Lowry's agent, Damon Lapa, claimed that the Giants' medical staff had misdiagnosed the injury and subjected Lowry to an unnecessary arm operation, turning a potential short-term recovery into a lengthy medical ordeal. Lapa said Dr. James Andrews and Dr. Greg Pearl confirmed the diagnosis in separate consultations with Lowry. Lapa said the circulatory issue was the source of Lowry's forearm tightness in August 2007 and loss of control in spring training 2008, but that the Giants' medical staff failed to identify the problem. The Giants, however, denied any wrongdoing. As of February 2010, Lowry was working out under the direction of noted personal trainer Brett Fischer at Fischer Sports Physical Therapy & Conditioning in Phoenix. Personal life In a February 28, 2013 interview on Chronicle Live, Lowry stated, \\"It doesn't look like baseball is going to be in my future,\\" and gave viewers a status update of his still- deteriorating health, his young family, his current career as an entrepreneur and ecology advocate, and his love for the San Francisco Giants and baseball in general. Lowry lives in Santa Rosa, California, co parents daughters Averlee and Anniston. An avid outdoorsman and sportsman, he was co-owner of Santa Rosa Ski & Sports.

Ferrochrome is produced by electric arc carbothermic reduction of chromite. Most of the global output is produced in South Africa, Kazakhstan and India, which have large domestic chromite resources. Increasing amounts are coming from Russia and China. Production of steel, especially that of stainless steel with chromium content of 10 to 20%, is the largest consumer and the main application of ferrochrome. Usage Over 80% of the world's ferrochrome is utilised in the production of stainless steel. In 2006, 28 Mt of stainless steel were produced. Stainless steel depends on chromium for its appearance and resistance to corrosion. Average chrome content in stainless steel is approx. 18%. It is also used to add chromium to carbon steel. FeCr from South Africa, known as \\"charge chrome\\" and produced from a Cr containing ore with a low carbon content, is most commonly used in stainless steel production. Alternatively, high carbon FeCr produced from high-grade ore found in Kazakhstan (among other places) is more commonly used in specialist applications such as engineering steels where a high Cr/Fe ratio and minimum levels of other elements (sulfur, phosphorus, titanium etc.) are important and production of finished metals takes place in small electric arc furnaces compared to large scale blast furnaces. Production Ferrochrome production is essentially a carbothermic reduction operation taking place at high temperatures. Chromium ore (an oxide of Cr and Fe) is reduced by coal and coke to form the iron-chromium alloy. The heat for this reaction can come from several forms, but typically from the electric arc formed between the tips of electrodes in the bottom of the furnace and the furnace hearth. This arc creates temperatures of about . In the process of smelting, huge amounts of electricity are consumed, making production very expensive in countries where power costs are high. Tapping of the material from the furnace takes place intermittently. When enough smelted ferrochrome has accumulated in the furnace hearth, the tap hole is drilled open and a stream of molten metal and slag rushes down a trough into a chill or ladle. Ferrochrome solidifies in large castings which are crushed for sale or further processed. Ferrochrome is generally classified by the amount of carbon and chrome it contains. Vast majority of FeCr produced is \\"charge chrome\\" from South Africa, with high carbon being the second largest segment followed by the smaller sectors of low carbon and intermediate carbon material.

Construction of a flownet is often used for solving groundwater flow problems where the geometry makes analytical solutions impractical. The method is often used in civil engineering, hydrogeology or soil mechanics as a first check for problems of flow under hydraulic structures like dams or sheet pile walls. As such, a grid obtained by drawing a series of equipotential lines is called a flownet. The flownet is an important tool in analysing two-dimensional irrotational flow problems. Flow net technique is a graphical representation method. Basic method The method consists of filling the flow area with stream and equipotential lines, which are everywhere perpendicular to each other, making a curvilinear grid. Typically there are two surfaces (boundaries) which are at constant values of potential or hydraulic head (upstream and downstream ends), and the other surfaces are no-flow boundaries (i.e., impermeable; for example the bottom of the dam and the top of an impermeable bedrock layer), which define the sides of the outermost streamtubes (see figure 1 for a stereotypical flownet example). Mathematically, the process of constructing a flownet consists of contouring the two harmonic or analytic functions of potential and stream function. These functions both satisfy the Laplace equation and the contour lines represent lines of constant head (equipotentials) and lines tangent to flowpaths (streamlines). Together, the potential function and the stream function form the complex potential, where the potential is the real part, and the stream function is the imaginary part. The construction of a flownet provides an approximate solution to the flow problem, but it can be quite good even for problems with complex geometries by following a few simple rules (initially developed by Philipp Forchheimer around 1900, and later formalized by Arthur Casagrande in 1937) and a little practice: * streamlines and equipotentials meet at right angles (including the boundaries), * diagonals drawn between the cornerpoints of a flownet will meet each other at right angles (useful when near singularities), * streamtubes and drops in equipotential can be halved and should still make squares (useful when squares get very large at the ends), * flownets often have areas which consist of nearly parallel lines, which produce true squares; start in these areas -- working towards areas with complex geometry, * many problems have some symmetry (e.g., radial flow to a well); only a section of the flownet needs to be constructed, * the sizes of the squares should change gradually; transitions are smooth and the curved paths should be roughly elliptical or parabolic in shape. Example flownets The first flownet pictured here (modified from Craig, 1997) illustrates and quantifies the flow which occurs under the dam (flow is assumed to be invariant along the axis of the dam -- valid near the middle of the dam); from the pool behind the dam (on the right) to the tailwater downstream from the dam (on the left). There are 16 green equipotential lines (15 equal drops in hydraulic head) between the 5 m upstream head to the 1m downstream head (4 m / 15 head drops = 0.267 m head drop between each green line). The blue streamlines (equal changes in the streamfunction between the two no-flow boundaries) show the flowpath taken by water as it moves through the system; the streamlines are everywhere tangent to the flow velocity. Example flownet 2, click to view full-size. The second flownet pictured here (modified from Ferris, et al., 1962) shows a flownet being used to analyze map-view flow (invariant in the vertical direction), rather than a cross-section. Note that this problem has symmetry, and only the left or right portions of it needed to have been done. To create a flownet to a point sink (a singularity), there must be a recharge boundary nearby to provide water and allow a steady-state flowfield to develop. Flownet results Darcy's law describes the flow of water through the flownet. Since the head drops are uniform by construction, the gradient is inversely proportional to the size of the blocks. Big blocks mean there is a low gradient, and therefore low discharge (hydraulic conductivity is assumed constant here). An equivalent amount of flow is passing through each streamtube (defined by two adjacent blue lines in diagram), therefore narrow streamtubes are located where there is more flow. The smallest squares in a flownet are located at points where the flow is concentrated (in this diagram they are near the tip of the cutoff wall, used to reduce dam underflow), and high flow at the land surface is often what the civil engineer is trying to avoid, being concerned about piping or dam failure. Singularities Irregular points (also called singularities) in the flow field occur when streamlines have kinks in them (the derivative doesn't exist at a point). This can happen where the bend is outward (e.g., the bottom of the cutoff wall in the figure above), and there is infinite flux at a point, or where the bend is inward (e.g., the corner just above and to the left of the cutoff wall in the figure above) where the flux is zero. The second flownet illustrates a well, which is typically represented mathematically as a point source (the well shrinks to zero radius); this is a singularity because the flow is converging to a point, at that point the Laplace equation is not satisfied. These points are mathematical artifacts of the equation used to solve the real-world problem, and do not actually mean that there is infinite or no flux at points in the subsurface. These types of points often do make other types of solutions (especially numeric) to these problems difficult, while the simple graphical technique handles them nicely. Extensions to standard flownets Typically flownets are constructed for homogeneous, isotropic porous media experiencing saturated flow to known boundaries. There are extensions to the basic method to allow some of these other cases to be solved: * inhomogeneous aquifer: matching conditions at boundaries between properties * anisotropic aquifer: drawing the flownet in a transformed domain, then scaling the results differently in the principle hydraulic conductivity directions, to return the solution * one boundary is a seepage face: iteratively solving for both the boundary condition and the solution throughout the domain Although the method is commonly used for these types of groundwater flow problems, it can be used for any problem which is described by the Laplace equation ( abla^2 \\\\phi = 0), for example electric current flow through the earth.

These existing routes were officially merged in 1887. The Boston Elevated Railway (BERy) was a streetcar and rapid transit railroad operated on, above, and below, the streets of Boston, Massachusetts and surrounding communities. Founded in 1894, it eventually acquired the West End Street Railway via lease and merger to become the city's primary mass transit provider. Its modern successor is the state- run Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA), which continues to operate in part on infrastructure developed by BERy and its predecessors. History PCC car #3295 on display at Boylston Retired BERy-era heavy rail subway cars at the MBTA Red Line's former Eliot Yard, 1967 South End, built 1889-91 Originally intended to build a short electric trolley line to Brookline, the West End Street Railway was organized in 1887. By the next year it had consolidated ownership of a number of horse-drawn streetcar lines, composing a fleet of 7816 horses and 1480 rail vehicles. As the system grew, a switch to underground pulled-cable propulsion (modeled after the San Francisco cable cars) was contemplated. After visiting Frank Sprague and witnessing the Richmond, Virginia system in action, WESR President Henry Whitney chose to deploy electric propulsion systems. A section of track was used to test the Bentley-Knight underground power line, but this was abandoned because of failures and safety concerns (especially after the electrocution of a team of horses in 1889). After competing in operational tests with the Sprague streetcar system, the Thomson-Houston company was chosen for system-wide deployment of overhead wires.History of electrification of the West End Street Railway The electrified rapid transit system was named an IEEE Milestone in Electrical Engineering in 2004. The first electric trolley line built by the West End Street Railway was between Union Square, Allston and Park Square, downtown, via Harvard Street, Beacon Street, Massachusetts Avenue and Boylston Street. Trolleys first ran in 1889. The Green Line A branch later served roughly the same purpose. The last horse car line was along Marlborough Street in the Back Bay, and was never electrified. It was closed around 1900.Closure In the late 19th century, the electric power industry was in its infancy; the power grid as we know it today simply did not exist. The railway company constructed its own power stations; by 1897, these included distributed generation stations in downtown Boston, Allston, Cambridge (near Harvard), Dorchester, Charlestown, East Cambridge, and East Boston. By 1904, the system had 36 megawatts of generating capacity, of track for over 1550 street cars (mostly closed but some open), and of elevated track for 174 elevated cars. On 7 November 1916, Boston Elevated Railway Co. street car No. 393 smashed through the warning gates of the open Summer Street drawbridge in Boston, plunging into the frigid waters of Fort Point Channel, killing 46 people. The first bus route was in 1922, between Union Square, Allston and Faneuil Street. In 1933 this was merged with the Union Square‚ÄìCentral bus and later became the bus.bus =Elevated railway= Share of the Boston Elevated Railway Company, issued 2. March 1918 In 1890, the West End Railway was authorized by the state to construct elevated railways, but did not pursue this possibility. The state consequently authorized a new franchise for such an endeavor, which resulted in the founding in 1894 in the establishment of the Boston Elevated Railway. The first stretch of elevated track was put in service in 1901, between Sullivan Square in Charlestown and Dudley Square in Roxbury. In 1897, BERy acquired a long-term lease on the West End's lines, and the two companies were formally merged in 1922. The elevated network was expanded to include six end- points, with vehicles run on the tracks in routes designed to allow passengers to reach any destination without changing trains. =Power generation= The difficulty of transporting coal over land from the Port of Boston and the short range of the direct current system prevented significant expansion inland. In 1911, a large generating station was built in South Boston which produced 25 Hertz alternating current, which could be transmitted long distances at high voltage, to substations which would drop the voltage and convert it to direct current for use by trains. The system was gradually converted until completion in 1931, when 14 substations were in place. This station would operate until 1981, when the MBTA had completed converting all of the active substations to be able to use 60 Hertz alternating current, and could switch to purchasing energy from local utility companies instead of running its own generators. =Conversion of routes to trolleybuses and buses= The first route of the Boston trackless trolley system was opened by BERy, on April 11, 1936. It was route 77 (later 69), Harvard ‚Äì Lechmere via Cambridge Street. Trackless trolleys still run from Harvard station, but only to the west and north, not east to Lechmere since 1963. Operations The company's rapid transit lines have evolved into the Red, Blue, and Orange Lines. The only streetcars that remain are the various branches of the Green Line and the Ashmont‚ÄìMattapan High Speed Line; the rest have been converted to buses. The Boston Elevated Railway operated in the following cities and towns: *Arlington *Belmont *Boston and the municipalities that have been merged into it *Brookline *Cambridge *Chelsea *Everett *Malden *Medford *Newton (only to get between Boston and Watertown) *Revere *Somerville *Stoneham (only the southern bit, in the Middlesex Fells) *Watertown Additionally, streetcars from adjoining towns, run by other companies, operated over Boston Elevated Railway trackage. Operations of the companies were taken over by the Metropolitan Transit Authority, now the MBTA, in 1947. ReferencesFurther reading * * External links *The Boston Elevated Railway Company.

Cofounders include but are not limited to Marc Weinstein, Dave Prinz, Yvonne Prinz, and Kent Randolph. The San Francisco store opened on November 15, 1997 in the Haight-Ashbury district, near Golden Gate Park. It was located in the former Park Bowl bowling alley. It regularly stocks upwards of 100,000 CDs, vinyl records, and audio cassettes, both new and used. The Southern California location was added on November 17, 2001 when the store opened a new branch on Sunset Boulevard (at Cahuenga Boulevard) in Hollywood. At the time of its opening, the store planned to stock as many as 250,000 titles, which would have placed it among the largest independent music stores in the world. According to Los Angeles Times writer Michael Hiltzik, the location \\"instantly became a Hollywood landmark.\\" Documents published by the Los Angeles Department of Planning in August 2017 indicate that the site will be demolished and replaced by a 28-story contemporary glass-and-steel tower with 232 residential units (including ten units for very low-income residents) and of ground-level commercial space. Should the City approve the project, it was expected that construction would begin in mid-2019, and be completed in 2021. On April 27, 2020, Amoeba announced that due to the Coronavirus Pandemic, the Hollywood location on Sunset Boulevard would not be reopening as hoped (to allow for final farewell events), but Amoeba would be relocating to their new Hollywood Boulevard location once they are permitted to reopen.https://www.amoeba.com/our-stores/store-news/3778/amoeba-hollywood-is- moving-3778/ Amoeba's world music department was headed by Robert Leaver,Good CD, Shame About the Cover.

The stores also trade in movies, though secondarily to their music business. Each location has a smaller collection of movies on DVD, VHS, Laserdisc and Blu-ray Disc. In addition, each store maintains a selection of music-related posters and artwork for purchase, as well as Amoeba-branded merchandise. The Hollywood location has the entire 2nd floor dedicated to DVD and Blu-ray Disc. In addition, Amoeba Music frequently holds free shows during store hours with locally and nationally known artists from a wide variety of genres. Primarily operating on re-selling used goods, Amoeba has survived the decline of CD sales since the early 2000s with its trade-in program and the advent of the vinyl revival. Along with the statewide stay-at-home order issued by California governor Gavin Newsom in the COVID-19 pandemic, many non-essential stores were told to close to prevent spread of COVID-19. Amoeba subsequently started a fundraising campaign on GoFundMe to pay the bills as most of their income is derived from in-store purchases.  YouTube channel  Amoeba's YouTube channel was created on January 27, 2006 and is home to interviews, recordings of live performances at Amoeba locations, and the Webby Award- winning series ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs In My Bag?‚Äù with various ‚Äúfeaturing artists and tastemakers sharing what they found shopping at Amoeba.‚Äù  Popular culture  The Hollywood store was included as a playable venue in the 2008 music game Guitar Hero World Tour. Paul McCartney recorded his EP Amoeba's Secret at an unannounced live performance at the Hollywood location on 27 June 2007.

In 1967, the bill was signed into law by President Lyndon B. Johnson. The ADEA prevents age discrimination and provides equal employment opportunity under conditions that were not explicitly covered in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. It also applies to the standards for pensions and benefits provided by employers, and requires that information concerning the needs of older workers be provided to the general public. Scope of protection The ADEA includes a broad ban against age discrimination against workers over the age of forty, and also specifically prohibits: * Discrimination in hiring, promotions, wages, and termination of employment and layoffs. * Statements of specifications in age preference or limitations. * Denial of benefits to older employees: an employer may reduce benefits based on age only if the cost of providing the reduced benefits to older workers is the same as the cost of providing full benefits to younger workers. * Since 1986, it has prohibited mandatory retirement in most sectors, with phased elimination of mandatory retirement for tenured workers, such as college professors, in 1993. Mandatory retirement based on age is permitted for: * Executives over age 65 in high policy-making positions who are entitled to a pension over a minimum yearly amount. The ADEA applies to employers who employ at least twenty employees on a regular basis within the current or prior calendar year. Amendments The ADEA was amended in 1986, and then again in 1991 by the Older Workers Benefit Protection Act (Pub. L. 101-433) and the Civil Rights Act of 1991 (Pub. L. 102-166). Case law The ADEA differs from the Civil Rights Act in that the ADEA applies to employers of 20 or more employees (see ) rather than 15 or more employees. Both acts do, however, only apply to employers in industries affecting interstate commerce. The 20 employees can include overseas employees. The ADEA protects US citizens working for US employers operating abroad except where it would violate the laws of that country.See . An age limit may be legally specified in the circumstance where age has been shown to be a \\"bona fide occupational qualification [BFOQ] reasonably necessary to the normal operation of the particular business\\" (see ). In practice, BFOQs for age are limited to the obvious (hiring a young actor to play a young character in a movie) or when public safety is at stake (for example, in the case of age limits for pilots and bus drivers). The ADEA does not stop an employer from favoring an older employee over a younger one, even when the younger one is over 40 years old.. The United States Supreme Court, in Meacham v. Knolls Atomic Power Lab, 554 U.S. 84 (2008), held that the employer, not the employee, bears the burden of proving that a layoff or other action that hurts older workers more than others was based not on age but on some other ‚Äúreasonable factor.‚Äù In Gomez- Perez v. Potter (2008), the Supreme Court allowed federal workers who experience retaliation as a result of reporting age discrimination under the law to sue for damages.. In Kimel v. Florida Bd. of Regents, 528 U.S. 62 (2000), the Supreme Court held that state employees cannot sue states for monetary damages under the ADEA in federal court.. The EEOC may still enforce the ADEA against states, and state employees may still sue state officials for declaratory and injunctive relief. In Gross v. FBL Financial Services, Inc., 557 U.S. 167 (2009), the Supreme Court ruled that a plaintiff must prove by that age was the \\"but for\\" cause of the challenged employment action. Babb v. Wilkie is a Supreme Court case which considered the scope and breadth of the ADEA. In it the Court ruled that plaintiffs only need to prove that age was a motivating factor in the decision in order to sue.. However, establishing but for causation is still necessary in determining the appropriate remedy. If a plaintiff can establish that the age was the determining factor in the employment outcome, they may be entitled to compensatory damages or other relief relating to the end result of the employment decision. Remedies ADEA remedies include compensatory and punitive damages for employee or damages if reinstatement is not feasible and/or employer's violation is intentional. Defenses Statutory defenses to ADEA claims include: * Employers may enforce waivers of age discrimination claims made without EEOC or court approval if the waiver is \\"knowing or voluntary.\\" * Valid arbitration agreements between employers and employees covering the dispute are subject to compulsory arbitration and no court action can be brought.. * Employers can discharge or discipline an employee for \\"good cause,\\" regardless of the employee's age. * Employers can take an action based on \\"reasonable factors other than age.\\" * Bona fide occupational qualifications, seniority systems, employee benefit or early retirement plans. * Voluntary early retirement incentives.

Virgil's Eclogues, trans. Len Krisak. Philadelphia: U of Pennsylvania P. p. vii. of the Latin poet Virgil. Background Taking as his generic model the Greek bucolic poetry of Theocritus, Virgil created a Roman version partly by offering a dramatic and mythic interpretation of revolutionary change at Rome in the turbulent period between roughly 44 and 38 BC. Virgil introduced political clamor largely absent from Theocritus' poems, called idylls (\\"little scenes\\" or \\"vignettes\\"), even though erotic turbulence disturbs the \\"idyllic\\" landscapes of Theocritus. Virgil's book contains ten pieces, each called not an idyll but an eclogue (\\"draft\\" or \\"selection\\" or \\"reckoning\\"), populated by and large with herdsmen imagined conversing and performing amoebaean singing in largely rural settings, whether suffering or embracing revolutionary change or happy or unhappy love. Performed with great success on the Roman stage, they feature a mix of visionary politics and eroticism that made Virgil a celebrity, legendary in his own lifetime. First page of an Italian translation of Eclogue 1, AD 1481  Structure and organization  Like the rest of Virgil's works, the Eclogues are composed in dactylic hexameter. It is likely that Virgil deliberately designed and arranged his book of Eclogues, in which case it is the first extant collection of Latin poems in the same meter put together by the poet. (Although it is thought that Catullus also compiled his book of poetry, it consists of poems written in different meters).Rudd, Niall (1976). Lines of Enquiry: Studies in Latin Poetry. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. p. 119.Clausen, Wendell (1994). Virgil: Eclogues. Clarendon, Oxford University Press. p. xxi. . Several scholars have attempted to identify the organizational/architectural principles underpinning the construction of the book. The book is arguably based on an alternation of antiphonal poems (e.g., dialogues) with non-dramatic/narrative poems.Goold, G. P. (1999), Virgil: Eclogues, Georgics, Aeneid 1‚Äì6. Loeb Classical Library. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press. p. 2. Rudd, Lines of Enquiry, pp. 121 ff. Beyond this, there have been many attempts (with little consensus) to identify other organizational principles. Many of these attempts have been catalogued and critiqued by Niall Rudd.Rudd, Lines of Enquiry, pp. 119 ff. Rudd refuted a number of cruder organizational theories, including theories that the Eclogues are organized * in chronological orderRudd, Lines of Enquiry, pp. 125 ff., citing R. Helm in Bursians Jahresbericht (1902) and W. Port in Phililogus 81 (1926). * by geographic setting, with Italian settings alternating with non- Italian settingsRudd, Lines of Enquiry, pp. 121 ff., citing R. S. Conway, Harvard Lectures on the Vergilian Age (1928), p. 139. * into two halves, each featuring a movement from lighter, more peaceful poems to heavier, more emphatic and agitated poemsRudd, Lines of Enquiry, pp. 121 ff., citing B√ºchner. Rudd also identified more-convoluted organizational theories. While considering these more plausible than the above, he concluded that \\"each system has at least one defect, and none is so superior to the others as to be obviously Virgil's own\\".Rudd, Lines of Enquiry, pp. 141 ff. Such systems include: * arrangement based on mutually supporting principles, such as topical and arithmetic correspondences * arrangement into a series of pairs of poems, bracketing Eclogue 5 with the balancing Eclogue 10 and supported by arithmetical correspondence (i.e., length of poems) * arrangement into two halves, with corresponding pairs based on length More recently, Thomas K. Hubbard has noted, \\"The first half of the book has often been seen as a positive construction of a pastoral vision, whilst the second half dramatizes progressive alienation from that vision, as each poem of the first half is taken up and responded to in reverse order.\\"Hubbard, Thomas K. (1998). The Pipes of Pan: Intertextuality and Literary Filiation in the Pastoral Tradition from Theocritus to Milton. Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press. p. 46. Eclogue 1 A dialogue between Tityrus and Meliboeus. In the turmoil of the era Meliboeus has been forced off his land and faces an uncertain future. Tityrus recounts his journey to Rome and the \\"god\\" he met there who answered his plea and allowed him to remain on his land. He offers to let Meliboeus spend the night with him. Eclogue 2 A monologue by the shepherd Corydon bemoaning his unrequited love for Alexis in the height of summer. Eclogue 3 A singing competition between Menalcas and Damoetas. Palaemon is the judge and pronounces the contest a tie. Eclogue 4 Capping a sequence or cycle in which Virgil created and augmented a new political mythology, Eclogue 4 reaches out to imagine a golden age ushered in by the birth of a boy heralded as \\"great increase of Jove\\" (magnum Iovis incrementum), which ties in with divine associations claimed in the propaganda of Octavian, the ambitious young heir to Julius Caesar. The poet makes this notional scion of Jove the occasion to predict his own metabasis up the scale in epos, rising from the humble range of the bucolic to the lofty range of the heroic, potentially rivaling Homer: he thus signals his own ambition to make Roman epic that will culminate in the Aeneid. In the surge of ambition, Virgil also projects defeating the legendary poet Orpheus and his mother, the epic muse Calliope, as well as Pan, the inventor of the bucolic pipe, even in Pan's homeland of Arcadia, which Virgil will claim as his own at the climax of his eclogue book in the tenth eclogue. Biographical identification of the fourth eclogue's child has proved elusive; but the figure proved a link between traditional Roman authority and Christianity. The connection is first made in the Oration of ConstantineOration of Constantine appended to the Life of Constantine by Eusebius of Caesarea (a reading to which Dante makes fleeting reference in his Purgatorio). Some scholars have also remarked similarities between the eclogue's prophetic themes and the words of Isaiah 11:6: \\"a little child shall lead\\". Eclogue 5 Eclogue 5 articulates another significant pastoral theme, the shepherd-poet's concern with achieving worldly fame through poetry. This concern is related to the metabasis Virgil himself undertakes thematically in Eclogue 4. In Eclogue 5, the shepherds Menalcas and Mopsus mourn their deceased companion Daphnis by promising to \\"praise ... Daphnis to the stars ‚Äì / yes, to the stars raise Daphnis\\". Menalcas and Mopsus praise Daphnis out of compassion but also out of obligation. Daphnis willed that his fellow shepherds memorialize him by making a \\"mound and add[ing] above the mound a song: / Daphnis am I in woodland, known hence far as the stars\\". Not only are Daphnis's survivors concerned with solidifying and eternizing his poetic reputation, but the dead shepherd-poet himself is involved in self-promotion from beyond the grave through the aegis of his will. It is an outgrowth of the friendly poetic rivalries that occur between them and of their attempts to best the gods, usually Pan or Phoebus, at their lyric craft. At the end of Eclogue 5, Daphnis is deified in the shepherds' poetic praise: \\"A god, a god is he, Menalcas!' / ... Here are four altars: / Look, Daphnis, two for you and two high ones for Phoebus.\\" Menalcas apostrophizes Daphnis with a promise: \\"Always your honor, name and praises will endure.\\" Ensuring poetic fame is a fundamental interest of the shepherds in classical pastoral elegies, including the speaker in Milton's \\"Lycidas\\".Lee, Guy, trans. (1984). \\"Eclogue 5\\". In Virgil, The Eclogues. New York: Penguin. pp. 29‚Äì35. Eclogue 8 This eclogue is also known as Pharmaceutria (\\"Sorceress\\"). Eclogue 10 In Eclogue 10, Virgil caps his book by inventing a new myth of poetic authority and origin: he replaces Theocritus' Sicily and old bucolic hero, the impassioned oxherd Daphnis, with the impassioned voice of his contemporary Roman friend, the elegiac poet Gaius Cornelius Gallus, imagined dying of love in Arcadia. Virgil transforms this remote, mountainous, and myth-ridden region of Greece, homeland of Pan, into the original and ideal place of pastoral song, thus founding a richly resonant tradition in western literature and the arts. This eclogue is the origin of the phrase omnia vincit amor (\\"love conquers all\\").

It resembles the Eiffel Tower and was used as an observation tower as well as a transmission tower. Today the tower is a major tourist attraction. Description Pet≈ô√≠n Lookout Tower at night The Pet≈ô√≠n Hill is roughly a half-hour walk up paths and the tower is also quite an arduous climb; however, the hill is served by a frequent Pet≈ô√≠n funicular and the tower has an elevator for elderly and disabled people. In 2014 the tower was visited by more than 557,000 visitors, with foreigners accounting for over 70% of said visitors. The two observation platforms are accessible via 299 stairs in sections of 13 per flight running around the inside of the structure. A pair of staircases form a double-helix structure allowing visitors travelling up and down concurrently. There are a gift shop and a small cafeteria on the main level. On the lowest level is a small exhibition area. One exhibition displayed Merkur Observation Towers and was held from 6 March 2013 to 30 March 2014. Comparisons to the Eiffel Tower Pet≈ô√≠n Lookout Tower is often described as small version of the Eiffel Tower. In contrast to the Eiffel Tower, Pet≈ô√≠n Lookout Tower has an octagonal, not square, cross-section. Further, it does not stand, as does the Eiffel Tower, on four columns of lattice steel. The whole area under its legs is covered with the entrance hall. A similarity between the Eiffel Tower and Pet≈ô√≠n Lookout Tower is the design of the lowest cross beams in the form of round bones. History In 1889, members of the Club of Czech Tourists visited the world exposition in Paris and were inspired by the Eiffel Tower. They collected a sufficient amount of money and in March 1891 the building of the tower started for the World's Jubilee Exhibition. It was finished in only four months. The tower had a lift for six people, first on a gas train, later on an electric drive. In 1953, a television transmitter was set up in the tower and the lift was removed, the tube was filled with cables and power supply. In 1953, a television broadcasting antenna was installed on Pet≈ô√≠n Lookout Tower, the program feed performed by a directional radio antenna. This served as Prague's television signal provider until the opening of the ≈Ωi≈ækov Television Tower in late 1992. The tower was closed for public during reconstruction in 1979‚Äì1992. In 1999‚Äì2002, the tower was again completely reconstructed and a new lift for disabled and elderly people was installed. From 21 January 2013 the tower has been operated by City of Prague Museum.

Then a subset B of A is said to be cofinal if it satisfies the following condition: :For every a ‚àà A, there exists some b ‚àà B such that a ‚â§ b. This definition is most commonly applied when A is a partially ordered set or directed set under the relation ‚â§. Cofinal subsets are very important in the theory of directed sets and nets, where ‚Äúcofinal subnet‚Äù is the appropriate generalization of ‚Äúsubsequence‚Äù. They are also important in order theory, including the theory of cardinal numbers, where the minimum possible cardinality of a cofinal subset of A is referred to as the cofinality of A. A subset B of A is said to be coinitial (or dense in the sense of forcing) if it satisfies the following condition: :For every a ‚àà A, there exists some b ‚àà B such that b ‚â§ a. This is the order-theoretic dual to the notion of cofinal subset. Note that cofinal and coinitial subsets are both dense in the sense of appropriate (right- or left-) order topology.  Properties  The cofinal relation over partially ordered sets (\\"posets\\") is reflexive: every poset is cofinal in itself. It is also transitive: if B is a cofinal subset of a poset A, and C is a cofinal subset of B (with the partial ordering of A applied to B), then C is also a cofinal subset of A. For a partially ordered set with maximal elements, every cofinal subset must contain all maximal elements, otherwise a maximal element that is not in the subset would fail to be less than or equal to any element of the subset, violating the definition of cofinal. For a partially ordered set with a greatest element, a subset is cofinal if and only if it contains that greatest element (this follows, since a greatest element is necessarily a maximal element). Partially ordered sets without greatest element or maximal elements admit disjoint cofinal subsets. For example, the even and odd natural numbers form disjoint cofinal subsets of the set of all natural numbers. If a partially ordered set A admits a totally ordered cofinal subset, then we can find a subset B that is well-ordered and cofinal in A.  Cofinal set of subsets  A particular but important case is given if A is a subset of the power set P(E) of some set E, ordered by reverse inclusion (‚äá). Given this ordering of A, a subset B of A is cofinal in A if for every a ‚àà A there is a b ‚àà B such that a ‚äá b. For example, let E be a group and let A be the set of normal subgroups of finite index. The profinite completion of E is defined to be the inverse limit of the inverse system of finite quotients of E (which are parametrized by the set A). In this situation, every cofinal subset of A is sufficient to construct and describe the profinite completion of E.

Collins Crime Club ‚Äì A checklist of First Editions. Dragonby Press (Second Edition) March 1999 (p. 15) and in the US by Dodd, Mead and Company the following year. The UK edition retailed at sixteen shillings (16/-) and the US edition at $4.50. It features the detective Miss Marple. Miss Marple takes a two-week vacation in London, at Bertram's Hotel, where she stayed in her youth. The hotel has a personality of its own, and a niche clientele of important church people, older women who lived through the Edwardian age, and girls looking for a safe place to stay in London. Miss Marple enjoys her trips around London, and learns that she cannot go back: life moves forward. She witnesses the complex lives of an estranged mother and daughter and as always works with the police to solve crimes. Reviews at the time of publication considered the denouement too far-fetched, but that it has \\"phenomenal zest and makes a reasonably snug read.\\" Another reviewer called it \\"an ingenious mystery\\" reliant on Christie's skillful writing style. A review in 1990 found the plot \\"creaky\\" but praised the \\"hotel atmosphere\\" which \\"is very well conveyed and used.\\" The character Elvira Blake was drawn well, and the careful description of the way older people look in 1965 compared to earlier eras, showed that Christie's \\"sharp eye had not dimmed\\". Plot summary Miss Marple is taking a two-week vacation in London, at Bertram's Hotel, courtesy of her nephew Raymond West. In her youth, she had stayed at this hotel. Since the war, the hotel has been renovated to create a distinct Edwardian era atmosphere with the best of modern conveniences and the best staff. Miss Marple encounters a friend taking tea, Lady Selina Hazy. Selina is on the lookout for friends, yet often mistakes people who look like her old friends. Miss Marple sees the famous adventuress Bess Sedgwick, plus her daughter, the young and beautiful Elvira Blake with her legal guardian Colonel Luscombe. She also meets the forgetful clergyman, Canon Pennyfather. American tourists consider the hotel as really English. She sees race driver Ladislaus Malinowski stop at the desk, and several times notices his car. She sees him with Elvira Blake. Elvira will inherit money from her father when she turns 21. Her mother is alive, but estranged by choice from Elvira. Elvira seeks to learn the size of her inheritance and who gets it if she dies. Lawyer Richard Egerton, one of her trustees, tells her about the great wealth awaiting her. She works a scheme with her friend Bridget to gain money to fly to Ireland to find some unspecified information, and goes there. It is unclear if she returns by train or by air. On the same day that Elvira travels to Ireland, Canon Pennyfather is to attend a conference in Lucerne. He fails to go to the airport the day before, going on the day of the conference instead, with a now useless airline ticket. He returns to Bertram's around midnight, disturbing intruders in his bedroom. He awakens four days later in a house far from London, and near the location of a recent overnight robbery of the Irish Mail train. He recuperates with a family unknown to him. His concussion blocks his memory of events. In an odd coincidence, some witnesses of the train robbery report seeing him on the train. When Archdeacon Simmons arrives and Pennyfather is still not home, he calls the police. Inspector Campbell is assigned the case, and is soon joined by Chief Inspector Davy, who sees links to unsolved crimes. After the sergeant questions everyone at the hotel, Davy comes to ask more questions. He encounters Miss Marple; her observations of the hotel having an ambiance not just of the Edwardian era but of unreality match his. She tells him of seeing Canon Pennyfather at 3 am after she thought he had gone to Lucerne. She also tells him what she overheard while sitting in a public part of the hotel. Bess Sedgwick spoke with the hotel commissionaire Michael Gorman about their mutual past in loud voices. They had once been married in Ireland, which her family ended by parting them. She thought the wedding was not a legal marriage. But it was genuine, and her four further marriages were unwittingly bigamous. On Miss Marple's last day at the hotel, speaking with Davy, they hear two shots ring out, followed by screams outdoors. Elvira Blake is discovered next to the corpse of Gorman. Elvira says he has been shot dead while shielding her from the gunfire. The gun belongs to Malinowski. Davy calls Miss Marple and Pennyfather back to London. She is in her room and he enacts his likely movements when she saw him in the hallway. She realises she saw a younger man, though with Pennyfather's appearance, and recalls the German term doppelganger. This jogs Pennyfather's memory; he remembers he saw himself sitting on a chair in his own hotel room, just before he was knocked unconscious. The criminal gang was counting on his absence, and reacted violently on his appearance. Davy and Miss Marple confront Bess Sedgwick as the orchestrator of these daring robberies, along with the ma√Ætre d'h√¥tel Henry, and Ladislaus Malinowski when fast cars were needed. The hotel staff co-operated, and the owners handled the money side of the thefts. Bess confesses not only to this, but also to the murder of Gorman. Making a run for it, Bess steals a car and speeds away recklessly, crashing fatally. Elvira was the second person in that public room, overhearing the conversation between her mother and Gorman. She thinks it invalidates Sedgwick's marriage to Lord Coniston, and marks her as illegitimate and not the heiress. She wants to be wealthy so Ladislaus will marry her. However, her father's will names her explicitly, information she never learned. Miss Marple is not convinced Bess killed Gorman. She believes that Elvira killed him. Davy agrees and will not let her get away with the murder.

References to actual places or events Bertram's Hotel is popularly believed to have been inspired by Brown's Hotel, in London, where Agatha Christie often stayed when visiting London. However, the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography claims that Christie's model was a different Mayfair hotel, Flemings Mayfair. The Great Train Robbery (1963) was a background influence. Literary significance and reception In The Guardian of 17 December 1965, Francis Iles (Anthony Berkeley Cox) said that, \\"At Bertram's Hotel can hardly be called a major Agatha Christie [novel], for in spite of the presence of Miss Marples (sic) the denouement is really too far- fetched. But does the plot matter so much with Mrs Christie? What does matter is that one just can't put any book of hers down.\\" Maurice Richardson in The Observer of 12 December 1965 said, \\"A C is seldom at her best when she goes thrillerish on you. This one is a bit wild and far-fetched, but it's got plenty of that phenomenal zest and makes a reasonably snug read.\\" Robert Weaver in the Toronto Daily Star of 8 January 1966 said, \\"At Bertram's Hotel is vintage Agatha Christie: an ingenious mystery that triumphantly gets away with what in lesser hands would be the most outrageous coincidences.\\" This novel was listed on Anthony Boucher's Best Crime Novels of the Year for 1966, one of thirteen listed that year. Brigid Brophy complained that the author offered \\"nothing like enough signposts to give the reader a chance to beat Miss Marple or the police to the solution\\". Robert Barnard said of this novel that \\"The plot is rather creaky, as in most of the late ones, but the hotel atmosphere is very well conveyed and used. Elvira Blake is one of the best observed of the many young people in late Christie. Note the reflections in chapter 5 in the novel on the changed look of elderly people, showing that the sharp eye had not dimmed, even if the narrative grasp was becoming shaky.\\" Publication history * 1965, Collins Crime Club (London), 15 November 1965, Hardcover, 256 pp * 1966, Dodd, Mead and Company (New York), 1966, Hardcover, 272 pp * 1967, Pocket Books (New York), Paperback, 180 pp * 1967, Fontana Books (Imprint of HarperCollins), Paperback, 192 pp * 1968, Ulverscroft Large- print Edition, Hardcover, 256 pp * 1972, Greenway edition of collected works (William Collins), Hardcover, 253 pp * 1973, Greenway edition of collected works (Dodd Mead), Hardcover, 253 pp * 2006, Marple Facsimile edition HarperCollins (Facsimile of 1965 Collins Crime Club first edition), 6 March 2006, Hardcover, The novel was first serialised in the UK weekly magazine Woman's Own in five abridged instalments from 20 November to 18 December 1965 illustrated with specially posed photographic layouts by Abis Sida Stribley.

Film, TV or theatrical adaptations A BBC television film adaptation from 1987 starred Joan Hickson in the title role as Miss Marple. ITV broadcast its adaptation on 23 September 2007 as part of the third series of Marple, starring Geraldine McEwan. This version included many substantial changes to the plot, characters, atmosphere and the finale of the original novel, and added overtly contemporary social themes: * A number of the characters in the novel were removed from the adaptation : Mrs McCrae; Archdeacon Simmons; Robert Hoffman; Miss Gorringe; Rose Sheldon; Colonel Derek Luscombe; Chief- Inspector Fred \\"Father\\" Davy; Inspector Campbell; Sergeant Wadell; Mr Robinson. * The adaptation added a large amount of new characters: ** Inspector Larry Bird - The new Chief of Investigations, who slowly accepts help from Miss Marple to solve the murders. Played by Stephen Mangan. ** Jane Cooper - Hotel Maid and assistant to Miss Marple. Forms an attachment to Larry Bird and falls in love with him at the end. Played by Martine McCutcheon. ** Tilly Rice - Hotel Maid, close friend to Mickey Gorman, and a blackmailer. Blackmails the killer. ** Hubert Curtain - Solicitor overseeing the Blake estate of Bess' late ex-husband. Involved in embezzlement and the handling of stolen artwork. Played by Peter Davison. ** Mutti - Fashion designer of German and Jewish background. Secretly seeking out a Nazi Officer who is on the run, and owner of several pieces of stolen artwork. Played by Danny Webb. ** Jack Bittern / Joel Bittern - Identical twins, who operate as thieves. Can be distinguished by where they wear their wristwatches. ** Amelia Walker - Singer, seeking to purchase artwork at the hotel. **Louis Armstrong - Jazz musician and old friend of Amelia's. *The main sub-plot was changed, in which the hotel is now an operation centre for smuggling Nazi war criminals to safety with stolen identities, in exchange for stolen art treasures they took. Mr Humfries and Hubert are involved in the scheme, hanging the stolen pieces in plain sight in the hotel; art and furniture in hotels is usually reproduction, Miss Marple explains, so it would be safe from both the law and thieves. The art disappears from the hotel when it is sold. Ladislaus Malinowski is a concentration camp prisoner turned Nazi hunter; he works with Mutti and Bess Sedgewick, and together they reveal the hotel guest known as \\"Canon Pennyfather\\" is in fact Herman Koch, a Nazi on the run. Miss Marple confirms that he was using the identity of the real Canon Pennyfather (away on holiday), pointing out he acted like a priest from a play while making mistakes in his deception such as only quoting from Psalms. Mutti recovers the artworks stolen from him, including one that Amelia Walker attempts to take. * A new sub-plot was added - London is hit by a spate of robberies, and during Gorman's murder, Lady Selina's jewels go missing. Miss Marple reveals that the theft was committed by the Bittern Twins, involved in the other robberies. Whilst one of the brothers posed as both, the other stole the jewels, but the brother posing as both made the mistake of not switching their wristwatch to the other wrist, which exposed their scheme, and leads to their arrests. * Elvira's motivation is changed. She and Malinowski are no longer seriously interested in each other: Malinowski backs off when he realises Elvira is Bess's daughter; Elvira reproaches her mother for this, but never mentions the matter again. Her emotional attachment in the adaptation is to her friend, Brigit Milford (the novel's Bridget), whose role is expanded. Several years earlier, Elvira wanted to go swimming in a river; she pressured Brigit into getting in, but backed out from getting in herself. The river was contaminated, and Brigit contracted polio, which led to her losing all use of her right hand. Elvira blames herself for causing this, and now tries to make Brigit's life more comfortable where possible. Miss Marple's denouement reveals, \\"If Brigit was to enjoy any quality of life, [Elvira] would need a great deal of money\\" - and this meant any obstacle to her inheritance had to be removed. Gorman's murder remains the same, but a new murder victim is added - Tilly Rice. Tilly was blackmailing Elvira about the secret of her mother's first marriage, so Elvira killed her. Her murder was always planned after Gorman's murder, not the other way around as the police assumed; Miss Marple correctly deduces this. * Gorman's murder was modified to coincide with a new motive. Gorman is killed by a sniper, under the belief he is protecting Elvira from them. In reality, Elvira was the sniper, and Brigit was dressed up as her to make the hotel's guest believe she was returning to the hotel. Elvira used her knowledge of the hotel to secretly make her way out and behind Brigit, whilst dressed as a maid. The pair then swapped over, Brigit handing over a gun she used as part of the deception. Miss Marple deduces all this before pointing out that they both made a mistake that gave them away - Brigit used her left hand to fire at the \\"non-existent\\" sniper, but when Elvira took over, she proceeded to fire with her right hand. * Lady Bess tries to take the blame during the denouement, but she does not run away and die in a car accident. She is forced to back down, and Elvira and Brigit then confess. Mother and daughter then apologise for wronging each other. In a side-plot, Bess had been receiving death threats prior to the death of Gorman, which made the police think she was the real target of the sniper; Miss Marple reveals that they had been coming from Elvira, that Bess had quickly realised where they had come from, and that Bess had deliberately planted one in Mr Curtain's desk to try to deflect suspicion away from Elvira.

The high school is located on the Red Lake Indian Reservation on which members of the Red Lake Band of Chippewa (Ojibwe) Indians live, and has over 300 students. The school's mascots are the Ogichidaag and Ogichidaakwag (warriors and lady warriors). The school also hosts its own radio station, Ka- MOD (94.1 FM). The school is a part of Red Lake School District (Independent School District #38). Public education first began in Red Lake with the formation of School District 119. In 1935 ground was broken on the construction of what is now Red Lake High School, with the doors first opening to students in 1936. The school became well known after the 2005 shooting, receiving much attention in the media and internet. 2005 shooting On March 21, 2005, 16-year-old Jeff Weise, a former student at the school, drove his grandfather's patrol vehicle to Red Lake High School. He first shot and killed the school security guard Derrick Brun, before proceeding through the school main hallway. He then entered an English classroom where he shot and killed three students and one teacher, and wounded three students. He later left the classroom and killed two students in the school main hallway. He later engaged in a brief shoot-out with police in a classroom. No officers were wounded. He then committed suicide inside a classroom by a shotgun-wound to the head. Weise had killed seven people inside the school, and had previously murdered his grandfather and his grandfather's companion at his home. Ojibwe culture Red Lake High School students can sign up for Ojibwe language classes (the language is also taught in elementary and middle schools in the district) and have a chance to learn Ojibwe traditions from community elders. A culture center, opened in 2004, is furnished in Ojibwe style. Decorations include carved animal symbols of the seven clans of the Red Lake Band (bear, turtle, bullhead, mink, eagle, pine marten and kingfisher) placed on a high shelf running around the room, and the words for the four directions carved into the walls.

Life Gislebertus first worked at Cluny, most likely as a chief assistant to the master of Cluny in 1115. His work reflects many of the biblical scenes as depicted in the bible, capturing their raw emotions. Gislebertus was taught about Jesus's compassion, and how he was loving and caring, this reflects in some of his art works around the cathedral. Originally the cathedral was created as a hospital for lepers, which were seen as diseased and almost forsaken in a sense. The reliefs at the front of the cathedral reflect imagery which would be appealing to the lepers, giving them hope. He contributed to the decorations the Abbey of Cluny. After concluding his training at Cluny he set off to V√©zelay, where he created the tympanum above the portico. His sculpture is expressive and imaginative: from the terrifying Last Judgment which depicts Jesus's return to Earth, judging all souls (dead and alive) on whether or not they spend eternity in heaven or hell. (West Tympanum), with its strikingly elongated figures, to the Eve (North Portal), the first large scale nude in European art since antiquity and a model of sinuous grace. His influence can be traced to other French church sculpture, and his techniques helped pave the way for the Gothic style. Style The name Gislebertus, the Latin for \\"Gilbert\\" (and for other \\"Gilberts\\" more usually spelt as the variants above), is found carved on the west tympanum of Autun Cathedral: Gislebertus hoc fecit or \\"Gislebertus made this.\\"Getty List of artists Some scholars today believe that this is actually the name of the patron who commissioned the work, rather than that of the artist. The lead sculptor would in any case have had a number of assistants, though the distinctive designs may well have been the work of a single hand. Gislebertus' name is the first ever found on stone work from the Romanesque period, as the sculptors before him believed themselves to be working for God, instead of themselves being creative individuals. On the other hand, as Grivot and Zarnecki state: Fernand Auberjonois writes that shortly after the mid-18th century the Church \\"did considerable artistic 'house cleaning' ... replacing Romanesque carvings looked on as barbaric with ornaments more suited to the era's new-found Greco-Roman taste.\\" Clergy removed the head of Christ in order to smoothly plaster over the tympanum of the west front. Carvings above the tympanum of 24 Patriarchs and Prophets were completely removed. Auberjonois explains that \\"The north portal of St. Lazare suffered even more grievous harm. Here Gislebertus had portrayed the resurrection of Lazarus, as well as Satan, Adam, and a magnificent Eve whose gesture at the moment she picks the fatal apple is an unrivaled example of absent-minded detachment. Of the main figures that adorned this entrance, only Eve has survived. She disappeared for years, having been carted down to the foot of the hill where the large stone on which she is carved served as building material for a house constructed in 1769. There she remained hidden for a century until that dwelling in turn was torn down.\\" Eve is considered one of the greatest art works in the Western tradition. It is the first large scale nude sculpture produced since Roman times. T. S. R. Boase, President of Magdalen College, Oxford, said \\"Eve has a seductive quality that no other 12th-century artist has equaled. If the other block (Adam) had survived, we would most certainly have had in it the completion of a great masterpiece\\"Introduction to Giselbertus, Sculptor of Autun, The Orion Press, 1961 The Giselbertus Adam & Eve Alabasters in the collection of the Yuko Nii Foundation, 12th-18th centuriesThe Yuko Nii Foundation alabasters of Adam and Eve recently came to light; these 12th- century versions of the Autun Cathedral Adam and Eve lintels may be the only surviving replica of this Giselbertus Adam masterpiece, which makes it significant. No other drawings or other copies of the Giselbertus Adam have been seen in our time in any library or museum. In 1837, archaeologists freed The Last Judgment from the mortar and in 1858, the architectural restorer Viollet-le-Duc restored the tympanum by replacing lost or damaged sculptures with copies, leaving the head of Christ unrestored. In 1948, St. Lazare's choir-master Abbe Denis Grivot, proved what he and others had suspected. A head of Christ in a nearby museum was the sculpture that had been removed 200 years previously. Grivot found that the sculpture fit perfectly into the tympanum. Other sculptures remain missing.Auberjonois, Fernand, \\"Gislebertus Hoc Fecit,\\" Horizon, September 1961, vol IV, No. 1, pp 46-57.

It was first recorded in 1959 and released on the 1960 album Giant Steps. The composition features a cyclic chord pattern that has come to be known as Coltrane changes. The composition has become a jazz standard and has been covered by many artists. Background \\"Giant Steps\\" was composed and recorded during Coltrane's 1959 sessions for Atlantic Records, his first for the label. The original recording features Coltrane on tenor saxophone, Paul Chambers on double bass, Tommy Flanagan on piano, and Art Taylor on drums. John Coltrane was known for coming into the studio with unrehearsed songs, and \\"Giant Steps\\" was no exception. On the original recording, Flanagan played a choppy start-stop solo where it sounds like he is struggling to improvise over Coltrane changes without adequate preparation. Flanagan revisited \\"Giant Steps\\" on several recordings later in his career, including an album named after the song which he dedicated to Coltrane. In some of the alternate takes, Cedar Walton is at the piano, declining to take a solo and also playing at a slower tempo than the takes with Flanagan. John Coltrane named \\"Giant Steps\\" after its bass line. He stated that \\"the bass line is kind of a loping one. It goes from minor thirds to fourths, kind of a lop-sided pattern in contrast to moving strictly in fourths or in half-steps.\\" It took two recording sessions two months apart before John Coltrane was willing to release his original rendition of \\"Giant Steps\\" to the public. An analysis of Coltrane's solo reveals that he worked out melodic patterns over the changes in advance, which he deployed during his recorded improvisation. Musical characteristics From beginning to end, \\"Giant Steps\\" follows alternating modulations of major third and augmented fifth intervals. Its structure primarily contains II - V - I harmonic progressions (often with chord substitutions) circulating in thirds. The chords and patterns in \\"Giant Steps\\" reflect those found in Coltrane's compositions \\"Central Park West\\" and \\"Countdown\\", and his version of the Gershwins' song, \\"But Not For Me.\\" According to Quincy Jones, Coltrane was inspired by an example in Nicolas Slonimsky's Thesaurus of Scales and Melodic Patterns, stating: \\"Everyone thinks Coltrane wrote that, he didn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs Slonimsky. That book started all the jazz guys improvising in 12-tone. Coltrane carried that book around till the pages fell off\\". \\"Giant Steps\\" is usually played in a 'fast swing' style. Reception \\"Giant Steps\\" has been praised by critics and has become a jazz standard along with \\"Naima\\" from the same album. According to Lindsay Planer, \\"Giant Steps\\" was a \\"crucial touchstone in the progression of Coltrane‚Äôs music\\". She also highlighted the \\"tasteful synchronicity and thoroughly flexible pacing\\" of Paul Chambers and Art Taylor in the original recording, along with the \\"frenetic leads\\" by Flanagan and Coltrane. Recordings There are four released versions of \\"Giant Steps\\" from Coltrane's original 1959 sessions. All are collected on the Atlantic Masters CD Edition of Giant Steps released in 1998. Two versions, catalogued as alternative versions 1 and 2, feature Cedar Walton on piano and Lex Humphries on drums and were recorded on March 26, 1959. On May 5, 1959, two additional versions were recorded with Tommy Flanagan on piano and Art Taylor on drums. The take numbers are unknown for May 5, but one of the two versions became the master track for the original album. All recordings were made at Atlantic Studios, New York. The master studio recording was released on the 1960 album Giant Steps, which was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2001. \\"Giant Steps\\" has been covered by numerous artists, including Archie Shepp and Max Roach on The Long March (1979) and Henry Butler on his debut album Fivin' Around (1986), among others. According to AllMusic, Buddy Rich and McCoy Tyner are the artists who have made the highest number of recordings of this composition.\\"Giant Steps\\" - Also Performed By. AllMusic. Retrieved November 5, 2019. A cover version by Joey Alexander was nominated for Best Improvised Jazz Solo at the 58th Annual Grammy Awards. The tune is popular among Latin jazz musicians, having been covered by Jorge Dalto, Gonzalo Rubalcaba, Justo Almario & Alex Acu√±a, and Paquito D'Rivera, among others.

Geography and climate Stolbovoy Island's area is approximately 170 km¬≤. Its length is 47 km and its maximum width is 10 km. The northernmost point of the island was named Cape Toll, in honor of Russian explorer Eduard Toll. There is a 5 km long lake in the northeast of the island. It is separated from the sea by a narrow spit. There is a 13 km long river, the Stolbovoy River, running northwards across the central part of the island. The highest point of Stolbovoy Island is 222 meters. The island has 15‚Äì70 m high rocky cliffs, the lower relief down to the beach being dominated by conical mound-like stony structures. The climate in the area is exceptionally severe, with prolonged, bitter winters, so that the waters of the Laptev Sea around Stolbovoy Island are covered by ice most of the year. Geology Tectonically deformed sedimentary rocks that accumulated during Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous periods comprise Stolbovoy Island. These turbidites, which contain the fossils of marine pelecypods, consist of beds of sandstone coarsely and rhythmically interbedded with beds of siltstone and argillite. These rocks have been folded into a synclinal structure, thrust faulted, and intruded by small quartz diorite dikes.Kos‚Äôko, M.K., B.G. Lopatin, and V.G.

It is named after San Francisco, where sourdough was found to contain the variety, though it is not endemic to the area. In fact, L. sanfranciscensis has been used in sourdough breads for thousands of years, and is used in 3 million tons of sourdough goods yearly.> Sourdough starters are leavened by a mixture of yeast and lactobacilli in a ratio of about 1:100. The yeast is most commonly Candida humilis. This yeast cannot metabolize the maltose found in the dough, while the Lactobacillus requires maltose. They therefore act without conflict for substrate, with the Lactobacillus utilizing maltose and the yeast utilizing the other sugars, including the glucose produced by the Lactobacillus. External conditions such as acidity and temperature affect the growth rates of Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis. One study found that of temperature of 33 ¬∞C (91 ¬∞F) leads to maximum growth rates, whereas temperatures over 41 ¬∞C (105 ¬∞F) completely inhibit the bacteria growth. Ideal and maximum growth temperatures of other organisms may be quite different; for instance a common yeast in sourdough, Candida milleri, prefers 27 ¬∞C (81 ¬∞F) and will not grow above 36 ¬∞C (97 ¬∞F). For commercial use, specific strains of the L. sanfranciscensis are grown on defined media, freeze-dried, and shipped to bakeries worldwide.

It was a complex calculation which equated to a reduction of approximately 66% of the UK's net contribution ‚Äì the amount paid by the UK into the EU budget less receipts from the EU budget. Based on a net contribution of ‚Ç¨11.7 (¬£9.6) billion in 2016, the UK Treasury estimated the 2017 rebate amounted to ‚Ç¨6.6 (¬£5.6) billion reducing the ultimate UK contribution for the 2017 budget to ‚Ç¨10.4 (¬£8.9) billion. Although the rebate was not set in the EU treaties, it was negotiated as part of the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) every seven years and had to be unanimously agreed. History In April 1970 the six founding member states of the then European Communities (EC) adopted the so-called 'own resources system' as the means of funding the EC budget. Under this system, revenues were to flow automatically to the EC budget rather than through agreement of the national parliaments, as had been the case until then, and calculated based on three elements: * Customs duties collected on imports from the rest of the world * Agricultural resources * VAT base. As the UK's VAT base in comparison with gross national product (GNP) was proportionally higher than in other member states, and the UK was more open than other member states to trade with non-EC countries, this system implied a disproportionate contribution by the UK when it joined the EEC in 1973. Additionally, the fact that around 70 per cent of the EC budget was used to finance the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), and that the UK had a small agricultural sector meant that the UK gained few receipts under the EEC's redistributive policies. To address this, at the Fontainebleau European Council in June 1984 Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher successfully negotiated the UK Rebate which was adopted in the May 1985 European Council decision. It was in place until the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union. In 2005, Prime Minister Tony Blair agreed to exclude from the calculation most enlargement-related expenditure (with a progressive phasing-in of the change from 2009 onwards), so as to contribute to the financing of the enlargements to the European Union, with the accession of Central and Eastern European states, that the country itself had strongly supported. The objective was to address what was widely perceived as an unfair effect of the rebate, since the original mechanism would have resulted in the UK contributing little to the costs of enlargement. These changes were adopted in the June 2007 European Council decision. Calculation and mechanics Calculating the size of the UK's annual rebate was complex. Broadly, the UK got back 66% of the difference between its share of member states' VAT contributions and its share of EU spending in return. The European Commission set out the detailed calculations in a working document. The calculation of the rebate for any one year was budgeted and paid for the following year, and the payments were subject to revision for up to three further years. There was no transfer of money from the European Commission to the UK Treasury involved; the effect of the rebate was to reduce the size of the UK's payments. The effect of the rebate was to increase contributions required from all other member states, to make up the loss from the overall budget. Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden and Austria all had their contribution to make up for the rebate capped to 25% of the figure which would otherwise apply. Pressure for change There had been growing pressure in recent years before Brexit from various EU member states for the rebate to be scrapped. This was partly because the recent additional member states of the EU, which are considerably poorer than the fifteen pre-2004 states, are a considerable expense on the CAP and the EU budget in general. The view was put forward by many that this made the UK rebate harder to accommodate within the EU budget, leveraged with the moral argument that all the new entrants were substantially poorer than the UK. The new entrants, however, are likely to be net recipients of EU funds and not net contributors like the UK was, and only Germany makes a larger contribution to these poorer entrants. The rebate distorted UK funding negotiations with the EU. Normally, countries and independent agencies within each country bid to receive central EU funds. The UK government was aware that two-thirds of any EU funding would have in effect been deducted from the rebate and came out of UK government funds. Thus the UK had only a one-third incentive to apply for EU funds. Other countries, whose contributions into the budget are not affected by funds they receive back, have no incentive to moderate their requests for funds. Furthermore, many EU grants are conditional on the recipient finding a proportion of funding from local sources, frequently national or local government. This increased the proportion coming from UK government revenue even further. This had the effect of artificially reducing EU expenditure returning to the UK and worsening the deficit which the rebate was intended to redress. right The British government had resisted campaigns to abolish the rebate and the UK had a veto on any decision by the EU to do so. Former Prime Minister Tony Blair said that he would veto any attempt to scrap the rebate. He was supported by many in his Cabinet and by the main opposition party, the Conservatives, as well as the majority of the British public. Supporters of the rebate argued that the distortion created by the rebate is minor compared to that created by the Common Agricultural Policy, which is expensive and has implications for free and fair trade in the EU. In addition, they point out that without the rebate, the UK would pay much more into the EU than comparably wealthy countries like France, due to structural differences between their economies. , France got more than twice as much CAP funds as the UK (22% of total funds compared to the UK's 9%) which in cash terms is a net benefit that France gets over and above what the UK got from the CAP of ‚Ç¨6.37bn. In comparison, the UK budget rebate for 2005 was scheduled to be approx ‚Ç¨5.5bn. Agricultural expenditure for new member states is included in the 'other' segment of the graph. This was limited in 2004 to 25% of payment rates applying to existing member states, rising to 30% in 2005 and 100% in 2013. Total CAP expenditure is capped, so in the absence of further changes, payments to all the pre-2004 member countries will fall by 5% over this period. Some commentators claim that to a large extent, France gets twice the CAP payment that was received by the UK because it has twice the amount of farmland, although the extent to which there is a correlation between the two is disputed. right The underlying reason why the UK insisted on retaining its rebate is that if it were reduced with no change to the CAP, then in its view the UK would have been subsidising an inefficient French farming sector. However, France itself remains a net payer to the EU budget, contributing ‚Ç¨9.05 billion more than it received in 2013. If the rebate was removed without changes to the CAP then the UK would have paid a larger net contribution than France. The UK would have made a net contribution of approximately ‚Ç¨10bn compared to the historical contribution of ‚Ç¨3.86bn, versus a current French net contribution of ‚Ç¨6.46bn. Germany has a GDP approximately 25% higher than either France or the UK, but per capita income is comparable to the other two countries. France technically makes a net contribution to the EU budget about twice what the UK did, Data from different standpoints (absolute, per capita, as proportion of GDP) Explanation without the data tables: and was the greatest contributor towards the UK rebate, which means it would have benefited most from its abolition. If France was not required to contribute towards the rebate it would have still contributed more to the EU budget than the UK did. These contrasting positions led to deadlock at the June 2005 EU budget negotiations in Brussels. France and other states demanded the abolition of the UK rebate at this meeting. Britain dismissed this as a diplomatic manoeuvre by France to save face after their rejection of the European Constitution in a referendum two weeks before the meeting. The UK made CAP reform a prerequisite of removal of the rebate, a proposal their opponents rejected. The negotiations thus ended without an agreement being reached. In December 2005 the UK Prime Minister Tony Blair agreed to give up approximately 20% of the rebate for the period 2007‚Äì2013, on condition that the funds did not contribute to CAP payments, were matched by contributions from other countries and were only for the new member states. Spending on the CAP remained fixed, as had previously been agreed. Overall, this reduced the proportion of the budget spent on the CAP. It was agreed that the European Commission should conduct a full review of all EU spending. The withdrawal of the UK from the EU had led to renewed discussion of scrapping of the rebates, with European Commissioner for Budget and Human Resources G√ºnther Oettinger stating that \\"I want to propose a budget framework that does not only do without the mother of all rebates [the U.K.‚Äôs] but without all of its children as well\\".

More generally it is used as a generic name for analogues for complete commutative rings (including p-adic fields in particular) of Newton's method for solving equations. Since p-adic analysis is in some ways simpler than real analysis, there are relatively neat criteria guaranteeing a root of a polynomial.  Statement  Many equivalent statements of Hensel's lemma exist. Arguably the most common statement is the following. = General statement = Assume K is a field complete with respect to a normalised discrete valuation v. Suppose, furthermore, that \\\\mathcal{O}_K is the ring of integers of K (i.e. all elements of K with non-negative valuation), let \\\\pi\\\\in K be such that v(\\\\pi)=1 and let k=\\\\mathcal{O}_K/\\\\pi\\\\mathcal{O}_K denote the residue field. Let f(X)\\\\in\\\\mathcal{O}_K[X] be a polynomial with coefficients in \\\\mathcal{O}_K. If the reduction \\\\overline{f}(X)\\\\in k[X] has a simple root (i.e. there exists k_0\\\\in k such that \\\\overline{f}(k_0)=0 and \\\\overline{f'}(k_0) eq 0), then there exists a unique a\\\\in\\\\mathcal{O}_K such that f(a)=0 and the reduction \\\\overline{a}=k_0 in k.Serge Lang, Algebraic Number Theory, Addison-Wesley Publishing Company, 1970, p. 43 = Alternative statement = Another way of stating this (in less generality) is: let f(x) be a polynomial with integer (or p-adic integer) coefficients, and let m,k be positive integers such that m ‚â§ k. If r is an integer such that :f(r) \\\\equiv 0 \\\\bmod p^k \\\\quad \\\\text{and} \\\\quad f'(r) ot\\\\equiv 0 \\\\bmod p then there exists an integer s such that :f(s) \\\\equiv 0 \\\\bmod p^{k+m} \\\\quad \\\\text{and} \\\\quad r \\\\equiv s \\\\bmod p^k. Furthermore, this s is unique modulo pk+m, and can be computed explicitly as the integer such that :s = r - f(r)\\\\cdot a, where a is an integer satisfying :a \\\\equiv [f'(r)]^{-1} \\\\bmod p^m. Note that f(r) \\\\equiv 0 \\\\bmod p^k so that the condition s \\\\equiv r \\\\bmod p^k is met. As an aside, if f'(r) \\\\equiv 0 \\\\bmod p, then 0, 1, or several s may exist (see Hensel Lifting below). = Derivation = We use the Taylor expansion of f around r to write: :f(s) = \\\\sum_{n=0}^N c_n (s-r)^n, \\\\qquad c_n = f^{(n)}(r)/n!. From r \\\\equiv s \\\\bmod p^k, we see that s ‚àí r = tpk for some integer t. Let :\\\\begin{align} f(s) &= \\\\sum_{n=0}^N c_n \\\\left(tp^k\\\\right)^n  &= f(r) + t p^k f'(r) + \\\\sum_{n=2}^N c_n t^n p^{kn}  &= f(r) + t p^k f'(r) + p^{2k}t^2g(t) && g(t) \\\\in \\\\Z[t]  &= zp^k + t p^k f'(r) + p^{2k}t^2g(t) && f(r) \\\\equiv 0 \\\\bmod p^k  &= (z+tf'(r)) p^k + p^{2k}t^2g(t) \\\\end{align} For m \\\\leqslant k, we have: :\\\\begin{align} f(s) \\\\equiv 0 \\\\bmod p^{k+m} &\\\\Longleftrightarrow (z + tf'(r))p^k \\\\equiv 0 \\\\bmod p^{k+m}  &\\\\Longleftrightarrow z + tf'(r) \\\\equiv 0 \\\\bmod p^m  &\\\\Longleftrightarrow tf'(r) \\\\equiv -z \\\\bmod p^m  &\\\\Longleftrightarrow t \\\\equiv -z [f'(r)]^{-1} \\\\bmod p^m && p mid f'(r) \\\\end{align} The assumption that f'(r) is not divisible by p ensures that f'(r) has an inverse mod p^m which is necessarily unique. Hence a solution for t exists uniquely modulo p^m, and s exists uniquely modulo p^{k+m}. = Simple statement = For f \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z}_p[x], if there is a solution a_0 of f(a_0) \\\\equiv 0 \\\\bmod p and f'(x) \\\\equiv 0 \\\\bmod p has no solutions, then there exists a unique lift \\\\alpha \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z}_p such that f(\\\\alpha) = 0. Note that given a solution \\\\alpha \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z}_p where f(\\\\alpha) = 0, its projection to \\\\mathbb{Z}/p gives a solution to f(\\\\alpha) \\\\equiv 0 \\\\bmod p , so Hensel's lemma gives a way to take solutions \\\\bmod p and give a solution in \\\\mathbb{Z}_p.  Observations  Frobenius = Note that given an a \\\\in \\\\mathbb{F}_p the Frobenius endomorphism (-) \\\\mapsto (-)^p gives a polynomial x^p - a which always has zero derivative > \\\\begin{align} \\\\frac{d}{dx}x^p - a &= p\\\\cdot x^{p-1}  &\\\\equiv 0\\\\cdot > x^{p-1} \\\\bmod p  & \\\\equiv 0 \\\\bmod p \\\\end{align} hence the p-th roots of a do not exist in \\\\mathbb{Z}_p. For a = 1, this implies \\\\mathbb{Z}_p cannot contain the root of unity \\\\mu_p. = Roots of unity = Although the p-th roots of unity are not contained in \\\\mathbb{F}_p, there are solutions of x^p - x = x(x^{p-1} - 1). Note > \\\\begin{align} \\\\frac{d}{dx} x^p - x &= px - 1  &\\\\equiv -1 \\\\bmod p > \\\\end{align} is never zero, so if there exists a solution, it necessarily lifts to \\\\mathbb{Z}_p. Because the Frobenius gives a^p = a, all of the non-zero elements \\\\mathbb{F}_p^\\\\times are solutions. In fact, these are the only roots of unity contained in \\\\mathbb{Q}_p.  Hensel lifting  Using the lemma, one can \\"lift\\" a root r of the polynomial f modulo pk to a new root s modulo pk+1 such that r ‚â° s mod pk (by taking m=1; taking larger m follows by induction). In fact, a root modulo pk+1 is also a root modulo pk, so the roots modulo pk+1 are precisely the liftings of roots modulo pk. The new root s is congruent to r modulo p, so the new root also satisfies f'(s) \\\\equiv f'(r) ot\\\\equiv 0 \\\\bmod p. So the lifting can be repeated, and starting from a solution rk of f(x) \\\\equiv 0 \\\\bmod p^k we can derive a sequence of solutions rk+1, rk+2, ... of the same congruence for successively higher powers of p, provided f'(r_k) ot\\\\equiv 0 \\\\bmod p for the initial root rk. This also shows that f has the same number of roots mod pk as mod pk+1, mod p k+2, or any other higher power of p, provided the roots of f mod pk are all simple. What happens to this process if r is not a simple root mod p? Suppose :f(r) \\\\equiv 0 \\\\bmod p^k \\\\quad \\\\text{and} \\\\quad f'(r) \\\\equiv 0 \\\\bmod p. Then s \\\\equiv r \\\\bmod p^k implies f(s) \\\\equiv f(r) \\\\bmod p^{k+1}. That is, f(r + tp^k) \\\\equiv f(r)\\\\bmod p^{k+1} for all integers t. Therefore, we have two cases: *If f(r) ot\\\\equiv 0 \\\\bmod p^{k+1} then there is no lifting of r to a root of f(x) modulo pk+1. *If f(r) \\\\equiv 0 \\\\bmod p^{k+1} then every lifting of r to modulus pk+1 is a root of f(x) modulo pk+1. Example. To see both cases we examine two different polynomials with p = 2: f(x) = x^2 +1 and r = 1. Then f(1)\\\\equiv 0 \\\\bmod 2 and f'(1) \\\\equiv 0 \\\\bmod 2. We have f(1) ot\\\\equiv 0 \\\\bmod 4 which means that no lifting of 1 to modulus 4 is a root of f(x) modulo 4. g(x) = x^2 -17 and r = 1. Then g(1)\\\\equiv 0 \\\\bmod 2 and g'(1) \\\\equiv 0 \\\\bmod 2. However, since g(1) \\\\equiv 0 \\\\bmod 4, we can lift our solution to modulus 4 and both lifts (i.e. 1, 3) are solutions. The derivative is still 0 modulo 2, so a priori we don't know whether we can lift them to modulo 8, but in fact we can, since g(1) is 0 mod 8 and g(3) is 0 mod 8, giving solutions at 1, 3, 5, and 7 mod 8. Since of these only g(1) and g(7) are 0 mod 16 we can lift only 1 and 7 to modulo 16, giving 1, 7, 9, and 15 mod 16. Of these, only 7 and 9 give g(x) = 0 mod 32, so these can be raised giving 7, 9, 23, and 25 mod 32. It turns out that for every integer k ‚â• 3, there are four liftings of 1 mod 2 to a root of g(x) mod 2k.  Hensel's lemma for p-adic numbers  In the p-adic numbers, where we can make sense of rational numbers modulo powers of p as long as the denominator is not a multiple of p, the recursion from rk (roots mod pk) to rk+1 (roots mod pk+1) can be expressed in a much more intuitive way. Instead of choosing t to be an(y) integer which solves the congruence :tf'(r_k) \\\\equiv -(f(r_k)/p^{k})\\\\bmod p^m, let t be the rational number (the pk here is not really a denominator since f(rk) is divisible by pk): :-(f(r_k)/p^{k})/f'(r_k). Then set :r_{k+1} = r_k + tp^k = r_k - \\\\frac{f(r_k)}{f'(r_k)}. This fraction may not be an integer, but it is a p-adic integer, and the sequence of numbers rk converges in the p-adic integers to a root of f(x) = 0. Moreover, the displayed recursive formula for the (new) number rk+1 in terms of rk is precisely Newton's method for finding roots to equations in the real numbers. By working directly in the p-adics and using the p-adic absolute value, there is a version of Hensel's lemma which can be applied even if we start with a solution of f(a) ‚â° 0 mod p such that f'(a)\\\\equiv 0 \\\\bmod p. We just need to make sure the number f'(a) is not exactly 0. This more general version is as follows: if there is an integer a which satisfies: :f(a)_p < f'(a)_p^2, then there is a unique p-adic integer b such f(b) = 0 and b-a_p <f'(a)_p. The construction of b amounts to showing that the recursion from Newton's method with initial value a converges in the p-adics and we let b be the limit. The uniqueness of b as a root fitting the condition b-a_p <f'(a)_p needs additional work. The statement of Hensel's lemma given above (taking m=1) is a special case of this more general version, since the conditions that f(a) ‚â° 0 mod p and f'(a) ot\\\\equiv 0 \\\\bmod p say that f(a)_p < 1 and f'(a)_p = 1.  Examples  Suppose that p is an odd prime and a is a non-zero quadratic residue modulo p. Then Hensel's lemma implies that a has a square root in the ring of p-adic integers \\\\Z_p. Indeed, let f(x)=x^2-a. If r is a square root of a modulo p then: : f(r) = r^2 - a \\\\equiv 0 \\\\bmod p \\\\quad \\\\text{and} \\\\quad f'(r) = 2r ot\\\\equiv 0 \\\\bmod p, where the second condition is dependent on the fact that p is odd. The basic version of Hensel's lemma tells us that starting from r1 = r we can recursively construct a sequence of integers \\\\\\\\{r_k\\\\\\\\} such that: : r_{k+1} \\\\equiv r_k \\\\bmod p^k, \\\\quad r_k^2 \\\\equiv a \\\\bmod p^k. This sequence converges to some p-adic integer b which satisfies b2 = a. In fact, b is the unique square root of a in \\\\Z_p congruent to r1 modulo p. Conversely, if a is a perfect square in \\\\Z_p and it is not divisible by p then it is a nonzero quadratic residue mod p. Note that the quadratic reciprocity law allows one to easily test whether a is a nonzero quadratic residue mod p, thus we get a practical way to determine which p-adic numbers (for p odd) have a p-adic square root, and it can be extended to cover the case p = 2 using the more general version of Hensel's lemma (an example with 2-adic square roots of 17 is given later). To make the discussion above more explicit, let us find a \\"square root of 2\\" (the solution to x^2-2=0) in the 7-adic integers. Modulo 7 one solution is 3 (we could also take 4), so we set r_1 = 3. Hensel's lemma then allows us to find r_2 as follows: :\\\\begin{align} f(r_1) &= 3^2-2=7  f(r_1)/p^1 &=7/7=1  f'(r_1) &=2r_1=6 \\\\end{align} Based on which the expression :tf'(r_1) \\\\equiv -(f(r_1)/p^k)\\\\bmod p, turns into: :t\\\\cdot 6 \\\\equiv -1\\\\bmod 7 which implies t = 1. Now: :r_2 = r_1 + tp^1 = 3+1 \\\\cdot 7 = 10 = 13_7. And sure enough, 10^2\\\\equiv 2\\\\bmod 7^2. (If we had used the Newton method recursion directly in the 7-adics, then r_2 = r_1 - f(r_1)/f'(r_1) = 3 - 7/6 = 11/6, and 11/6 \\\\equiv 10 \\\\bmod 7^2.) We can continue and find r_3 = 108 = 3 + 7 + 2\\\\cdot 7^2 = 213_7. Each time we carry out the calculation (that is, for each successive value of k), one more base 7 digit is added for the next higher power of 7. In the 7-adic integers this sequence converges, and the limit is a square root of 2 in \\\\Z_7 which has initial 7-adic expansion :3 + 7 + 2\\\\cdot7^2 + 6\\\\cdot 7^3 + 7^4 + 2\\\\cdot 7^5 + 7^6 + 2\\\\cdot 7^7 + 4\\\\cdot 7^8 + \\\\cdots. If we started with the initial choice r_1 = 4 then Hensel's lemma would produce a square root of 2 in \\\\Z_7 which is congruent to 4 (mod 7) instead of 3 (mod 7) and in fact this second square root would be the negative of the first square root (which is consistent with 4 = ‚àí3 mod 7). As an example where the original version of Hensel's lemma is not valid but the more general one is, let f(x) = x^2-17 and a=1. Then f(a) =-16 and f'(a) = 2, so :f(a)_2 < f'(a)_2^2, which implies there is a unique 2-adic integer b satisfying :b^2 = 17 \\\\quad \\\\text{and} \\\\quad b-a_2 < f'(a)_2 = \\\\frac{1}{2}, i.e., b ‚â° 1 mod 4. There are two square roots of 17 in the 2-adic integers, differing by a sign, and although they are congruent mod 2 they are not congruent mod 4. This is consistent with the general version of Hensel's lemma only giving us a unique 2-adic square root of 17 that is congruent to 1 mod 4 rather than mod 2. If we had started with the initial approximate root a = 3 then we could apply the more general Hensel's lemma again to find a unique 2-adic square root of 17 which is congruent to 3 mod 4. This is the other 2-adic square root of 17. In terms of lifting the roots of x^2-17 from modulus 2k to 2k+1, the lifts starting with the root 1 mod 2 are as follows: :1 mod 2 --> 1, 3 mod 4 :1 mod 4 --> 1, 5 mod 8 and 3 mod 4 ---> 3, 7 mod 8 :1 mod 8 --> 1, 9 mod 16 and 7 mod 8 ---> 7, 15 mod 16, while 3 mod 8 and 5 mod 8 don't lift to roots mod 16 :9 mod 16 --> 9, 25 mod 32 and 7 mod 16 --> 7, 23 mod 16, while 1 mod 16 and 15 mod 16 don't lift to roots mod 32. For every k at least 3, there are four roots of x2 ‚àí 17 mod 2k, but if we look at their 2-adic expansions we can see that in pairs they are converging to just two 2-adic limits. For instance, the four roots mod 32 break up into two pairs of roots which each look the same mod 16: :9 = 1 + 23 and 25 = 1 + 23 \\\\+ 24. :7 = 1 + 2 + 22 and 23 = 1 + 2 + 22 \\\\+ 24. The 2-adic square roots of 17 have expansions :1 + 2^3 +2^5 +2^6 +2^7 +2^9 + 2^{10} + \\\\cdots :1 + 2 + 2^2 + 2^4 + 2^8 + 2^{11} + \\\\cdots Another example where we can use the more general version of Hensel's lemma but not the basic version is a proof that any 3-adic integer c ‚â° 1 mod 9 is a cube in \\\\Z_3. Let f(x) =x^3-c and take initial approximation a = 1. The basic Hensel's lemma cannot be used to find roots of f(x) since f'(r)\\\\equiv 0 \\\\bmod 3 for every r. To apply the general version of Hensel's lemma we want f(1)_3 <f'(1)_3^2, which means c\\\\equiv 1 \\\\bmod 27. That is, if c ‚â° 1 mod 27 then the general Hensel's lemma tells us f(x) has a 3-adic root, so c is a 3-adic cube. However, we wanted to have this result under the weaker condition that c ‚â° 1 mod 9. If c ‚â° 1 mod 9 then c ‚â° 1, 10, or 19 mod 27. We can apply the general Hensel's lemma three times depending on the value of c mod 27: if c ‚â° 1 mod 27 then use a = 1, if c ‚â° 10 mod 27 then use a = 4 (since 4 is a root of f(x) mod 27), and if c ‚â° 19 mod 27 then use a = 7. (It is not true that every c ‚â° 1 mod 3 is a 3-adic cube, e.g., 4 is not a 3-adic cube since it is not a cube mod 9.) In a similar way, after some preliminary work, Hensel's lemma can be used to show that for any odd prime number p, any p-adic integer c congruent to 1 modulo p2 is a p-th power in \\\\Z_p. (This is false for p = 2.) Generalizations Suppose A is a commutative ring, complete with respect to an ideal \\\\mathfrak{m}, and let f(x) \\\\in A[x]. a ‚àà A is called an \\"approximate root\\" of f, if : f(a) \\\\equiv 0 \\\\bmod f'(a)^2 \\\\mathfrak{m}. If f has an approximate root then it has an exact root b ‚àà A \\"close to\\" a; that is, :f(b) = 0 \\\\quad \\\\text{and} \\\\quad b \\\\equiv a \\\\bmod{\\\\mathfrak m}. Furthermore, if f'(a) is not a zero-divisor then b is unique. This result can be generalized to several variables as follows: :Theorem. Suppose A be a commutative ring that is complete with respect to ideal \\\\mathfrak{m} \\\\subset A. Let f_1, \\\\ldots, f_n \\\\in A[x_1, \\\\ldots, x_n] be a system of n polynomials in n variables over A. View \\\\mathbf{f} = (f_1, \\\\ldots, f_n), as a mapping from An to itself, and let J_{\\\\mathbf{f}}(\\\\mathbf{x}) denote its Jacobian matrix. Suppose a = (a1, ..., an) ‚àà An is an approximate solution to f = 0 in the sense that ::f_i(\\\\mathbf{a}) \\\\equiv 0 \\\\bmod (\\\\det J_{\\\\mathbf{f}}(a))^2 \\\\mathfrak{m}, \\\\qquad 1 \\\\leqslant i \\\\leqslant n. :Then there is some b = (b1, ..., bn) ‚àà An satisfying f(b) = 0, i.e., ::f_i(\\\\mathbf{b}) =0, \\\\qquad 1 \\\\leqslant i \\\\leqslant n. :Furthermore this solution is \\"close\\" to a in the sense that ::b_i \\\\equiv a_i \\\\bmod \\\\det J_{\\\\mathbf{f}}(a) \\\\mathfrak{m}, \\\\qquad 1 \\\\leqslant i \\\\leqslant n. As a special case, if f_i(\\\\mathbf{a}) \\\\equiv 0 \\\\bmod \\\\mathfrak{m} for all i and \\\\det J_{\\\\mathbf{f}}(\\\\mathbf{a}) is a unit in A then there is a solution to f(b) = 0 with b_i \\\\equiv a_i \\\\bmod \\\\mathfrak{m} for all i. When n = 1, a = a is an element of A and J_{\\\\mathbf{f}}(\\\\mathbf{a}) = J_f(a)=f'(a). The hypotheses of this multivariable Hensel's lemma reduce to the ones which were stated in the one-variable Hensel's lemma. Related concepts Completeness of a ring is not a necessary condition for the ring to have the Henselian property: Goro Azumaya in 1950 defined a commutative local ring satisfying the Henselian property for the maximal ideal m to be a Henselian ring. Masayoshi Nagata proved in the 1950s that for any commutative local ring A with maximal ideal m there always exists a smallest ring Ah containing A such that Ah is Henselian with respect to mAh. This Ah is called the Henselization of A. If A is noetherian, Ah will also be noetherian, and Ah is manifestly algebraic as it is constructed as a limit of √©tale neighbourhoods. This means that Ah is usually much smaller than the completion √Ç while still retaining the Henselian property and remaining in the same category.

JSTORIran and Its Place Among Nations, Alidad Mafinezam, Aria Mehrabi, 2008, p.57 Initially, Kasravi enrolled in a seminary. Later, he joined the Iranian Constitutional Revolution. He experienced a sort of conversion to Western learning when he learned that the comet of 1910 had been identified as a reappearance of Halley's comet. He abandoned his clerical training after this event and enrolled in the American Memorial School of Tabriz. Thenceforward he became, in Roy Mottahedeh's words, \\"a true anti- cleric.\\" Kasravi was associated with the Democrat Party in Iran. Kasravi was a professor of law at the University of Tehran and also a lawyer in Tehran, Iran. He was the founder of a political-social movement whose goal was to build an Iranian secular identity. The movement was formed during the Pahlavi dynasty. Kasravi authored more than 70 books, mostly in the Persian language. The most important ones are \\"History of the Iranian Constitutional Revolution\\" and \\"Eighteen Years History of Azerbaijan\\", which are the among the most important literature works of the Persian Constitutional Revolution. Life It was in Tbilisi where he first became acquainted with a wide spectrum of political ideas and movements, and he soon was employed by the government of Iran in various cultural posts. A prolific writer, Kasravi was very critical of both the Shi'a clergy and of the policies of the central government. His outspoken ways would lead him to have many supporters and critics starting from the Reza Shah period. While Abdolhossein Teymourtash was a strong supporter of his works, Mohammad Ali Foroughi is said to have taken strong exception to his literary theories and banned him from contributing to the Farhangestan or to continue publishing. Moreover, he had liberal views on religion, was a strong supporter of democracy, and expressed them in satirical pamphlets like What Is the Religion of the Hajis with Warehouses? that infuriated many readers. His views earned him many powerful enemies such as Ayatollah Kashani. His detailed account of the Constitutional Revolution still stands out as one of the most important sources on the events, even though Kasravi was a teenager at the time of the revolution and cannot claim the full authority of a contemporary witness that his writing at times suggests.

Browne, appreciated by Iranian intellectuals of all tendencies, whom he accused to have favoured Sufi poetry in his history of Persian literature, and thus trying to characterize the Iranian spirit with the errors he thinks belong to Sufis (immorality, irrationality, ...), further promoting idleness and passivity in order to keep Iran subjugated to foreign imperialists.Lloyd Ridgeon, Sufi Castigator: Ahmad Kasravi and the Iranian Mystical Tradition, Routledge (2006), pp. 121-135 His criticism of Hafez Shirazi followed the same path, considering him \\"a source of disgrace\\",Lloyd Ridgeon, Sufi Castigator: Ahmad Kasravi and the Iranian Mystical Tradition, Routledge (2006) p. 141 saying that his \\"immorality\\" was due to the fact that the Mongols were the new rulers in the region, not respectful of Islamic law, thus letting some Sufis (like Hafez) \\"free to indulge in drinking wine, whereas previously they had to be cautious not to offend the Islamic sentiments of the rulers and the religious authorities.\\"Lloyd Ridgeon, Sufi Castigator: Ahmad Kasravi and the Iranian Mystical Tradition, Routledge (2006), p. 148 Kasravi was also critical about the Bah√° º√≠ Faith and considered it as another continuation of the same deviation that started from Shia (penetration and influence of Old Iranian and Judaism beliefs about \\" a supposed to come savior\\" into Islam) to Shaykhism (followers of Shaykh Ahmad Ahsaei) then Babism (followers of Ali Mohammad, the Bab), then into the Bah√° º√≠ Faith.

In the introduction he illustrates some common believes about Sufism, for example he says that Sufism has many followers and it is very diverse and Sophists are everywhere like Tehran, Mashhad, Shiraz Maragheh and ... Also, he says it is not true that science will destroy Sufism and talks about why European adore Sufism. He talks about the root of Sufism and its origin in Greek philosophy. Like his other books about Shia and Bah√° º√≠ Faith Ideologies he criticizes Sufism and talks about contradictions and flaws in Sufism in the second chapter, for example the fact that most of Sophist do not have any occupation and they do not get married or they do not care about life before death. In the third chapter is about Islam and Sufism and the bad thing that Sufism followers have done to Islam. The next chapter is about the negative effect of Sufism on its followers because of the nature of the ideology. In the sixth chapter he calls Sufism followers liars and criticize their books and what they say as ‚ÄúKramat‚Äù. The next two chapters are about Mongolians attack to Iran and relationship with Sufism, Kasravi blames Sufism for Iran‚Äôs defeat. The last chapter is about a Greek philosopher called ‚ÄúPlotinus‚Äù, which Kasravi believes is the founder of Sufism and criticizing his ideas. The book is attacking all the ideologies of Sufism and bring some examples from Sufism books. Works about the old Azeri language Kasravi is known for his solid and controversial research work on the ancient Azari language. He showed that the ancient Azari language was an offshoot of Pahlavi language. Due to this discovery, he was granted membership of the London Royal Asiatic Society and American Academy.ÿßÿ≠ŸÖÿØ ⁄©ÿ≥ÿ±Ÿà€åÿõ Ÿæ⁄òŸàŸáÿ¥⁄Øÿ±€åÿåÿ≥ÿ±⁄©ÿ¥€å Ÿà ÿÆÿ±ÿØŸá ŸÜ⁄Øÿ±€å Khosro Naghed Arguing that the ancient Azari language had not been related to Persian language.Ahmad Kasravi did not believe that the true national language of Iranian Azerbaijan was Persian and therefore tried to prevent the linguistic assimilation of Persian in Azarbaijan.Tadeusz Swietochowski, Russia and a Borderland in Transition Azerbaijan, 122-289 p. (Columbia University Press, 1995). In 1927-8 Ahmad Kasravi led the way in establishing the ancestry of the Safavids dynasty with the publication of three influential articles, and disputed the validity of the 'official' Safavid family tree contained in the Safvat al-Safa, and argued convincingly that the ancestors of Shaykh Safi al-Din, who founded the Safavid Order (tariqa), were indigenous inhabitants of Iran. Today, the consensus among Safavid historians is that the Safavid family hailed from Persian Kurdistan.  Assassination  On 11 March 1946, while being tried on charges of \\"slander against Islam,\\" Kasravi and one of his assistants named Seyyed Mohammad Taghi Haddadpour, were knifed and killed in open court in Tehran by followers of Navvab Safavi, a Shi'a extremist cleric who had founded an organization called the Fadayan-e Islam (literally Devotees of Islam), lead by two brothers, Hossein and Ali-Mohammad Emami. The same group had failed in assassinating Kasravi earlier in April 1945 in Tehran. Ayatollah Borujerdi and Ayatollah Sadr al-Din al-Sadr had issued fatwas for killing Ahmad Kasravi. The later Supreme Leader of Iran, Ruhollah Khomeini, was also against Kasravi's ideas, and had called for young martyrs for Islam to counter to \\"this illiterate Tabrizi\\" a few weeks after the first unsuccessful assassination attempt.

Nava'i believed that Chagatai and other Turkic languages were superior to Persian for literary purposes, an uncommon view at the time and defended this belief in his work titled The Comparison of the Two Languages. He emphasized his belief in the richness, precision and malleability of Turkic vocabulary as opposed to Persian.\\"ŸÇ€åÿßÿ≥ ÿßŸÑÿ∫ÿ™€åŸÜ\\" ŸÜŸàÿßÿ¶€å Ÿæÿß€åŸá ÿØÿßŸÜÿ¥€å ŸÜÿØÿßÿ±ÿØ. Because of his distinguished Chagatai language poetry, Nava'i is considered by many throughout the Turkic-speaking world to be the founder of early Turkic literature. Many places and institutions in Central Asia are named after him.  Life  Alisher Nava'i's portrait in Isfana, Kyrgyzstan Alisher Nava'i was born in 1441 in Herat, which is now in north- western Afghanistan. During Alisher's lifetime, Herat was ruled by the Timurid Empire and became one of the leading cultural and intellectual centres in the Muslim world. Alisher belonged to the Chagatai amir (or Mƒ´r in Persian) class of the Timurid elite. Alisher's father, GhiyƒÅth ud-Din Kichkina (The Little), served as a high-ranking officer in the palace of ShƒÅhrukh MirzƒÅ, a ruler of Khorasan. His mother served as a prince's governess in the palace. GhiyƒÅth ud- Din Kichkina served as governor of Sabzawar at one time. He died while Alisher was young, and another ruler of Khorasan, Abul-Qasim Babur Mirza, adopted guardianship of the young man. Alisher was a schoolmate of Husayn Bayqarah, who would later become the sultan of Khorasan. Alisher's family was forced to flee Herat in 1447 after the death of ShƒÅhrukh created an unstable political situation. His family returned to Khorasan after order was restored in the 1450s. In 1456, Alisher and Bayqarah went to Mashhad with Ibn-Baysunkur. The following year Ibn-Baysunkur died and Alisher and Bayqarah parted ways. While Bayqarah tried to establish political power, Alisher pursued his studies in Mashhad, Herat, and Samarkand. After the death of Abu Sa'id Mirza in 1469, Husayn Bayqarah seized power in Herat. Consequently, Alisher left Samarkand to join his service. Bayqarah ruled Khorasan almost uninterruptedly for forty years. Alisher remained in the service of Bayqarah until his death on 3 January 1501. He was buried in Herat. Alisher Nava'i led an ascetic lifestyle, \\"never marrying or having concubines or children.\\"  Work  USSR stamps to celebrate the 500th anniversary of his birth Alisher served as a public administrator and adviser to his sultan, Husayn Bayqarah. He was also a builder who is reported to have founded, restored, or endowed some 370 mosques, madrasas, libraries, hospitals, caravanserais, and other educational, pious, and charitable institutions in Khorasan. In Herat, he was responsible for 40 caravanserais, 17 mosques, 10 mansions, nine bathhouses, nine bridges, and 20 pools. Among Alisher's constructions were the mausoleum of the 13th- century mystical poet, Farid al-Din Attar, in Nishapur (north-eastern Iran) and the Khalasiya madrasa in Herat. He was one of the instrumental contributors to the architecture of Herat, which became, in Ren√© Grousset's words, \\"the Florence of what has justly been called the Timurid Renaissance\\". Moreover, he was a promoter and patron of scholarship and arts and letters, a musician, a composer, a calligrapher, a painter and sculptor, and such a celebrated writer that Bernard Lewis, a renowned historian of the Islamic world, called him \\"the Chaucer of the Turks\\". = Literary works = Under the pen name Nava'i, Alisher was among the key writers who revolutionized the literary use of the Turkic languages. Nava'i himself wrote primarily in the Chagatai language and produced 30 works over a period of 30 years, during which Chagatai became accepted as a prestigious and well-respected literary language. Nava'i also wrote in Persian (under the pen name FƒÅni), and, to a much lesser degree, in Arabic. Nava'i's best-known poems are found in his four diwans, or poetry collections, which total roughly 50,000 verses. Each part of the work corresponds to a different period of a person's life: diwan. From the library of Suleiman the Magnificent. * Ghara'ib al-Sighar (Wonders of Childhood) * Navadir al-Shabab (Rarities of Youth) * Bada'i' al-Wasat (Marvels of Middle Age) * Fawa'id al-Kibar (Benefits of Old Age) To help other Turkic poets, Alisher wrote technical works such as Mizan al-Awzan (The Measure of Meters), and a detailed treatise on poetical meters. He also crafted the monumental Majalis al-Nafais (Assemblies of Distinguished Men), a collection of over 450 biographical sketches of mostly contemporary poets. The collection is a gold mine of information about Timurid culture for modern historians. Alisher's other important works include the Khamsa (Quintuple), which is composed of five epic poems and is an imitation of Nizami Ganjavi's Khamsa: * Hayrat-ol-abrar (Wonders of Good People) (ÿ≠€åÿ±ÿ™ ÿßŸÑÿßÿ®ÿ±ÿßÿ±) * Farhad va Shirin (Farhad and Shirin) (ŸÅÿ±ŸáÿßÿØ Ÿà ÿ¥€åÿ±€åŸÜ) * Layli va Majnun (Layli and Majnun) (ŸÑ€åŸÑ€å Ÿà ŸÖÿ¨ŸÜŸàŸÜ) * Sab'ai Sayyar (Seven Travelers) (ÿ≥ÿ®ÿπŸá ÿ≥€åÿßÿ±) (about the seven planets) * Sadd-i-Iskandari (Alexander's Wall) (ÿ≥ÿØ ÿ≥⁄©ŸÜÿØÿ±€å) (about Alexander the Great) Alisher also wrote Lison ut-Tayr (ŸÑÿ≥ÿßŸÜ ÿßŸÑÿ∑€åÿ± or Language of Birds, following Attar's Manteq-ol-tayr ŸÖŸÜÿ∑ŸÇ ÿßŸÑÿ∑€åÿ± or Speeches of Birds), in which he expressed his philosophical views and Sufi ideas. He translated Jami's Nafahat-ul-uns (ŸÜŸÅÿ≠ÿßÿ™ ÿßŸÑÿßŸÜÿ≥) to Chagatai Turkic and called it Nasayim-ul- muhabbat (ŸÜÿ≥ÿß€åŸÖ ÿßŸÑŸÖÿ≠ÿ®ÿ™). His Besh Hayrat (Five Wonders) also gives an in-depth look at his views on religion and Sufism. His book of Persian poetry contains 6,000 lines (beits). Nava'i's last work, Muhakamat al-Lughatayn (The Trial of the Two Languages) is a comparison of Turkic and Persian and was completed in December 1499. He believed that the Turkic language was superior to Persian for literary purposes, and defended this belief in his work. Nava'i repeatedly emphasized his belief in the richness, precision and malleability of Turkic vocabulary as opposed to Persian.Ali Shir Nava'i Muhakamat al-lughatain tr. & ed.

Influence of Nava'i  Alisher Nava'i on a commemorative Uzbek coin Nava'i had a great influence in areas as distant as India to the east and the Ottoman Empire to the west. His influence can be found in Central Asia, modern day Turkey, Kazan of Russia, and all other areas where Turkic speakers inhabit. * Babur, founder of the Mughal Empire in India and the author of Baburnama, was heavily influenced by Nava'i and wrote about his respect for the writer in his memoirs. * The Ottomans were highly conscious of their Central Asian heritage; S√ºleym√¢n the Magnificent was impressed by Nava'i and had Divan-i Neva'i, Khamsa, and Muhakamat added to his personal library. * The renowned Azari poet Fuz√ªl√Æ, who wrote under the auspices of both the Safavid and Ottoman empires, was heavily influenced by the style of Nava'i. * Nava'i is considered the national poet of Uzbekistan in Uzbek culture. The province of Navoi is named in his honor, as well as many other landmarks such as streets and boulevards. It is an ongoing trend for Uzbek authors and poets to take inspiration from his works.  Legacy  Nava'i is one of the most beloved poets among Central Asian Turkic peoples. He is generally regarded as the greatest representative of Chagatai language literature. His mastery of the Chagatai language was such that it became known as \\"the language of Nava'i\\". Although all applications of modern Central Asian ethnonyms to people of Nava'i's time are anachronistic, Soviet and Uzbek sources regard Nava'i as an ethnic Uzbek. Maria Subtelny has proposed that Alisher Nava'i was a descendant of Bakhshi scribes, which has led some sources to call Nava'i a descendant of Uyghurs. However, other scholars such as Kazuyuki Kubo disagree with this view. Soviet and Uzbek sources hold that Nava'i significantly contributed to the development of the Uzbek language and consider him to be the founder of Uzbek literature. In the early 20th century, Soviet linguistic policy renamed the Chagatai language \\"Old Uzbek\\", which, according to Edward A. Allworth, \\"badly distorted the literary history of the region\\" and was used to give authors such as Alisher Nava'i an Uzbek identity. In December 1941, the entire Soviet Union celebrated Nava'i's five-hundredth anniversary. In Nazi-blockaded Leningrad, Armenian orientalist Joseph Orbeli led a festival dedicated to Nava'i. Nikolai Lebedev, a young specialist in Eastern literature who suffered from acute dystrophy and could no longer walk, devoted his life's last moments to reading Nava'i's poem Seven Travelers. Many places and institutions in Uzbekistan and other Central Asian countries are named after Alisher Nava'i. Navoiy Region, the city of Navoiy, the National Library of Uzbekistan named after Alisher Navoiy, the Alisher Navoi Opera and Ballet Theatre, Alisher Navoiy station of Tashkent Metro, and Navoi International Airport ‚Äì all are named after him. Many of Nava'i's ghazals are performed in the Twelve Muqam, particularly in the introduction known as Muq√§ddim√§.Nathan Light. Intimate Heritage: Creating Uyghur Muqam Song in Xinjiang. Berlin. Lit Verlag, 2008. They also appear in popular Uzbek folk songs and in the works of many Uzbek singers, such as Sherali Jo‚Äòrayev. Alisher Nava'i's works have also been staged as plays by Uzbek playwrights.  Notes  References  * *  Bibliography  * . * . * . * . * . * . * .

Russian explorer Baron Eduard Toll and three companions vanished forever in November 1902 while travelling away from Bennett Island towards the south on loose ice floes.Barr, W., 1980, Baron Eduard von Toll's Last Expedition: The Russian Polar Expedition, 1900‚Äì1903. Arctic. vol. 34, no. 3, pp. 201‚Äì224. In 1916, the Russian ambassador in London issued an official notice to the effect that the Imperial government considered Bennett, along with other Arctic islands, integral parts of the Russian Empire. This territorial claim was later maintained by the Soviet Union. Some individuals assert American ownership of Bennett Island, and others of the De Long group, based on the 1881 landing. However, the United States government has never claimed Bennett Island, and recognizes it as Russian territory.Bureau of European and Eurasian Affairs, US State Department, 2003, Status of Wrangel and other Arctic islands Last visited May 26, 2008.  Geology  A headland on Bennett Island Bennett Island consists of Early Paleozoic, late Cretaceous, Pliocene, and Quaternary sedimentary and igneous rocks. The oldest rocks outcropping on Bennett island are moderately tilted marine Cambrian to Ordovician sedimentary rocks. They consist of an approximately thick sequence of argillites with minor amounts of siltstone, and limestone that contain Middle Cambrian trilobites and of Ordovician argillites, siltstones, and quartz sandstones that contain graptolites. These Paleozoic rocks are overlain by Late Cretacecous coal-bearing argillites and quartzite-like sandstones and basaltic lava and tuff with lenses of tuffaceous argillite. The Late Cretaceous strata is overlain by basaltic lavas ranging in age from Pliocene to Quaternary. The Quaternary volcanic rocks form volcanic cones.Kos‚Äôko, M.K., B.G. Lopatin, and V.G.

Glaciers  View of Bennett Island with its ice cap Bennett Island in NASA Landsat image Bennett Island has the largest permanent ice cover within the De Long Islands. In 1987, the permanent ice cap of this island consisted of four separate glaciers that had a total area of . All of these glaciers were perched on high, basaltic plateaus bounded by steep scarp-like slopes.Verkulich, S.R., A.G. Krusanov, and M.A. Anisimov, 1992, The present state of, and trends displayed by, the glaciers of Bennett Island in the past 40 years. Polar Geography and Geology. vol. 16, no. 1, pp. 51‚Äì57. In 1992, Dr. Verkulich and others named these glaciers as the De Long East, De Long West, Malyy, and Toll glaciers. With an area of in 1987, Toll Glacier was the largest of them. It occupied the center of Bennett Island; had an elevation of above mean sea level; and was thick at its center. It had an outlet glacier, West Seeberg Glacier, from which ice flowed downhill from Toll Glacier into the sea. The next largest glacier was De Long East Glacier with an area of in 1987. It laid about above mean sea level at the southeast end of Bennett Island and had a thickness of . Adjacent to De Long East Glacier laid the De Long West Glacier with an area of ; an elevation of above mean sea level; and a thickness of in 1987. Malyy Glacier, with an area of in 1987, occupied a basaltic plateau at an elevation of above mean sea level on the northeast end of Bennett Island and was thick. In 1987, all of these glaciers were shrinking in volume and had been so for the past 40 years. Of the glaciers described by Dr. Verkulich and others, Dr. Glazovskiy discusses only the Toll Ice Cap, which Dr. Verkulich and others referred to as \\"Toll Glacier\\". In 1996, it had an area of and a mean elevation of above sea level. Its equilibrium line altitude was at an elevation of 200 m (660 ft) above sea level.

At the time that these ice caps formed, the De Long Islands were major hills within a large subaerial plain, called the Great Arctic Plain, that now lies submerged below the Arctic Ocean and East Siberian Sea.Schirrmeister, L., H.-W.

Vegetation  Rush/grass, forb, cryptogam tundra covers the Bennett Island. It is tundra consisting mostly of very low-growing grasses, rushes, forbs, mosses, lichens, and liverworts. These plants either mostly or completely cover the surface of the ground. The soils are typically moist, fine-grained, and often hummocky.CAVM Team, 2003, Circumpolar Arctic Vegetation Map..

Atmospheric plumes  Bennett Island plume observed in a false colorNOAA-18 AVHRR data by the Cooperative Institute for Meteorological Satellite Studies (CIMSS), University of Wisconsin ‚Äì Madison, USA. Bennett Island plumes are a phenomenon in the arctic that had been a mystery to atmospheric scientists for decades until it was finally explained by a collaborative, post-cold war United States and Russian expedition in the 1990s. For years, scientists observed large, sometimes hundreds of miles long plumes emanating from the northeast coast of Russia over the remote Bennett Island and scientists hypothesized that the plumes were caused by volcanoes, gas plumes or even Soviet cold war testing before satellite observations revealed them to be meteorological in origin. The most popular theory among scientists was that the plumes were formed when clathrates‚Äîmethane, trapped and frozen into a crystalline structure similar to ice by a combination of low temperatures and high pressures‚Äîmelted and released methane gas. These gas deposits can melt, bubble to the surface and erupt like a geyser into the atmosphere. Due to remaining cold-war tensions, and the Soviet military's desire to protect the secrecy of submarine facilities, western scientists were only able to observe the plumes remotely via satellite. The melting permafrost/clathrate hypothesis was unable to be tested until spring of 1992, when US and Russian Scientists in Siberia were able to conduct an air-borne expedition conduct a sampling of the plume and surprisingly found no methane. Scientists had initially dismissed the meteorological explanation of the clouds because the plumes only seemed to be unique to Bennett Island and not the other, similar islands, and because it was thought that the 1,000 foot high island was too low to generate orographic clouds. Orographic clouds normally form when air is forced to rise as it passes over a mountain and cools. Bennett Island plumes form due to the layering of arctic air at different, very cold temperatures. The region is relatively remote, with only warmer polynyas‚Äîopen water surrounded by sea ice ‚Äì to potentially provide instability. When air hits the elevated Bennett Island, which behaves like an airplane air foil it rises up, sometimes to over , nucleates, condenses and forms a cloud. The catalyst for the generation of the plumes was difficult to pinpoint because the apparent source region of the plume can appear to shift with time depending on the weakening or intensification of the strength of the wind flowing over the mountain. Consequently, the plumes were determined to be excellent indicators of the location of arctic fronts and jet stream activity. Presently, the mystery of Bennett Island plumes has not completely been solved; scientists are still seeking an explanation for why the plumes form at an unusually high altitude of over above the mountain tops. Scientists are also studying the dynamics of the island, and why its unique shape is able to generate these plumes.

Bodecker and published by Harcourt, Brace (finally Harcourt, Brace & World). The series name may date from the 2000 boxed set of books 1‚Äì4, Edward Eager's Tales of Magic (Odyssey/Harcourt Young Classic; ). # Half Magic (1954) # Knight's Castle (1956) # Magic by the Lake (1957) # The Time Garden (1958) # Magic or Not? (1959) # The Well-Wishers (1960) # Seven-Day Magic (1962) The first book, Half Magic, comes earliest in the series' chronology. Magic by the Lake is its direct sequel, in that it features the same children in further adventures at about the same age. The second book, Knight's Castle, is set one generation later, and The Time Garden is its direct sequel. Magic or Not? features different children, and The Well-Wishers is its direct sequel. Seven- Day Magic features a fourth set of children. ;Half Magic A dull summer is improved when Katharine, Mark, Jane and Martha find a magical coin-like talisman. The catch is that it grants half of any wish made by its bearer‚Äîa wish to be on a desert island sends them to the Sahara desert, and their mother ends up halfway home when she wishes to return home during a dull visit to her relatives. That \\"half magic\\" is a challenge, sometimes comical, until the children learn to double their wishes. Half Magic was a number one seller in America. Anthony Boucher, comparing the novel to Nesbit, described it as \\"gay and charming, yet rigidly governed fantasy in the Unknown manner.\\"\\"Recommended Reading,\\" F&SF;, September 1954, p.93. ;Magic by the Lake Here are the further adventures of Martha, Jane, Mark, and Katharine from Half-Magic. Their summer vacation is enlivened by an entire magic lake, channeled through a talking, and somewhat grumpy, box turtle. They are stranded on a desert island, visit Ali-Baba's cave, and end up rescued by some children we will see in the next book. Half Magic and Magic by the Lake are set in the 1920s, much earlier than the other Tales. ;Knight's Castle Martha's children, Roger and Ann, and their cousins, Aunt Katharine's children Eliza and Jack, find that the combination of a toy castle, Scott's Ivanhoe, and a little magic can build another wonderful series of adventures. The Tales of Magic contain many references to the children's novels of E. Nesbit (1890s to 1910s); Knight's Castle pays explicit tribute to Nesbit's The Magic City. It also refers explicitly to the cartoons of Charles Addams. (Half Magic includes a reference to a short story by Saki.) Knight's Castle won the Ohioana Book Award for Juvenile Literature in 1957. ;The Time Garden Eliza, Jack, Roger, and Ann find an herb garden where thyme grows, which lets them travel through time (until the thyme is ripe). They are assisted by the Natterjack. On one adventure they rescue their Aunt Jane, Uncle Mark and their mothers from an adventure they took as children. This gives an alternate view of one of the adventures in Magic by the Lake. ;Magic or Not? Laura, James, and their wonderful new neighbors, Kip and Lydia, wish up some summer adventures when the well in their new yard is more than they imagined. Where the first four Tales of Magic and the last one feature unambiguously magical events, Magic or Not? and its sequel The Well-Wishers differ in tone. All the apparently magical events in these two novels are described ambiguously, with clues also to possible non-supernatural explanations. ;The Well-Wishers The children return to the ambiguously magical wishing well from Magic or Not for another series of unpredictable adventures that may or may not be magical. ;Seven-Day Magic Barnaby, John, Susan, Abbie and Fredericka check out a tattered book from the library for seven days. Oddly, it carefully and correctly records every word they say. Soon they find that it not only records events, but creates new magical adventures. Among the Magic novels only Seven-Day Magic features children who do not appear in at least one other book. It does refer to Half Magic by name, and has a chapter where the children visit the very end of Half Magic and what might have happened afterwards. Among their adventures, the children visit the era when Laura Ingalls Wilder was a girl and John's grandmother was a school-teacher; the time may be that of On the Banks of Plum Creek, they speculate. On the other hand, as the adventure concludes with a blizzard, Edward Eager may have been dramatizing the beginning of the 1888 Schoolhouse Blizzard. The adventure is too brief and the text too unclear to be certain. Seven-Day Magic was Eager's last book.

John Street at 39th Avenue E. and stretching down to Lake Washington Boulevard E. It was named by Charles L. Denny after his wife, Viretta Chambers Denny. It is located to the south of the former home of Kurt Cobain, where he was found dead. Nirvana fans gather at the park on the anniversary of Cobain's death (April 5), and to a lesser extent on his birthday (February 20), to pay tribute to him. The park's wooden benches, serving as the de facto memorial to Kurt Cobain in Seattle, are covered with graffiti messages to the rock icon. There has been much speculation over the years on whether the name of the park should be changed to \\"Kurt's Park\\", due to the late rock icon's large fan base. Fans pay tribute to Cobain on April 5, 2014, the 20th anniversary of the musician's death Howard Schultz controversy The first version of the group Friends of Viretta Park was formed by area neighbors during a dispute with former neighbor and Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz, who formerly lived to the South. Schultz later moved to a new residence. Viretta Park Repair In 2010 a group known as Viretta Park Repair was formed; according to its website its purpose was \\"to repair and restore Seattle's Viretta Park and... create a memorial for Nirvana's singer/songwriter Kurt Cobain who died next door to the park\\". Its first work party was scheduled to take place on Kurt Cobain's 44th birthday on February 20, 2011. Volunteers came from all over the Western United States and Southwestern Canada. The next series of scheduled work parties, scheduled for March 13, 2011 and April 5, 2011, were shut down by Seattle Parks and Recreation Superintendent Christopher Williams after a neighbor complained about memorial events - and a sculpture - that did not exist, but which were actually scheduled for Aberdeen, Washington. Acting Parks Chief Christopher Williams sided with the neighbors in blocking any attempt to have any memorial to Kurt Cobain in the park, despite recent additions to Jimi Hendrix Park in Seattle and a memorial sculpture in Aberdeen, Washington which had the approval of Aberdeen's Mayor. Since then Viretta Park Repair has been given the green light to hold additional work parties. A second work party was held on June 4, 2011 where volunteers removed invasive holly and blackberry bushes, laid burlap and covered the area with bark mulch.

S. Lewis for his series The Chronicles of Narnia. Hailing from Telmar, the Telmarines are prominent in the book Prince Caspian, the second book published in the series. The Telmarines were pirates in our world before entering the Narnian world through a magical cave. No scene from the books takes place there, but Telmar is said to be \\"far beyond the Western Mountains.\\"Prince Caspian, p. 41-42 \\"It was your Highness's ancestor, Caspian the First, who first conquered Narnia (country) and made it his Kingdom. It was he that brought all your nation into the country. You are not Narnians at all. You are all Telmarines ‚Äì that is, you all came from the Land of Telmar, far beyond the Western Mountains.\\" According to the timeline drawn up by Lewis, Calormen extended west into Telmar some three centuries after the world was first created. However, after only two years, the Calormenes in Telmar behaved so wickedly that Aslan turned them into dumb beasts, and the area became effectively unpopulated. Pirates from our world arrived in Telmar over a century later, through a rare gateway between the worlds. Prince Caspian describes how the descendants of these pirates, the Telmarines, invaded Narnia many generations later, leaving Telmar behind and suppressing Narnia's native inhabitants. This led eventually to the events related in Prince Caspian. Telmarine leaders of Narnia in Prince Caspian are King Miraz (brother of the late Caspian IX), Queen Prunaprismia, Lord Glozelle, and Lord Sopespian. In the film version of Prince Caspian, the principal Telmarine characters are portrayed by Spanish, Latin American, and Italian actors. The high-ranking Telmarines are shown to be corrupt, scheming individuals. Miraz had his own brother killed in order to claim the throne. Sopespian and Glozelle plot together to kill Miraz and blame it on the Narnians in order to declare all- out war on them. This plan succeeds, although the Telmarine army is defeated in the subsequent battle, ending some 300 years of oppression (according to the timeline).

It was awarded in two divisions: gold for repeated acts of bravery or achievement in combat; and silver for distinguished non-combat war service. The German Cross in Gold ranked higher than the Iron Cross First Class but below the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross, while the German Cross in Silver ranked higher than the War Merit Cross First Class with Swords but below the Knight's Cross of the War Merit Cross with Swords. Divisions The German Cross was issued in two versions: gold and silver (the color of the laurel wreath around the swastika), the former being an award for repeated acts of bravery or repeated outstanding achievements in combat, the latter being for multiple distinguished services in war efforts and was considered a continuation of the War Merit Cross with swords. Article three of the law governing the German Cross states that a prerequisite for the presentation of the German Cross in Gold or Silver is the ownership of the Iron Cross (1939) 1st Class or Clasp to the Iron Cross (1939) 1st Class, or the War Merit Cross 1st Class with Swords. Appearance The order consists of a star badge, containing a swastika (in German, Hakenkreuz, \\"hooked cross\\", which gives the award its name, the \\"German cross\\"). It had a diameter of 6.5 cm and was worn on the right-hand side of the tunic. If a recipient had been awarded both the silver and gold divisions, the gold division should be worn only. German Cross in Gold (cloth form) Only the gold version of the award was officially available in cloth form, which was made for easier wear on the combat uniform; General Helmuth Weidling wore this variety during his defense of Berlin in April‚ÄìMay 1945. Far more awards in gold (combat) were presented than in silver (support). Specimen copies of a special grade, the German Cross in Gold with Diamonds, was manufactured in 1942 but this grade was never instituted or bestowed. =1957 version= In 1957 alternative de-nazified replacement versions of the German Cross were authorized for wear by the Federal Republic of Germany. This replaced the swastika with a representation of the Iron Cross for the gold division, and the War Merit Cross with Swords for the silver division. Wearing Nazi-era decorations was banned in Germany after the war, as was any display of the swastika. The 1957 replacement of the World War II decorations consequently enabled recipients to wear the German Cross again but only in the new version of the insignia.

Nebraska Public Power District brochure; online at Iowa Homeland Security & Emergency Management website. Retrieved 2011-05-04. CNS was first put into operation in July 1974 and generates approximately 800 megawatts (MWe) of electricity. The plant consists of a General Electric BWR/4 series reactor plant and a Westinghouse turbine generator. The plant has a Mark I containment system. In 1998, CNS was the first plant in the United States to load nuclear fuel containing uranium that had been provided under the Megatons to Megawatts Program, in which uranium removed from nuclear weapons of the former Soviet Union was turned into low-enriched uranium and then into fuel. In September 2008, NPPD applied to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) for a renewal of the operating license for CNS, extending it for an additional twenty years. In November 2010 CNS received its license renewal, which was the 60th renewal license to be issued by the NRC. An agreement was approved in January 2010 by NPPD to extend Entergy's management support services until January 2029. The original contract between the companies, signed in 2003, was for the remaining years of the plant's original operating license, which ran until January 18, 2014. Surrounding population The Nuclear Regulatory Commission defines two emergency planning zones around nuclear power plants: a plume exposure pathway zone with a radius of , concerned primarily with exposure to, and inhalation of, airborne radioactive contamination, and an ingestion pathway zone of about , concerned primarily with ingestion of food and liquid contaminated by radioactivity. In 2010, the population within 10 miles of Cooper was 4,414; the population within 50 miles was 163,610. Cities within the 50-mile radius include Nebraska City, with a population of 7,289, located from the plant.Dedman, Bill (April 14, 2011), Nuclear neighbors: Population rises near US reactors, NBC News, http://www.nbcnews.com/id/42555888 Accessed 2011-05-01.Drozd, David. \\"Nebraska Incorporated Place Census Populations with Changes and Percent Changes: 1980 to 2010\\".

Devol's invention earned him the title \\"Grandfather of Robotics\\". As recognized by the National Inventors Hall of Fame, \\"Devol's patent for the first digitally operated programmable robotic arm represents the foundation of the modern robotics industry.\\" Early life George Devol was born in an upper middle- class family in Louisville, Kentucky. He attended Riordan Prep school. United Cinephone Phantom Doorman automatic door Choosing to forego higher education, in 1932 Devol went into business, forming United Cinephone to produce variable area recording directly onto film for the new sound motion pictures (\\"talkies\\"). However, he later learned that companies like RCA and Western Electric were working in the same area, and decided to discontinue the product. During that time, Devol also developed and patented industrial lighting and invented the automatic opening door. World War II In 1939, Devol applied for a patent for proximity controls for use in laundry press machines, based on a radio frequency field. This control would automatically open and close laundry presses when workers approached the machines. Once the war began, Devol was advised by the patent office that his patent application would be placed on hold for the duration of the conflict. Around the time the World War II began, Devol sold his interest in United Cinephone and approached Sperry Gyroscope to see if they were interested in his ideas on radar technology. He was retained by Sperry as manager of the Special Projects Department that developed radar devices and microwave test equipment. Later in the war, he approached Auto-Ordnance Company regarding products that company could produce aside from their primary product line, which were Thompson submachine guns. Devol told them that the field of radar counter-measures was about to emerge as an urgently needed defense technology. In 1943, he organized General Electronics Industries in Greenwich, Connecticut, as a subsidiary of the Auto Ordnance Corporation. General Electronics produced counter-radar devices until the end of the War. General Electronics was one of the largest producers of radar and radar counter-measure equipment for the U.S. Navy, U.S. Army Air Force and other government agencies. The company's radar counter-measure systems were on allied planes on D-Day. Over a difference of opinion regarding the future of certain projects, Devol resigned from Auto Ordinance and joined RCA. After a short stint as eastern sales manager of electronics products, which he felt \\"wasn't his ball of wax\\", Devol left RCA to develop ideas that eventually led to the patent application for the first industrial robot. In 1946 he applied for a patent on a magnetic recording system for controlling machines and a digital playback device for machines. Devol was part of the team that developed the first commercial use of microwave oven technology, the Speedy Weeny, which automatically cooked and dispensed hotdogs in places such as Grand Central Terminal. In the early 1950s, Devol licensed his digital magnetic recording device to Remington Rand of Norwalk, CT and became manager of their magnetics department. There he worked with a team to develop his magnetic recording system for business data applications. He also worked on developing the first high-speed printing systems. While the magnetic recording system proved too slow for business data, Devol's invention was re-purposed as a machine control that would eventually become the \\"brains\\" of the Unimate robot. The first industrial robot: Unimate The first static magnetic recorder that used a saw blade to record information In the 1940s, Devol wasn't thinking about robots. Instead, he was focusing on manipulators and his patent on magnetic recording devices. He felt the world was ready for new ideas as he saw the introduction of automation into factories during this time. In 1954, Devol applied for patent on Programmed Article Transfer that introduced the concept of Universal Automation or Unimation; was issued in 1954. At the suggestion of Devol's wife, Evelyn, the word \\"Unimate\\" was coined to define the product, much the same as George Eastman had coined Kodak.vidyaonline.org - robot U.S. Patent 2,988,237, issued in 1961 to Devol. When he filed the patent for a programmable method for transferring articles, he wrote, \\"the present invention makes available for the first time a more or less general purpose machine that has universal application to a vast diversity of applications where cyclic digital control is desired.\\" After applying for this seminal patent ‚Äî which had not a single prior citation ‚Äî Devol searched for a company willing to give him financial backing to develop his programmable articles transfer system. He talked with many major corporations in the United States during his search. Through family connections, Devol obtained an audience with a partner in the firm Manning, Maxwell and Moore. Joseph F. Engelberger, at that time, was chief of engineering in the aircraft products division at Manning, Maxwell and Moore in Stratford, Connecticut. Engelberger was very interested, and Devol agreed to license Manning, Maxwell and Moore his patent and some future patents in the field.Handbook of Design, Manufacturing and Automation by Richard C. Dorf and Andrew Kusiak (Wiley-IEEE) Page 260 However, Manning, Maxwell and Moore was sold that year and its aircraft division is to be closed. This development prompted Engelberger to seek a backer to buy out the aircraft division and found one in Consolidated Diesel Electronic (Condec), which agreed to put up the financing for the continued development of the robot. This new Condec division was called Unimation Incorporated with Joseph Engelberger as its president.Robotics Research Group - The first robot: \\"Unimate\\" , University of Texas. Accessed August 14, 2011. The first Unimate prototypes were controlled by vacuum tubes used as digital switches though later versions used transistors. Further, the \\"off-the-shelf\\" parts available in the late 1950s, such as digital encoders, were not adequate for the Unimate's purpose, and as a result, with Devol's guidance and a team of skilled engineers, Unimation designed and machined practically every part in the first Unimates. Devol also invented a variety of new technologies, including a unique rotating drum memory system with data parity controls. In 1960, Devol personally sold the first Unimate robot, which was shipped in 1961 to General Motors. GM first used the machine for die casting handling and spot welding. The first Unimate robot was installed at GM's Inland Fisher Guide Plant in Ewing Township, New Jersey in 1961 to lift hot pieces of metal from a die-casting machine and stack them.Mickle, Paul. \\"1961: A peep into the automated future\\", The Trentonian. Accessed August 11, 2011. \\"Without any fanfare, the world's first working robot joined the assembly line at the General Motors plant in Ewing Township in the spring of 1961.... It was an automated die-casting mold that dropped red-hot door handles and other such car parts into pools of cooling liquid on a line that moved them along to workers for trimming and buffing. Its most distinct feature was a grip on a steel armature that eliminated the need for a man to touch car parts just made from molten steel.\\" Soon companies such as Chrysler, Ford, and Fiat saw the necessity for large Unimate purchases. Approximately $5 million was spent to develop the first Unimate. In 1966, after many years of market surveys and field tests, full-scale production began in Connecticut. Unimation's first production robot was a materials handling robot and was soon followed by robots for welding and other applications. In 1975, Unimation showed its first profit. In 1978, the PUMA (Programmable Universal Machine for Assembly) robot was developed by Unimation from Vicarm (Victor Scheinman) and with support from General Motors. In 2005, Popular Mechanics magazine selected Devol's Unimate as one of the Top 50 Inventions of the Past 50 Years. Additional work Devol later obtained patents on visual and tactile sensors for robots, coaxial connectors, non-refillable containers, and magnetostrictive manipulators or \\"micro robotics\\", a field he created. *Elected to honorary member of the Society of Manufacturing Engineers (1985) *Inducted into the National Inventor's Hall of Fame (2011) *Member of the Automation Hall of Fame *Henry Ford and Smithsonian Museum collections both include Unimate robots *Devol's archives are with the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, Michigan Death Devol died on August 11, 2011, aged 99, at his home in Wilton, Connecticut.

Life and work Mrs. F.O.C. Darley Darley was born on June 23, 1822, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He was a self-taught and prolific artist who started out as a staff artist for a Philadelphia publishing company where he was given a wide variety of assignments. After he moved to New York, his work began to appear in magazines such as Harper's Weekly and in books by various publishers. Darley made 500 drawings for Lossing's History of the United States. Among his lithographic illustrations are those for Irving's \\"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\\", and some scenes in Indian life. The swing and vigor of his style, his facility, and versatility and the high average merit of his numerous works, make him one of the most noteworthy of American illustrators. Grave of F. O. C. Darley at Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, Massachusetts Darley signed a contract with Edgar Allan Poe on January 31, 1843, to create original illustrations for his upcoming literary journal The Stylus.Allen, Hervey. Israfel: The Life and Times of Edgar Allan Poe. New York: Farrar & Rinehart, Inc., 1934: 224. The contract, which was through July 1, 1844, requested at least three illustrations per month, \\"on wood or paper as required,\\" but no more than five, for $7 per illustration. The Stylus was never actually produced but Darley provided illustrations for the final installments of the first serial publication of Poe's award-winning tale \\"The Gold-Bug\\" later that year.Quinn, Arthur Hobson. Edgar Allan Poe: A Critical Biography. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1998: 338. . In 1848, Darley provided the drawings for the first fully illustrated edition of Irving's \\"Rip Van Winkle\\",Burstein, Andrew. The Original Knickerbocker: The Life of Washington Irving.

Chapel Hill: The University of North Carolina Press, 1967: 184. That same year, Darley also illustrated an edition of Irving's The Sketch Book of Geoffrey Crayon, Gent. and then his Wolfert's Roost in 1855. Over his career, he produced nearly 350 drawings for James Fenimore Cooper, later collected in a several-volume edition of Cooper's novels printed from 1859 to 1861. In 1868 he published, after a visit to Europe, Sketches Abroad with Pen and Pencil. His water color paintings of incidents in American history are full of spirit and his bank-note vignettes are also worthy of mention. In 1851, he was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Honorary member, and became a full Academician in 1852. John Neal Hoover has written a scholarly article on Darley with a section on further reading.Hoover, John Neal.

Manhattan Valley is a neighborhood in the northern part of Upper West Side in Manhattan, New York City. It is bounded by West 110th Street to the north, Central Park West to the east, West 96th Street to the south, and Broadway to the west. It was formerly known as the Bloomingdale District, a name still in occasional use. Geography Manhattan Valley occupies a natural depression running east‚Äìwest across Manhattan, declining rapidly from high rocky bluffs at the western border of modern Central Park, and following west the valley created by what was once a minor stream draining from roughly the area of the Harlem Meer into the Hudson River. The area is located on a gentle slope between West 96th Street and W. 110th Street. A division preferred by community groups extends the area south to W. 96th Street, a major thoroughfare which runs in its own natural valley and stretches across town through Central Park. From west to east, Broadway, Amsterdam Avenue, Columbus Avenue, Manhattan Avenue, and Central Park West are north‚Äìsouth thoroughfares through the neighborhood. Amsterdam Avenue, Broadway, and Central Park West proceed in an uninterrupted grid; Columbus Avenue becomes Morningside Drive north of W. 110th Street. Manhattan Avenue originates at 100th Street and proceeds north into Harlem. Several large swaths of Manhattan Valley are made up of residential developments which break the regular city street grid. The area from W. 100th to W. 97th Streets between Central Park West and Amsterdam Avenue consists of Park West Village, a \\"towers in a park\\" housing development. Another superblock, occupied by the Frederick Douglass Houses lies just to the north, bordered by Amsterdam Avenue, W. 100th Street, Manhattan Avenue, and West 104th Street. Columbus Avenue also passes through both of these developments.  History  Development= Church of the Ascension, at 107th Street between Amsterdam Avenue and Broadway Manhattan Valley was part of the Bloomingdale District, the name given to the farms and houses along the Bloomingdale Road along Manhattan's Upper West Side. The Dutch applied the name Bloemendaal, Anglicized to \\"Bloomingdale\\" or \\"the Bloomingdale District\\", to the west side of Manhattan from about 23rd Street up to the Hollow Way (modern 125th Street). It consisted of farms and villages along a road (regularized in 1703) known as the Bloomingdale Road. Bloomingdale Road was renamed The Boulevard in 1868, as the farms and villages were divided into building lots and absorbed into the city. By the 18th century it contained numerous farms and country residences of many of the city's well-off, a major parcel of which was the Apthorp Farm. The main artery was the Bloomingdale Road, which began north of where Broadway and the Bowery Lane (now Fourth Avenue) join (at modern Union Square) and wended its way northward to about modern 116th Street in Morningside Heights, where the road further north was known as the Kingsbridge Road. Within the confines of the modern-day Upper West Side, the road passed through the hamlets of Harsenville, bounded by 68th Street, 81st Street, Central Park West, and the Hudson River;Map adapted from Reprinted by Forgotten Books, 2015; . Strycker's Bay, located on a now- infilled inlet between 86th and 96th Streets; and Bloomingdale Village, a place near current Columbia University campus. In the early 1800s, John Clendening owned a farm covering much of the valley, roughly from the Bloomingdale Road to Eighth Avenue between 99th and 105th Streets, with a large mansion near Amsterdam and 104th Streets. As the farm was acquired prior to the introduction of the Commissioners' Plan of 1811, the boundaries of the farm did not line up precisely with the modern streets set up in the grid plan. The area was known as the \\"Clendening Valley.\\" Although the Clendening estate was divided and sold in 1845, the Clendening Valley name persisted until the 1880s, and a Clendening Hotel existed into the early 20th century. The construction of an elevated aqueduct to carry the Croton Aqueduct over the valley in 1838-42 separated the eastern side of the valley from the village of Bloomingdale which had emerged around the Bloomingdale Road, until the 1870s when it was replaced with an underground inverted siphon, and the old aqueduct was torn down. Early development in the 1870s and 1880s focused on institutional care for the ill or aged, and included the Hebrew Home for the Aged, the Catholic Old Age Home, the Home for Respectable Aged Indigent Females, and the Towers Nursing Home constructed as a cancer ward by John Jacob Astor III in 1884. Also located in Manhattan Valley at the time was the New York Cancer Hospital, built in 1887 at 455 Central Park West. These, together with the Lion Brewery, gave the area its earliest landmarks. The neighborhood began to fill out residentially at the end of the 19th century and beginning of the 20th, when the New York City Subway's IRT Ninth Avenue Line in 1870 and the IRT Broadway ‚Äì Seventh Avenue Line in 1904 allowed the public ready access to uptown Manhattan. Columbia's purchase of the Bloomingdale Lunatic Asylum at around the same time as the subway's arrival naturally made the neighborhood more attractive as well. The area was populated mostly by Irish and German immigrants through the 1950s. Young boys and girls took advantage of Central Park and Riverside Drive or played stick ball and roller hockey in the streets. The 1950s saw many migrants from Puerto Rico take up residence in the Upper West Side and a proposed project to eliminate the older brownstone apartments began to drive earlier residents to the suburbs. =Later years= American Youth Hostels building at Amsterdam and 103rd, formerly the Residence for Respectable Aged Indigent Females, is one of architect Richard Morris Hunt's few surviving projects in New York City. By the 1950s and 1960s, the area went into decline, in line with a trend of general urban deterioration in Manhattan. As middle-class residents left for the suburbs, buildings were allowed to fall into disrepair and were divided into small units for new low-rent tenants, many of them originally from Puerto Rico. Urban renewal programs, headed by city planner Robert Moses, called for several city blocks to be demolished in order to construct the Frederick Douglass Houses in the superblock where they stand today. The development of the Douglass Houses greatly increased the density of low-income renters without providing much in the way of amenities (food shops, clubs, restaurants, and open space) for them to use. Rampant graft and corruption associated with the project blighted their opening and brought ill repute on the neighborhood, and the debacle contributed strongly to Moses's fall from power and ouster. Although community groups, such as the Manhattan Valley Development Corporation, tried to find alternative solutions for the housing shortage in the area, the city's 1976 fiscal crisis caused many of these alternate plans to be shelved. The crime rate in the area increased dramatically, along with drug use and poverty. By 1960, the Bloomingdale neighborhood had the highest juvenile delinquency rate in Manhattan and the second highest number of welfare cases per 1,000 residents. New investment came to the area in the 1980s. Soon, however, new investment was brought to a halt by wavering property prices in the late 1980s and early 1990s, combined with the rise of crack use and dealers in the area, which gave Manhattan Valley the reputation as one of the easiest places in the city to score a hit. In addition, there was a lot of violence on the streets of Manhattan Valley, especially at night, when gang wars were prevalent. With the Wall Street boom in the early 1980s, Manhattan as a whole experienced a sharp recovery. Seventy years after the Bloomingdale Asylum's closing, the provenance of the name was fading into obscurity, and residents and brokers alike began referring to the neighborhood by its present name. The new name and recovery were both much bolstered by the non-profit Manhattan Valley Development Corporation (MVDC), founded in 1968. It sought to differentiate itself from other community development organizations by opposing the demolition of pre-war buildings in favor of renovation, and seeking to promote small business and \\"prevent harassment by out-side management companies prevalent in low income 'minority' neighborhoods.\\" = Gentrification = The Manhattan Avenue Historic District Manhattan Valley has gentrified significantly since the 1980s. With this gentrification, rents in the area rose. The estimated population of Latino residents was fast dwindling by 1987. Meanwhile, nonprofit groups started to renovate many structures that were owned by the city, as well as build housing on previously vacant tracts of land. Reactions to this gentrification were mixed. In 1990, one resident stated, \\"The crime situation is our biggest threat ‚Ä¶ but if we get rid of it, we're also faced with gentrification.\\" Coinciding with this gentrification in 1990, crime was declining steeply, although drug dealings were still common; one large drug arrest had been made in December of that year. The Frederick Douglass Houses, which had become frequented by drug dealers, was thought to be stymieing the development of new housing in the area, which included two apartment towers that had been constructed in the preceding two years. The Columbus Amsterdam business improvement district was organized in the late 1990s to develop stronger business presence along the main thoroughfares of Columbus and Amsterdam Avenues, and to provide entrepreneurial opportunities to locals. In 2005, brokers estimated that properties in the area were approximately 30% less expensive than comparable properties in the adjacent south. The neighborhood's proximity to the much-valued Central Park as well as to three separate subway lines make it attractive to young commuters, and as of 2006 prices were rising dramatically as New Yorkers were \\"tipped off\\" by their brokers. Many historical brownstones and townhouses were saved from demolition, particularly east of Columbus Avenue, where the property values are the highest. Yet the area remains diverse, representing a microcosm of the larger city in terms of the different ethnicities, ages and socioeconomic groups living within the same community.  Demographics  According to the 2000 United States Census (in which Manhattan Valley's census tracts are 187, 189, 191, 193, and 195), 48,983 people live in the community. Of the population, 44% are of Hispanic origin, 32% are African Americans, and 24% are Asians, whites, and other races. Fifty-five percent of the residents are of very low income (below 50% of the area's median family income, which is $13,854). In 2009, the more affluent families resided west of Broadway and east of Manhattan Avenue. Of the Manhattan Valley population, 20.76% had income from Social Security and 23% relied on public assistance.

History American explorer and US Navy lieutenant commander George W. De Long set out in 1879 aboard the , hoping to reach Wrangel Island and to discover open seas in the Arctic Ocean near the North Pole. However, the ship entered an ice pack near Herald Island in September 1879 and became trapped. The vessel drifted several hundred miles with the ice, passing north of Wrangel Island. In May 1881 it approached Jeannette Island and Henrietta Island. According to The Annual Report of the Secretary of the Navy, for the Year 1882 (p. 16), \\"A sled party landed, hoisted the national ensign, and took possession in the name of the United States\\".Naval Historical Center, 2003a, A Lengthy Deployment: The Jeannette Expedition in Arctic Waters as Described in Annual Reports of the Secretary of the Navy, 1880‚Äì1884 Last visited May 26, 2008.Naval Historical Center, 2003b, Jeannette Arctic Expedition, 1879‚Äì1881 ‚Äî Overview and Selected Images.

In 1916 the Russian ambassador in London issued an official notice to the effect that the Imperial government considered Henrietta, along with other Arctic islands, integral parts of the Russian Empire. This territorial claim was later maintained by the Soviet Union. A Soviet polar station was established on Henrietta Island in 1937 in an expedition by Rudolf Samoylovich, and closed in 1963.

Such doctrines are usually invoked where lawsuits involving the same issues are brought in two different court systems at the same time (such as federal and state courts). The United States has a federal court system with limitations on the cases that it can hear, while each state has its own individual court system. In some instances, the jurisdiction of these courts overlap, so a lawsuit between two parties may be brought in either or both courts. The latter circumstance can lead to confusion, waste resources, as well as cause the appearance that one court is disrespecting the other. Both federal and state courts have developed rules determining when one court will defer to another's jurisdiction over a particular case. Federal abstention doctrines The various abstention doctrines applied by federal courts are named for the United States Supreme Court cases in which they were enunciated. =Pullman abstention= Pullman abstention was the first \\"doctrine of abstention\\" to be announced by the Court, and is named for Railroad Commission v. Pullman Co., 312 U.S. 496 (1941). Concisely, the doctrine holds that \\"the federal courts should not adjudicate the constitutionality of state enactments fairly open to interpretation until the state courts have been afforded a reasonable opportunity to pass on them.\\"Edwards v. Aguillard oyez.org This doctrine permits a federal court to stay a plaintiff's claim that a state law violates the United States Constitution until the state's judiciary has had an opportunity to apply the law to the plaintiff's particular case. The hope is to avoid a federal constitutional ruling by allowing the state courts to construe the law in a way that eliminates the constitutional problem or to rule it void under the state's own constitution. For Pullman abstention to be invoked, three conditions must be apparent: # The case presents both state grounds and federal constitutional grounds for relief; # The proper resolution of the state ground for the decision is unclear; and # The disposition of the state ground could obviate adjudication of the federal constitutional ground. Under Pullman abstention, the federal court retains jurisdiction to hear the constitutional issues in the case if the state court's resolution is still constitutionally suspect. In Government and Civil Employees Organizing Committee, CIO v. Windsor, 353 U.S. 364 (1957), the Supreme Court held that litigants must inform the state court that they are contending that the state law violates a federal constitutional provision, so that the state court may take that into consideration when interpreting the state statute. However, in England v. Louisiana State Board of Medical Examiners, 375 U.S. 411 (1964), the Supreme Court noted that the litigants must not ask the state court to resolve the constitutional issue itself, or the federal court would be bound by res judicata to follow the decision of the state court. In such a case, the litigant seeking a judgment that the law is unconstitutional must usually appeal to the higher courts of the state, rather than seeking review in a federal court. =Younger abstention= Younger abstention, named for Younger v. Harris, 401 U.S. 37 (1971), is less permissive to the federal courts, barring them from hearing civil rights tort claims brought by a person who is currently being prosecuted for a matter arising from that claim in state court. For example, if an individual who was charged with drug possession under a state law believes that the search was illegal, and in violation of their Fourth Amendment rights, that person may have a cause of action to sue the state for illegally searching him. However, a federal court will not hear the case until the person is convicted of the crime. The doctrine has been extended to state civil proceedings in aid of and closely related to state criminal statutes,Huffman v. Pursue, Ltd., 420 U.S. 592, 43 L.Ed.2d 482, 95 S.Ct. 1200 (1975) administrative proceedings initiated by a state agency,Ohio Civil Rights Comm'n v. Dayton Christian Sch., Inc., 477 U.S. 619, 627 n.2, 91 L. Ed. 2d 512, 106 S. Ct. 2718 (1986) or situations where the State has jailed a person for contempt of court.Judice v. Vail, 430 U.S. 327 (1977) The doctrine applies even where the state does not bring an action until after the person has filed a lawsuit in federal court, provided that the federal court has not yet undergone proceedings of substance on the merits of the federal suit.Hicks v. Miranda, 422 U.S. 332, 45 L.Ed.2d 223, 95 S.Ct. 2281 (1975) There are three exceptions to Younger abstention: # Where the prosecution is in bad faith (i.e. the state knows the person to be innocent); or # Where the prosecution is part of some pattern of harassment against an individual; or # Where the law being enforced is utterly and irredeemably unconstitutional (e.g., if the state were to pass a law making it a crime to say anything negative about its governor under any circumstances). =Burford abstention and Thibodaux abstention= Burford abstention, derived from Burford v. Sun Oil Co., 319 U.S. 315 (1943), allows a federal court sitting in diversity jurisdiction to abstain where the state courts likely have greater expertise in a particularly complex area of state law (the case itself dealt with the regulation of oil drilling operations in Texas). Burford allows a federal court to dismiss a case only if: # The case presents \\"difficult questions of state law bearing on policy problems of substantial public import whose importance transcends the result in the case then at bar,\\" or # The adjudication of the case in a federal forum \\"would be disruptive of state efforts to establish a coherent policy with respect to a matter of substantial public concern.\\"Quackenbush v. Allstate Ins. Co, 517 U.S. 706, 727 (1996) Burford abstention is closely related to Thibodaux abstention, derived from Louisiana Power & Light Co. v. City of Thibodaux, 360 U.S. 25 (1959), which occurs when a federal court sitting in diversity jurisdiction chooses to allow a state to decide issues of state law that are of great public importance to that state, to the extent that a federal determination would infringe on state sovereignty. Unlike the abstention doctrines raised in federal question cases, there is a strong presumption that federal courts should not apply Burford or Thibodaux Abstention. =Colorado River abstention= Finally, Colorado River abstention, from Colorado River Water Conservation District v. United States, 424 U.S. 800 (1976) comes into play where parallel litigation is being carried out, particularly where federal and state court proceedings are simultaneously being carried out to determine the rights of parties with respect to the same questions of law. Under such circumstances, it makes little sense for two courts to expend the time and effort to achieve a resolution of the question. Unlike other abstention doctrines, application of the Colorado River doctrine is prudential and discretionary, and is based less on comity or respect between different court systems than on the desire to avoid wasteful duplication of litigation. The classification of the doctrine as a form of abstention has been disputed, with some courts simply calling it a \\"doctrine of exceptional circumstances\\". Each of the various federal circuits has come up with its own list of factors to weigh in determining whether a federal court should abstain from hearing a case under this doctrine. Typically, such factors include: * the order in which the courts assumed jurisdiction over property * the order in which the courts assumed jurisdiction over the parties * the relative inconvenience of the fora * the relative progress of the two actions (added by Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital v. Mercury Constr. Corp. in 1983) * the desire to avoid piecemeal litigation * whether federal law provides the rule of decision * whether the state court will adequately protect the rights of all parties * whether the federal filing was vexatious (intended to harass the other party) or reactive (in response to adverse rulings in the state court). =Note on the Rooker-Feldman doctrine= The Rooker-Feldman doctrine has some characteristics of an abstention doctrine, because it prohibits federal court review of state court actions. However, it does not require federal courts to abstain from hearing cases pending action in the state court, but instead deems that federal courts lack jurisdiction to hear cases already fully decided in state courts. The doctrine is not a judicially created exception to federal jurisdiction. Rather, the Rooker and Feldman cases simply recognized the fact that Congress has not granted the federal district or appeals courts statutory jurisdiction to consider appeals of state court decisions, only the US Supreme Court via a writ of certiorari). It is an open question whether Congress could grant such jurisdiction. State court abstention doctrines No national rule requires state courts to abstain from hearing cases brought in federal courts or in courts of other states, though the All Writs Act permits federal courts to enjoin state courts from hearing matters if necessary to preserve the jurisdiction of the federal court. But every state has some doctrine that lets its courts stay actions to avoid duplicative litigation. Some states have doctrines that let state courts abstain from hearing cases already pending in other kinds of tribunals. For example, in Gavle v. Little Six, Inc., 555 N.W.2d 284 (Minn. 1996), the Minnesota Supreme Court upheld abstention where the state court might \\"undermine the authority of the tribal courts over Reservation affairs\\" or \\"infringe on the right of Indians to govern themselves\\".

The pectineus muscle is the most anterior adductor of the hip. The muscle does adduct and laterally rotate the thigh but its primary function is hip flexion. It can be classified in the medial compartment of thigh (when the function is emphasized) or the anterior compartment of thigh (when the nerve is emphasized). Structure The pectineus muscle arises from the pectineal line of the pubis and to a slight extent from the surface of bone in front of it, between the iliopectineal eminence and pubic tubercle, and from the fascia covering the anterior surface of the muscle; the fibers pass downward, backward, and lateral, to be inserted into the pectineal line of the femur which leads from the lesser trochanter to the linea aspera. =Relations= The pectineus is in relation by its anterior surface with the pubic portion of the fascia lata, which separates it from the femoral artery and vein and internal saphenous vein, and lower down with the profunda artery. By its posterior surface with the capsule of the hip joint, and with the obturator externus and adductor brevis, the obturator artery and vein being interposed. By its external border with the psoas major, the femoral artery resting upon the line of interval. By its internal border with the outer edge of the adductor longus. Obturator foramen is situated directly behind this muscle, which forms one of its coverings. It forms part of the floor of the femoral triangle. =Innervation= The lumbar plexus is formed from the anterior rami of nerves L1 to L4 and some fibers from T12. With only five roots and two divisions, it is less complex than the brachial plexus and gives rise to a number of nerves including the femoral nerve and accessory obturator nerve. The pectineus muscle is considered a composite muscle as the innervation is by the femoral nerve (L2 and L3) and occasionally (20% of the population) a branch of the obturator nerve called the accessory obturator nerve. When it is present, the accessory obturator nerve innervates a portion of the pectineus muscle, entering the muscle on its dorsomedial aspect. The greater nerve to the muscle is the femoral nerve. Unlike the obturator accessory nerve, the femoral nerve is always present and provides the sole innervation for the pectineus muscle in over 90% of cases. The muscle is also innervated by the accessory obturator nerve in the 8.7% of cases in which the nerve occurs.5 Function It is one of the muscles primarily responsible for hip flexion. It also adducts the thigh. Additional images File:Gray235.pngRight hip bone. External surface. File:Gray344.pngStructures surrounding right hip- joint.

The corps was never formed, however, as the Japanese surrender obviated any need for it. Under the proposals the corps would have comprised Australian, British, Canadian and New Zealand forces. Proposal Planning by General Douglas MacArthur, as supreme commander of Allied forces, for Operation Olympic‚Äîas the initial landings on Ky≈´sh≈´ in late 1945 were to be known‚Äîrevolved around land forces composed entirely of US Army and Marine Corps units. However, the Australian Advisory War Council suggested to MacArthur that the significant involvement of Australian Army units in the Pacific War over the previous three years meant that they should be involved in landings on Kyushu; nevertheless, the Australian government was considering the attachment of smaller units to US formations. The aircraft carriers and battleships of a combined Commonwealth fleet, known as the British Pacific Fleet, were to be involved in Olympic, along with Australian cruisers and destroyers that had been integrated into US Navy task forces (since 1942). In addition, a 10-squadron Commonwealth heavy bomber force composed of two groups (one RCAF and one RAF-RAAF-RNZAF) in Europe and was to be based on Okinawa, under the code name \\"Tiger Force\\". The 12-squadron Australian First Tactical Air Force may have been transferred from the South-West Pacific,Horner 1982, p. 415. as might the heavy bombers of No. 11 Group RAAF. By mid-1945, United Kingdom leaders were proposing that a combined Commonwealth corps comprising five divisions be assembled in India, and that they be introduced to the campaign in Operation Coronet ‚Äì landings on Honsh≈´, near Tokyo Bay, during March 1946.Day 1992, p. 297. By the time of the Potsdam Conference, however, MacArthur was insisting that only three divisions should be part of the combined Commonwealth corps, as part of a US army-level formation. MacArthur also proposed that: the corps should be kept in reserve rather than taking part in initial landings; it should not include Indian Army units, due to \\"linguistic and administrative complications\\", and; in the interests of rationalising lines of supply, the Commonwealth divisions should be re-organised to resemble US divisions, as well as being trained and equipped with US weapons, vehicles and other key equipment.Day 1992, p. 299.Horner 1982, p. 416. Besides questions of American national prestige, which undoubtedly weighed heavily, behind these conditions was a desire to simplify the lines of communication and the logistic support arrangements of the invasion force. Indeed, once established in Japan MacArthur intended to switch his strategic lines of communication direct to America.Horner 1982, p. 414. On 8 August, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, General Alan Brooke proposed that the corps comprise one Australian, one British and one Canadian division, as well as two New Zealand brigades. The corps was to be formed in the United States and train there for six months before deployment, and would have also been organised along the lines of a US corps and utilise American equipment. It is generally considered that the corps was to have included the already established British 3rd Infantry Division, and two Australian and Canadian divisions being re-raised for the purpose of the invasion: the Australian 10th Infantry Division,Day 2003, p. 689.Robertson 1981, p. 196. and the 6th Canadian Infantry Division. British leaders were proposing that the corps be led by Lieutenant General Sir Charles Keightley, a British officer. The Australian government disagreed with the appointment of an officer with no experience fighting the Japanese, and instead proposed Lieutenant General Sir Leslie Morshead for the command.Horner 1982, p. 418. The details of the corps' deployment were still being discussed when the war was ended by the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, although it appears that the Commonwealth land forces would not have been used in the initial landings on Ky≈´sh≈´ under Operation Olympic. Instead they would most likely have been used during the landings on Honsh≈´, near Tokyo, which were scheduled to begin on 1 March 1946 under Operation Coronet, and which would have also included a French Corps.Weinberg 1994, p. 872. Regardless, some sources state that MacArthur was proposing the further reduction of the Commonwealth land forces to an elite division. However, considering the likelihood of extremely high casualties in any such invasion, it must be considered likely that a much larger number of Commonwealth troops would have become involved following the landings. CompositionCanadian= The Canadian Army Pacific Force was organized on the lines of a standard infantry division, with nine infantry battalions. However, to ease logistic concerns, U.S. military equipment was to be adopted, as well as U.S. Army organization. Therefore, three battalions were formed into \\"regiments\\" rather than brigades, and \\"cannon companies\\" were formed rather than anti-tank units. The battalions were named in Canadian fashion, rather than numbered, and the division was patterned after the 1st Canadian Infantry Division.Stacey, C.P.

He was executed in 1820 for the murder of the conservative dramatist August von Kotzebue the previous year in Mannheim. As a result of his execution, Sand became a martyr in the eyes of many German nationalists seeking the creation of a united German national state. Biography Karl Ludwig Sand was born to Gottfried Christoph Sand and his wife Dorothea Johanna Wilhelmina Sch√∂pf (1766‚Äì1826), on 5 October 1795. His siblings were George, Fritz, Caroline and Julia. =Education= Students marching towards the Wartburg, of which Sand was one. In 1804 he attended the Lateinschule (Latin school) in Wunsiedel and in 1810 he moved on to the grammar school (Gymnasium) in Hof, living with the school's rector, Georg Heinrich Saalfrank, a friend of Sand's Enlightened Protestant family. Following the closure of the Hof Gymnasium on the institution of Montgelas's Reforms, Sand followed his teacher to the Neues Gymnasium (New Grammar School) in Regensburg, completing his studies in September 1814. In November 1814 Sand matriculated at the University of T√ºbingen. In 1815, Sand volunteered under Major von Falkenhausen, participating in the Battle of Waterloo in June and in Paris by July. He returned from the war disillusioned with its results and fell into a deep depression. In 1816, while at the University of Erlangen, Sand formed Burschenschaft Teutonia with his friend Dittmar, meeting at castle ruins near Erlangen which they had named Ruttli. They built a meeting house for their group of 80 students. Sand's depression was further intensified by the destruction of Ruttli by the competing political group the Landmannschaft and the drowning death of Dittmar in 1817. Starting in 1817 he studied at the University of Jena, attending the lectures of Jakob Friedrich Fries, Heinrich Luden and Lorenz Oken and joining further Burschenschaften. Sand was among the nationalist students who gathered at the 1817 Wartburg festival, in which Kotzebue's History of the German Empires was one of the books ceremoniously burned. =Murder of August von Kotzebue= Illustration of Sand's attack on Kotzebue. Sand already contemplated the murder of August von Kotzebue in a diary entry of 5 May 1818. He called him a \\"traitor to the nation\\" and a \\"deceiver of the people\\" and characterized him as an enemy of the Burschenschaft. On the morning of 23 March 1819 Sand, using the pseudonym Henry, visited Kotzebue in his Mannheim house. Refused entry to the house and told to return in the afternoon, Sand returned just before five o'clock. Having exchanged just a few words with Kotzebue, Sand produced a dagger and, with the words \\"Here, you traitor to the fatherland!\\", stabbed him repeatedly in the chest. Surprised by Kotzebue's four-year-old son witnessing the event from the nursery, Sand lost his wits and stabbed himself. Leaving the house, he handed a servant a piece of writing he had prepared (\\"Death to August von Kotzebue\\"), and stabbed himself again in the street. His suicide attempt failed, and he was taken to hospital. Aftermath The Mannheim Hofgericht (court of law) sentenced Sand to death on 5 May 1820. He was beheaded by Franz Wilhelm Widmann, who was the official executioner at the time. The execution of Karl Ludwig Sand. His grave in Mannheim Sand's murder of Kotzebue was a catalyst for government restrictions on liberal and German nationalist thought. On 20 September 1819 Prince Klemens Wenzel von Metternich called a meeting of representatives from across the German Confederation to create the Carlsbad Decrees which outlawed the Burschenschaften and put limits on freedom of the press and the rights of members of such organizations, banning them from public office, teaching or studying at universities.Full text of Carlsbad Decrees Alexandre Dumas, p√®re wrote about Sand's life and published excerpts from his journals and letters in Karl Ludwig Sand,Karl Ludwig Sand by Alexandre Dumas, p√®re part of Celebrated Crimes.Celebrated Crimes, Alexandre Dumas, p√®re Prior to writing his story, Dumas visited Widmann's son in Mannheim in 1838 to gather information about Sand's character. Alexander Pushkin also memorialized Sand in his poem about assassins entitled \\"Kinzhal\\" (The Dagger).Terras, Victor, Handbook of Russian literature By Victor Terras page 96 In Germany three films have been made concerning the events of Karl Sand's life: Karl Sand in 1964, Sand in 1971, and Die Unbedingten in 2009.

Life Sayer was born October 18, 1799, \\"[t]he natural son of John Sayer of the parish of Sainte Anne,\\" and an Ojibway woman, Marguerite. Records from Pointe-Claire, Quebec indicate that he was baptized on July 21, 1815. Sayer enlisted as a coureur des bois with the McTavish, McGillivray & Company on April 7, 1818, as was registered by the notary J.-G. Beek at Ste Anne, Bout de l'Isle, in the west of the Island of Montreal. He was hired to work in the areas controlled by the North West Company. The contract is preserved in the Archives Nationales du Quebec. According to the Hudson Bay Archives, Pierre Guillaume worked for the North West Company at Cumberland House from 1818 to 1821, the year of the union of the North West and Hudson Bay Companies. From 1828 to 1829, he worked for the Hudson Bay Company as a Bowsman at Fort Pelly in the Swan River District and then stayed on as a Steersman from 1829 to 1832. In 1832, he was freed from his service in the Hudson Bay Company and moved to Grantown, near the Red River Settlement. On March 2, 1835, according to the St. Francois Xavier Catholic Church marriage records,Public Archives of Manitoba St. Fran√ßois Xavier Catholic Church marriage record, M 15 page 21 Sayer married Josephte Frobisher, the elder daughter of fur trader Alexander Frobisher and his Cree wife, on March 2, 1835 at St. Francois Xavier. Josephte, who was born around 1795 to 1807, was baptized the same day as the wedding. She and Sayer had eight sons and four daughters.Barkwell, Lawrence. http://www.metismuseum.ca/media/document.php/14587.Sayer,%20Pierre%20Guillaume%20(b.%201803).pdf Trial Sayer had been trading to Norman Kittson, now in Pembina, North Dakota, which was in direct violation of the company's monopoly. In 1849, Chief Factor John Ballenden arrested Sayer, Andr√© Goulet, Hector McGinnis, and Norbert Larond of Grantown as they were about to leave on a trading trip to Lake Manitoba. They were brought to trial before the General Quarterly Court of Assiniboia on May 17, 1849. Regehr, Ted D., \\"Pierre-Guillaume Sayer Trial\\", Encyclopedia of the Great Plains, (David J. Wishart, ed.) Sayer was backed by M√©tis leader Louis Riel Sr.. On the day of the trial, a crowd of armed M√©tis men gathered outside the courtroom, ready to support their M√©tis brother. They demanded for Sayer to be tried by a jury of his own choosing and to be allowed to take fellow M√©tis into the court with him. Although he was allowed to select a jury of his own, he was still found guilt. Judge Adam Thom, under immense pressure from the overwhelming number of armed M√©tis, levied no fine or punishment. With the cry, \\"Le commerce est libre! Le commerce est libre!\\" (\\"Free Trade! Free Trade!\\"), the HBC could no longer use the courts to enforce their monopoly on the settlers of Red River. In 1870 the trade monopoly was abolished, and trade in the region was opened to any entrepreneur. The company relinquished its ownership of Rupert's Land under the Rupert's Land Act 1868 enacted by the Canadian Parliament. Later life According to the church records at St. Laurent, Manitoba, Pierre Guillaume died on August 7, 1868 and was buried at St. Laurent the next day, August 8, 1868, at the age of 75. Father Laurent Simonet OMI, who started the mission and became its first parish priest in 1864, officiated. The witnesses were Baptiste Lavall√©e and Pierre Chartrand. Birth dates Sayer's birth year varies between 1779 and 1807 in other original sources. *1779 appears in the Manitoba census of 1834 and in the update of 1835. However, it seems to be a copyist error as the name above lacks its date, which is given to Pierre instead. The error is corrected in the formal census of 1835. *1793 is the date given in the registry of his death and burial at St. Laurent, Manitoba. *1796 is given on the census of 1849, the year in which he was tried in court. *1801 is from the fact that when he enlisted with the Hudson Bay Company in 1828, he stated that he was 27 years old. That is shown on the Servants List of 1828 and gives him 1801 as the year of his birth. *1803 is found on the censuses of 1833 and 1838. Pierre‚Äôs grandson, Alexander Henry Sayer, also stated that his grandfather was about 14 years old when he enlisted as a voyager in 1818. *1807 is from the censuses in 1835 and 1843.

(It had invited the Economic and Social Council to consider the matter in an earlier session.) The idea and practice of tolerance was widely promoted in schools in many member states. Tolerance was held to be an 'endangered virtue' in many parts of the world, particularly those who were under racial and religious wars, such as those in Bosnia and Rwanda. UNESCO said that five key planks were required to overcome intolerance: law, education, access to information, individual awareness and local solutions. Tolerance is thus a political, legal and moral duty to protect and preserve human rights. The International Day for Tolerance is now celebrated on November 16 every year, in recognition of the Paris Declaration which was signed that day in 1995 by 185 member states.

She was a historical contemporary of Dante Alighieri, who portrayed her as a character in the Divine Comedy. Life and death Daughter of Guido I da Polenta of Ravenna, Francesca was wedded in or around 1275 to the brave, yet crippled Giovanni Malatesta (also called Gianciotto or \\"Giovanni the Lame\\"), son of Malatesta da Verucchio, lord of Rimini. Translation and commentary by John Ciardi. The marriage was a political one; Guido had been at war with the Malatesta family, and the marriage of his daughter to Giovanni was a way to secure the peace that had been negotiated between the Malatesta and the Polenta families. While in Rimini, she fell in love with Giovanni's younger brother, Paolo. Though Paolo, too, was married, they managed to carry on an affair for some ten years, until Giovanni ultimately surprised them in Francesca's bedroom some time between 1283 and 1286, killing them both. Translation and commentary by Robert and Jean Hollander. In Inferno In the first volume of The Divine Comedy, Dante and Virgil meet Francesca and her lover Paolo in the second circle of hell, reserved for the lustful. Here, the couple are trapped in an eternal whirlwind, doomed to be forever swept through the air just as they allowed themselves to be swept away by their passions. Dante calls out to the lovers, who are compelled to briefly pause before him, and he speaks with Francesca. She obliquely states a few of the details of her life and her death, and Dante, apparently familiar with her story, correctly identifies her by name. He asks her what led to her and Paolo's damnation, and Francesca's story strikes such a chord within Dante that he faints out of pity.

Chief among them was one put forth by poet Giovanni Boccaccio in his commentary on The Divine Comedy, Esposizioni sopra la Comedia di Dante; he stated that Francesca had been tricked into marrying Giovanni through the use of Paolo as a proxy. Guido, fearing that Francesca would never agree to marry the crippled Giovanni, had supposedly sent for the much more handsome Paolo in Giovanni's stead. It wasn't until the morning after the wedding that Francesca discovered the deception. This version of events, however, is very likely a fabrication. It would have been nearly impossible for Francesca not to know who both Giovanni and Paolo were, and that Paolo was already married, given the dealings the brothers had had with Ravenna and Francesca's family. Also, Boccaccio was born in 1313, some 27 years after Francesca's death, and while many Dante commentators after Boccaccio echoed his version of events, none before him had mentioned anything similar. In the 19th century, the story of Paolo and Francesca inspired numerous theatrical, operatic, and symphonic adaptations.

It was formed in 1973 as an oppositional group of clergy following sweeping victories by Jacob Aall Ottesen Preus II (J. A. O. Preus II) and the LCMS's conservative wing, known as Confessional Lutherans, at the synod's 1973 convention in New Orleans. It was not considered a major issue in the LCMS when it began because it originally lacked significant lay support. ELIM gained further momentum in the wake of the 1974 Seminex controversy at Concordia Seminary in St. Louis, Missouri. The organization dedicated a large portion of its resources to supporting the break-away Seminex institution. Only after the Seminex controversy did ELIM begin to gain lay support. However, immediately after the Seminex controversy both the Confessional Lutherans and the ELIM claimed they did not want a schism. But after Preus was easily reelected as president of the LCMS in 1976 ELIM decided to become a confessing movement within the LCMS. ELIM, along with Seminex, did not fully support the Confessional Lutheran doctrine of Sola scriptura (by scripture alone), which states that all doctrine is derived from the Holy Scriptures, and Biblical innerrancy. The fight between the Confessional Lutherans and the liberals, most of whom held membership in ELIM, is commonly referred to as the Battle for the Bible. Confessional Lutherans claimed victory in the Battle for the Bible in that the smaller liberal wing later left the LCMS to join the Association of Evangelical Lutheran Churches. The Confessional Lutherans remaining in the LCMS viewed this victory as reaffirming the confessional nature of their denomination, as established by C. F. W. Walther, Wilhelm L√∂he, and F. C. D. Wyneken. For several years, ELIM published a newsletter entitled Missouri in Perspective, intended to provide liberal commentary on synodical affairs. Many of the leaders, ministers, and congregations that supported ELIM eventually left the LCMS in 1976 to form the Association of Evangelical Lutheran Churches (AELC), one of the three predecessor churches of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA). The organization survived as a cross-denominational group (composed of AELC and liberal LCMS members) until the ELCA came into existence in 1988.

The Diploma was written by the Minister of Interior, Agenor Go≈Çuchowski. It attempted to increase the power of the conservative nobles by giving them more power over their own lands through a program of aristocratic federalism. This policy was a failure almost from the start, and Franz Joseph was forced to make further concessions in the February Patent of 1861. Even so, historians have argued that the October Diploma began the \\"constitutional\\" period of the empire.Okey, Robin. Habsburg Monarchy c. 1765-1918. pg. 178. Chicago: Rand McNally and Company, 1969. Causes In 1860, Franz Josef and the Austrian Habsburg Empire were \\"threatened with a crisis of existence.\\"Taylor, A.J.P. Habsburg Monarchy 1809-1918. pg. 100. Hamish Hamilton: London, 1951. 1856 had begun a period of diplomatic isolation following the defeat of Russia, a key Austrian ally, in the Crimean War. The second war of Italian Independence had ended in 1859 with an Austrian defeat at the hands of Napoleon III, and Franz Josef was forced to cede Lombardy to the French. These losses worsened the already weak state of the Austrian economy and exposed the weaknesses of the empire's bureaucracy. Both liberals and conservatives were anxious for reform after a decade of near absolutist rule, while Hungarians and Czechs wanted greater autonomy over their own affairs. In March 1860, Franz Josef asked the Imperial Parliament, or Reichsrat, to advise the emperor on matters of reform. The Reichsrat, composed almost entirely of conservative aristocrats, naturally recommended a reconstruction of the empire based on the principles of aristocratic federalism. Their report was ignored by Franz Josef, but by the end of the year, he would adopt the principles of aristocratic federalism in his own document. It was the realities of foreign policy that led the emperor to adopt the conservatives‚Äô ideas. He hoped to establish a Holy Alliance with Czar Alexander II of Russia and King William I of Prussia and believed that a strongly conservative domestic policy would be an advantage in the upcoming negotiations. He demanded that a constitution be written within a week and settled the general principles of the document during a train stop en route to the conference. Results Historian A.J.P. Taylor called the Diploma a victory for the Old Conservative nobility. The Habsburg government was reorganized on a federal basis, and the provincial diets were given the power to cooperatively pass laws with the Emperor and the Reichstrat. In a concession to the liberals, the membership of the Reichsrat was increased by over a hundred new members. However, the Diploma called for the Reichsrat to meet very infrequently, and its jurisdiction covered only part of the empire. The provincial diets were packed with the landed aristocracy, thus giving them more direct power over their own lands. Hungary was given special status in the Reichsrat through a provision that called for non-Hungarian delegates to meet separately from the whole body to discuss non-Hungarian matters. This, however, fell far short of the Hungarian leaders' desire for greater autonomy and recognition. Almost immediately after the Diploma was passed, it became clear that it would not last long. The empire's finances continued to fail, further showing the weaknesses of the current administration. Prussia and the German Confederation began to sense a weakness in the monarchy that could be exploited, while Hungarians were furious with the few reforms they had been given. Additionally, the Tsar disapproved of granting a Federal Constitution to Galicia. In the end, it was the German liberals who were eventually able to effect change. These liberals made up a substantial number of the most powerful bureaucrats and, while they often opposed the emperor, they were supporters of a strong centralized state instead of a weak, federalized one. Through their influence, the emperor was pressured into appointing the liberal Anton von Schmerling as Secretary of State in December. Von Schmerling took to rewriting the October Diploma, and in February 1861, the emperor adopted the February Patent. NotesSources *Jelavich, Barbara.

A VLSI VL82C106 Super I/O chip The original business plan was to be a contract wafer fabrication company, but the venture investors wanted the company to develop IC (Integrated Circuit) design tools to help fill the foundry. Thanks to its Caltech and UC Berkeley students, VLSI was an important pioneer in the electronic design automation (EDA) industry. It offered a sophisticated package of tools, originally based on the 'lambda- based' design style advocated by Carver Mead and Lynn Conway. L. Conway,2012. Reminiscences of the VLSI Revolution. http://ai.eecs.umich.edu/people/conway/Memoirs/VLSI/Lynn_Conway_VLSI_Reminiscences.pdf Accessed 14nov2019 An early challenge for the fledgling company was the so- called Bagpipe project. In January 1982, Steve Jobs approached a group of VLSI Technology managers including Jack Balletto with a request: Would they help Apple Inc. build a custom chip for the not-yet-announced Macintosh computer? In spite of the fact that VLSI's design tools were still in their infancy, the offer proved irresistible because of the prestige the chip would confer on the company if successful. For the VLSI Technology engineering team, this project became an all-hands-on-deck effort. Working side by side with Apple engineers Burrell Smith and Martin Haeberli, the group delivered a packaged prototype by September. Although the chip (referred to as the Integrated Burrell Machine) was functional, its performance fell short of expectations, and schedule pressures caused Apple to drop the chip in favor of a more conservative design -- a big disappointment for VLSI Technology.

VLSI became an early vendor of standard cell (cell-based technology) to the merchant market in the early 1980s where the other ASIC- focused company, LSI Logic, was a leader in gate arrays. Prior to VLSI's cell- based offering, the technology had been primarily available only within large vertically integrated companies with semiconductor units such as AT&T; and IBM. VLSI's design tools included not only design entry and simulation but eventually also cell-based routing (chip compiler), a datapath compiler, SRAM and ROM compilers, and a state machine compiler. The tools were an integrated design solution for IC design and not just point tools, or more general purpose system tools. A designer could edit transistor-level polygons and/or logic schematics, then run DRC and LVS, extract parasitics from the layout and run Spice simulation, then back-annotate the timing or gate size changes into the logic schematic database. Characterization tools were integrated to generate FrameMaker Data Sheets for Libraries. In March 1991, VLSI spun off its IC design tools group into a wholly owned subsidiary, Compass Design Automation. EE Times, March 11, 1991 The Compass subsidiary was purchased by Avanti Corporation in 1997. VLSI's physical design tools were critical not only to its ASIC business, but also in setting the bar for the commercial electronic design automation (EDA) industry. When VLSI and its main ASIC competitor, LSI Logic, were establishing the ASIC industry, commercially available tools could not deliver the productivity necessary to support the physical design of hundreds of ASIC designs each year without the deployment of a substantial number of layout engineers. The companies' development of automated layout tools was a rational \\"make because there's nothing to buy\\" decision. The EDA industry finally caught up in the late 1980s when Tangent Systems released its TanCell and TanGate products. In 1989, Tangent was acquired by Cadence Design Systems (founded in 1988). Unfortunately, for all VLSI's initial competence in design tools, they were not leaders in semiconductor manufacturing technology. VLSI had not been timely in developing a 1.0 Œºm manufacturing process as the rest of the industry moved to that geometry in the late 1980s. VLSI entered a long-term technology partnership with Hitachi and finally released a 1.0 Œºm process and cell library (actually more of a 1.2 Œºm library with a 1.0 Œºm gate). As VLSI struggled to gain parity with the rest of the industry in semiconductor technology, the design flow was moving rapidly to a Verilog HDL and synthesis flow. Cadence acquired Gateway, the leader in Verilog hardware design language (HDL) and Synopsys was dominating the exploding field of design synthesis. As VLSI's tools were being eclipsed, VLSI waited too long to open the tools up to other fabs and Compass Design Automation was never a viable competitor to industry leaders. Meanwhile, VLSI entered the merchant high speed static RAM (SRAM) market as they needed a product to drive the semiconductor process technology development. All the large semiconductor companies built high speed SRAMs with cost structures VLSI could never match. VLSI withdrew once it was clear that the Hitachi process technology partnership was working. ARM60 CPU chip ARM Ltd was formed in 1990 as a semiconductor intellectual property licensor, backed by Acorn, Apple, and VLSI. VLSI became a licensee of the powerful ARM processor. Initial adoption of the ARM processor was slow. Few applications could justify the overhead of an embedded 32-bit processor. In fact, despite the addition of further licensees, the ARM processor enjoyed little market success until they developed the novel 'thumb' extensions. Ericsson adopted the ARM processor in a VLSI chipset for its GSM handset designs in the early 1990s. It was the GSM boost that is the foundation of ARM the company/technology that it is today. Only in PC chipsets, did VLSI dominate in the early 1990s. This product was developed by five engineers using the \\"Megacells\\" in the VLSI library that led to a business unit at VLSI that almost equaled its ASIC business in revenue. VLSI eventually ceded the market to Intel because Intel was able to package-sell its processors, chipsets, and even board-level products together. VLSI also had an early partnership with PMC, a design group that had been nurtured of British Columbia Bell. When PMC wanted to divest its semiconductor intellectual property venture, VLSI's bid was beaten by a creative deal by Sierra Semiconductor. The telecom business unit management at VLSI opted to go it alone. PMC Sierra became one of the most important telecom ASSP vendors. Scientists and innovations from the 'design technology' part of VLSI found their way to Cadence Design Systems (by way of Redwood Design Automation). Compass Design Automation (VLSI's CAD and Library spin-off) was sold to Avant! Corporation, which itself was acquired by Synopsys.  Global expansion, ARM, GSM and Philips/NXP  VLSI maintained operations throughout the USA, and in Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Singapore and Taiwan. One of its key sites was in Tempe, Arizona, where a family of highly successful chipsets was developed for the IBM PC. In 1990, VLSI Technology, Acorn Computers, and Apple Computer were the founding investing partners in ARM Ltd. Ericsson of Sweden, after many years of collaboration, was by 1998, VLSI's largest customer, with annual revenue of $120 million. VLSI's datapath compiler (VDP) was the value-added differentiator that opened the door at Ericsson in 1987/8. The silicon revenue and GPM enabled by VDP must make it one of the most successful pieces of customer-configurable, non-memory silicon intellectual property (SIP) in the history of the industry. Within the Wireless Products division, based at Sophia-Antipolis in France, VLSI developed a range of algorithms and circuits for the GSM standard and for cordless standards such as the European DECT and the Japanese PHS. Stimulated by its growth and success in the wireless handset IC area, Philips Electronics acquired VLSI in June 1999, for about $1 billion. The former components survive to this day as part of Philips spin-off NXP Semiconductors.

He was fluent in over 10 languages (including Korean, Chinese, Turkish, and Persian, the last one learned especially in order to read works by Omar Khayy√°m). Early life Vyacheslav Menzhinsky, a member of the Polish nobility, was born into a Polish-Russian family of teachers. His father was a Russified Pole and tsarist official. He graduated from the Faculty of Law at Saint Petersburg University in 1898. Political activism He joined the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (RSDLP) in 1902. In 1905 he became a member of the military organization of the Petersburg Committee of the RSDLP. In 1906 Menzhinsky was arrested, but was able to escape from Russia. He lived in Belgium, Switzerland, France, United States, working in foreign branches of the RSDLP. He joined the editorial board of Vpered, aligning himself with Grigory Aleksinsky and Mikhail Pokrovsky, rejecting the concept of proletarian culture developed by Alexander Bogdanov and Anatoly Lunacharsky. After the February Revolution of 1917, Menzhinsky returned to Russia in the summer of that year. Later life and death According to G. von Schantz, Menzhinsky \\"personally conducted the wrecking of the Russian banks, a maneuver that deprived all opponents of Bolshevism of their financial means of warfare.\\" From 1919 he was a member of the Presidium of Cheka, and five years later became a deputy chairman of its successor, the OGPU. After Felix Dzerzhinsky's death in July 1926 Menzhinsky became the chairman of the OGPU. Menzhinsky played a great role in conducting the secret Trust and Sindikat-2 counterintelligence operations, in the course of which leaders of large anti-Soviet centers abroad, Boris Savinkov and Sidney Reilly, were lured to the USSR and arrested. At the same time, as a senior Chekist, Menzhinsky was loyal to Joseph Stalin, whose personality cult had already begun to form, coinciding with several important purges in 1930‚Äì1931. Trotsky, who had met him before the revolution, thought him unremarkable: \\"He seemed more like the shadow of some other unrealized man, or rather like a poor sketch for an unfinished portrait.\\" Menzhinsky spent his last years as an invalid, suffering from acute angina since the late 1920s, which rendered him incapable of physical exertion. He conducted the affairs of the OGPU while lying upon a couch in his office at the Lubyanka, but rarely interfered in the day-to-day operation of the GPU. Stalin tended to deal with his first deputy Genrikh Yagoda, who essentially took over as head of the organization in all but name beginning in the late 1920s.\\"Vyacheslav Menzhinsky\\" article on the Spartacus Educational website Menzhinsky died in 1934. When his successor, Yagoda, made his public confession under duress at the Moscow Trial of the Twenty One in 1938, Yagoda stated that he had poisoned Menzhinsky.

He was later the United States Minister to Chile and an unsuccessful candidate for the U.S. House of Representatives. Nicknamed \\"Kilcavalry\\" (or \\"Kill-Cavalry\\") for using tactics in battle that were considered as recklessly disregarding the lives of soldiers under his command, Kilpatrick was both praised for the victories he achieved, and despised by Southerners whose homes and towns he devastated. Early life Hugh Judson Kilpatrick, more commonly referred to as Judson Kilpatrick, the fourth child of Colonel Simon Kilpatrick and Julia Wickham, was born on the family farm in Wantage Township, near Deckertown, New Jersey (now Sussex Borough). Civil War Kilpatrick graduated from the United States Military Academy in 1861, just after the start of the war, and was commissioned a second lieutenant in the 1st U.S. Artillery. Within three days he was a captain in the 5th New York Infantry (\\"Dury√©e's Zouaves\\").https://catalog.archives.gov/id/76062548 Kilpatrick was the first United States Army officer to be wounded in the Civil War, struck in the thigh by canister fire while leading a company at the Battle of Big Bethel, June 10, 1861.Snell (2016), p. 91. Felix Agnus is credited with saving his life during the Battle of Big Bethel. By September 25 he was a lieutenant colonel, now of the 2nd New York Cavalry Regiment, which he helped to raise, and it was the mounted arm that brought him fame and infamy.https://catalog.archives.gov/id/76062548https://catalog.archives.gov/id/77319409 Assignments were initially quiet for Lt. Col. Kilpatrick, serving in staff jobs and in minor cavalry skirmishes. That changed in the Second Battle of Bull Run in August 1862. He raided the Virginia Central Railroad early in the campaign and then ordered a foolish twilight cavalry charge the first evening of the battle, losing a full squadron of troopers. Nevertheless, he was promoted to full colonel on December 6. Kilpatrick was aggressive, fearless, ambitious, and blustery. He was a master, in his mid-twenties, of using political influence to get ahead. His men had little love for his manner and his willingness to exhaust men and horses and to order suicidal mounted cavalry charges. (The rifled muskets introduced to warfare in the 1850s made the historic cavalry charge essentially an anachronism. Cavalry's role shrank primarily to screening, raiding, and reconnaissance.) The widespread nickname they used for Kilpatrick was \\"Kill Cavalry\\". He also had a bad reputation with others in the Army. His camps were poorly maintained and frequented by prostitutes, often visiting Kilpatrick himself. He was jailed in 1862 on charges of corruption, accused of selling captured Confederate goods for personal gain. He was jailed again for a drunken spree in Washington, D.C., and for allegedly accepting bribes in the procurement of horses for his command. Harper's Weekly rendering of Kilpatrick's raid In February 1863, Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker created a Cavalry Corps in the Army of the Potomac, commanded by Maj. Gen. George Stoneman. Kilpatrick assumed command of the 1st Brigade, 2nd Division. In the Chancellorsville Campaign in May, Stoneman's cavalry was ordered to swing deeply behind Gen. Robert E. Lee's army and destroy railroads and supplies. Kilpatrick did just that, with gusto. Although the corps failed to distract Lee as intended, Kilpatrick achieved fame by aggressively capturing wagons, burning bridges, and riding around Lee, almost to the outskirts of Richmond, Virginia, in Stoneman's 1863 Raid. =Gettysburg Campaign= Union Cavalry General Judson Kilpatrick At the beginning of the Gettysburg Campaign, on June 9, 1863, Kilpatrick fought at Brandy Station, the largest cavalry battle of the war. He received his brigadier general's star at the age of 27 on June 13, fought at Aldie and Upperville, and assumed division command three days before the Battle of Gettysburg commenced. On June 21, he was captured at Upperville, but was quickly rescued, going on to risk his life that same day in order to rescue the wounded commander of the 5th North Carolina Cavalry.Snell (2016), p. 93. On June 30, he clashed briefly with J.E.B. Stuart's cavalry at Hanover, Pennsylvania, but then proceeded on a wild goose chase in pursuit of Stuart, rather than fulfilling his mission of intelligence gathering. On the second day of the Gettysburg battle, July 2, 1863, Kilpatrick's division skirmished against Wade Hampton five miles northeast of town at Hunterstown. He then settled in for the night to the southeast at Two Taverns. One of his famous brigade commanders, Brig. Gen. George A. Custer, was ordered to join Brig. Gen. David McM. Gregg's division for the next day's action against Stuart's cavalry east of town, so Kilpatrick was down to one brigade. On July 3, after Pickett's Charge, he was ordered by army commander Maj. Gen. George G. Meade and Cavalry Corps commander Alfred Pleasonton to launch a cavalry charge against the infantry positions of Lt. Gen. James Longstreet's Corps on the Confederate right flank, just west of Little Round Top. Kilpatrick's lone brigade commander, Brig. Gen. Elon J. Farnsworth, protested against the futility of such a move. Kilpatrick essentially questioned his bravery and allegedly dared him to charge: \\"Then, by God, if you are afraid to go I will lead the charge myself.\\" Farnsworth reluctantly complied with the order. He was killed in the attack and his brigade suffered significant losses. Kilpatrick and the rest of the cavalry pursued and harassed Lee during his retreat back to Virginia. That fall, he took part in an expedition to destroy the Confederate gunboats Satellite and Reliance in the Rappahannock River, boarding them and capturing their crews successfully. =The Dahlgren Affair= Kilpatrick and his 3rd Division staff, March 1864 Just before the start of Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant's Overland Campaign in the spring of 1864, Kilpatrick conducted a raid toward Richmond and through the Virginia Peninsula, hoping to rescue Union prisoners of war held at Belle Isle and in Libby Prisons in Richmond. Kilpatrick took his division out on February 28, sneaking past Robert E. Lee's flank and driving south for Richmond. On March 1, they were within 5 miles of the city. Defenses around the city were too strong however and numerous squads of Confederate militia and cavalry nipped at their heels the whole way, including some of General Wade Hampton's troopers dispatched from the Army of Northern Virginia. Unable to get at Richmond or return to the Army of the Potomac, Kilpatrick decided to bolt down the Virginia Peninsula where Ben Butler's Army of the James was stationed. Meanwhile, the general was dismayed to find out that Ulric Dahlgren's brigade (detached from the main force) had not made it across the James River. Eventually 300 of the latter's troopers stumbled into camp, Dahlgren and the rest seemingly vanished into thin air. The survivors reported that they'd made a nightmarish journey through the countryside around Richmond in darkness and a sleet storm, the woods filled with enemy troops and hostile civilians at every turn. Dahlgren and the 200 cavalrymen he was accompanying had been told by a slave of a place where the James was shallow and could be forded. When they got there, the river was swelled up and cresting. Convinced he'd been tricked, Dahlgren ordered the slave hanged. They went back north and found that Kilpatrick was gone and they were alone in a hostile country. The troopers battled their way to the Mattaponi River, crossed, and appeared to be safe from danger, but in the dark they ran into a Confederate ambush. Dahlgren was shot dead along with many of his men, the rest being taken prisoner. His body was then displayed in Richmond as a war trophy. Papers found on the body of Dahlgren shortly after his death described the object of the expedition, and they were apparently altered to read that he wanted to burn and loot Richmond and assassinate Jefferson Davis and the whole Confederate cabinet. The raid had resulted in 324 cavalrymen killed and wounded, and 1000 more taken prisoner. In addition, Kilpatrick's men had cut a swathe of destruction across the outskirts of Richmond, destroying tobacco barns, boats, railroad cars and tracks, and other infrastructure. They also deposited a large number of pamphlets in and around homes and other buildings offering amnesty to any Southern civilian who took the oath of loyalty to the United States. The discovery and publication of the Dahlgren Papers sparked an international controversy. General Braxton Bragg denounced the papers as \\"fiendish\\" and Confederate Secretary of War James Seddon proposed that the Union prisoners be hanged. Robert E. Lee agreed that they made for an atrocious document, but urged calm, saying that no actual destruction had taken place and the papers might very well be fakes. In addition, Lee was concerned because some Confederate guerrillas had just been captured by the Army of the Potomac, which was considering hanging them, and execution of Dahlgren's men might set off a chain reaction. The Confederate general sent the papers to George Meade under a flag of truce and asked him to provide an explanation. Meade wrote back that no burnings or assassinations had been ordered by anyone in Washington or the army. Meanwhile, newspapers and politicians in the North and South exchanged blows. The former condemned the use of Ulric Dahlgren's corpse as a carnival attraction and the latter accused Lincoln's government of wanting to conduct indiscriminate pillage and slaughter on Virginia civilians, including the claim that Kilpatrick wanted to free Union prisoners and turn them loose on the women of Richmond. Northern papers also cheered the destruction caused by the raid and took pleasure in describing the ravaged condition of the Virginia countryside. After reaching Ben Butler's base at Fort Monroe, Kilpatrick's men took a steamship back to Washington. More trouble followed when they were granted a few days' rest in Alexandria, Virginia before rejoining the Army of the Potomac. The city was garrisoned with African-American troops, and one stopped to inform a cavalryman that only persons on active duty were allowed to ride horses through the streets. This trooper found it insulting to take orders from a black man and promptly struck him down with his sword. Kilpatrick's division was punished by being forced to immediately embark for the Rapidan River without resting or drawing new uniforms. The \\"Kilpatrick-Dahlgren\\" expedition was such a fiasco that Kilpatrick found he was no longer welcome in the Eastern Theater. He transferred west to command the 3rd Division of the Cavalry Corps of the Army of the Cumberland, under Maj. Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman. =Final campaigns through Georgia and the Carolinas= Historical marker of Kilpatrick Summing up Judson Kilpatrick in 1864, Sherman said \\"I know that Kilpatrick is a hell of a damned fool, but I want just that sort of man to command my cavalry on this expedition.\\" Starting in May 1864, Kilpatrick rode in the Atlanta Campaign. On May 13, he was severely wounded in the thigh at the Battle of Resaca and his injuries kept him out of the field until late July. He had considerable success raiding behind Confederate lines, tearing up railroads, and at one point rode his division completely around the enemy positions in Atlanta. His division played a significant role in the Battle of Jonesborough on August 31, 1864. Kilpatrick continued with Sherman through his March to the Sea to Savannah and north in the Carolinas Campaign. He delighted in destroying Southern property. On two occasions his coarse personal instincts betrayed him: Confederate cavalry under the command of Maj. Gen. Wade Hampton raided his camp while he was in bed with Marie Boozer whom he had met while going through Columbia, and, at the Battle of Monroe's Crossroads, he was forced to flee for his life in his underclothes until his troops could reform. Kilpatrick accompanied Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman to the surrender negotiations held at Bennett Place near Durham, North Carolina, on April 17, 1865. Kilpatrick later commanded a division of the Cavalry Corps in the Military Division of the Mississippi from April to June 1865, and was promoted to major general of volunteers on June 18, 1865. He resigned from the Army on December 1, 1865. Later life Kilpatrick was an early member of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States, a military society composed of officers who had served in the Union armed forces and their descendants. He was elected a First Class Companion in the Pennsylvania Commandery on November 1, 1865 and was assigned insignia number 63. Kilpatrick became active in politics as a Republican and in 1880 was an unsuccessful candidate for the U.S. Congress from New Jersey. In November 1865, Kilpatrick was appointed Minister to Chile by President Andrew Johnson. This appointment was announced concurrently with the inclusion of Kilpatrick's name on a list of Republicans arrested for bribery.http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85054616/1865-11-22/ed-1/seq-2/#date1=1865&index;=3&rows;=20&searchType;=advanced&language;=&sequence;=0&words;=Forrest+Kilpatrick&proxdistance;=5&date2;=1880&ortext;=&proxtext;=&phrasetext;=&andtext;=forrest+kilpatrick&dateFilterType;=yearRange&page;=1 Raftsman's Journal Newspaper, Clearfield, Pa., November 22, 1865, Page 2 He was continued as Minister by President Grant. As American Minister to Chile, he was involved in an attempt to arbitrate between the combatants of the Chincha Islands War after the Valparaiso bombardment (1866). The attempt failed, as the chief condition of Spanish admiral M√©ndez N√∫√±ez was the return of the captured Covadonga. Kilpatrick asked the American naval commander Commander John Rodgers to defend the port and attack the Spanish fleet. Admiral M√©ndez N√∫√±ez famously responded with, \\"I will be forced to sink [the US ships], because even if I have one ship left I will proceed with the bombardment. Spain, the Queen and I prefer honor without ships to ships without honor.\\" (\\"Espa√±a prefiere honra sin barcos a barcos sin honra.\\") Kilpatrick was recalled in 1870. The 1865 appointment seems to have been the result of a political deal. Kilpatrick had been a candidate for the Republican nomination for governor of New Jersey but lost out to Marcus Ward. Due to his service in helping Ward, Kilpatrick was rewarded with the post in Chile. Due to the Grant administration recalling him, Kilpatrick supported Horace Greeley in the 1872 presidential election. By 1876, Kilpatrick returned to the Republicans and supported Rutherford B. Hayes for the presidency. In Chile he married, as his second wife, Luisa Fernandez de Valdivieso, {1836-1928} a member of a wealthy family of Spanish origin that had emigrated to South America in the 17th century. They had two daughters: Julia Mercedes Kilpatrick (b. Nov 6, 1867 Santiago, Chile ‚Äì d ? Married Nov 7, 1894 to US Army Brigadier General William Carroll Rafferty) and Laura Delphine Kilpatrick {1874-1956} married June 29, 1897 to Harry Hays Morgan (b. 1859 New Orleans-d.England 1933; son of Philip H. Morgan, divorced 1927). Laura Kilpatrick and Harry Morgan were the parents of twin sisters Thelma Furness, Viscountess Furness and Gloria Morgan Vanderbilt; Artist and socialite Gloria Vanderbilt (1924 - 2019) was Hugh Judson Kilpatrick's great-granddaughter. Another prominent descendant is CNN newsman Anderson Cooper, Kilpatrick's great-great-grandson. In March 1881, in recognition of Kilpatrick's service to the Republicans in New Jersey as well as a consolation prize for his defeat for a House seat, President James Garfield appointed Kilpatrick again to the post of Minister to Chile, where he died shortly after his arrival in the Chilean capital Santiago. His remains returned to the United States in 1887 and were interred at the West Point Cemetery in West Point, New York.https://catalog.archives.gov/id/77154378 Kilpatrick was the author of two plays, Allatoona: An Historical and Military Drama in Five Acts (1875) and The Blue and the Gray: Or, War is Hell (posthumous, 1930).

It was signed in Calgary, Alberta, on September 14, 1997, by all Canadian premiers and territorial leaders except Quebec's Lucien Bouchard. The Declaration had followed controversial and divisive constitutional debate in Canada seen during the patriation of the Constitution in 1982, and the subsequent collapse of the Meech Lake and Charlottetown Accords. Content Both the Meech Lake and Charlottetown Accords, had they been enacted, would have controversially bestowed upon Quebec the status of a \\"distinct society.\\" The Declaration thus parted from this trend by referring to the \\"unique character of Quebec society\\" rather than endorsing the recognition of Quebec as a distinct society. The role of the National Assembly of Quebec in promoting this uniqueness (specified as including the predominant use of the French language, its culture and its civil law) was affirmed. Notwithstanding the uniqueness of Quebec's characteristics and the characteristics of other provinces, the Declaration stated that all provinces must have legal equality. Moreover, powers gained by any province during future constitutional negotiations would also have to be offered to the other provinces. In the process, Canadian federalism was reaffirmed as the form of Canada's government, and it was stated that this system could operate to ensure Canadians would receive social services, as long as the various levels of government \\"work in partnership while respecting each other's jurisdictions.\\" The Declaration also affirmed equality rights (including \\"equality of opportunity\\") and recognized Canada's multiculturalism, indeed asserting that Canada's \\"diversity\\" and \\"tolerance\\" are \\"without rival in the world.\\" In recognizing Canada's diversity, the Declaration made explicit reference to the \\"Aboriginal peoples and cultures.\\" Reaction According to an opinion poll conducted by Angus Reid in November 1997, 62% of Canadians supported the Declaration's principles (39% \\"moderately\\", 23% \\"strongly\\"). 30% were opposed and 7% had no opinion. These numbers were similar to Quebec's, which found 23% \\"strongly\\" in favour and 36% \\"moderately\\" in favour (59% overall), and 30% opposed. Radio-Canada also found that in Quebec, 80% of the province's residents would classify the Declaration as \\"acceptable\\"; 18% were opposed.Uni.ca, \\"The Calgary Declaration\\", URL accessed 17 December 2006. Quebec Liberal Jean Charest voiced some support for the Calgary Declaration. However, a Parti Qu√©b√©cois minister Guy Chevrette said a referendum should take place before Quebec should adopt the Declaration, and sovereignty should be an option in such a referendum. In 2006, the eventually successful candidate for the leadership of the Liberal Party of Canada St√©phane Dion recalled the Declaration as being unsuccessful. \\"Few people remember\\" the Declaration, he writes, and in Quebec the Declaration was quickly dismissed by politicians because it \\"had no teeth\\".St√©phane Dion, \\"What, exactly, do we mean by 'nation'?\\", National Post, October 26, 2006, A.14. Journalist Paul Wells highlighted items he thought were missing from the Declaration, saying, \\"The Calgary declaration says nothing about health care, good schools, the return of prosperity, the slow rebirth of a thoughtful Canadian foreign policy, or the possibility of sharing good ideas and ennobling projects with fellow citizens who don't speak the same language but who share the same values.\\"Paul Wells, \\"Charest wins on platitudes\\", Guardian, Charlottetown, P.E.I.: May 1, 1998, pg.

The wrongdoing is typically defined by a codification of legislation, regulations, and decrees. The civil fine is not considered to be a criminal punishment, because it is primarily sought in order to compensate the state for harm done to it, rather than to punish the wrongful conduct. As such, a civil penalty, in itself, will not carry jail time or other legal penalties. For example, if a person were to dump toxic waste in a state park, the state would have the same right to seek to recover the cost of cleaning up the mess as would a private landowner, and to bring the complaint to a court of law, if necessary. Civil penalties occupy a strange place in some legal systems - because they are not criminal penalties, the state need not meet a burden of proof that is \\"beyond a reasonable doubt\\"; but because the action is brought by the government, and some civil penalties can run into the millions of dollars, it would be uncomfortable to subject citizens to them by a burden of proof that is merely a \\"preponderance of the evidence.\\" Therefore, the assessment of most civil penalties requires a finding of \\"clear and convincing evidence\\" before a civil defendant will be held liable. A defendant may well raise excuses, justifications, affirmative defenses, and procedural defenses. An administrative law judge or hearing officer may oversee the proceedings and render a judgment. Judgment is made on the balance of probabilities, meaning if it is more than fifty percent likely that the accused is responsible then the accused shall be found guilty. In some cases, a civil penalty may be supplemented by other legal process, including administrative sanctions or even criminal charges, and their respective appeals. For example, failure to pay a fine assessed for a traffic code violation may result in administrative suspension of a driver's license, and further driving after suspension may be a criminal offense. On the other hand, a minimal case may be \\"put on file\\", or otherwise suspended for a period during which the defendant may be required to avoid further violations, or carry out specific duties (such as making repairs or restitution, or attending supplemental education), after which the matter is dismissed. In other cases, such as public safety and consumer protection violations, the local authorities may revoke permits and licenses, and seek injunction to stop or remove non-conforming works or goods, in addition to the civil penalty. Pending or admitted civil violations may also be used as evidence of responsibility in a civil suit. One example is speeding causing in a car accident, resulting in a wrongful death claim. However, the plaintiff may be required to prove causation through a harm encompassed in the regulations.  Civil Penalties in England  The concept of civil penalties in English is in a state of flux. In contract, damages is a remedy to provide monetary compensation for loss; and damages may be unliquidated (general damages), or liquidated (pre-determined). In the absence of an out-of court settlement, unliquidated damages must be ascertained by a court or tribunal, whereas liquidated damages will be determined by reference to the contract or to a mutually agreed arbitrator. The purpose of liquidated damages is to provide certainty and to avoid both the bother and cost of legal proceedings. It is well established that liquidated damages for breach of contract are void if they seek to punish rather than to compensate for loss. For a contractual \\"penalty\\" clause to be valid, one must show that it was drawn up after a bona fide attempt to estimate loss in advance of the breach. For example, a motorway construction contract may have an estimated finish date with a \\"penalty clause\\" for every day late; but provided that this date is realistic and the \\"penalty\\" is a reasonable approximation of loss, the clause will be valid. The validity of the clause will be advanced if there is an equivalent bonus for finishing early. Difficulties can arise with fines for wrongful parking (parking in the wrong area, or overstaying). There are three scenarios: (i) parking on public streets; & parking in a private car park either (ii) with permission, or (iii) without permission. If a parking fine is imposed for type (i), since the powers exercised by the local authority have been delegated by Parliament, there is little that one can do, except to seek judicial review and allege disproportionality. If it is type (ii), such as in a supermarket car-park, then contract rules apply. If, say, the cost was ¬£1 for an hour, and you got a ¬£60 ticket for overstaying a further hour, you can legally send them an extra ¬£1, plus (say) ¬£5 as a contribution to their administration expenses. If they are not satisfied, they would have to issue a county court summons, which might not be cost effective. In type (iii) where one has parked on private land without permission, a typical notice might read: \\"In parking on this land, you hereby accept that your vehicle will be clamped and a ¬£100 release charged\\". Although this may seem a simple matter of trespass with an unavoidable fine, it may amount to a case of implied contract (i.e. \\"if you park here, you agree to pay a penalty\\"); and such a \\"penalty\\" (read \\"damages\\") must be proportionate or else the fine will be void. Also, since the penalty notice could have been attached to the windscreen, the clamping of the vehicle may itself be unlawful trespass. Since the introduction of the Protection of Freedoms Act 2012 (also known as POFA), that wheel clamping is illegal unless by an Authority (e.g. Police, Local Authority or DVLA).

A closely related instrument is the bajo quinto (Spanish: \\"fifth bass\\") which has 10 strings in five double courses. In playing, the left hand holds the strings against frets on a fingerboard, while the right hand plucks or strums the strings. When played in older styles of music where the instrument assumes the role of a bass, the strings are usually plucked with the fingers. In modern chordal and melodic styles, a pick is frequently used. Origins and use The history of the bajo sexto is somewhat unclear. There are few written sources, and until very recently most music dictionaries and encyclopedias did not mention the instrument. A few contemporary researchers have been working from oral sources‚Äîliving players and luthiers‚Äîto tracing the background of the instrument.Avetardo, J. T., ed.; Puro Conjunto: An Album in words and Pictures; Center for Mexican American Studies, The University of Texas; Austin, Texas: 2001. 470p. According to Professor Guillermo Contreras of Mexico's National Music Conservatory, the bajo quinto is probably a descendant of the Italian baroque chitarra battente. In the 17th and 18th centuries, Mexican artisans built several types of instruments with double strings in three, four, five, six, seven and eight courses, influenced by their Spanish ancestors. Descendants of these instruments are bandolon, guitarra s√©ptima, quinta huapanguera, jarana jarocha, concheras, and guitarra chamula, among others. The manufacture of bajo quinto and sexto reached a peak in quality and popularity in the 19th century in central and southern Mexico, in the states of Guerrero, Michoac√°n, Morelos, Puebla, Oaxaca, and Tlaxcala.Bajos de espiga. Diccionario de la M√∫sica Espa√±ola e Hispanoamericana. Sociedad General de Autores y Editores. Madrid (2002). Near the end of the 19th century the bajo sexto began to migrate northwards, where it became a popular instrument for weddings and dances such as the bailes de regalos (popular between 1870 and 1930). In these settings, it was usually played along with a set of small tom- tom drums.Hernandez, Ramon; An Informal History of the Bajo Sexto; in Aventardo, Ch. 12, pp. 127‚Äì130. The 1930s saw the rise of conjunto music and the instruments of choice for this developing style were accordion and bajo sexto. The Texas-Mexican Conjunto At this time the bajo sexto functioned primarily as a bass instrument, providing a strong rhythmic foundation supporting the solo accordion. In the late 1940s, string bass (and later, electric bass) was added to the instruments, and in the 1950s, drums, completing the modern conjunto ensemble. The inclusion of bass and drums freed the bajo sexto from exclusively rhythmic bass duties, and bajo players began experimenting with chords, counter rhythms, and melodic lines. As the popularity of conjunto spread northward, the bajo sexto went with it, and the instrument was taken up by musicians in Northern Mexico and Texas to play other forms of music: norte√±o music of Northern Mexico and across the border in the music of South Texas known as \\"Tejano\\" (or Tex-Mex), \\"conjunto\\", or \\"m√∫sica mexicana-tejana\\". Construction and tuning The fretboard and 10 strings of a bajo quinto The bajo sexto is a member of the guitar family, and physically looks like a 12-string guitar. However, there are important differences: The body is usually a bit deeper; the neck is shorter, joining the body at the 12th fret (modern 12-string guitars usually join at the 14th fret); and (being a bass instrument) the strings are thicker. Older instruments tended to have a larger body; modern instruments are more guitar- like, and the body is typically not more than an inch or so deeper than the guitar. Modern instruments frequently have a cutaway in the upper bout of the body adjacent to the neck, allowing easier access to higher playing positions on the neck, for the left hand. Since the instrument is tuned an octave below the guitar, the body on some instruments is not large enough for the lowest E to resonate well, and many players remove the sixth course, playing on only 10 strings (five courses). Luthiers eventually picked up on this practice and began leaving off the low E course during construction, producing instruments with only five courses ‚Äî bajo quintos. Bajo sextos are traditionally tuned in fourths, what a guitarist would call all fourths tuning. The lower three courses are doubled at the higher octave (similar to the lower four courses on a 12-string guitar), and the upper three courses are doubled at the unison: :::E1-E2 A1-A2 D2-D3 G2-G2 C3-C3 F3-F3 (from lowest to highest course) The bajo quinto derives from the bajo sexto.

Melbourne, The Macquarie Library Pty Ltd. is a town in the Australian state of Victoria. Located north of Melbourne, it is the oldest inland town in Victoria by the combination of age and physical occupation, and because it had unique agricultural attributes to drive that earliest settlement. It grew very rapidly to become four times bigger than its nearest inland rival by 1851. Its spectacular growth continued to match that of the major gold mining towns of Ballarat, Bendigo and Beechworth until at least 1861.Williams, Martin. Charles Bonney and the fertile Kilmore Plains, Victorian Historical Journal, Vol. 90, No. 1, June 2019. History The traditional owners of Kilmore and the Kilmore Plains are the Taungurong people, a part of the Kulin nation that inhabited a large portion of central Victoria including Port Phillip Bay and its surrounds. The Tommy McRae artwork held by the National Gallery of Australia depicts the \\"Kilmore Tribe Holding Corobboree\\",McRae, T., Kilmore tribe holding corobboree, 1890, Artwork, National Gallery of Australia, 1994. and a child pioneer of Kilmore, James Hamilton, describes in detail just such a corroboree at Kilmore in 1845.Hamilton, J. C., Pioneering Days in Western Victoria, Melbourne, Exchange Press, 1923, p.96. Kilmore was discovered for European use by the famous Overlander and explorer of the Port Phillip District (later Victoria) and South Australia Charles Bonney on about 21 March 1837, at which time he also blazed the track of the Sydney Road to Melbourne. His track formed the main highway between the capital cities for 139 years. Kilmore was settled by Bonney on about 17 June 1837 as a sheep station and he built Bonney's Outstation on the townsite itself. Kilmore would have had its first European building within a couple of days of Bonney's arrival.Williams 2019, p. 108. Bonney's sheep station was unique because the Kilmore Plains on which it was established were permanently watered by three spring-fed creeks and were highly fertile. Thus they were suited for both grazing and high population small acreage farming. After Bonney left, the station was held successively by Dr Richard Julian Hamlyn, then the partners Frederick Armand Powlett and John Green.Williams 2019, p. 109-111. The most productive part of the property was purchased by William Rutledge on 12 April 1841 in a Special Survey of 5120 acres and was progressively leased or subdivided into small holdings for intensive agricultureWilliams 2019, p. 113-114. whereupon it became the agricultural powerhouse of inland Victoria.Williams 2019, p. 117. The Kilmore Plains had such a concentration of population that in the first Victorian election of 1851 the district controlled two seats. The United Boroughs of Kilmore, Kyneton and Seymour were dominated by Kilmore township, while the United Counties of Talbot, Dalhousie and Anglesea were dominated by the Rutledge Kilmore Special Survey. As a further demonstration of the importance of the district, the first elected representative of the United Counties was John Pascoe Fawkner, the co-founder of Melbourne.Williams 2019, p. 115. Between 1856 and 1865 the seat of Kilmore was the electorate of the Irish-born John O'Shanassy (1818‚Äì83) who had three stints as Premier of Victoria between 1857 and 1863.Victoria Premiers O'Shanassy, an Irish Catholic, was the bane of the Protestant establishment in Melbourne and the ensuing sectarianism also affected those who lived in Kilmore. O'Shanassy's supporters were referred to as 'O'Rowdies' and O'Shanassy as the 'Rowdy King\\".O'Brien, Antony.

The town hosts a market on the last Saturday of each month, and a Celtic Festival each June. Kilmore Post Office opened on 1 February 1843 and, with Ovens (later Wangaratta) which opened the same day, were the fifth and sixth to open in the Port Phillip District and the first two inland offices. Many of Kilmore's oldest extant buildings are made of bluestone including the hospital, old court house, former post office, some churches, a gaol, and a monument to Hume and Hovell near the golf course. The Kilmore courthouse, 30 June 1933 The Kilmore Magistrates' Court closed on 1 January 1990.  Population  At the 2016 census, Kilmore had a population of 7,958. 80.0% of people were born in Australia. The next most common countries of birth were England 3.2% and China 1.3%. 87.4% of people only spoke English at home. The most common responses for religion were Catholic 33.5%, No Religion 31.0% and Anglican 13.2%.  Public Transport  Kilmore is serviced by a V/Line railway station on the Seymour line. The locality is also serviced by Mitchell Transit - providing a Town Bus route and intra municipal service covering the towns of Wallan, Kilmore, Broadford and Seymour within the Mitchell Shire.

Kilmore on the Sydney Road, Shire of Kilmore, 1988. (comprehensive (1830s‚Äì1980s) history based on interviews and historic documents) Still today, many parts of the track are still in place like the old cobblestone platform of the original railway station. Most of this though has been built over or grown over. Kilmore is served by a railway station at Kilmore East, on the main line. The Post Office at Kilmore East opened on 1 September 1872 as Gavan Duffy and was renamed Kilmore East two months later and closed in 1976.  Media  Though Kilmore is located relatively close to Melbourne, it still retains the \\"Township\\" atmosphere. It is serviced by Melbourne radio and Television, and also offers local media services.

Macdonald to confront Louis Riel and the M√©tis in 1870, during the Red River Resistance, at the Red River Colony in what is now the Canadian province of Manitoba. The expedition was also intended to counter American expansionist sentiments in northern border states. Leaving Toronto in May 1870, the expedition arrived at Fort Garry on August 24, 1870. After a journey of three months in arduous conditions, the Expedition arrived at, and captured, Fort Garry. This extinguished Riel's Provisional Government, and eradicated the threat of the American expansion into western Canada.  Setting the stage  Prior to the outset of the Wolseley Expedition, there had been a series of rebellions by Louis Riel. The M√©tis led by Riel at Red River were dissatisfied with the Canadian government's deal with the Hudson's Bay Company in the land transfer of Rupert's Land. Riel was angry that there was no official communication between the government at Red River Settlement and the Canadian government informing them of a new governor by the name of William McDougall who had arrived and assumed control over the settlement. The first major clash of the Rebellion of 1870 came when government land surveyors arrived at the Red River Settlement on October 11, 1869. A group of M√©tis soldiers obstructed the surveyor's work and forced them from the settlement. Following this clash, Riel was able to evict the local federal government including McDougall, take over Upper Fort Garry and set up a provisional government. Sir John A. Macdonald proposed in 1869 that a force of police officer troops be sent to Manitoba to control the M√©tis in the area. He wished to model this police force after the Irish Constabulary with not only rifleman but also a mounted force. However, this motion was not acted upon, and was later reorganized into the military expedition under Garnet Wolseley. In January and February 1870 Riel led a series of failed negotiations with the federal government and the Hudson's Bay Company. On March 4, 1870 Riel executed Thomas Scott, a loyal supporter of the Canadian government. There are various reasons given for his execution by scholars over the decades including it being an attempt to compel the Canadians into real negotiations, to Riel blatantly disliking Thomas Scott himself. While we may never know the true reason for the execution of Scott, we do know it sparked political and military engagements. History Major General Wolseley Under the leadership of Colonel Garnet Wolseley the expedition set out in May 1870 from Toronto in an attempt to interdict Riel. The U.S. government had refused permission for the troops to cross U.S. soil, and many thought it impossible to move a military force into Western Canada via an all-Canadian route, the Dawson Road having been mapped out only three years earlier and the railway still many years away. The Dawson Road is so named after its original architect, S.J. Dawson. Dawson was given the contract to construct a road large enough for the passage of wagon-laden horses that stretched from the shores of Lake Superior to the navigable waters of the interior. Dawson was given the task of having the road passable by May 1, when the expedition was due to arrive at that stage of the journey. However, due to unfavourable weather in the form of rain, and a series of forest fires prior to the rain fall, the road was not completed on time. Wolseley ordered a work party consisting of soldiers to aid in the road construction. After working from May 25 until mid-way through July, Wolseley cut a path from the road to the Winnipeg River. The only other upset to the plans was the turnabout of Lake of the Woods set before the mouth of the Winnipeg River. Wolseley and his flotilla were lost for several days before finally finding their portage. Wolseley sent Indian paddlers back to the other flotillas to assist in their journey across the lake. The difficulties were overcome, and the force arrived at Winnipeg in August. Sault Ste. Marie commemorating the Wolseley Expedition's portage around the St. Marys Rapids. The expedition travelled to Georgian Bay, then by steamer across Lake Huron to the U.S. Sault Canal where men and materiel had to be transported on the Canadian side of the river. The two steamers which were hired by the Canadian Government were the 'Algoma' and the 'Chicora'. The St. Mary's canal was a canal system which went through the territory of the United States, critical to moving supplies northward. The first steamer, the Algoma, made it through before the Chichora was stopped. American border agents stopped the steamers due to the movement of soldiers and the materials of war, which were viewed as a threat. The U.S. authorities forced Wolseley to unload the Chicora of all soldiers and materials of wars prior to permitting it to pass. Wolseley then arranged the three mile portage of the soldiers and materials upriver on the Canadian side of the river to be loaded back onto the awaiting Algoma. The expedition the proceeded across Lake Superior to the Department of Public Works station at Thunder Bay, which Wolseley named Prince Arthur's Landing on May 25, 1870, in honour of Queen Victoria's third son. From there the troops carried small boats to Lake Shebandowan. On August 3, 1870 the first brigades of canoes started their journey towards Fort Garry, leaving from the shores of Shebandowan. The brigades followed the original Hudson's Bay Company trapping line until they reached Kashaboiwe Lake, when they began to follow a new route which Dawson had found and constructed. Travelling further westwards, they passed through Fort Frances, arriving on August 4. Wolseley made it to Lake of the Woods, however he lost his way. On August 15 he finally made Rat Portage with his flotilla and sent Iroquois guides back to help the remaining brigades cross the river. They proceeded down the Winnipeg River and across the south basin of Lake Winnipeg to the Red River finally arriving at Fort Garry in late August. Wolseley formed up his troops and immediately began his advance on Upper Fort Garry. As first-hand accounts survive of the troops marching on the fort, the southern gate stood thrown open and the fort was abandoned. Fort Garry was officially reported as being taken back into the Canadian government's control as of August 24 with a ceremonial raising of the Union Jack. Louis Riel and his followers abandoned Fort Garry resulting in a bloodless victory for Wolseley. Riel and his followers abandoned the fort with the result it was taken in a \\"bloodless\\" action. The lack of resistance to the Wolseley expedition has been attributed to both the remoteness of the location and the Federal government's efforts to avoid provoking the local inhabitants into further rebellion. An eyewitness account of the expedition's arrival at Upper Fort Garry provided by a member of the expedition, William Perrin, appeared in the Manitoba Free Press in August 1900 on the 30th anniversary of the arrival. Perrin was a regular British soldier of the 60th Rifles (The King's Royal Rifle Corps). The expedition is considered by military historians to have been among the most arduous in history. Over 1000 men had to transport all their provisions and weaponry, including cannon, over hundreds of miles of wilderness. At numerous portages, corduroy roads had to be constructed. As these jobs were being done the troops had to endure life in the bush for over two months, in summer heat and the inevitable plagues of blackflies and mosquitoes. Imperial and Canadian military forces in the Red River Rebellion Imperial military forces: *60th Regiment: a regiment from the British Army, was overseen by Colonel R.J. Feilden. Colonel Feilden was second in command of the entire expedition and oversaw 26 officers and 350 men. These forces were known as the 'Regulars' and were provided by the British Army. *Detachment of Royal Artillery: overseen by Lieutenant Alleyne was also a part of the expedition. The detachment included 19 soldiers with a battery of four 7-pounder brass mountain guns. *Detachment of Royal Engineers: also accompanied the expedition. These 19 engineers were overseen by Lieutenant Hencage. This detachment was mainly concerned with the building of the Dawson Road in preparation for the main expeditionary force. *Detachment of Army Service Corps *Detachment of Army Hospital Corps Canadian Militia: *1st Ontario Rifles: a battalion of volunteer soldiers from Ontario. The militia of Ontario is reported to have been keen on marching on the Red River Colony due to the death of Thomas Scott who hailed from the province. Lieutenant-Colonel Jarvis oversaw this force of 28 officers and 350 soldiers, all of which were volunteers. *1st Quebec Rifles: a battalion from Quebec. Reports from the time state that there was very little interest among the people of Quebec for the expedition. Upon the first wave of recruits, only 88 out 350 soldiers in the battalion were French speaking. The remaining were to be filled by English speakers. This battalion was overseen by Lieutenant-Colonel Casault along with his staff of 28 officers. Transportation personnel: The expeditionary forces would not move anywhere all too fast without the company of voyageurs and teamsters to provide their transportation. Over 400 Aboriginal voyageurs were hired to handle the canoes. Reports from the expedition comment on the 100 Iroquois voyageurs from the Montreal area as being the most reliable and best equipped to handle rapid moving water. Along with the use of boat to transport men and equipment, 150 horses and 100 teamsters; men who handle horses and wagons were hired. These men were primarily meant to transport material and men from Thunder Bay to Shebandowen Lake along the Dawson Road. The North-West Mounted Police, established three years later in 1873, did not take part in the expedition. Legacy Following the successful completion of the expedition, Wolseley penned a tribute to his men in recognition of their extraordinary efforts. The expedition's inability to sail through the Soo Locks on the Michigan (US) side of the river led to a federal government effort to build a water passageway on the Ontario side. This resulted in construction of the Sault Ste. Marie Canal, completed in 1895. That canal is now used for recreational boating as part of the national park system, and is a National Historic Site managed by Parks Canada. The Red River Expedition of 1870 was named a National Historic Event on January 12, 2018. The street adjacent to the site of Wolseley's landing in the City of Thunder Bay is named Wolseley Street.

The program focused on how technologies affect and are used in modern society. It is History's first, and longest-running program, having first aired on History's first day of broadcasting on January 1, 1995, and its last episode aired on April 11, 2015. Modern Marvels has produced over 650 one-hour episodes covering various topics involving (to list a few) science, technology, electronics, mechanics, engineering, architecture, industry, mass production, manufacturing, and agriculture. Each episode typically discusses the history and production of several related items; for instance, an episode on distilled spirits discusses the production of bourbon in Kentucky, scotch whisky in Scotland, and tequila in Mexico. To fit the network's format, Modern Marvels focuses a significant portion of the episode on the history of the subject. The show began to premiere new episodes in January 2010, not having done so through all of 2009.Modern Marvels Episode Guide. History.com. In August 2010, History Channel began to air older episodes that had been edited to fit a 30-minute time slot, under the title Modern Marvels: Essentials. In October 2011, Modern Marvels began airing first-run episodes on History 2 (formerly History International) in addition to its main run on History Channel. Reruns of the series currently air on the digital broadcast network Quest. Engineering Disasters Occasionally, Modern Marvels aired a special spin-off called Engineering Disasters. These periodic episodes describe the circumstances of situations in which technology does not work correctly, such as building collapses and airplane crashes, resulting in spectacular (and sometimes fatal) failures. Including an episode on New Orleans and another on the 1970s, 24 original Engineering Disasters episodes have been on Modern Marvels. The packaging on the box set of Engineering Disasters 4-20 plus New Orleans describes the series as such: \\"Dark clouds with silver linings, Modern Marvels: Engineering Disasters presents the tragic, yet invaluable, handmaidens of technological progress.\\"Modern Marvels: Engineering Disasters - (5 DVD set, back panel) A former title screenshot of Modern Marvels Introduction Distinct from other History Channel series, the introduction of Modern Marvels features visuals and sounds of a bolt being turned by a ratchet wrench, followed by a partially computer-generated sequence involving construction workers building and hanging the title. Narration Several narrators were used in the history of the series. The last and longest-running is Max Raphael, who has also narrated other History Channel series, such as Command Decisions. The History Channel has repackaged some episodes that originally aired in other series and stand- alone specials into episodes of Modern Marvels, such as Ice Road Truckers, which originally aired in 2000 as part of the series Suicide Missions.

As the muse of hat designer Philip Treacy, she is credited with discovering the models Stella Tennant and Sophie Dahl as well as propelling and continually advocating the career of fashion designer Alexander McQueen, beginning when she bought the entirety of his explosive premier show inspired by Jack the Ripper. She committed suicide using the herbicide paraquat in 2007. Early life Born Isabella Delves Broughton in Marylebone, London, she was the eldest child of Major Sir Evelyn Delves Broughton, a military officer, and his second wife, Helen Mary Shore, a barrister. Sir Evelyn was the only son of Jock Delves Broughton; his sister, Rosamond, married Simon Fraser, 15th Lord Lovat in 1938. Blow had two sisters, Julia and Lavinia; her brother, John, drowned in the family's swimming pool at the age of 2. This had a profound effect on her. In 1972, when she was 14, her parents separated and her mother left the household, bidding each daughter farewell with a handshake. Her parents divorced two years later. Isabella did not get along with her father, who bequeathed her only ¬£5,000 from his estate, which was worth more than one million pounds. Blow studied for her A-levels at Heathfield School, after which she enrolled at a secretarial college and then took odd jobs. As she told Tamsin Blanchard of The Observer in 2002: > I've done the most peculiar jobs. I was working in a scone shop for years, > selling apricot-studded scones. I was a cleaner in London for two years. I > wore a handkerchief with knots on the side, and my cousin saw me in the post > office and said, What are you doing? I said, What do you think I look like > I'm doing? I'm a cleaner! Career Blow moved to New York City in 1979 to study Ancient Chinese Art at Columbia University and shared a flat with the actress Catherine Oxenberg. A year later, she left the Art History programme at Columbia, moved to Texas, and worked for Guy Laroche. In 1981 she married her first husband, Nicholas Taylor (whom she divorced in 1983), and was introduced to the fashion director of the US edition of Vogue, Anna Wintour. Blow was hired initially as Wintour's assistant, but it was not long before she was assisting Andr√© Leon Talley, as of 2008 US Vogues editor-at-large. While working in New York, she befriended Andy Warhol and Jean-Michel Basquiat. She returned to London in 1986 and worked for Michael Roberts, then the fashion director of Tatler and The Sunday Times Style magazine. During this period she was romantically linked to editor Tim Willis. In 1989, Blow married her second husband, barrister and art dealer Detmar Hamilton Blow,Oxford Dictionary of National Biography 2005-2008, ed. Lawrence Goldman, Oxford University Press, pg 113 a grandson (and namesake) of the early 20th-century society architect Detmar Blow, in Gloucester Cathedral. Philip Treacy designed the bride's wedding headdress and a now-famous fashion relationship was forged. Realizing Treacy's talent, Blow established Treacy in her London flat, where he worked on his collections. She soon began wearing Treacy's hats, making them a signature part of her flamboyant style. In a 2002 interview with Tamsin Blanchard, Blow declared that she wore extravagant hats for a practical reason: > [...] to keep everyone away from me. They say, Oh, can I kiss you? I say, > No, thank you very much. That's why I've worn the hat. Goodbye. I don't want > to be kissed by all and sundry. I want to be kissed by the people I love. In 1993 she worked with the photographer Steven Meisel producing the Babes in London shoot, which featured Plum Sykes, Bella Freud and Honor Fraser. Blow had a natural sense of style and a good feeling for future fashion directions. She discovered Alexander McQueen and purchased his entire graduate collection for ¬£5,000, paying it off in weekly ¬£100 installments. Spotting Sophie Dahl, Blow described her as \\"a blow up doll with brains\\", and launched the model's career. Blow supported both the fashion world and the art world. Artists Tim Noble and Sue Webster created a shadow portrait of her which was displayed in the National Portrait Gallery. Blow was the fashion director of Tatler and consulted for DuPont Lycra, Lacoste, and Swarovski. She became the subject of an exhibition in 2002 entitled When Philip met Isabella, which featured sketches and photographs of her wearing Treacy's hat designs. In 2004 she had a brief acting cameo playing a character called Antonia Cook in the film The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou. Blow starred in 2005 in a project by artist Matthieu Laurette, commissioned and produced by Frieze Projects 2005 and entitled \\"What Do They Wear at Frieze Art Fair?\\" It consisted of daily guided tours of Frieze Art Fair led by Blow and fellow international fashion experts Peter Saville, Kira Joliffe, and Bay Garnett. Shortly before her death, Blow was the creative director and stylist of a series of books for an Arabic beauty magazine, Alef; the books were being produced by Kuwaiti fashion entrepreneur Sheikh Majed al-Sabah. Illness Toward the end of her life, Blow became seriously depressed and was reportedly anguished over her inability to \\"find a home in a world she influenced\\". Daphne Guinness, a friend of Blow's, stated: \\"She was upset that Alexander McQueen didn't take her along when he sold his brand to Gucci. Once the deals started happening, she fell by the wayside. Everybody else got contracts, and she got a free dress\\". According to a 2002 interview with Tamsin Blanchard, it was Blow who brokered the deal in which Gucci purchased McQueen's label. Other pressures on her included financial problems (Blow was disinherited by her father in 1994) and infertility. Isabella and Detmar Blow separated in 2004. Detmar Blow went on to have an affair with Stephanie Theobald, the society editor of British Harper's Bazaar, while his estranged wife entered into a liaison with a gondolier she met in Venice. During the couple's separation, Blow was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and began undergoing electroshock therapy. For a time, the treatments appeared to be helpful. During this period she also had an affair with Matthew Mellon; however, after an eighteen-month separation, Isabella and Detmar Blow were reconciled. Soon afterward, she was diagnosed with ovarian cancer. Depressed over her waning celebrity status and her cancer diagnosis, Blow began telling friends that she was suicidal. In 2006, Blow attempted suicide with an overdose of sleeping pills. Later that year, Blow again attempted suicide by jumping from the Hammersmith Flyover, which resulted in her breaking both ankles. Blow made several more suicide attempts in 2007, by driving her car into the rear of a lorry, attempting to obtain horse tranquilizers, trying to drown herself in a lake and by overdosing while on a beach in India. Death On 6 May 2007, during a weekend house party at Hilles, where the guests included Treacy and his partner, Stefan Bartlett, Blow announced that she was going shopping. Instead, she was later discovered collapsed on a bathroom floor by her sister Lavinia and was taken to Gloucestershire Royal Hospital, where Blow told the doctor she had drunk the weedkiller Paraquat. She died at the hospital the following day. Blow's death was initially reported as being caused by ovarian cancer; however, a coroner later ruled the death a suicide. At the inquest, Blow's sister, Lavinia Verney, stated that after she discovered her sister had ingested the poison, Blow had told her, \\"I'm worried that I haven't taken enough.\\" Her funeral was held at Gloucester Cathedral on 15 May 2007. Her casket, made of willow, was surmounted by one of her Philip Treacy hats as well as a floral tribute, and her pallbearers included her godson Otis Ferry, a son of the rock star Bryan Ferry. (In 2010, Bryan Ferry dedicated his Olympia album in memoriam Isabella Blow and David Williams.) Actor Rupert Everett and actress Joan Collins delivered eulogies. Opera singer Charles Eliasch sang. A memorial service was held in the Guards Chapel in London on 18 September 2007, where Anna Wintour and Geordie Greig spoke. Prince Michael and Princess Michael of Kent were in attendance. Wintour's eulogy and part of the memorial service can be seen in DVD disc two of The September Issue.

It originates in the Apennines at Trevi nel Lazio and flows westward past Subiaco, Vicovaro, and Tivoli to join the Tiber in northern Rome. It formed the principal valley east of ancient Rome and became an important water source as the city's population expanded. The falls at Tivoli were noted for their beauty. Historic bridges across the river include the Ponte Nomentano, Ponte Mammolo, Ponte Salario, and Ponte di San Francesco, all of which were originally fortified with towers. History The confluence of the Aniene and Tiber was controlled by Antemnae, a Latin settlement on a hill just to its south.

The Aqua Anio Novus (\\"New Anio aqueduct\\") was begun under Caligula around 38 and completed under Claudius in 48. A third aqueduct, the Aqua Marcia, was constructed by Q. Marcius Rex between 144 and 140 using the proceeds from the destructions of Corinth and Carthage in 146 . The emperor Nero created three lakes on the river for his villa at Subiaco. The largest of these dams was the highest dam in classical antiquity and remained in use until its destruction by a flood in 1305. Trajan eventually connected the Anio Novus to two of these lakes.

That heading usually consists of a name and an address, and a logo or corporate design, and sometimes a background pattern. The term \\"letterhead\\" is often used to refer to the whole sheet imprinted with such a heading. Overview Many companies and individuals prefer to create a letterhead template in a word processor or other software application. This generally includes the same information as pre-printed stationery, but at lower cost. Letterhead can then be printed on stationery (or plain paper) as needed on a local output device or sent electronically. Letterheads are generally printed by either the offset or letterpress methods. In most countries outside North America, company letterheads are printed A4 in size (210 mm x 297 mm). In North America, the letter size is typically 8.5 x 11 inches (215 x 280 mm). Although modern technology makes letterheads very easy to imitate, they continue to be used as evidence of authenticity.Evidence and the Advocate: A Contextual Approach to Learning Evidence, Christopher W.

He took his AB at Calvin College (1959) and an MA at Fordham University (1961). He completed his doctoral studies in 1965, also at Fordham and briefly did post-graduate studies at Yale University. Kreeft joined the philosophy faculty of the Department of Philosophy of Boston College in 1965.\\"Peter John Kreeft\\", Boston College He has debated several academics in issues related to God's existence. Shortly after he began teaching at Boston College he was challenged to a debate on the existence of God between himself and Paul Breines, an atheist and history professor, which was attended by a majority of undergraduate students. Kreeft later used many of the arguments in this debate to create the Handbook of Christian Apologetics with then undergraduate student Ronald K. Tacelli. In 1971, Kreeft published an article titled \\"Zen In Heidegger's 'Gelassenheit'\\" in the peer-reviewed journal International Philosophical Quarterly, of Fordham University. In 1994, he was an endorser of the document \\"Evangelicals and Catholics Together\\". He also formulated, with R. Tacelli, \\"Twenty Arguments for the Existence of God\\".http://www.apologetics.com/default.jsp?bodycontent=/articles/theistic_apologetics/kreeft- arguments.html Conversion story Kreeft converted to Catholicism during his college years. A key turning point was when he was asked by a Calvinist professor to investigate the claims of the Catholic Church that it traced itself to the early Church. He said that, on his own, he \\"discovered in the early Church such Catholic elements as the centrality of the Eucharist, the Real Presence, prayers to saints, devotion to Mary, an insistence on visible unity, and apostolic succession.\\" The \\"central and deciding\\" factor for his conversion was \\"the Church's claim to be the one Church historically founded by Christ.\\" He reportedly applied C. S. Lewis's trilemma (either Jesus is Lunatic, Liar, or Lord): \\"I thought, just as Jesus made a claim about His identity that forces us into one of only two camps ... so the Catholic Church‚Äôs claim to be the one true Church, the Church Christ founded, forces us to say either that this is the most arrogant, blasphemous and wicked claim imaginable, if it is not true, or else that she is just what she claims to be.\\" According to Kreeft's personal account, his conversion to Catholicism was influenced by, among other things, Gothic architecture and Thomistic philosophy, the writings of St. John of the Cross, the logic of asking saints to pray for us, and a visit to St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York City when he was twelve years old, \\"feeling like I was in heaven ... and wondering why, if Catholics got everything else wrong, as I had been taught, they got beauty so right...\\"\\"Peter Kreeft\\", Ignatius Insight Bibliography Books = * *Between Heaven and Hell (1982) ‚Äî A Dialog with John F.

In October 2001, the CPR decided to spin off the remaining businesses it had not recently sold off, thus creating separate companies for each, including Canadian Pacific Railway Limited. History The Canadian Pacific Railway Company was incorporated on February 16, 1881, to build a railway linking British Columbia with Ontario and Quebec. On July 5, 1971, the Canadian Pacific Railway Company was renamed Canadian Pacific Limited, reflecting the fact that for years it had been a diversified company. On July 4, 1996, as part of a corporate reorganization, the Canadian Pacific Railway Company became a subsidiary of a new company that assumed the Canadian Pacific Limited name. Canadian Pacific Limited's non-railway operations also became subsidiaries of the new Canadian Pacific Limited, leaving the Canadian Pacific Railway Company with the railway operations. In 2001, the five remaining subsidiaries of Canadian Pacific Limited were spun off into separate companies. CP Hotels The CPR built hotels along its railway routes across Canada. The first hotels were originally built in 1886 primarily to provide meal service for passengers in the Rocky Mountains where railway grades were too severe to justify the operation of Dining Cars. CPR's hotel network later expanded to include the Ch√¢teau Frontenac in Quebec City, Quebec, Chateau Lake Louise on Lake Louise in Alberta, the Banff Springs Hotel in Banff, Alberta, The Empress in Victoria, British Columbia, the Royal York in Toronto, Ontario, and The Algonquin in St. Andrews, New Brunswick among others. In 2001, CPR acquired US hotelier Fairmont (est. 1907) and merged it with CP Hotels to form Fairmont Hotels and Resorts. In some of the former CP Hotels, CP retained stores selling CPR-related items under the banner \\"CP Store\\". Stock Code: None - privately held company Headquarters: Toronto, Ontario Railway The flagship division of Canadian Pacific, the Canadian Pacific Railway began as a private tender to build a railway line connecting eastern Canada to the Pacific. Formed by a group of businessmen, the company was formally established in May 1881 under President George Stephen. The CPR was completed under the leadership of American William Cornelius Van Horne. Stock Code: CP (NYSE and TSX) Headquarters: Calgary, Alberta, Canada Telecommunications Along with railways, CPR also established telegraph operations to allow communications to remote areas. Established as CPR Telegraph Company in 1894, it later became CNCP Telecommunications in 1967 (co-owned with rival Canadian National Railway) and as Unitel Communications Incorporated 1990. Prior to the name change to Unitel, Rogers Communications acquired a stake in 1984 and later sold to AT&T; Canada in 1984. Unitel disappeared into AT&T; in 1993 and Rogers sold the rest by 1995. AT&T; Canada was later sold off by parent AT&T; into an independent company, MTS Allstream. Stock Code: MBT (TSX) Headquarters: Winnipeg, Manitoba Telegraph operations within CNCP under AT&T; Canada ended in 1999 and sold to Montreal-based T√©l√©grame Plus, which in 2002 became iTelegram's Canadian unit Telegrams Canada with head office in Toronto. Trucking Along with trains, CP also operated trucking operations as part of its land shipping operations. Acquiring Dominion Express Company in 1882, it later became Canadian Pacific Express Company in 1926. It operated independently from the Railway with charges being assessed between companies for work done. It later became CP Express and Transport in a merger of trucking operations including Smith Transport, with extensive highway routes throughout Canada and into the United States. Changes brought on by deregulation caused great difficulties for all major trucking companies in Canada and eventually employees bought out CP in 1994 to form Interlink Freight Systems, however, competition from non-union companies and owner- operators was relentless, this and other difficulties on the US side finally brought about its demise. Operations ceased in July 1997. More recently, CP Ships trucking has been known as \\"C Truck\\". It is unclear what the future of C Truck will be now that Hapag Lloyd owns CP Ships. Airline CP purchased ten \\"bush plane\\" companies in the early 1940s and merged them to establish Canadian Pacific Air Lines in 1942 to service western Canada and the Far East routes. The airline provided passenger and parcel service to remote areas in Canada. The name was changed in June 1968 to CP Air, then sold in 1987 to Canadian Airlines International, flying as Canadian. The airline was taken over by Air Canada in the summer of 2000. Stock Code: AC.A or AC.B (TSX) Headquarters: Montreal, Quebec Energy and mining In 1883, a CPR crew accidentally discovered natural gas near Medicine Hat, Alberta. In 1912, the CPR set up its Department of Natural Resources in Calgary to manage its timber, oil, gas, and mineral rights as well as land sales and immigration and colonization activities. In 1958, CP created Canadian Pacific Oil and Gas Company (CPOG) to manage its oil, gas, and mineral rights. CPOG was merged with Central-Del Rio Oils to form PanCanadian Energy in 1971, to expand CP portfolio into energy exploration. PanCanadian was spun off by CP in 2002 and later merged with Alberta Energy Corporation to form EnCana. Fording Coal, a coal mining company formed by CP was also spun off in 2002 and now operates under Fording Coal-Canadian Coal Trust. Stock Code: FDG.UN (TSX) and FDG (NYSE) - no longer trades as Fording Coal ceased operations in 2008 and now royal trust under Vancouver, BC-based Teck Resources Headquarters: Calgary, Alberta Land Canadian Pacific Investments was created in 1962 to expand CP from core transportation business, but since 2001, CP now is focused on fewer businesses. CPI became Canadian Pacific Enterprises Limited in 1980 and disappeared within CP Limited in 1985. Ships Empress steamship poster from 1920. CP Ships began with steam freighters on the Great Lakes in 1883 and chartered ships in the Pacific in 1886, but CP Ships did not begin until April 28, 1891, when the first of its Empress ships started Trans-Pacific operations. It started Trans-Atlantic operations in 1903. With the diminishing role of ships as airlines took over transcontinental travel, CP Ships focused its operations to shipping goods. CP Ships began container shipping in 1964, with ships able to carry 12 containers. In 1984 CP co-founded the container shipping company Canada Maritime. They acquired the company fully in 1993. CP Ships' growth strategy was to acquire different shipping lines and integrate them into a company composed of many small sectors. Until the end of their history right before they were bought by Hapag Lloyd, almost all the acquisitions were retained as separate brands. CAST (Canadian Atlantic Sea Transport) was acquired in 1995. Contship Containerlines and the American company Lykes Lines were acquired in 1997. 1998 saw the acquisition of Ivaran (which was not retained as a separate TMM containers on a double stack train car, 2008 brand) and Australia New Zealand Direct Line. TMM (Transportacion Maritima Mexicana), also known as Linea Mexicana, and CCAL (which was not retained as a separate brand) were bought in 2000. In 2002 CP Ships acquired Italia Line, which used to be owned by the government's Finmare Group and was owned by D'amico at the time of purchase. CP Ships was spun off as a separate entity from CP in 2001, and acquired by Hapag-Lloyd in 2005. Hapag Lloyd parent TUI intends to integrate CP Ships into Hapag Lloyd to form a super shipping group. At the time of acquisition they also owned Montreal Gateway Terminals. In July 2006 the CP Ships name disappeared into a single container shipper Hapag-Lloyd AG.

Breen and Walter Reisch. The film stars Marilyn Monroe, Joseph Cotten, Jean Peters and Max Showalter. It was one of 20th Century Fox's biggest box office hits of the year. Unlike other film noirs of the time that were filmed in black and white, Niagara was filmed in \\"three-strip\\" Technicolor (one of the last films to be made at Fox in that format, as a few months later Fox began converting to CinemaScope, which had compatibility problems with \\"three-strip\\" but not with Eastmancolor). Monroe was given first billing in Niagara, which elevated her to star status. Her following two films of that year, Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, with Jane Russell, and How to Marry a Millionaire, with Betty Grable and Lauren Bacall, were even bigger successes. Plot Ray and Polly Cutler (Showalter and Peters), on a delayed honeymoon at Niagara Falls, find their reserved cabin occupied by George and Rose Loomis (Cotten and Monroe). Rose tells them that George is asleep and has recently been discharged from an Army mental hospital after his war service in Korea. The Cutlers politely but reluctantly accept another, less desirable cabin, and so the two couples become acquainted. Polly (Peters) and George (Cotten) Rose (Monroe) George and Rose have a very troubled and volatile marriage. She is younger and very attractive. He is jealous, depressed and irritable. While touring the Falls the following day, Polly sees Rose passionately kissing another man, her lover Patrick (Richard Allan). That evening, the Cutlers witness George's rage. Rose joins an impromptu party and requests that a particular record be played. George storms out of their cabin and breaks the record, suspecting the song has a secret meaning for Rose. Seeing that George has cut his hand with the record, Polly visits his room to apply mercurochrome and bandages. George confides that he was a sheep rancher whose luck turned for the worse after he married Rose, whom he met when she was a barmaid. What George does not know is that Rose and Patrick are planning to murder him at one of the Niagara Falls tourist sites. The next day, Rose lures George into following her to the dark tourist tunnel underneath the Falls, where Patrick is waiting to kill him. To let Rose know that George is dead, Patrick will request the Rainbow Tower Carillon play Rose's special song \\"Kiss\\", both uncredited). When she hears the tune being played on the carillon bells, Rose concludes George is dead. In fact, it is George who has killed Patrick, thrown his body into the Falls, and collected Patrick's shoes at the exit instead of his own. This leads the police to believe that George is the victim. The body is retrieved and the police bring Rose to identify George's body. When the cover is lifted from the face and she recognizes the dead man, she collapses before saying anything and is admitted to the hospital. The motel manager moves the Cutlers' belongings to the Loomises' cabin. George comes to the cabin looking for Rose but finds Polly sleeping there instead. She wakes and sees him before he runs away. She tells the police, who launch a dragnet. During the Cutlers' second visit to the Falls, George finds Polly alone for a moment. Trying to escape, she slips, but he saves her from falling over the edge into the waterfall torrent. He explains to her that he killed Patrick in self-defense and begs her to \\"let me stay dead\\". Polly leaves without answering. Later that day, she tells the police detective that she believes George is alive. George has the carillon play \\"Kiss\\" again to panic Rose, who flees the hospital, intending to cross the border back to the U.S. Finding George waiting at the border for her, she runs and tries to hide in the carillon bell tower. George catches her and strangles her beneath the bells, which remain silent. Remorsefully he says, \\"I loved you, Rose. You know that.\\" The Cutlers go fishing with friends (Don Wilson and Lurene Tuttle) in a launch on a section of the Niagara River above the Falls. When the boat moors in Chippawa for gasoline and other supplies, George steals it with Polly on board. She tells him to give himself up as it was self-defense, but he tells her he can't because he's killed Rose. The police set out in pursuit. The boat runs out of gas and drifts towards the Falls. As they near the edge, George scuttles the boat to slow it down and manages to get Polly onto a large rock before he goes over the Falls to his death. Polly is rescued from the rock by a helicopter.

Reisch says, \\"Anybody hearing the name Niagara thinks of honeymoon couples and of some sentimental story of a girl walking out on her husband on their wedding night and their getting together again. It would be foolish to start up with Sonja Henie tricks here or Esther Williams-type swimming extravaganzas. I would like to make it a mystery story, with a real murder in it.\\" Reisch says he came up with the story but he wrote the script with Richard Breen and Brackett. Head of Fox Daryl F Zanuck wanted to put Marilyn Monroe into the film. According to Reisch, \\"we thought that was a nice idea, until there came a second telephone call that he wanted her to be the villainess, not the girl... My God! Here was the prettiest girl in the whole United States of America! But he insisted it was a great idea, so we finally did it. We didn't know whether she would like it, but she had no objection, whatsoever‚Äîon the contrary.\\" Peters replaced Anne Baxter in the role of Polly. Shooting of Niagara took place in the summer of 1952. Peters' character was initially the leading role, but the film eventually became a vehicle for Monroe, who was by that time more successful. Reisch says there are \\"major sequences missing\\" from the final film. \\"After he'd seen it, Zanuck simply couldn't accept the fact that the police at Niagara Falls were of Canadian extraction. We had British actors playing Canadian police commissioners and detectives and various cops, and he just abhorred it. He wouldn't let us go back to the stages to finish it or to repair it‚Äîno, he just took it out! The American audience, he said, does not know, does not understand, that the Niagara Falls are bisected by the border . . . and we should have used Americans. And [director Henry] Hathaway, who didn't like the idea either, sided with him. So there are big holes in the story.\\" By sheer accident, the film holds the record for the longest filmed walk in the history of cinema. \\"Kiss\\" was composed by Lionel Newman, with lyrics by Haven Gillespie; both are uncredited. ReceptionCritical response= When the film was released, The New York Times praised the film, if not the acting. They wrote in January 1953, \\"Obviously ignoring the idea that there are Seven Wonders of the World, Twentieth Century-Fox has discovered two more and enhanced them with Technicolor in Niagara... For the producers are making full use of both the grandeur of the Falls and its adjacent areas as well as the grandeur that is Marilyn Monroe... Perhaps Miss Monroe is not the perfect actress at this point. But neither the director nor the gentlemen who handled the cameras appeared to be concerned with this. They have caught every possible curve both in the intimacy of the boudoir and in equally revealing tight dresses. And they have illustrated pretty concretely that she can be seductive - even when she walks. As has been noted, Niagara may not be the place to visit under these circumstances but the falls and Miss Monroe are something to see.\\"The New York Times. \\"Niagara Falls Vies With Marilyn Monroe,\\" film review, January 22, 1953. Last accessed: December 27, 2007. Opening title Also in 1953, the staff at Variety wrote, \\"Niagara is a morbid, clich√©d expedition into lust and murder. The atmosphere throughout is strained and taxes the nerves with a feeling of impending disaster. Focal point of all this is Marilyn Monroe, who's vacationing at the Falls with hubby Joseph Cotten...The camera lingers on Monroe's sensuous lips, roves over her slip-clad figure and accurately etches the outlines of her derri√®re as she weaves down a street to a rendezvous with her lover. As a contrast to the beauty of the female form is another kind of nature's beauty ‚Äî that of the Falls. The natural phenomena have been magnificently photographed on location.\\"Variety. Film review, 1953. Last accessed: February 2, 2008. More recent critics have also praised the film. In 2001, Robert Weston wrote, \\"Niagara is a good movie for noir fans who crave something a little different. Be warned, the film was shot in glorious Technicolor, not black and white, but still boasts an ample share of shadows and style...Undoubtedly, the best reason to see Niagara is just as trailer promised: for the scenery. There's some terrific location work that showcases the breathtaking aspects of the Falls before the city evolved into a tawdry Canadian answer to Atlantic City; and of course, there's a gal named Marilyn Monroe, burgeoning at her humble beginnings.\\"Weston, Robert. Film Monthly, film review and analysis, August 24, 2001. Last accessed: June 27, 2010. Based on 12 reviews, Niagara is rated at 83% at review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes. Noir themes A major theme is that of sex and its destructiveness.Silver, Alain & Elizabeth Ward, Film Noir (1979). The Overlook Press: Woodstock, New York. Rose is a femme fatale, seductively dressed in tight clothes revealing her sensual figure. Her relationship (combining the sexual, hypocritical, and scornful) with George is contrasted with the more normal relationship of the Cutlers, which also has sexual elements hinted at by the film. Ray Cutler does not fail to notice the sexual charms of Rose, but the reaction of both Ray and Polly to their interactions with George and Rose demonstrate the conventionality of their attitudes.Riese, Randall, The Unabridged Marilyn: Her Life from A to Z (1990). Bonanza Books: Modesto, California. Legacy The famous walk by Monroe's character, Rose, in a black skirt and red sweater across the cobblestone street, holds the record for the longest walk in cinema history with around 116 feet of film. In the weeks after Monroe's death in August 1962, Andy Warhol used a publicity photo from Niagara as the basis for his silkscreen painting Marilyn Diptych, showing multiple images of Monroe's face.

FC Porto won their second European trophy in two years, beating Partizan Belgrade, Marseille, Manchester United, Lyon, Deportivo La Coru√±a and AS Monaco on their way. The only team Porto faced and failed to beat was Real Madrid in the group stage. =UEFA Cup= The Portuguese participants in this edition of the UEFA Cup were: Benfica, Sporting and Uni√£o de Leiria. Benfica entered the first round of the UEFA Cup. They were the most successful Portuguese team in the competition, reaching the fourth round, where they lost to an Italian team, Inter Milan. Prior to this, they beat La Louvi√®re, Molde and Rosenborg. Sporting beat Malm√∂ in the first round, but were surprised in the following round by Turkish team Gen√ßlerbirligi, who beat Sporting in their own stadium by 3-0.

Initial, large-scale trials of the NTDR network, February 1998. The Near-term digital radio (NTDR) program provided a prototype mobile ad hoc network (MANET) radio system to the United States Army, starting in the 1990s. The MANET protocols were provided by Bolt, Beranek and Newman; the radio hardware was supplied by ITT.L. Williams, L. Emory, \\"Near Term Digital Radio - a first look\\", Proceedings of the 1996 Tactical Communications Conference. Ensuring Joint Force Superiority in the Information Age, 30 April-2 May 1996. These systems have been fielded by the United Kingdom as the High-capacity data radio (HCDR) and by the Israelis as the Israeli data radio. They have also been purchased by a number of other countries for experimentation. The NTDR protocols consist of two components: clustering and routing. The clustering algorithms dynamically organize a given network into cluster heads and cluster members. The cluster heads create a backbone; the cluster members use the services of this backbone to send and receive packets. The cluster heads use a link-state routing algorithm to maintain the integrity of their backbone and to track the locations of cluster members. The NTDR routers also use a variant of Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) that is called Radio-OSPF (ROSPF). ROSPF does not use the OSPF hello protocol for link discovery, etc. Instead, OSPF adjacencies are created and destroyed as a function of MANET information that is distributed by the NTDR routers, both cluster heads and cluster members. It also supported multicasting.B. Welsh, N. Rehn, B. Vincent, J. Weinstein, and S.

Species richness is simply a count of species, and it does not take into account the abundances of the species or their relative abundance distributions. Species richness is sometime considered synonymous with species diversity, but the formal metric species diversity takes into account both species richness and species evenness. Sampling considerations Depending on the purposes of quantifying species richness, the individuals can be selected in different ways. They can be, for example, trees found in an inventory plot, birds observed from a monitoring point, or beetles collected in a pitfall trap. Once the set of individuals has been defined, its species richness can be exactly quantified, provided the species- level taxonomy of the organisms of interest is well enough known. Applying different species delimitations will lead to different species richness values for the same set of individuals. In practice, people are usually interested in the species richness of areas so large that not all individuals in them can be observed and identified to species. Then applying different sampling methods will lead to different sets of individuals being observed for the same area of interest, and the species richness of each set may be different. When a new individual is added to a set, it may introduce a species that was not yet represented in the set, and thereby increase the species richness of the set. For this reason, sets with many individuals can be expected to contain more species than sets with fewer individuals. If species richness of the obtained sample is taken to represent species richness of the underlying habitat or other larger unit, values are only comparable if sampling efforts are standardised in an appropriate way. Resampling methods can be used to bring samples of different sizes to a common footing.Colwell, R. K. and Coddington, J. A. (1994) Estimating terrestrial biodiversity through extrapolation. Philosophical Transactions: Biological Sciences, 345, 101‚Äì118. Properties of the sample, especially the number of species only represented by one or a few individuals, can be used to help estimating the species richness in the population from which the sample was drawn.Chao, A. (1984) Non-parametric estimation of the number of classes in a population. Scandinavian Journal of Statistics, 11, 265‚Äì270.Chao, A. (2005) Species richness estimation. Pages 7909‚Äì7916 in N. Balakrishnan, C. B. Read, and B. Vidakovic, eds. Encyclopedia of Statistical Sciences. New York, Wiley. Trends in species richness The observed species richness is affected not only by the number of individuals but also by the heterogeneity of the sample. If individuals are drawn from different environmental conditions (or different habitats), the species richness of the resulting set can be expected to be higher than if all individuals are drawn from similar environments. The accumulation of new species with increasing sampling effort can be visualised with a species accumulation curve. Such curves can be constructed in different ways. Increasing the area sampled increases observed species richness both because more individuals get included in the sample and because large areas are environmentally more heterogeneous than small areas. Many organism groups have most species in the tropics, which leads to latitudinal gradients in species richness. There has been much discussion about the relationship between productivity and species richness. Results have varied among studies, such that no global consensus on either the pattern or its possible causes has emerged.Waide, R. B. et al (1999) The relationship between productivity and species richness. Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics, 30, 257‚Äì300.  Applications Species richness is often used as a criterion when assessing the relative conservation values of habitats or landscapes. However, species richness is blind to the identity of the species. An area with many endemic or rare species is generally considered to have higher conservation value than another area where species richness is similar, but all the species are common and widespread.

Huarpe =Kaufman (1990)=Families and isolates Terrence Kaufman's classification is meant to be a rather conservative genetic grouping of the languages of South America (and a few in Central America). He has 118 genetic units. Kaufman believes for these 118 units \\"that there is little likelihood that any of the groups recognized here will be broken apart\\". Kaufman uses more specific terminology than only language family, such as language area, emergent area, and language complex, where he recognizes issues such as partial mutual intelligibility and dialect continuums. The list below collapses these into simply families. Kaufman's list is numbered and grouped by \\"geolinguistic region\\". The list below is presented in alphabetic order. Kaufman uses an anglicized orthography for his genetic units, which is mostly used only by himself. His spellings have been retained below.Kaufman, Terrence. (1990).

The names of the stocks are often obvious hyphenations of two members; for instance, the P√°es-Barbak√≥a stock consists of the P√°esan and Barbak√≥an families. If the composition is not obvious, it is indicated parenthetically. Kaufman puts question marks by Kechumara and Moset√©n-Chon stocks. \\"Good\\" stocks: * Awak√©‚ÄìKaliana (Arutani‚ÄìSape) * Chibcha‚ÄìMisumalpa * Ezmeralda‚ÄìJaruro * Jur√≠‚ÄìTikuna * Kechumara (=Kechua + Haki) (good?) * Lule‚ÄìVilela * Moset√©n‚ÄìChon (good?) * P√°es‚ÄìBarbak√≥a * Pano‚ÄìTakana * Sechura‚ÄìKatakao * Wamo‚ÄìChapak√∫ra \\"Probable\\" stocks: * Macro-Je (=Chikitano + Bor√≥roan + Aimor√© + Rikbakts√° + Je + Jeik√≥ + Kamak√°nan + Mashakal√≠an + Pur√≠an + Fuln√≠o + Karaj√° + Ofay√© + Guat√≥) * Mura‚ÄìMatanaw√≠ \\"Promising\\" stocks: * Kali√°nan (=Awak√© + Kaliana + Maku) \\"Maybe\\" stocks: * Bora‚ÄìWitoto * H√≠varo‚ÄìKawapana * Kunsa‚ÄìKapishan√° (now abandoned) * Pukina‚ÄìKolyawaya * S√°paro‚ÄìYawa Clusters and networks Kaufman's largest groupings are what he terms clusters and networks. Clusters are equivalent to macro-families (or phyla or superfamilies). Networks are composed of clusters. Kaufman views all of these larger groupings to be hypothetical and his list is to be used as a means to identify which hypotheses most need testing. =Campbell (2012)= Lyle Campbell (2012) proposed the following list of 53 uncontroversial indigenous language families and 55 isolates of South America ‚Äì a total of 108 independent families and isolates.

These prohibitions are meant to protect individuals from intrusion by state governments and to keep the states from intruding on the enumerated powers of the U.S. federal government. Among other things, this clause prohibits states from issuing their own money and from enacting legislation relieving particular persons of their contractual obligations. Although the clause recognizes people's right to form contracts, it allows the government to create laws barring contracts offending public policy, such as contracts for sex or for child labor. Likewise, though prohibited from creating a state currency, states are not barred from making \\"gold and silver coin a tender in payment of debts\\".  Text  Treaties, alliances, or confederations  At the time of the Civil War, this clause was one of the provisions upon which the Supreme Court relied in holding that the Confederation formed by the seceding States (the States that withdrew from membership in a federal union) could not be recognized as having any legal existence.Williams v. Bruffy, 96 U.S. 176, 183 (1878). Today, its practical significance lies in the limitations which it implies upon the power of the States to deal with matters having a bearing upon international relations. In the early case of Holmes v. Jennison,39 U.S. (14 Pet.) 540 (1840). Chief Justice Taney, referencing the Contract Clause, wrote an opinion which found that states had no power under it to honor an extradition request from a foreign government. More recently, the kindred idea that the responsibility for the conduct of foreign relations rests exclusively with the Federal Government prompted the Court to hold that, since the oil under the three mile marginal belt along the California coast might well become the subject of international dispute and since the ocean, including this three mile belt, is of vital consequence to the nation in its desire to engage in commerce and to live in peace with the world, the Federal Government has paramount rights in and power over that belt, including full dominion over the resources of the soil under the water area.United States v. California, 332 U.S. 19 (1947). In Skiriotes v. Florida,313 U.S. 69 (1941). (1941) the Court, on the other hand, ruled that this clause did not disable Florida from regulating the manner in which its own citizens may engage in sponge fishing outside its territorial waters. Speaking for a unanimous Court, Chief Justice Hughes declared: ‚ÄúWhen its action does not conflict with federal legislation, the sovereign authority of the State over the conduct of its citizens upon the high seas is analogous to the sovereign authority of the United States over its citizens in like circumstances.‚Äù313 U.S. at 78‚Äì79.  Bills of credit  In constitutional context, \\"bills of credit\\" mean paper medium of exchange intended to circulate between individuals, and between the Government and individuals, for the ordinary social purposes. Such papers do not need to be legal tender. Interest-bearing certificates in denominations up to ten dollars that were issued by loan offices established by the State of Missouri and made receivable in payment of taxes or other moneys due to the State, and in payment of the fees and salaries of state officers, were held to be bills of credit whose issuance was banned by this section.Craig v. Missouri, 29 U.S. (4 Pet.) 410, 425 (1830); Byrne v. Missouri, 33 U.S. (8 Pet.) 40 (1834). The States are not forbidden, however, to issue coupons receivable for taxes,Virginia Coupon Cases (Poindexter v. Greenhow), 114 U.S. 269 (1885); Chaffin v. Taylor, 116 U.S. 567 (1886). nor to execute instruments binding themselves to pay money at a future day for services rendered or money borrowed.Houston & Texas Central R.R. v. Texas, 177 U.S. 66 (1900). Bills issued by state banks are not bills of credit;Briscoe v. Bank of Kentucky, 36 U.S. (11 Pet.) 257 (1837). it is immaterial that the State is the sole stockholder of the bank,Darrington v. Bank of Alabama, 54 U.S. (13 How.) 12, 15 (1851); Curran v. Arkansas, 56 U.S. (15 How.) 304, 317 (1854). that the officers of the bank were elected by the state legislature, or that the capital of the bank was raised by the sale of state bonds.Woodruff v. Trapnall, 51 U.S. (10 How.) 190, 205 (1851).  Legal tender  Relying on this clause, the Supreme Court has held that the creditors should be paid in gold or silver, when the marshal of a state court seizes the property (bank notes) of the debtor within (a discharge of) an execution.Gwin v. Breedlove, 43 U.S. (2 How.) 29, 38 (1844). See also Griffin v. Thompson, 43 U.S. (2 How.) 244 (1844). However courts ruled valid the state laws providing that checks be drawn on local banks, as the Constitution does not prohibit a bank depositor from consenting when he draws a check that payment may be made by draft.Farmers & Merchants Bank v. Federal Reserve Bank, 262 U.S. 649, 659 (1923).  Bills of attainder  Statutes passed after the Civil War with the intent and result of excluding persons who had aided the Confederacy from following certain callings, by the device of requiring them to take an oath that they had never given such aid, were held invalid as being bills of attainder, as well as ex post facto laws.Cummings v. Missouri, 71 U.S. (4 Wall.) 277, 323 (1867); Klinger v. Missouri, 80 U.S. (13 Wall.) 257 (1872); Pierce v. Carskadon, 83 U.S. (16 Wall.) 234, 239 (1873). Other attempts to raise bill-of-attainder claims have been unsuccessful. A Court majority denied that a municipal ordinance that required all employees to execute oaths that they had never been affiliated with Communist or similar organizations, violated the clause, on the grounds that the ordinance merely provided standards of qualifications and eligibility for employment.Garner v. Board of Public Works, 341 U.S. 716, 722‚Äì723 (1951). Cf. Konigsberg v. State Bar of California, 366 U.S. 36, 47 n.9 (1961). A law that prohibited any person convicted of a felony and not subsequently pardoned from holding office in a waterfront union was not a bill of attainder because the ‚Äúdistinguishing feature of a bill of attainder is the substitution of a legislative for a judicial determination of guilt‚Äù and the prohibition ‚Äúembodies no further implications of appellant‚Äôs guilt than are contained in his 1920 judicial conviction.‚ÄùDe Veau v. Braisted, 363 U.S. 144, 160 (1960). Presumably, United States v. Brown, 381 U.S. 437 (1965), does not qualify this decision.  Impairing the obligation of contracts  The Framers of the Constitution added this clause in response to the fear that states would continue a practice that had been widespread under the Articles of Confederation--that of granting \\"private relief.\\" Legislatures would pass bills relieving particular persons (predictably, influential persons) of their obligation to pay their debts. It was this phenomenon that also prompted the framers to make bankruptcy law the province of the federal government. During and after the Revolution, many states passed laws favoring colonial debtors to the detriment of foreign creditors. Federalists, especially Alexander Hamilton, believed that such a practice would jeopardize the future flow of foreign capital into the fledgling United States. Consequently, the Contract Clause, by ensuring the inviolability of sales and financing contracts, encouraged an inflow of foreign capital by reducing the risk of loss to foreign merchants trading with and investing in the former colonies.See generally James W. Ely, Jr., The Guardian of Every Other Right (Oxford Univ. Press 1998). The clause does not prohibit the federal government from modifying or abrogating contracts. During the New Deal Era, the Supreme Court began to depart from the Lochner era constitutional interpretation of the Commerce Clause, Due Process, and the Contract Clause. In Home Building & Loan Association v. Blaisdell,290 U.S. 398 (1934) the Supreme Court upheld a Minnesota law that temporarily restricted the ability of mortgage holders to foreclose. The law was enacted to prevent mass foreclosures during the Great Depression, a time of economic hardship in America. The kind of contract modification performed by the law in question was arguably similar to the kind that the Framers intended to prohibit, but the Supreme Court held that this law was a valid exercise of the state's police power, and that the temporary nature of the contract modification and the emergency of the situation justified the law. Further cases have refined this holding, differentiating between governmental interference with private contracts and interference with contracts entered into by the government. Succinctly, there is more scrutiny when the government modifies a contract to alter its own obligations.See United States Trust Co. v. New Jersey, 431 U.S. 1 (1977) =Modification of private contracts= The Supreme Court laid out a three-part test for whether a law conforms with the Contract Clause in Energy Reserves Group v. Kansas Power & Light.459 U.S. 400 (1983) First, the state regulation must not substantially impair a contractual relationship. Second, the State \\"must have a significant and legitimate purpose behind the regulation, such as the remedying of a broad and general social or economic problem.\\"459 U.S. 400, 411-13 (1983) Third, the law must be reasonable and appropriate for its intended purpose. This test is similar to rational basis review. =Modification of government contracts= In United States Trust Co. v. New Jersey,431 U.S. 1 (1977) the Supreme Court held that a higher level of scrutiny was needed for situations where laws modified the government's own contractual obligations. In this case, New Jersey had issued bonds to finance the World Trade Center and had contractually promised the bondholders that the collateral would not be used to finance money-losing rail operations. Later, New Jersey attempted to modify law to allow financing of railway operations, and the bondholders successfully sued to prevent this from happening.  See also  * Charles River Bridge v.

Sampson John Albertson Sampson (August 17, 1873-December 23, 1946) was a gynecologist who studied endometriosis. Sampson was born near Troy, New York and graduated from Johns Hopkins in 1899. After completing his training in gynecology, he settled in Albany, New York. He worked at the Albany Hospital, and later became Professor of Gynecology at Albany Medical College. While endometriotic cysts had been described before - notably by W.W. Russell in 1898Russell, W. W. (1899). Aberrant portions of the Mullerian duct found in an ovary. Johns Hopkins Hosp Bul, 94-96(January, February, March), 8-10., it was Sampson who studied the disease systematically, described the clinical manifestations, and contributed to our understanding by proposing, in 1921, that endometriosis - a term he coined - is a process caused by the escape of menstrual debris including endometrial tissue that escapes retrograde through the fallopian tubes into the pelvis.Sampson JA. Peritoneal endometriosis due to the menstrual dissemination of endometrial tissue into the peritoneal cavity. Am J Obstet Gynecol 14:422, 1927. This then leads to secondary reactions of inflammation, repair, and scar formation. His theory of retrograde menstruation explains the typical distribution of endometriosis in the pelvis and why women with cervical or vaginal obstruction have a high incidence of endometriosis, it does not, however, provide an answer to why some women have endometriosis after hysterectomy or in distant organs. Thus, alternative theories have been developed, including the concept of endometriosis that starts in the pelvis de novo from stem cells. Even today, these and other theories coexist, as the cause of endometriosis remains a subject of debate. He has the distinction of having an artery named after him, Sampson's artery.

Most of its work was done with the strictest secrecy, and it began research of what would become some of the most important technology during World War II, including radar and the atomic bomb. It was superseded by the Office of Scientific Research and Development in 1941, and reduced to merely an advisory organization until it was eventually terminated during 1947. Organization The NDRC was created as part of the Council of National Defense, which had been created during 1916 to coordinate industry and resources for national security purposes, by an order of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt on June 27, 1940. Vannevar Bush, the director of the Carnegie Institution, had pressed for the creation of the NDRC because he had experienced during World War I the lack of cooperation between civilian scientists and the military. Bush managed to get a meeting with the President on June 12, 1940, and took a single sheet of paper describing the proposed agency. Roosevelt approved it in ten minutes. Government officials then complained that Bush was attempting to increase his authority and to bypass them--which he later admitted he was: :There were those who protested that the action of setting up NDRC was an end run, a grab by which a small company of scientists and engineers, acting outside established channels, got hold of the authority and money for the program of developing new weapons. That, in fact, is exactly what it was. (Bush 1970, p. 31‚Äì32) In his June 15 letter which appointed Bush to the head of the committee, Roosevelt outlined that the NDRC was not meant to replace the research work done by the Army and Navy in their own laboratories or through industry contracts, but rather to \\"supplement this activity by extending the research base and enlisting the aid of the scientists who can effectively contribute to the more rapid improvement of important devices, and by study determine where new effort on new instrumentalities may be usefully employed.\\" (Quoted in Stewart 1948, p. 8). The NDRC was managed by eight members, one of which was the chairman and two of which were appointed automatically by virtue of their positions as President of the National Academy of Sciences and the Commissioner of Patents. One member was appointed by the Secretary of War and another by the Secretary of the Navy; the other four members were appointed without reference to other offices. The original eight members of the NDRC were: Vannevar Bush, President of the Carnegie Institution (Chairman); Rear Admiral Harold G. Bowen, Sr.; Conway P. Coe, Commissioner of Patents; Karl Compton, President of MIT; James B. Conant, President of Harvard University; Frank B. Jewett, President of the National Academy of Sciences and President of Bell Telephone Laboratories; Brigadier General George V. Strong; and Richard C. Tolman, Professor of Physical Chemistry and Mathematical Physics at California Institute of Technology. Strong was succeeded by Brigadier General R.C. Moore on January 17, 1941. During its first meeting on July 2, the NDRC elected Tolman as its Vice-Chairman and appointed Irvin Stewart as its Secretary. The NDRC members met approximately once a month until September 1942, after which it met either weekly or bi-weekly until the end of the war with Germany, after which it met irregularly. NDRC research Under the chairmanship of Bush the NDRC created new laboratories, including the Radiation Laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which aided the development of radar, and the Underwater Sound Laboratory at New London, Connecticut, which developed sonar. The former grew to be the largest single activity of the NDRC. In the year of its autonomous existence, the NDRC received approximately $6,500,000 (out of a requested $10,000,000) for research. The NDRC's most important project eventually became the Manhattan Project--the full-scale project to produce nuclear weapons by the United States. An Advisory Committee on Uranium had been established to consider the feasibility of an atomic bomb as part of the National Bureau of Standards during 1939 as the result of the Einstein‚ÄìSzil√°rd letter, but had not made significant progress. It was instructed in Roosevelt's June 15 letter to report to the NDRC and Bush, establishing the chain of command which would later result in the full-scale bomb project. During June 1940 Bush reorganized the Uranium Committee into a scientific body and eliminated military membership. No longer beholden to the military for funds, the NDRC had greater access to money for nuclear research. However, there was little impetus until the British MAUD Committee's findings were presented in 1941. Creation of the OSRD The increasing hostilities in Europe cause a desire to create a new organization which would supersede the NDRC and remedy some of the problems the NDRC was facing, in particular in converting scientific research into usable military technology (\\"development\\"), increased liaison between the different parts of military and civilian research in different government agencies, and creating a system for funding military medicine. At Bush's insistence Roosevelt issued Executive Order No. 8807 on June 28, 1941, which established the Office of Scientific Research and Development. The NDRC technically still existed after the creation of the OSRD but its authority had been reduced from being able to actually fund research to becoming simply an advisory body to the OSRD. The NDRC ceased to exist officially after its last meeting on January 20, 1947. When it became the NDRC of the OSRD, the committee membership and structure was re-organized. The NDRC of the OSRD membership consisted of Conant (Chairman), Tolman (Vice-Chairman), Adams, Compton, and Jewett, along with the Commission of Patents (Coe until September 1945, and then Casper W. Ooms), and the representatives of the Army and Navy (which changed periodically). The Committee on Uranium was reorganized as the S-1 Section and it stopped being part of NDRC jurisdiction during December 1941. Select NDRC projects The NDRC funded research into hundreds of different projects at many different educational and industrial sites around the country. Some of the ones it is best remembered for include: *Atomic bomb research (would later become the Manhattan Project) *DUKW - amphibious vehicle *Project Pigeon *Proximity fuze *Radar at the Radiation Laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology NDRC research organization The NDRC's research organization changed constantly during its single year of autonomous existence. During early June 1941, shortly before it was superseded by the OSRD, its organization was as follows: *Division A (Armor and Ordnance) - Richard C. Tolman, Chairman; Charles C. Lauritsen, Vice-Chairman. **Section B (Structural Defense) **Section H (Investigations on Propulsion) **Section S (Terminal Ballistics) **Section T (Proximity Fuzes for Shells) **Section E (Fuzes and Guided Projectiles) *Division B (Bombs, Fuels, Gases, Chemical Problems) - James B. Conant, Chairman **Synthetic Problems - Roger Adams, Vice-Chairman ***Section A-1 (Explosives) ***Section A-2 (Synthetic Organics) ***Section A-3 (Detection of Persistent Agents) ***Section A-4 (Toxicity) **Physical Chemical Problems - W.K. Lewis, Vice-Chairman ***Section L-1 (Aerosols) ***Section L-2 (Protective Coatings) ***Section L-3 (Special Inorganic Problems) ***Section L-4 (Nitrocellulose) ***Section L-5 (Paint Removers) ***Section L-6 (Higher Oxides) ***Section L-7 (Oxygen Storage) ***Section L-8 (Gas Drying) ***Section L-9 (Metallurgical Problems) ***Section L-10 (Exhaust Disposal) ***Section L-11 (Absorbents) ***Section L-12 (Oxygen for Airplanes) ***Section L-13 (Hydraulic Fluids) **Miscellaneous Chemical Problems ***Section C-1 (Automotive Fuels; Special Problems) ***Section C-2 (Pyrotechnics) ***Section C-3 (Special Problems) *Division C (Communication and Transportation) - Frank B. Jewett, Chairman; C. B. Jolliffe, Hartley Rowe, R. D. Booth, and J. T. Tate, Vice-Chairmen. **Section C-1 (Communications) **Section C-2 (Transportation) **Section C-3 (Mechanical and Electrical Equipment) **Section C-4 (Submarine Studies) **Section C-5 (Sound Sources) *Division D (Detection, Controls, Instruments) - Karl Compton, Chairman; Alfred L. Loomis, Vice-Chairman. **Section D-1 (Detection) **Section D-2 (Controls) **Section D-3 (Instruments) **Section D-4 (Heat Radiation) *Division E (Patents and Invention) - Conway P. Coe, Chairman.

His victims were his own children, fathered by incestuous relationships with his daughters and nieces, as well as the children by his wife.\\"Marcus Wesson's Family Tree\\", Court TV, May 10, 2005 He has been described as the worst mass murderer of Fresno, California. Early life and education Marcus Wesson was born in Kansas, the eldest of four children of Benjamin and Carrie Wesson. They were raised as members of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. Wesson claimed that his mother was a religious fanatic. His father was an alcoholic and child abuser who abandoned the family when Wesson was a child. By the early 1960s, the family had moved to San Bernardino, California. After dropping out of high school, Wesson joined the Army and was stationed in Europe. Shortly after returning to the US and leaving the military, he became involved with Rosemary Solorio, a married woman living in San Jose, California. Soon Solorio broke up with her husband, and Wesson moved in with her and her children. In 1971, Solorio gave birth to Wesson's son. At the same time, Wesson was cultivating a relationship with one of Solorio's daughters, Elizabeth, telling her that God had chosen her to be his bride. In 1974, at the age of 8, Elizabeth was \\"married\\" to the 27-year- old Wesson in a home wedding ceremony. He began sexually abusing her at age 12. At age 15, they married legally when she became pregnant. Four months later, she gave birth to her first child. Eventually the couple had 10 children together; one died as an infant. One of Elizabeth's younger sisters left her own seven children with them, claiming to be unable to care for them. Wesson never held a steady job; he lived off welfare, and had his adult children work and give him all of their earnings. In 1989, Wesson was convicted of welfare fraud and perjury. The family often lived in run-down shacks, boats, and vacant houses. Wesson was abusive toward his wife and children. He prevented Elizabeth from participating in the children's upbringing. He homeschooled the children and taught them from his own handwritten Bible that focused on Jesus Christ being a vampire. He told the children that he was God and had them refer to him as \\"Master\\" or \\"Lord\\". He taught the children to be prepared for Armageddon and said that the girls were destined to become Wesson's future wives. He separated the boys from the girls, fearing they would develop sexual feelings for each other. He had the boys stay in a shack in a heavily wooded area and the girls on a rundown boat for several months. Wesson sexually abused two daughters and three nieces, \\"marrying\\" each in home ceremonies when they were around 7 to 9 years old. Each of the five girls became pregnant as a result of the incest. The mothers never disclosed the paternity of their children because Wesson threatened to harm them and the children if they did so. Court records indicate that Wesson fathered up to 18 children with 7 women and girls, including his five daughters. Murders Prior to March 12, 2004, Wesson had declared his intention to relocate his daughters and their children to Washington state, where Wesson's parents lived. On March 12, 2004, several members of Wesson's extended family, along with two nieces who rebelled against him, converged on his family compound demanding the release of their children. Fresno police were summoned to what was described as a child custody issue, and a standoff ensued. Fresno police testified they did not hear gunshots being fired shortly after, though other witnesses present at the standoff testified they did hear gunshots fired at that time.Child brides and vampire names: Bizarre the norm in mass murder trial By Harriet Ryan, Court TV via CNN.com, Thursday, May 19, 2005 In the aftermath, police discovered nine bodies, including two of Wesson's daughters and a total of seven of their children, in a bedroom filled with antique coffins. Each victim had been fatally shot through the eye. Wesson's other children, who were not present inside the house, survived the incident. Victims * Sebhrenah April Wesson (age 22) * Elizabeth Breahi Kina Wesson (age 37) * Illabelle Carrie Wesson (age 8) * Aviv Dominique Wesson (age 7) * Johnathon St Charles Wesson (age 7) * Sedonia Solorio Wesson (age 2) * Marshey St Christopher Wesson (age 2) * Ethen St Laurent Wesson (age 4) * Jeva St Vladensvspry Wesson (age 1) Trial At Wesson's trial, the prosecutor was Chief Deputy District Attorney, Lisa Gamoian. Wesson was represented by public defenders Peter Jones and Ralph Torres. They presented the defense that his 25-year-old daughter Sebhrenah, committed all the murders, including of her son Marshey and then committed suicide.i The murder weapon, a .22 caliber handgun, was found with her body, and Sebhrenah's DNA was found on the gun, which lent credence to Wesson's claim. The jury declined to find that Wesson fired the fatal shots, but convicted him of murder anyway, presumably finding that he had persuaded his children to enter into a suicide pact. Conviction and sentence Wesson was convicted of nine counts of first-degree murder on June 17, 2005, and also found guilty on 14 counts of forcible rape and the sexual molestation of seven of his daughters and nieces. Wesson was sentenced to death on June 27, 2005 and is currently in San Quentin State Prison. ReferencesExternal links * Fresno police chief: 'Horrific' scene at home at CNN.com * Scheeres, Julia.

Arrangements were made for its creation during May 1941, and it was created formally by Executive Order 8807 on June 28, 1941. It superseded the work of the National Defense Research Committee (NDRC), was given almost unlimited access to funding and resources, and was directed by Vannevar Bush, who reported only to President Franklin Delano Roosevelt. The research was widely varied, and included projects devoted to new and more accurate bombs, reliable detonators, work on the proximity fuze, guided missiles, radar and early-warning systems, lighter and more accurate hand weapons, more effective medical treatments, more versatile vehicles, and, most secret of all, the S-1 Section, which later became the Manhattan Project and developed the first atomic weapons. Human experimentation From October 1943 to October 1946, OSRD used conscientious objectors from Civilian Public Service as subjects for research of malaria, altitude pressure, life raft rations, high altitude, frostbite, psycho-acoustics, poison gas, ingestion of and exposure to sea water, temperature extremes, climate, physiological hygiene, thiamine, bed rest and aero medicine. To study the effects of diet and nutrition, Ancel Keys of the University of Minnesota Laboratory of Physiological Hygiene placed 32 conscientious objectors on a controlled diet. For three months they were given a normal 3,200 calorie diet. This was followed by six months of an 1800 calorie diet, fewer calories than provided by the famine diet experienced by the civilian population in wartime Europe. The research documented the men's ability to maintain physical output and the psychological effects such as introversion, lethargy, irritability and severe depression. The study then studied the men's recovery as they returned to a normal diet and regained the weight lost during the experimentation. The men indicated later they would not have volunteered for this project had they known how rigorous it would be. The OSRD was discontinued during December 1947.

The clubs are generally run and organized by the parents of the students in the supported organization in high schools, and by athletic supporters and fans at colleges. It is not a social club. Its main function is to develop support for the student program and raise funds to supplement shrinking public support as a result of budget cuts. For example, fundraisers are often held to raise money for supplies or equipment that the students may need or for trips that the students may need to take. The main principle of funding by a U.S. IRS 501(c)(3) nonprofit is that the booster club may not discriminate in making grants to youth or college students on the basis of their family's membership in or funding to the club, or the family's fund- raising or time put into club activities. A popular way for booster clubs to raise money is with raffles held at sporting events for some item that would be donated by a local business, clothing such as t-shirts with the school's name and mascot on it, or the sale of popcorn, hot dogs, and other food items to the fans who attend a game, tournament, or other athletic event. Membership fees are also a key fundraising element, especially at the college level. With the popularity of the internet and social media, many programs are turning to online crowdfunding platforms to reach out for additional support. At the high school level, school administrators cannot be involved in the booster club organization except approving activities held at the high school. At the collegiate level, the NCAA strictly regulates the activities of booster clubs and strictly defines what actions would cause a person to be considered an official booster of an athletic program. Many scandals have resulted from prohibited activities by patrons, particularly those providing monetary or in- kind incentives for prospective athletes to sign with a particular university.

Lee graduated from Capital High School in Olympia, Washington in 1993, where he also played football. Being ambidextrous Lee played as a lefty in baseball and as a QB for the Capital High football team threw with his right. While playing for San Diego State University in 1996, Lee won the Golden Spikes Award, annually given to the best amateur baseball player by USA Baseball. Lee was initially drafted as the second pick in the 1996 Major League Baseball Draft by the Minnesota Twins, but was declared a free agent by MLB after the Twins failed to tender him a contract within fifteen days of the end of the draft. He then signed a four-year, $10 million contract with the Arizona Diamondbacks. Lee played on the 1996 Olympic baseball team for the United States. The team went 7-2 with losses to Cuba in the preliminary round and Japan in the semifinals. The U.S. team won the Bronze medal by defeating Nicaragua. Professional careerArizona Diamondbacks= Lee was the starting first baseman in the Diamondbacks' inaugural season of , and he hit .269 with 71 runs scored, 22 home runs, and 72 RBI and finished third in the voting for NL Rookie of the Year. Lee has the distinction of having the first hit (a single) as well as hitting the first home run in Diamondbacks history on March 31, 1998 in a home game against the Colorado Rockies; however, the team lost the game 9-2 (Lee also had scored and driven in the first runs in D-Backs history with that blast). Lee was part of the Diamondbacks' trade for Curt Schilling from the Philadelphia Phillies, along with pitchers Vicente Padilla, Omar Daal, and Nelson Figueroa on July 26, . =Philadelphia Phillies= In 56 games with the Phillies in 2000, Lee batted .239 with 19 runs scored, 1 home run, and 14 RBI. In 2001, his first full season with the Phillies, Lee appeared in 157 of 162 games, the most of any season in his career. Lee batted .258 with a career best 75 runs scored, while hitting 20 home runs, and also driving in a career best 90 RBI. The Phillies finished 86-76, just two games behind the Atlanta Braves for the National League East. In 2002 with the Phillies, Lee played 153 games and batted .265; however, his stats began to decline as he scored 55 runs, hit 13 home runs, and drove in 70 RBI. On December 21, 2002 the Phillies released Lee, granting him free agency, two weeks after signing free agent first baseman Jim Thome. =Tampa Bay Devil Rays= On February 6, 2003 the Tampa Bay Devil Rays signed Lee to a contract. In 145 games with Tampa Bay, Lee batted a career high .275 while tying his career best with 75 runs scored, hitting 19 home runs, and driving in 70 RBI. On November 2, 2003 Lee was again granted his free agency and on March 2, 2004 he signed with the New York Yankees. =New York Yankees= In 2004 with the Yankees, Lee appeared in seven games, missing most of the season with a torn labrum in his left shoulder which required surgery. Lee had a .105 batting average, scoring one run and driving in two, but did not hit any home runs. On October 29, 2004, the Yankees declined the club option for a second year on Lee's contract and he was released after the Yankees paid a $250,000 buyout. After again becoming a free agent, Lee re-signed with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays on February 11, 2005. =Return to Tampa Bay= In 2005, Lee appeared in 129 games batting .272 with 54 runs scored, 12 home runs, and 49 RBI. On June 19, 2005 Lee had his consecutive errorless games streak ended at 170, then the second longest in American League history and only 8 games behind the record held by Mike Hegan whose streak ran from 1970 to 1973. With the bases loaded, Larry Walker grounded out to Lee at 1st base. Lee then threw home with his throw beating David Eckstein to the plate, however, catcher Toby Hall had to stretch for the ball and failed to touch home plate, allowing Eckstein to score and giving Lee a throwing error.

Born in Des Moines, Iowa, he is best known as the sampler and keyboardist in Slipknot, in which he chose #5. Jones joined the band in 1996 shortly after the recording of Mate. Feed. Kill. Repeat., replacing Donnie Steele on guitar, although he quickly moved onto the role of sampler. Following the departure of Joey Jordison in 2013, Jones is now the second-longest-serving member of Slipknot. Career Craig Jones joined Slipknot in mid-1996, replacing original guitarist Donnie Steele after the recording of the band's debut demo Mate. Feed. Kill. Repeat. He was enlisted to the band by drummer Joey Jordison, with whom Jones had previously worked (alongside guitarist Josh Brainard) in the band Modifidious. However, shortly after joining the band, the \\"electronics and computer genius\\" moved over to the role of sampler due to the increase in sound effects, background noises/programmed samples and media samples used in the band's music. Mick Thomson replaced him on guitar. Jordison claimed that Jones was happy with the change, noting that \\"he liked doing that anyway, coming up with all these noises and sounds\\". Jones' contribution to the band has been described by BBC Music as \\"provid[ing] samples, speeches and noises as a kind of audio garnish in the band's dark maelstrom\\". Jones was given the nickname \\"133\\" as a reference to the processor speed of his computer, 133 MHz, which author Joel McIver claims \\"was considered the state of the art\\" at the time. In September 2004, it was announced that Jones would not be performing with Slipknot for a short period of the band's European tour due to a \\"medical emergency\\". A statement on the band's official website explained that \\"Craig Jones #133 (#5) has been suffering incredible pain during the first week of our European tour and has been unable to eat or sleep properly. Therefore, a decision was made for him to return to the States for emergency dental surgery\\". Speaking about the situation, guitarist Jim Root explained that \\"We're filling his spot, we've got a picture of him in the dressing room and we miss him every day, [but] we couldn't cancel the tour\\". Mask Upon joining the band as a guitarist, Jones initially wore women's pantyhose on his head when performing, which was said to give his face a \\"compressed, robber-like look\\". This was later changed to an astronaut space helmet with long nails hammered through it. The helmet was later replaced by a bondage mask, and a zipper was also added over the mouth area. Along with those of Root and Thomson, Jones' mask has been acknowledged by fans as having stayed very much consistent over the course of Slipknot's career. For the group's 2019 album We Are Not Your Kind, his mask was slightly modified, with the nails being replaced by screws and being longer at the top of the mask, achieving a mohawk effect. Personal life Jones is often identified by the media as the most quiet and private member of Slipknot, earning him the nickname \\"The Quiet One\\". Vocalist Corey Taylor has commented on his demeanour by describing him as \\"the quietly scary type\\". Slipknot producer Ross Robinson has added that he \\"would try to get him to talk and he would just sit and stare at [him]\\". Loudwire's Graham Hartmann noted that he \\"almost never speaks\\" and \\"keeps people at a distance\\", theorising that these qualities inspired the style of his mask. Ian Gittins of The Guardian described Jones as \\"patently a strange individual\\", as well as quoting the band's manager's dubbing of the sampler as \\"the Unabomber\\", a reference to terrorist Ted Kaczynski. When asked early in his career about what job he might be working were he not in Slipknot, Jones responded that he'd likely be \\"driving forklifts in a warehouse all day long\\", although he has also joked that he would \\"probably be out killing people\\", which has earned him the nickname \\"The Killer\\". According to Robinson, the latter comment was the first the sampler made in an interview, and it inspired a number of complaints from readers of the publication to which it was made.

A feedwater heater is a power plant component used to pre-heat water delivered to a steam generating boiler. Preheating the feedwater reduces the irreversibilities involved in steam generation and therefore improves the thermodynamic efficiency of the system.Fundamentals of Steam Power by Kenneth Weston, University of Tulsa This reduces plant operating costs and also helps to avoid thermal shock to the boiler metal when the feedwater is introduced back into the steam cycle. In a steam power plant (usually modeled as a modified Rankine cycle), feedwater heaters allow the feedwater to be brought up to the saturation temperature very gradually. This minimizes the inevitable irreversibilities associated with heat transfer to the working fluid (water). See the article on the second law of thermodynamics for a further discussion of such irreversibilities. Cycle discussion and explanation  The energy used to heat the feedwater is usually derived from steam extracted between the stages of the steam turbine. Therefore, the steam that would be used to perform expansion work in the turbine (and therefore generate power) is not utilized for that purpose. The percentage of the total cycle steam mass flow used for the feedwater heater is termed the extraction fraction and must be carefully optimized for maximum power plant thermal efficiency since increasing this fraction causes a decrease in turbine power output. Feedwater heaters can also be \\"open\\" or \\"closed\\" heat exchangers. An open heat exchanger is one in which extracted steam is allowed to mix with the feedwater. This kind of heater will normally require a feed pump at both the feed inlet and outlet since the pressure in the heater is between the boiler pressure and the condenser pressure. A deaerator is a special case of the open feedwater heater which is specifically designed to remove non-condensable gases from the feedwater. Closed feedwater heaters are typically shell and tube heat exchangers where the feedwater passes throughout the tubes and is heated by turbine extraction steam. These do not require separate pumps before and after the heater to boost the feedwater to the pressure of the extracted steam as with an open heater. However, the extracted steam (which is most likely almost fully condensed after heating the feedwater) must then be throttled to the condenser pressure, an isenthalpic process that results in some entropy gain with a slight penalty on overall cycle efficiency: Many power plants incorporate a number of feedwater heaters and may use both open and closed components. Feedwater heaters are used in both fossil- and nuclear- fueled power plants. Economizer An economizer serves a similar purpose to a feedwater heater, but is technically different as it does not use cycle steam for heating. In fossil-fuel plants, the economizer uses the lowest- temperature flue gas from the furnace to heat the water before it enters the boiler proper. This allows for the heat transfer between the furnace and the feedwater to occur across a smaller average temperature gradient (for the steam generator as a whole). System efficiency is therefore further increased when viewed with respect to actual energy content of the fuel. Most nuclear power plants do not have an economizer. However, the Combustion Engineering System 80+ nuclear plant design and its evolutionary successors, (e.g. Korea Electric Power Corporation's APR-1400) incorporate an integral feedwater economizer. This economizer preheats the steam generator feedwater at the steam generator inlet using the lowest-temperature primary coolant. Testing A widely use Code for the procedures, direction, and guidance for determining the thermo-hydraulic performance of a closed feedwater heater is the ASME PTC 12.1 Feedwater Heater Standard.

The name is French and means, literally, \\"the door of the dead\\". Current dynamics North of the peninsula, warm water from Green Bay flows into Lake Michigan on the surface, while at the same time, cold lakewater enters Green Bay deep underneath.Currents and Temperatures in Green Bay, Lake Michigan, Journal of Great Lakes research 11(2):97-109, 1985, by page 108 (page 12 of the pdf) Origin of the name According to traditions given by the Native Americans to area fishermen in the 1840s and reported both by Captain Brink, a government engineer who surveyed the area in 1834, and by Hjalmar R. Holand in his two-volume history of Door County,Hjalmar R. Holand. History of Door County Wisconsin: The County Beautiful Vol. 1, Chicago: S. J. Clarke, 1917, pp. 39-40. the ominous name is traced back to a battle between the Winnebago and Potawatomi tribes. Holand's report is as follows: :The Winnebago, having migrated from the southwest, were not content to share the land with the gentle Potawatomi, who had arrived before them. They had already pushed the latter from the peninsula to the islands and were preparing to attack the islands, too. The Potawatomi devised a desperate plan for defense. They sent three scouts to spy out the Winnebago positions. The spies were then to light a signal fire so the Potawatomi warriors could land safely and attack the Winnebago from behind. The spies, however, were discovered and captured. Two died with their secret, but one revealed the plan. :Knowing the plan, the Winnebago decided to use it to their advantage and devised a two pronged attack. They chose a high bluff where there was no safe landing and set a signal fire there. There they planned to intercept the war party as they were helpless in their canoes. They sent a second group to attack the villages of the Potawatomi, which would be defenseless with their warriors gone. :When the Potawatomi defenders left the islands, the weather was relatively calm, but by the time they were mid channel, a stiff north wind set in. They pressed on, however, confident that they could land safely near the signal fire. When they arrived, the Winnebago attacked, raining destruction from above. They could not land, and the strong north wind and waves prevented their fleeing to safety. Canoes capsized in the surf and were dashed against the rocks. A few Potawatomi managed to climb to a ledge a short distance above the waves. Some of the Winnebago jumped down to the ledge and fighting continued there until a large wave took them all to their deaths in the lake. :After the battle at the bluff, the remaining Winnebago waited for the return of their second party. The wind and waves that had prevented the Potawatomi from fleeing apparently also caught the Winnebago raiding party. They were never seen again. The Winnebago took it as a sign that they should not try to cross to the islands again, for it was, they concluded, a doorway to death. The report seems to be biased in favor of the Potawatomi. The Winnebago, or to use their own chosen name the Ho-Chunk, do not describe themselves as fierce. Various historical accounts indicate that it was the Potawatomi who were the newcomers to the area and that the Winnebago had recently suffered greatly at the hands of the Illinois.Potawatomi HistoryPotawatomi If this account accurately gives the origin of the name, the battle probably occurred in the mid seventeenth century, shortly after the Potawatomi settled in the area and before the French used the area enough to name the strait. If the Porte des Morts battle happened it could have occurred here at Door Bluff (also called Deathdoor Bluff). This is typical of a number of places on the northern coast of the Door Peninsula. The escarpment seen here is between 15 and 20 feet high. Above that is a gentle slope up for about 50 feet and another similar escarpment above that. The broad flat rocks at the base of the cliff are high enough to be out of most of the surf in stormy seas, yet low enough to be awash in a rogue wave. At the time this photo was taken, the lake was about 1.8 feet below its long term average level. The wind was from the south at about 15 mph, gusting to about 25 mph. In the \\"Detail of NOAA Chart #14909\\" (above), Deathdoor Bluff is the point at the far left of the chart. Other explanations for the origin of the name have been offered. One account involving Native Americans has a tribe building a ring of campfires on thin ice to lure their enemies through the strait overnight. The plan worked and the attackers perished. Another mentions a storm in which canoes were dashed against the rock but mentions no battle. It has also been said that the French, not wanting the English to establish fur trade routes to Wisconsin and other surrounding areas, named the passage to discourage and scare sailors from sailing through the strait.OnMilwaukee.com Visitors Guide: Beyond Milwaukee: Deaths Door Strait Yet the strait had its name well before the English were coming to the Great Lakes. It is possible that the \\"doorway to death\\" name has a much larger significance. The written history of the area between Jean Nicolet's visit to Green Bay in 1634 and the return of French trappers in the late 1650s is virtually a blank page. Thus, the only reasons that can be found for the drastic reduction in the population of the Winnebago in that time period - from estimates of between ten and twenty thousand to five, six, or seven hundred - are those that can be gleaned from the natives' own oral traditions, which by the time they make it to a recorder's pen often mix and confuse details of separate events. R. David Edmunds relates that after the Winnebago successfully repulsed the first advance of the Potawatomi, they lost several hundred warriors in a storm on Lake Michigan.Edmunds, R. David, The Potawatomis: Keepers of the Fire, University of Oklahoma Press, Norman, 1978, page 5 Carol Mason also refers to the loss of 600 warriors, but does not indicate on which body of water they were lost and questions the credibility of the report.Mason, Carol I. Introduction to Wisconsin Indians. Salem, Wis.: Sheffield Publishing Co., 1988, p. 66. Lee Sultzman says Lake Winnebago was the location and that 500 warriors were lost in a failed attack against the Fox. James Clifton says more than 500 were lost in a battle with the Sauk, who entered northeast Wisconsin about the same time as the Potawatomi.Clifton, James A., The Prairie People: Continuity and Change in Potawatomi Indian Culture 1665-1965, The Regents Press of Kansas, Lawrence, 1977, page 37 Others say that the Winnebago were allied with both the Fox and Sauk.Winnebago Indian Tribe Edmunds opines that such a loss could not by itself result in the near decimation of the whole people, and offers that two other causes should also be included.Edmunds, R.D., p. 5 The Winnebago during this time apparently also suffered greatly from a disease, perhaps one of the European plagues like smallpox (although the Winnebago say it resulted in the victims turning yellow, which is not a trait of smallpox).Winnebago Finally, it appears that a sizeable contingent of their historic enemies, the Illinois, came on a mission of mercy to help the Winnebago at time of suffering and famine - what one might expect after the loss of 600 men who were also their hunters. Perhaps remembering former hostilities, however, the Winnebago repaid the kindness by adding their benefactors to their diet. The Illinois were enraged and in the ensuing retaliation they almost totally wiped out the Winnebago. It is not likely that there was more than one separate incident in which upwards of 500 or 600 warriors were lost in a storm. The fact that only warriors are mentioned suggests that they were lost in some kind of military effort. It does seem clear that the initial influx of Potawatomi (about 1641 to 1643) was repulsed, and that later the Potawatomi returned in strength. By the time the French returned to the area the Potawatomi were well established in northeast Wisconsin, not only in the Potawatomi Islands of Door County, but also at what is now the city of Green Bay. Lake Michigan is much more capable of producing deadly waves than is Lake Winnebago. While it must remain speculation, it is nonetheless reasonable to conclude that the Porte des Morts battle really happened, that it was the end of the Winnebago's pushing out the first wave of Potawatomi, that the loss of 600 warriors in a storm corresponds with the loss of warriors in the Porte des Morts tradition, and that the event marked not just the doorway to death for those who died at the bluff and in the storm, but the beginning of events that brought death to nearly the whole tribe. One may never be certain as to the origin of the name, but it seems to suggest a significant event, and the records of the French tie no event of their history to the name. A grim reputation \\"A small ledge just above the water at Door Bluff County Park, measuring about 6 feet by 18 feet.\\" A couple observing a wreck in the Porte des Morts; from a postcard prior to 1915 A number of factors combine to make this a particularly dangerous strait. Older sailing vessels were not as maneuverable as modern motor boats. The strait is relatively narrow. Shoals extend far from shore. Winds on the Great Lakes are notoriously unpredictable and can increase to gale forces and more almost without warning. The strait is also a combination of three separate passageways. Plum Island and tiny Pilot Island are almost in the center of what is commonly considered Death's Door, and pose hazards. While the Porte des Morts Passage proper to the south of Plum Island is relatively hazard free, the Detroit Island Passage to the north of Plum Island has many. The water between Detroit Island and Washington Island hides shoals that are not navigable, except by small boats like canoes. Ships lost in Death's Door include the Fleetwing in 1888, the A.P. Nichols, Forest, and J.E. Gilmore in 1892. The wrecks of Death's Door have taken relatively few human lives. So great is the reputation of Porte des Morts that a number of shipwrecks have been attributed to it that did not happen in the strait. One of these is the loss of the Griffin (also spelled Griffon), the first sailing ship on the upper Great Lakes. The Griffon was last seen sailing from Washington Island, but it was sailing north, not south into Death's Door. One account does say that she sailed from Detroit Harbor, which does open on Death's Door, but the same account says those on shore watched it sail north, which is impossible from that location. Another possible point of departure for the Griffin would be Washington Harbor on the north side of Washington Island or even Rock Island, which lies just northeast of Washington Island. There have been many who have claimed to have found the remains of the Griffin, but not one has been verified. The most recent \\"discovery\\" is awaiting funding and legal process before it can collect sufficient evidence to support or refute the claim.LaSalle-Griffon - First European Vessel to Sail the Upper Great Lakes Another ship erroneously said to have grounded in Death's Door is the Louisiana, which records clearly show beached and burned on the shore of Washington Harbor Door County Advocate, November 13, 1913, page 1Door County Democrat, November 14, 1913, page 1 Death's Door was used primarily by vessels sailing between ports along Green Bay and those along middle to southern Lake Michigan. Going around Washington Island would add roughly thirty miles to the voyage. At a time when ships made between five and ten miles an hour in good sailing weather, that meant three to six additional hours. So captains used Death's Door often until the Sturgeon Bay Ship Canal was completed in 1878. By using the canal sailors could not only avoid Death's Door, but especially could shorten their voyage by over a hundred miles. Porte des Morts Passage today Porte des Morts Passage from beach at Northport, showing ferry harbor breakwater and Plum Island at left, Detroit Island center, and Pilot Island at right. An abandoned lighthouse is the only structure on Pilot Island. While Great Lakes freighters still navigate through Death's Door Passage on occasion on routes from Lake Superior to ports in Green Bay waters, most use the Rock Island Passage. Freighters from southern Lake Michigan will use the Sturgeon Bay ship canal constructed in 1881. Commercial ferries transit Death's Door Passage daily to provide transport from mainland Door County to Washington Island. Recreation boating is common since navigation is not dangerous with modern marine electronics.  Climate Waves= Water conditions begin to deteriorate in August and are worst in October and November, when lakewide wave heights of 5 to 10 feet are encountered about 35 percent of the time. In October, southerly through southwesterly winds are most often responsible for the waves, while by November westerly through northerly winds often generate rough water conditions. Waves of 10 feet or more are encountered 3 to 5 percent of the time from November through March. Extreme waves of 20 to 22 feet have been encountered. During the spring, high waves are infrequent, but 5- to 10-foot waves develop 15 to 30 percent of the time in the south and 20 to 40 percent in the north. In the summer, waves climb above 10 feet less than 1 percent of the time, while those in the 5- to 10-foot range drop to less than 20 percent in June and July.Plum Island Rear Range Light Spill Response, uscg.mil pages 1-2 = Winds = Coastal winds are more localized and variable. Along the Lake Michigan shore, spring winds are variable, particularly in the morning, when northerlies, easterlies, and southerlies are among the most common. By afternoon, aided by a lake-breeze effect, there are a preponderance of winds out of the south, particularly with the approach of summer. Summer also brings a slackening of windspeeds. The likelihood of encountering winds of 28 knots or more falls from a 4- to 10-percent chance in March to less than 3 percent by May. However, Green Bay recorded a 95-knot southwesterly one May; it is not unrealistic to expect a wind extreme of 100 knots or more over open waters. Spring winds can still blow strong, with winds of 28 knots or more encountered about 4 to 8 percent of the time. They do slacken from their winter fierceness, with southerlies and southwesterlies becoming more frequent and northerlies less so as summer approaches. Strong winds are infrequent in summer and mostly associated with thunderstorms. Southerly and southwesterly winds prevail particularly in the north. Southeasterlies are also common in the south, with northerlies also present.

He later took up arms again in the so- called Thurgau war against Archduke Sigismund of Austria in 1460. It was due to his influence that the Dominican convent St. Katharinental, whither many Austrians had fled after the capture of Diessenhofen, was not destroyed by the Swiss confederates. At around the age of 30, he married Dorothea Wyss, a farmer's daughter. They farmed in the municipality of Fl√ºeli in the alpine foothills, above Sachseln on the Lake Sarnen. He also continued in the military to the age of 37, rising to the position of captain, reportedly fighting with a sword in one hand and a rosary in the other. After serving in the military, he became a councillor and judge for his canton in 1459 and served as a judge for nine years. He declined the opportunity to serve as Landamman (governor) of his canton.  Political mystic  After receiving a mystical vision of a lily eaten by a horse, which he recognized as indicating that the cares of his worldly life (the draft horse pulling a plough) were swallowing up his spiritual life (the lily, a symbol of purity), he decided to devote himself entirely to the contemplative life. In 1467, he left his wife and his ten children with her consent and set himself up as a hermit in the Ranft chine in Switzerland, establishing a chantry for a priest from his own funds so that he could assist at mass daily. According to a canonical process, he survived for nineteen years with no food except for the eucharist. Symbolic visions continued to be a feature of his contemplation, and he became a spiritual guide whose advice was widely sought and followed.The Saints: A concise Biographical Dictionary, edited by John Coulson, Hawthorn Books, Inc., 1960 His reputation for wisdom and piety was such that figures from across Europe came to seek advice from him, and he was known to all as \\"Brother Klaus.\\" In 1470, Pope Paul II granted the first indulgence to the sanctuary at Ranft and it became a place of pilgrimage, since it lay on the Way of Saint JamesWay of St. James - Being on the way a pilgrims' route to Santiago de Compostela in Spain. His counsel prevented a civil war between the cantons meeting at the Diet of Stans in 1481, when their antagonism grew. Despite being illiterate and having limited experience with the world, he is honored among both Protestants and Catholics with the permanent national unity of Switzerland. Letters of thanks to him from Berne and Soleure still survive. When he died, on 21 March 1487, he was surrounded by his wife and children.  Prayer citation  The new Catechism of the Catholic Church cites a brief personal prayer of St. Nicholas of Flue in paragraph #226Catechism of the Catholic Church - I believe in God of Chapter 1 of Part 1, Section 2 \\"The Profession of the Christian Faith\\" under subheading IV \\"The implications of faith in one God\\", an aspect of which is making good use of created things. > My Lord and my God, take from me everything that distances me from you. > My Lord and my God, give me everything that brings me closer to you. > My Lord and my God, detach me from myself to give my all to you. > Veneration He was beatified in 1669. After his beatification, the municipality of Sachseln built a church in his honour, where his body was interred. He was canonized in 1947 by Pope Pius XII. His feast day in the Roman Catholic Church is 21 March, except in Switzerland and Germany, where it is 25 September. As a layman with family responsibilities who took his civic duties as an ancestral landowner seriously, Brother Klaus is a model of heroic manhood for many concerned with the flourishing of local communities and sustainable use of open land. He is the patron saint of the German-language association KLB (Katholischen Landvolkbewegung), the Catholic Rural Communities Movement.Wir √ºber uns A plate from the Amtliche Luzerner Chronik of 1513 of Diebold Schilling the Younger, illustrating the events of the Tagsatzung at Stans in 1481.

Visionary images  Of the many spiritual insights Nicholas received in his visions, one in particular is reproduced often in a reduced logographic format, as a mystical wheel.BruderKlaus.com Nicholas described his vision of the Holy Face at the center of a circle with the tips of three swords touching the two eyes and mouth, while three others radiate outwards in a sixfold symmetry reminiscent of the Seal of Solomon. A cloth painted with the image, known as the meditation prayer clothJakobusGemeinde.de associates the symbol with six episodes from the life of Christ: the mouth of God at the Annunciation, the eyes spying Creation both in its prelapsarian innocence and redemption from the Fall at Calvary, while in the inward direction the betrayal by his disciple Judas in the Garden of Gethsamene points to the crown of the Pantocrator sitting in the judgment seat, the glad tidings of the Nativity scene's \\"Glory to God in the Highest and Peace to his people on Earth\\" echoes in the ear on the right of the head, while the memorial of the Lord's Supper \\"This is my body, which will be given for you\\" at the prayers of consecration in the Divine Liturgy of the Mass echoes to the ear on the left of the head. These six medallions contain additional symbols of acts of Christian kindness: # two crutches suggest Visiting the sick as a work of mercy # hiker's walking stick with travel pouch suggests Hospitality to strangers # a loaf of bread, fish and a pitcher of water and wine represent Feed the hungry, quench the thirsty # chains indicate Care for the incarcerated # Christ's garments evoke Clothe the naked # a coffin reminds us to Bury the dead This visual interpretation encapsulates the personal piety of rural peasants, many illiterate, for whom salvation history was expressed in these crucial aspects of God's loving relationship with us and the Christian duty to love of neighbor. Sanctifying grace flows from the Paschal Victim on the Cross, an image Nicholas described in his vision by the stream,Webland.ch where the Tabernacle sits atop a spring that flows forth covering the earth, echoing the rivers flowing from the Temple in Ezekiel's visions. Such profound insights on the allegorical,RTF Study Program - Lesson 2: The Four Senses of Sacred Scripture anagogical and tropological senses of scripture are often lost in modern biblical exegesis that focuses too narrowly on the literal sense, the historical-critical method.

Fox explored the synthesis of amino acids from inorganic molecules, the synthesis of proteinous amino acids and amino acid polymers called \\"proteinoids\\" from inorganic molecules and thermal energy, and created what he thought was the world's first protocell out of proteinoids and water. He called these globules \\"microspheres\\". Fox believed in the process of abiogenesis where life spontaneously organized itself from the colloquially known \\"primordial soup;\\" poolings of various simple organic molecules that existed during the time before life on Earth. He also suggested that his experiments possessed conditions that were similar to those of primordial Earth. In his experiments, he demonstrated that it is possible to create protein-like structures from inorganic molecules and thermal energy. Dr. Fox went on to create microspheres that he said closely resembled bacterial cells and concluded that they could be similar to the earliest forms of life or protocells. BiographyEarly years= Sidney Fox was the son of Jacob Fox, a wig-maker, and Louise Berman, a Ukrainian immigrant. Fox married Raia Joffe Fox and they have three sons: Lawrence, Ronald, and Thomas. All three of his sons became scientists. His family was Jewish. Fox obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree from University of California, Los Angeles in Chemistry. He went on to earn a Ph. D. from California Institute of Technology in 1940 and did his postdoctoral work at the Linus Pauling Laboratory where he grew close with Linus Pauling. =Academic career= From 1943 to 1955, Fox was a full professor at Iowa State College. Fox became the head of the Iowa Agricultural Experimental Station's Chemistry Department from 1949 to 1955. In 1955, Sidney W. Fox moved to Florida State University and held the position of Professor of Chemistry, Director of the Oceanographic Institute, and Director of the Institute for Space Biosciences. In 1964, Dr. Fox moved to the University of Miami where he was a professor and the director of the Institute for Molecular Evolution for 25 years. The program was supported by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Dr. Fox also taught at the Southern Illinois University in the Department of Plant Biology as a Distinguished Research Professor. From there, Fox moved to the University of South Alabama where he was entitled Distinguished Research Scientist in the Marine Sciences department in 1993. =Later Years= 9 Years before his death, Fox underwent quintuple bypass surgery and was in a coma for 13 weeks. He survived without any major impairment and carried on with his career. Dr. Fox continued working as a professor up into his eighties. In 1996, 2 years before his death, Fox was elected Fellow of the Society of the International Society for the Study of the Origin of Life or ISSOL. Sidney Walter Fox died on Monday, August 10, 1998 in Mobile, Alabama. TheoriesThe production of amino acids from inorganic molecules= Dr. Sidney Fox based his experiments off of the information found in the Miller‚ÄìUrey experiment. The Miller‚ÄìUrey experiment was performed by scientist Stanley Miller under the guidance of Harold Urey in the early 1950s. In the Miller‚ÄìUrey experiment, water was boiled in a flask with the gases hydrogen, ammonia, and methane. The gases flowed through the apparatus past two electrodes that produced an electrical charge that acted as the lightning that would have been in the atmosphere before life on Earth. When the gases condensed after being cooled down, they fell back into the boiling flask. What Stanley Miller found in the flask when he observed the water were acids and amino acids. Amino acids are the necessary \\"building block\\" molecules for proteins. Stanley Miller and Harold Urey's experiment suggests that life formed from the presence of inorganic molecules, water, and electrical charge. These conditions are assumed to be similar to those of primordial earth. In 1964, Fox and Kaoru Harada performed an experiment yielding similar results. In this experiment, methane flowed through a concentrated solution of ammonium hydroxide and then into a hot tube containing silica sand at about 1000 ¬∞C. Fox indicated that silica gel, volcanic lava, and alumina could be used in place of silica sand. The gas was then absorbed in cold, aqueous ammonia. The result was twelve protein-like amino acids: aspartic acid, glutamic acid, glycine, alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, serine, threonine, proline, tyrosine, and phenylalanine. Many other similar experiments were carried out by teams of scientists such as Heyns and Pavel, Oro and Kamat, and Fox and Windsor that led to the production of amino acids. =The creation of proteinoids= One of the first experiments by Dr. Fox and Kaoru Harada that had to do with the formation of proteinoids was called Thermal Copolymerization of Amino Acids to a Product Resembling Protein. It was performed in February 1958. The experiment began with L-glutamic acid heated in an oil bath. DL-aspartic acid and an amino acid mixture were added to the L-glutamic acid and heated for three hours in the oil bath under a layer of CO2. The solution was cooled and the glass container it was in was rubbed with 20 mL of water and sat overnight. The result was a grainy precipitate. The next day, 10 mL of water and 10 mL of ethanol were added to the precipitate and filtered. The solid left over from filtering was put in cellophane dialysis tubing and left in a water bath for four days. When the inside of the tubes were observed and chromatograms were taken, it showed the presence of polypeptide chains. Fox called these protein-like structures \\"proteinoids.\\" The polypeptide chains were composed of glutamic acid, aspartic acid, and amino acids and the percentages of each suggested that the arrangement of the constituents were non-random. The experiment was meant to resemble the drying-out of amino acids in similar conditions to those of primordial Earth. Extremely high temperatures, around 140-180 ¬∞C, are required to polymerize amino acids without a catalyst. Fox says in his publications that these temperatures could have been reached in three different scenarios on primordial Earth; hot springs, dried-up lagoons, and pressurized volcanic magma. The experiment did not prove that proteins were formed on primordial earth using primarily heat, but Fox and Kaoru Harada believed it suggested that if proteinoids could be synthesized using just heat and the amino acids formed from the Miller‚ÄìUrey experiment, then more research could lead to an answer to how anabolic reactions, enzymatic proteins, and nucleic acids were first formed and in turn, how the earliest forms of life originated. Fox noted that there were various ways of setting up the experiment. One could also replace L-glutamic acid with L-glutamine without preheating it in an oil bath and then add phosphoric acid. The phosphoric acid would act as a catalyst for the formation of peptide bonds. There are some that are skeptical of this type of experiment. These people believe that for the experiment to be plausible, prebiotic Earth would have needed high concentrations of the lysine, glutamic acid, and aspartic acid because they were at high concentrations in Fox's experiment. Some believe it is unlikely that primordial Earth had such a distribution of amino acids available on its surface. =The assembly of proteinoids into microspheres= Dr. Fox claims that the origin of the cell is a microsphere or protocell. Microspheres are made from the addition of water or salt solution to the appropriate proteinoids. To prepare microspheres, Fox added 10 mL of boiling salt solution to the hot proteinoids and stirred carefully. Then, he boiled the solution for thirty seconds, removed the solution from its vessel, and poured it into a cool vessel. When the solution was cooled, he observed the results under a microscope. One gram of protein polymer yields up to one billion microspheres with about ten billion molecules of proteinoid in each sphere. Fox says that the assembly of microspheres takes about twenty minutes and is more immediate and produces better microspheres if the water (or salt solution) is heated prior to mixing. Microspheres have multiple properties that are similar to those of cells. The microspheres produced were mostly uniformly spherical and Fox believed that the shape and uniformity mimics that of coccoid bacteria. He also believed that the uniformity meant that there was a sophisticated system that kept the microspheres at equilibrium. The microspheres were able to asexually divide via binary fission, could form junctions with other microspheres, and developed a double membrane corresponding to that of a cell.

The story was created by Herbert Wright and D. C. Fontana, and was made into a script in two days by executive producer Maurice Hurley. The episode was directed by Rob Bowman. Set in the 24th century, the series follows the adventures of the Starfleet crew of the Federation starship Enterprise-D. In this episode, the crew rescue three Klingons from a damaged freighter in the neutral zone. Once aboard they befriend Lt. Worf (Michael Dorn) and attempt to hijack the Enterprise so they can live as true Klingons, forcing Worf to choose between them or Starfleet. The episode explained the backstory to the character of Lt. Worf and Michael Dorn was pleased with the outcome. Rob Bowman thought that the episode worked well. He included an overhead shot on the engineering set which had not been done before on the show and tweaked the ending. Shots of the Klingon starship were reused from Star Trek: The Motion Picture, while the freighter model would be reused as various freighters throughout the various Star Trek television series. Guest stars included Vaughn Armstrong as Korris in his first role in the franchise and only appearance in The Next Generation. He appeared in a further eleven roles in the franchise, including the part of Admiral Maxwell Forrest in Star Trek: Enterprise. The episode was watched by 10.7 million viewers during the initial broadcast, and reviews by critics were mixed. Plot The Enterprise enters the neutral zone, to investigate the distress call of a Talarian freighter. The freighter is badly damaged, and three life forms are detected aboard. An away team beams over and finds three Klingons: Korris (Vaughn Armstrong); Konmel (Charles Hyman); and Kunivas (Robert Bauer), who is wounded. The away team returns with them to the Enterprise before the freighter explodes. Kunivas is taken to sickbay and Korris meets with Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart). The Klingon explains that they were passengers when the freighter was attacked by a Ferengi ship; the Klingons took over the freighter to fend off and destroy the Ferengi ship, but the damage sustained left the freighter adrift and faltering. As Korris and Konmel are shown to quarters, they are surprised to hear about a fellow Klingon, Lt. Worf (Michael Dorn), who is serving within Starfleet. Meanwhile, Kunivas' condition worsens; Korris, Konmel, and Worf are present when he dies. The three let out a fierce roar as per Klingon custom (a warning to the dead that a Klingon warrior is about to arrive). As they return to the Klingons' quarters, Konmel is disappointed that Kunivas was not killed by an enemy, leading Worf to question the nature of the attack on the freighter; Korris and Konmel quickly change the subject. Worf forces Korris to reveal the truth: the three had commandeered the freighter, in order to seek out a place they could live as true Klingons, and the damage to the freighter was a result of a battle with a Klingon ship. When the two are seen near the ship's battle bridge, hoping to steal the drive section and escape, they are placed in the brig. The Enterprise is soon met by a Klingon battlecruiser, captained by Commander K'Nera (David Froman), who demands the return of the fugitive Klingons. Knowing that Korris and Konmel will be tried and executed if they are returned, Worf argues instead for their exile to a hostile planet, but K'Nera refuses. Korris and Konmel use parts secreted on their uniforms to assemble a disruptor pistol and escape from the brig; Konmel is killed as Korris takes over the Engineering deck. Picard and Worf race to Engineering, and Worf tries to reason with Korris who is threatening to destroy the warp core and take the Enterprise with him. Korris attempts to persuade Worf to come with him and conquer the galaxy as a true Klingon, but Worf retorts that a true Klingon fights out of honor and loyalty, and that Korris has demonstrated neither. Korris is enraged, and Worf takes the opportunity to shoot him dead. K'Nera is told of the deaths of the fugitives, and Worf declares that they \\"died well\\" when asked of their manner of death. Worf agrees to consider an offer to serve aboard the Klingon battlecruiser after his service aboard the Enterprise is complete, but when communications with K'Nera are broken off, assures the bridge crew he was just being polite. Production \\"Heart of Glory\\" featured the first Star Trek role for actor Vaughn Armstrong. He appeared as eleven other characters throughout the franchise. Writer and executive producer Maurice Hurley thought that \\"Heart of Glory\\" was the closest experience he had on the show to directly place his own personal philosophy into a script. He later credited fellow executive producer Rick Berman with helping to write the script for \\"Heart of Glory\\", saying \\"When I had a problem, I could go in and we could sit there, close the door, yell and scream. I'd pace, he'd make suggestions. The two of us made stories work in that room that had to be shot within a couple of days. We were under enormous time pressure, and we were working hand in glove. We had a wonderful time, on that show, especially.\\" Hurley wrote the screenplay in two days from a story created by Herbert Wright and D. C. Fontana.Nemecek (2003): p. 52 Because of the delays, the Klingon language portions of the script didn't make any actual sense in translation and were simply Klingon sounding words created by Hurley. The story explained Lt. Worf's background for the first time in the series, including the story of Romulan betrayal at Khitomer which saw the death of his parents. While his foster parents were first mentioned in this episode, they were not seen until the fourth season episode \\"Family\\" and his stepbrother didn't appear on the show until the seventh season episode \\"Homeward\\". Michael Dorn was pleased with the outcome of this episode as he felt it showed the producers that the fans were just as interested in his character as the others in the main cast. He felt that it could have been taken further and wanted there to be an epic battle at the end of the episode.Gross; Altman (1993): p. 165 The Klingon battlecruiser seen in \\"Heart of Glory\\" was footage re-used from Star Trek: The Motion Picture, while the freighter was a general model which would come to be reused throughout The Next Generation and other Star Trek television series. The scene where Lieutenant Worf confronts Korris used camera angles not previously seen on the series.Director Rob Bowman made bold decisions in designing the confrontation sequence. The scripted version showed the fight between Worf and Korris taking place entirely on the first deck of the engineering section. Instead, Bowman had them fight on the upper deck and, using camera angles never before seen on the show, filmed vertical sequences in that part of the set. He also altered the script so that Konmel needed to be hit by three phaser blasts. Bowman used a steadicam to film the scenes on the freighter in order to give a rough effect to the footage.Nemecek (2003): p. 53 He was pleased with the outcome, describing it as the easiest of all of the Next Generation episodes he directed. He said that it was a show where \\"every hand we had was a 21. It just worked.\\" Guest stars in this episode included Robert Bauer, who had previously been in a band with Michael Dorn, as Kunivas. Stuntman Dennis Madalone made his second appearance in The Next Generation with this episode, having previously appeared earlier in the season in \\"Where No One Has Gone Before\\". He would continue to appear as various crewmen through the rest of the series. \\"Heart of Glory\\" was the only appearance in The Next Generation for actor Vaughn Armstrong. He would, however, go on to play a further eleven different roles in the Star Trek franchise, including as the recurring character of Admiral Maxwell Forrest in Star Trek: Enterprise. Reception \\"Heart of Glory\\" was first broadcast in the United States on March 21, 1988, in broadcast syndication. The episode received Nielsen ratings of 10.7 million on the first broadcast, which was an increase over the 10.1 million received by the previous episode, \\"Coming of Age\\". Only the episode \\"Symbiosis\\" received a higher rating by the end of the season. =Critical response= Several reviewers re-watched the episode after the end of the series. Keith DeCandido reviewed the episode for Tor.com in July 2011. DeCandido is a novelist and has produced works based in the Star Trek universe, and describes himself as \\"the Klingon guy\\" as far as Star Trek novelists are concerned. However, he was not overly pleased with the episode, describing the plot as being slow and saying that Michael Dorn's acting skills at this point were \\"mediocre\\" but would get \\"much much better\\" later in the series. He praised David Froman as K'Nera, describing him as having \\"tremendous presence\\" and thought that although Vaughn Armstrong was excellent as Admiral Forrest in Enterprise, in this early episode he was \\"overly histrionic\\". He described the overhead shot of Worf after the death of Korris as \\"just silly\\", and thought that the episode overall was a \\"forgettable mess\\". He gave it a rating of four out of ten. Zack Handlen, writing for The A.V. Club in May 2010, thought that the first act of \\"Heart of Glory\\" was slow, but it improved after that and said that \\"while it's not exactly a tear-jerker, it allows Worf the dignity the character needs to work.\\" He had mixed feelings about the Klingon death ritual, but felt that it was justified at the end of the episode as the complex nature of the character of Korris made the sense of loss feel earned. He gave the episode a grade of B+. Michelle Erica Green watched the episode for TrekNation in August 2007, and described it as one of her favourite episodes from the first season. She thought it laid the groundwork for later episodes in The Next Generation, Deep Space Nine, and Voyager regarding the Klingon culture. However, she felt that the drama seemed artificial and that the writers forced a situation where Worf had to kill one of the Klingons as if \\"justifying the brutality as necessary for the good of Starfleet\\". Jamahl Epsicokhan at his website \\"Jammer's Reviews\\" also thought that the drama with Worf deciding whether or not to join the Klingons was problematic. He thought it was hard to believe that the crew seemed to know Worf as little as they did at this point in the series, but praised it for being the starting point for all future Klingon-based stories in the franchise. He gave it a score of three out of four. Home media release The first home media release of \\"Heart of Glory\\" was on VHS cassette, appearing on November 11, 1992 in the United States and Canada. The episode was later included on the Star Trek: The Next Generation season one DVD box set, released in March 2002. The most recent release was as part of the season one Blu-ray set on July 24, 2012.

According to mysterious papers found on the body of the raid's commanding officer, Colonel Ulric Dahlgren, one of their mission objectives was to assassinate Confederate President Jefferson Davis and his cabinet. History Ulric Dahlgren was killed outside Richmond, near the King & Queen County Court House, on March 2 during a bungled raid on the Confederate capital, ostensibly to free Union prisoners (see Battle of Walkerton). Late that evening, thirteen-year-old William Littlepage discovered Dahlgren's body and searched its pockets for a pocketwatch. Instead, he found a pocketbook and two folded papers, which he promptly turned over to his teacher, Edward W. Halbach, a captain in the Confederate Virginia Home Guard. Halbach examined the papers the next morning and discovered that they contained signed orders on Union army stationery for a plot to assassinate Davis. According to other sources, such as Alexandria Gazette, October 16, 1865, it was Major Heros von Borcke who led the party which killed Ulric Dahlgren and who searched the body and found the papers, and his lieutenant handed them to Fitzhugh Lee. The names 'Halbach' or 'Littlepage' are not to be found in any relation to Dahlgren's death in the Library of Congress's newspaper collection for the years 1864 following. According to one of the papers: > The men must keep together and well in hand, and once in the city it must be > destroyed and Jeff. Davis and Cabinet killed.Text of the Dahlgren Papers Halbach immediately contacted his commander, Captain Richard H. Bagby, and informed him of the discovery. At 2 p.m. on March 3, Bagby transferred the papers to Lieutenant James Pollard with instructions to deliver them to his commander Col. Richard L. T. Beale. Beale instructed that they be delivered to the Confederate command in Richmond immediately. Pollard arrived in Richmond at noon on March 4 and delivered the papers to General Fitzhugh Lee. Lee, astonished at their contents, immediately took the papers to Davis and Secretary of State Judah P. Benjamin. Davis quietly read through the documents in Lee's presence and paused when he reached the assassination order, he remarked, \\"That means you, Mr. Benjamin.\\" Lee was then instructed to take the papers to the War Department, where they were received by Secretary of War James A. Seddon. Seddon decided to release the documents publicly and sought Davis's approval to do so. The Richmond newspapers were contacted for a conference at the War Department and given copies of the orders, which were published the next morning on March 5. In coming months, the papers were widely circulated in the Confederacy and in Europe as evidence of Union barbarism. Dahlgren was likened to Attila the Hun, and several Union leaders were accused of participation in the plot, including US President Abraham Lincoln. In the United States, the papers were denounced as a forgery designed to weaken the Union's war effort. Possible forgeries Many historians, such as Duane Schultz in The Dahlgren Affair: Terror and Conspiracy in the Civil War, agreed that the papers were forged and intended to justify the numerous plots by the Confederate Secret Service to kidnap Lincoln or to blow up the White House. However, a new handwriting study performed on the papers by the Smithsonian Channel seems to confirm that the documents are authentic.

Life On January 8, 1854, Yan Fu was born in what is modern day Fuzhou, Fujian Province to a respectable scholar-gentry family in the trade of Chinese medicine. In his early years, Yan Fu‚Äôs father greatly encouraged Yan Fu to obtain a high education and prepare for the Imperial examination. However, the death of his father in 1866 caused an abrupt change to these plans. A year later, Yan Fu entered the Fujian Arsenal Academy () in Fuzhou, a Western school where he studied a variety of subjects including English, arithmetic, geometry, algebra, trigonometry, physics, chemistry, astrology and navigation. This was a turning point in young Yan Fu‚Äôs life as he was able to experience first-hand contact with Western science, thus inspiring the enthusiasm that carried him through the rest of his career. After graduating with high honors in 1871, Yan Fu went on to spend the next five years at sea. He first served aboard the training ship Jianwei () and later on the battle cruiser Yangwu (). In 1877‚Äì79 he studied at the Royal Naval College, Greenwich, England. During his years there, he became acquainted with China‚Äôs first ambassador Guo Songtao, and despite their age difference and status gap developed a strong friendship. Benjamin Schwartz mentions in his biography that \\"they often spent whole days and nights discussing differences and similarities in Chinese and Western thought and political institutions\\".Benjamin I. Schwartz (1964). In Search of Wealth and Power: Yen Fu and the West. Cambridge: Belknap Press of Harvard University Press. Pg 29 His return to China, however, did not bring him the immediate success he was hoping for. Though he was unable to pass the Imperial Civil Service Examination, he was able to obtain a teaching position at the Fujian Arsenal Academy and then Beiyang Naval Officers' School () at Tianjin. During this time, Yan Fu succumbed to the opium addiction that had sprung up in China.Benjamin I. Schwartz (1964). In Search of Wealth and Power: Yen Fu and the West. Cambridge: Belknap Press of Harvard University Press. Pg 32 It was not until after the Chinese defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894‚Äì95, fought for control of Korea) that Yan Fu became famous. He is celebrated for his translations, including Thomas Huxley's Evolution and Ethics, Adam Smith's The Wealth of Nations, John Stuart Mill's On Liberty and Herbert Spencer's Study of Sociology.Yan Fu. Britannica.com. Yan critiqued the ideas of Darwin and others, offering his own interpretations. The ideas of \\"natural selection\\" and \\"survival of the fittest\\" were introduced to Chinese readers through Huxley's work. The former idea was famously rendered by Yan Fu into Chinese as tiƒÅnz√© (). Yan Fu served as an editor of the newspaper Guowen Bao.Hegel, Robert E. \\"The Chinese Novel at the Turn of the Century\\" (book review). Chinese Literature: Essays, Articles, Reviews (CLEAR), , 07/1983, Volume 5, Issue 1/2, pp. 188‚Äì191 - Cited p. 189. He became politically active, and in 1895, he was involved in the Gongche Shangshu movement, which opposed the Treaty of Shimonoseki ending the First Sino-Japanese War. In 1909 he was given an honorary Jinshi degree. In 1912 he became the first principal of National Peking University (now Peking University). Today the university holds an annual academic conference in his honor.First Yan FU Academic Forum held at PKU. Peking University. He became a royalist and conservative who supported Yuan Shikai () and Zhang Xun () to proclaim themselves emperor in his later life. He also participated the foundation of Chouanhui (), an organization which supported restoring monarchy. He laughed at \\"New Literature Revolutionaries\\" such as Hu Shih (). On October 27, 1921, after returning to his home in Fuzhou only a year earlier to recuperate from his recurring asthma, Yan Fu died at the age of 67. Translation theory Statue of Yan Fu at Tianjin Yan stated in the preface to his translation of Evolution and Ethics () that \\"there are three difficulties in translation: faithfulness, expressiveness, and elegance\\" (). He did not set them as general standards for translation and did not say that they were independent of each other. However, since the publication of that work, the phrase \\"faithfulness, expressiveness, and elegance\\" has been attributed to Yan Fu as a standard for any good translation and has become a clich√© in Chinese academic circles, giving rise to numerous debates and theses. Some scholars argue that this dictum actually derived from Scottish theoretician of translation, Alexander Fraser Tytler. Though Yan Fu's classical prose did its best to meet the standards of \\"faithfulness, expressiveness, and elegance\\", there were those who criticized his works for not being accessible to the younger generations. In particular, a famous liberal from the May Fourth Movement, Cai Yuanpei, stated in an article written in 1924: \\"...[Yan Fu's translations]...seem to be old- fashioned and his literary style is difficult to comprehend, but the standard with which he selected books and the way he translated them are very admirable even today\\".Huang, Ko-wu (2003). \\"The Reception of Yan Fu in the Twentieth- Century China.\\" University Press of America. 25-44 Other critiques of his work arose as Chinese scholars became more aware of Western learning. Translated works Yan Fu's translation of Evolution and Ethics Yan Fu was one of the most influential scholars of his generation as he worked to introduce Western social, economic and political ideas to China. Previous translation efforts had been focused mainly on religion and technology. Yan Fu was also one of the first scholars to have personal experiences in Western culture, whereas many prior scholars were students in Japan who then translated Western works from Japanese to Chinese. Yan Fu also played an important role in the standardization of science terminology in China during his time serving as the Head of the State Terminology Bureau. In 1895 he published Zhibao , a Chinese newspaper founded in Tianjin by the German Constantin von Hannecken (1854-1925), which contains several of his most famous essays: *Lun shi bian zhi ji (On the Speed of World Change) *Yuan qiang (On the Origin of Strength) *Pi Han (In Refutation of Han Yu) *Jiuwang jue lun (On our Salvation) Later, from 1898 to 1909, Yan Fu went on to translate the following major works of Western liberal thought: *Evolution and Ethics Thomas Henry Huxley as Tianyan lun (On Evolution) 1896-1898 *The Wealth of Nations by Adam Smith as Yuan fu (On Wealth) 1901 *The Study of Sociology by Herbert Spencer as Qunxue yiyan (A Study of Sociology) 1903 *On Liberty by John Stuart Mill as Qunji quanjie lun (On the Boundary between the Self and the Group) 1903 *A System of Logic by John Stuart Mill as Mule mingxue (Mill‚Äôs Logic) 1903 *A History of Politics by Edward Jenks as Shehui tongquan (A Full Account of Society) 1903 *The Spirit of the Laws by Montesquieu as Fayi (The Meaning of the Laws) 1904-1909 *Primer of Logic by William Stanley Jevons as Mingxue qianshuo (An Outline of Logic) 1909 See also *Translation References *Benjamin I.

The hospital is the main General Hospital for the southern part of the island. The hospital can perform most surgeries, and specialized care includes the areas of: gynaecology, paediatrics, obstetrics, cardiac surgery, plastic surgery, psychotherapy, radiology, radiography and ophthalmology. The Q.E.H. boasts also having a series of operating theaters. The Q.E.H. is a 600-bed complex lying in the Eastern section of Bridgetown, located on the southeast bank of the Constitution River. The current hospital building was constructed in 1963‚Äì1964, and officially opened on 14 November 1964. In December 2004, the Barbados Ministry of Health disclosed that based on foreign-investment into the country, there is a future possibility that genetic re-constructive surgery may be performed at the Q.E.H. The Accident and Emergency Department, formerly known as QEH Casualty, was transformed in 1990 into the new A&E; Department. The department was pioneered by Dr Irvine Brancker and Dr Van Tyne. It opened with a team of initially 12 junior doctors and 2 consultants. Presently, there are 20 doctors in the department. As the busiest department in the hospital, they attend to approximately 45,000 patients each year. Offering patient care on par with some first world countries, Dr Chaynie Williams, the first female head of the department, applauds the skill set of her staff and also notes that the A&E; improvement programme has put measures in place to make the visit to A&E; a more comfortable one, including the addition of patient advocates, a redesign of the physical space, improvements to staffing complements, improved outreach and efficiencies plus a concerted, ongoing effort to reduce waiting times. In 2006 it was stated that the Government of Barbados was spending $112 million (US$56 million) annually running the hospital. 200x200px In 2008 the former Minister of Health Dr. Jerome Walcott said that the current hospital which is over 40 years old should be replaced by a new state of the art hospital complex. He classified it as nonsensical to spend over $400 million (US$200 million) on an extension of the current facility saying that it may cost upwards of $600 million (US$300 million) in the end. He went on to suggest the current QEH might be better off turned into a nursing home.

The GDRTA serves communities within Montgomery County and parts of Greene County, Ohio, USA. There are 31 routes. RTA operates diesel and electric trolley buses seven days a week, 21 hours a day, and provides services to many citizens within the area. RTA's current executive director is Mark Donaghy. Greater Dayton RTA is Ohio‚Äôs fourth-largest public transit system, serving Dayton and 23 surrounding communities in Montgomery County and parts of Greene County. RTA provides more than 11 million passenger trips per year on its buses. History Former GDRTA Logo The Miami Valley Regional Transit Authority (now the Greater Dayton Regional Transit Authority, or RTA) took over public transit operations in November 1972. In 2003, its Board of Trustees voted to change the transit agency's name to the Greater Dayton Regional Transit Authority. =Trolley buses= ETI trolley buses, in 2016 One notable feature of the GDRTA system is its use of electric trolley buses. Only five cities in the United States currently have electric trolley buses: Boston, Dayton, Philadelphia, San Francisco and Seattle. The first electric trolley bus (ETB) operation in Ohio occurred in Dayton, on April 23, 1933, when the Linden‚ÄìSalem line was converted from streetcars to trackless trolleys -- or trolley buses, as they are most commonly known today. The RTA renewed its commitment to electric transit with a Board of Trustees vote to continue the trolley bus service in 1991, and the purchase of a new fleet of ETBs from Electric Transit, Inc., a joint venture of the Czech company Skoda and the U.S. company AAI Corporation, based on Skoda's model 14Tr. Final assembly of the vehicles took place in Dayton in 1995‚Äì98. In 2014, the system added its first low-floor trolley buses, with four dual-mode prototypes purchased from Vossloh Kiepe (now Kiepe Electric) and using bodies from Gillig, for testing and evaluation. In January 2018, RTA placed an order with Kiepe for 26 production-series dual-mode trolley buses to the same design as the prototypes, with Gillig low-floor bodies, for delivery starting in 2019.Trolleybus Magazine No. 339 (May‚ÄìJune 2018), p. 117. . Electric streetcar service in Dayton had started in 1888, and it continued through to, and indeed beyond, the start of trolley bus service. Therefore, electric transit service has been operated continuously in Dayton since 1888, which is longer than in any other city in the United States. Hybrid buses hybrid buses leaving the downtown transit center, known as Wright Stop Plaza With the addition of environmentally friendly hybrid buses in 2010 to the GDRTA's fleet, the GDRTA is Ohio's greenest transit fleet. In September 2010 RTA was designated the only 5-star Ohio Green Fleet by Clean Fuels Ohio. Hubs Wright Stop Plaza Transit Center, viewed from across Main Street in 2010 The RTA operates five bus \\"hubs\\", or transit centers. Each hub serves as a connection to many suburban bus routes around Dayton. The one in downtown Dayton is named Wright Stop Plaza and opened for service on September 1, 2009 (after a ceremonial opening earlier).Trolleybus Magazine No. 288 (November‚ÄìDecember 2009), p. 144. . Operation The RTA operates with diesel and electric trolley buses. Dayton is the smallest city in the United States to still operate electric trolley buses. The trolley buses travel at least five miles on RTA routes serving Dayton and some neighboring suburbs. The routes include: Route 1, Route 2, Route 3, Route 4, Route 5, Route 7 and Route 8. Bus service to Dayton International Airport from downtown Dayton began on 11 August 2013. Service was expanded to stops on Pentagon Boulevard in Beavercreek, allowing access to the Fairfield Commons Mall and Soin Medical Center, on January 12, 2014. Contributions The RTA has been involved in helping the city of Dayton through its contributions to the Dayton Dragons, The Schuster Center, and the Dayton Aviation Heritage National Historical Park. In addition, RTA passed a resolution to make easier connections to its regional hubs and prevent misuse of transfers. In January 2007, RTA created an established proposal to make all buses serve regional businesses, establish transfer points in designated areas and streamline previously neighborhood routes. The RTA added two routes to serve areas frequently used by passengers. RTA discontinued eight routes in response to overlapping and low passenger counts.

Insect repellents help prevent and control the outbreak of insect-borne (and other arthropod-bourne) diseases such as malaria, Lyme disease, dengue fever, bubonic plague, river blindness and West Nile fever. Pest animals commonly serving as vectors for disease include insects such as flea, fly, and mosquito; and the arachnid tick . Some insect repellents are insecticides (bug killers), but most simply discourage insects and send them flying or crawling away. Almost any might kill at a massive dose without reprieve, but classification as an insecticide implies death even at lower doses.  Effectiveness  Synthetic repellents tend to be more effective and/or longer lasting than \\"natural\\" repellents. For protection against mosquito bites, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommends DEET, picaridin (icaridin, KBR 3023), oil of lemon eucalyptus (para-menthane-diol or PMD), ethyl butylacetylaminopropionate and 2-undecanone with the caveat that higher percentages of the active ingredient provide longer protection. In 2015, Researchers at New Mexico State University tested 10 commercially available products for their effectiveness at repelling mosquitoes. On the mosquito Aedes aegypti, the vector of Zika virus, only one repellent that did not contain DEET had a strong effect for the duration of the 240 minutes test: a lemon eucalyptus oil repellent. All DEET-containing mosquito repellents were active. In one comparative study from 2004, ethyl butylacetylaminopropionate was as effective or better than DEET in protection against Aedes aegypti and Culex quinquefasciatus mosquitoes. Other sources (official publications of the associations of German physicians as well as of German druggists) suggest the contrary and state DEET is still the most efficient substance available and the substance of choice for stays in malaria regions, while ethyl butylacetylaminopropionate has little effect. However, some plant-based repellents may provide effective relief as well. Essential oil repellents can be short-lived in their effectiveness, since essential oils can evaporate completely. A test of various insect repellents by an independent consumer organization found that repellents containing DEET or picaridin are more effective than repellents with \\"natural\\" active ingredients. All the synthetics gave almost 100% repellency for the first 2 hours, where the natural repellent products were most effective for the first 30 to 60 minutes, and required reapplication to be effective over several hours.\\"Test: Mosquito Repellents, The Verdict\\" Choice, The Australian Consumers Association Although highly toxic to cats, permethrin is recommended as protection against mosquitoes for clothing, gear, or bed nets.\\"Protection against Mosquitoes, Ticks, & Other Arthropods\\", U.S. Centers for Disease Control In an earlier report, the CDC found oil of lemon eucalyptus to be more effective than other plant-based treatments, with a similar effectiveness to low concentrations of DEET. However, a 2006 published study found in both cage and field studies that a product containing 40% oil of lemon eucalyptus was just as effective as products containing high concentrations of DEET.Carroll SP, Loye J, 2006, Journal of the American Mosquito Control Association 22(3):507-514, 510 Research has also found that neem oil is mosquito repellent for up to 12 hours.

There are also products available based on sound production, particularly ultrasound (inaudibly high frequency sounds) which purport to be insect repellents. However, these electronic devices have been shown to be ineffective based on studies done by the United States Environmental Protection Agency and many universities.  Safety For humans= DEET Icaridin p-Menthane-3,8-diol (PMD) Children may be at greater risk for adverse reactions to repellents, in part, because their exposure may be greater. Children can be at greater risk of accidental eye contact or ingestion. As with chemical exposures in general, pregnant women should take care to avoid exposures to repellents when practical, as the fetus may be vulnerable. Some experts also recommend against applying chemicals such as DEET and sunscreen simultaneously since that would increase DEET penetration. Canadian researcher, Xiaochen Gu, a professor at the University of Manitoba‚Äôs faculty of Pharmacy who led a study about mosquitos, advises that DEET should be applied 30 or more minutes later. Gu also recommends insect repellent sprays instead of lotions which are rubbed into the skin \\"forcing molecules into the skin\\". Regardless of which repellent product used, it is recommended to read the label before use and carefully follow directions. Usage instructions for repellents vary from country to country. Some insect repellents are not recommended for use on younger children. In the DEET Reregistration Eligibility Decision (RED) the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reported 14 to 46 cases of potential DEET associated seizures, including 4 deaths. The EPA states: \\"... it does appear that some cases are likely related to DEET toxicity,\\" but observed that with 30% of the US population using DEET, the likely seizure rate is only about one per 100 million users.\\"Reregistration Eligibility Decision: DEET.\\" U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Prevention, Pesticides, and Toxic Substances. September 1998. pp39-40 The Pesticide Information Project of Cooperative Extension Offices of Cornell University states that, \\"Everglades National Park employees having extensive DEET exposure were more likely to have insomnia, mood disturbances and impaired cognitive function than were lesser exposed co-workers\\".Deet The EPA states that citronella oil shows little or no toxicity and has been used as a topical insect repellent for 60 years. However, the EPA also states that citronella may irritate skin and cause dermatitis in certain individuals. Canadian regulatory authorities concern with citronella based repellents is primarily based on data-gaps in toxicology, not on incidents. \\"So Then: Who‚Äôs Afraid of Citronella Oil? Update!\\" Cropwatch Newsletter Vol 2, Issue 1, No. 1 Within countries of the European Union, implementation of Regulation 98/8/EC, commonly referred to as the Biocidal Products Directive, has severely limited the number and type of insect repellents available to European consumers. Only a small number of active ingredients have been supported by manufacturers in submitting dossiers to the EU Authorities. In general, only formulations containing DEET, icaridin (sold under the trade name Saltidin and formerly known as Bayrepel or KBR3023), ethyl butylacetylaminopropionate (IR3535) and citriodiol (p-menthane-3,8-diol) are available. Most \\"natural\\" insect repellents such as citronella, neem oil, and herbal extracts are no longer permitted for sale as insect repellents in the EU due to their lack of effectiveness; this does not preclude them from being sold for other purposes, as long as the label does not indicate they are a biocide (insect repellent). = For other animals = A 2018 study found that Icaridin, in what the authors described as conservative exposure doses, is highly toxic to salamander larvae.

The Riel family moved back to Lower Canada while Louis was a child. He was educated in Quebec, learning the trade of carding wool. He joined the fur trade with the Hudson's Bay Company in 1838 and was stationed at Rainy River, Ontario, where he fathered a daughter named Marguerite in 1840. He left the HBC in 1842 and returned to Quebec with the intention of joining the priesthood at the Oblates of Mary Immaculate at Saint-Hilaire, but withdrew a year later.Goldsborough. \\"Memorable Manitobans: Louis Riel Sr. (1817-1864)\\", Manitoba Historical society He returned to the Canadian West, settling in the Red River Colony on a river lot in Saint-Boniface (now a district of modern Winnipeg, Manitoba).

In 1847, he opened a small mill on his farm with the support of chief factor John Ballenden with the hope of establishing a fulling mill operation in the settlement. But Riel had little success with his fulling mill. He also attempted to open and operate a carding and grist mill to grind grain and card wool for the Grey Nuns of St. Boniface,\\"Grey Nuns\\", Canadian Encyclopedia hence his title of \\"miller of the Seine\\", but to little success. Finally, in 1857, Riel attempted to establish a textile industry in the settlement, but the venture failed. Although he was not a successful businessman, he showed great leadership within the M√©tis community. Louis Riel Sr. was an active participant in the Red River M√©tis community. Riel emerged as a M√©tis leader in the defence of Guillaume Sayer in his trial in May 1849. This trial was a defining moment in the fall of the Hudson's Bay Company's monopoly of the fur trade. Riel continued to fight for the rights of the M√©tis and was instrumental in them gaining representation on the Council of Assiniboia and for French to be used in the Assiniboia courts as well as English.

It was located at the intersection of Shiloh Springs Road and Salem Avenue, in the northwest Dayton suburb of Trotwood, Ohio. The mall was built on the site of the former Roscoe Filburn farm; Filburn was a party in the famous Wickard v. Filburn case dealing with the growing of wheat and its effect on interstate commerce. The Rouse Company opened the mall in October 1966. In its early stages it had 60 retailers; the original mall was anchored by Rike's and Sears department stores. There was also a Liberal supermarket, a smaller department store called The Metropolitan, and a multi- screen cinema. A large-scale renovation was completed in 1981 with the construction of a two-story concourse capped by a new JCPenney anchor store (relocated from the nearby Forest Park Plaza). The supermarket, which was closed by 1979, had its space subdivided into inline stores. While the expansion included a food court, it was pretty much an afterthought and had limited seating. So when The Metropolitan closed in the mid-1980s, its space was extensively reworked to form a much larger food court adjacent to the center court. The mall, which by that time featured over 110 retailers, was prosperous throughout the remainder of the 1980s. By the mid-1980s poor mall management affected the mall's ability to attract new tenants, renew existing leases, and most importantly, attract serious shoppers. By the mid- to late-1990s, the mall was well on its way to becoming a so-called \\"dead mall\\". In spring 1998, Rouse sold its interest in the mall to its financial partner, Cigna. Cigna in turn hired General Growth Properties (GGP) to manage the mall. In the same year, anchor store Lazarus (formerly Rike's) left the mall, and later that year JCPenney also closed. The Loews Cinema and many of the mall's restaurants also went out of business, leaving Sears and a newly built Home Depot (in a separate building) as the only anchors. The mall closed permanently in early 2005. Demolition of the mall began on May 15, 2006, but the Sears building was retained, with Sears becoming a freestanding store. The city of Trotwood purchased the mall site, with the exception of Sears and Home Depot, in 2004, and began working with GGP to redevelop the area as the Landmark Town Center, an upscale, open-air, \\"lifestyle\\" complex, intended to resemble the Easton Town Center in Columbus. The new center suffered delays, with GGP leaving the project in 2007, and its completion date was repeatedly extended. By 2010/2011, Trotwood had reenvisioned the mall site as the TechConnection Business Park, a mixed-use technology campus. As of October 2013, no physical progress had been made on the business park. After an October 2013 announcement, Sears closed in January 2014, with no word on the fate of its former building. In June 2018, Trotwood received a $200,0000 federal grant, which together with $200.000 of the city's own funds, will be used to demolish the Sears building and clean up the former mall site for future expected mixed-use development. The cleanup is expected to take at least a year. In 2019, the city became involved in a bidding war for the old Sears building, which was placed up for auction by a bankruptcy court. Having made an initial offer of $70,000, they were outbid by an investor, but ultimately purchased the property for $225,000 in the second round of bidding.

More recently, aluminium yarns, aluminized plastic yarns, and aluminized nylon yarns have replaced gold and silver.

History Gold and silver have been used since ancient times as decoration in the clothing and textiles of kings, leaders, nobility and people of status. Many of these elegant textiles can be found in museums around the world. Historically, the metallic thread was constructed by wrapping a metal strip around a fiber core (cotton or silk), often in such a way as to reveal the color of the fiber core to enhance visual quality of the decoration.Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History Ancient textiles and clothing woven from wholly or partly gold threads is sometimes referred to as cloth of gold. They have been woven on Byzantine looms from the 7th to 9th Centuries, and after that in Sicily, Cyprus, Lucca, and Venice. Weaving also flourished in the 12th Century during the legacy of Genghis Khan when art and trade flourished under Mongol rule in China and some Middle Eastern areas.Kim, Caroline \\"Humanities\\" The Treasures of Genghis Khan: Sept - Oct 2002 Vol. 23 #5 The Dobeckmum Company produced the first modern metallic fiber in 1946. During the early 1960s, Brunswick Corp. conducted a research program to develop an economically viable process for forming metallic filaments. They started producing metallic filaments in a laboratory- scale pilot plant. By 1964 Brunswick was producing fine metal fibers as small as 1 Œºm from 304 type stainless steel. Their first large scale production facility, located in the USA, was brought on stream in 1966. Metal fibers are now widely produced and used in all kinds of technology. With a wide range of applications, it is a mature sector. In the past, aluminium was often the base in a metallic fiber. More recently stainless steel has become the dominant metal for metallic fibers. Depending on the alloy, the metallic fibers provide properties to the yarn which allow the use in more high tech\\"An Overview of Metal Fiber Applications\\" - White paper - J.De Baerdemaeker, J.Vleurinck - https://www.bekaert.com/en/product-catalog/content/Metal-fibers/replacement- of-glass-fiber-media-by-metal-fiber-media applications . Fiber properties Machined fibers in various metals and alloysMetal fibers exists in different forms and diameters. Generally, the sector offers metal fiber diameters from 100Œºm down to 1Œºm. Metallic fibers exists in both long, continuous fibers as well as short fibers (with a length/diameter ratio of less than 100). Compared to other fiber types, like carbon, glass, aramid or natural fibers, metal fibers have a low electrical resistance. This makes them suitable for any application that requires electrical conductivity. Their excellent thermal resistance makes them withstand extreme temperatures. Corrosion resistance is achieved through the use of high-quality alloys in stainless steels or other metals. Other advantageous mechanical properties of metal fibers include high failure strain, ductility, shock resistance, fire resistance and sound insulation. Sintered metal fiber structures and products display high porosity properties, while remaining structurally strong and durable. This benefits the function and structure of specific applications like filtration or electrodes. Coated metallic filaments helps to minimize tarnishing. When suitable adhesives and films are used, they are not affected by salt water, chlorinated water in swimming pools or climatic conditions. If possible anything made with metallic fibers should be dry-cleaned, if there is no care label. Ironing can be problematic because the heat from the iron, especially at high temperatures, can melt the fibers. Production method There are several processes which can be used for manufacturing metallic fibers. The most common technology is known as bundle drawing. Several thousands of filaments are bundled together in a so-called composite wire, a tube which is drawn through a die to further reduce its diameter. The covering tube is later dissolved in acid, resulting in individual continuous metal fibers. This composite wire is drawn further until the desired diameter of the individual filaments within the bundle is obtained. Bundle drawing technology allows for the production of continuous metal fiber bundles with lengths of up to several kilometers. Due to the nature of the process, the cross-section of the fibers is octagonal. In order to achieve high-quality fibers, this technology can be fine-tuned, resulting in uniform, very thin fibers with a very narrow equivalent diameter spread. Special developments within the last couple of years have allowed this technology to be used for the production of fibers with diameters as small as 200 nm and below. In the laminating process, one seals a layer of aluminium between two layers of acetate or polyester film. These fibers are then cut into lengthwise strips for yarns and wound onto bobbins. The metal can be colored and sealed in a clear film, the adhesive can be colored, or the film can be colored before laminating. There are many different variations of color and effect that can be made in metallic fibers, producing a wide range of looks. With foil-shaving technology, fibers with diameters down to 14 Œºm and a more rectangular crosssection are feasible. This produces semicontinuous bundles of fibers or staple fibers. Machining of staple fibers can produce semicontinuous bundles of fibers down to 10 Œºm. Improving staple fiber manufacturing allows a narrow diameter spread on these kinds of fibers as well as tuning of the geometry of the fiber. This technology is unique compared to foil shaving or fibers from melt spinning, due to the small diameters that can be reached and the relatively small diameter spread Metallic fibers can also be made by using the metalizing process. This process involves heating the metal until it vaporizes then depositing it at a high pressure onto the polyester film . This process produces thinner, more flexible, more durable, and more comfortable fibers.Kadolph, Sara J. and Langford, Anna L. \\"Textiles Ninth Edition\\" pg. 129-130. Metal fiber may also be shaved from wire (steel wool), cast from molten metal, or grown around a seed (often carbon).  Types of metallic fiber products  Sintered metal fibers Sintered media metal fibers are converted into fiber media either as non-woven fleece or sintered structures composed of fibers ranging from 1.5 to 80 Œºm in diameter. These porous metal fiber media have been used for their uniqueness in highly demanding applications. The benefit of having the combination of an outstanding permeable material (porosities up to 90% for sintered and up to 99% for non-woven structures) combined with high corrosion and temperature resistance is highly valued. The sintered porous structure has no binder as the individual fibers are strongly bonded together by inter-metallic diffusion bonding. 3D sintered structures have also become a standard product. Some of the latest developments are relate to filtration media using a combination of metallic and non-metallic fibers, allowing the best of both worlds. Short metal fibersShort fibers A specially designed process allows the production of individual powder-like metal fibers known as short fibers with a length over diameter (L/D) range of 100. These short fibers can be used as such or in combination with metal powders to produce sintered filtration structures with ultra-high levels of filtration while allowing unique levels of permeability. Metal fibers in polymer pellets, ready for injection moulding Polymer pellets Other metal fiber products are polymer pellets or grains composed out of metal fibers. Several bundles of fibers are glued together with a variety of sizings and an adequate compatible extrusion coating is applied. After chopping these coated bundles into pellets they can be used as additives in the production of engineered conductive/ shielding plastic pieces by injection molding and extrusion. The unique benefit of metal fibers is the conductive network formation with a relatively limited volume of conductive additives. alt= Non- wovens Non-wovens or felts can be produced with metal fibers, just like with traditional textile fibers. In a very limited number of cases, needle punching can be applied to entangle the fibers and obtain needle-punched felt. left Yarns A bundle of endless stainless steel fibers can be converted to yarns by textile spinning processes. There are two forms of yarn: one with a low amount of fibers and one with a high amount of fibers. The former, with a number of filaments of around 275, can be converted into a filament yarn by adding twist to the bundle. Bundles with several thousands of fibers are typically used to convert fibers into spun yarn. That can be done by stretch breaking and subsequent traditional yarn spinning technologies. This results in 100% metal yarns. During the spinning process, tows can be blended and blended yarns can also be produced. Blends with cotton, polyester and wool are possible. Subsequently, metal yarns can be further converted into various textile products using textile processes. Knitting (circular, flat, warp) and weaving are possible, as well as braiding. Blended textile products can be obtained by combining metal yarns with other yarns, or by using yarns that have two kinds of fibers inside and hence are already blends by themselves. alt= Electrical cables To make cables, two or more filaments are twisted together a number of times. During the process, a cable's torsion and straightness are monitored. The cable can be fine-tuned for a certain application by combining different filament strengths, diameters or the number of twists, or by preforming. leftFiber Reinforced Composites Metal fiber can be used as reinforcement fiber for composite materials, improving breaking behavior upon impact and electrical conductivity. Traditional carbon or glass fiber reinforcement fibers have very limited elongation possibilities, which results in a brittle and explosive breaking behavior. Metal fibers act perfectly complementary to this, and can absorb much more energy before breaking. Processing is no different from any other reinforcement fiber for composite material. It is even possible to combine metal fibers with other fibers into a 'hybrid' composite structure, which combines all the benefits of carbon, glass and steel. Producers Currently metallic fibers are manufactured primarily in Europe. The largest and most integrated metal fiber producer worldwide is the multinational company Bekaert, headquartered in Belgium, but with manufacturing footprint in Europe, Asia and the Americas. Three manufacturers are still producing metallic yarn in the United States. Metlon Corporation is one of the remaining manufacturers in the U.S. that stocks a wide variety of laminated and non-laminated metallic yarns & Brightex Corporation, Japan and South Korea, such as Hwa Young, is also manufacturing Metallic fibers. China also produces metallic yarns; the city Dongyang contains more than 100 factories, though some of these are home based production sites rather than conventional factories. Two of the more popular factories are Salu Metallic Yarn and Aoqi Textile. Trademarks Metallic yarnBekaert manufactures metal fibers and many derived products such as continuous fiber, sintered media, nonwoven structures, polymer pellets, braids, woven fabrics, cables, yarns and short fibers. Well established brand names are Bekipor, Beki-shield and Bekinox. The Lurex Company has manufactured metallic fibers in Europe for over fifty years. They produce a wide variety of metallic fiber products including fibers used in apparel fabric, embroidery, braids, knitting, military regalia, trimmings, ropes, cords, and lace surface decoration. The majority of Lurex fibers have a polyamide film covering the metal strand but polyester and viscose are also used. The fibers are also treated with a lubricant called P.W., a mineral-based oil, which helps provide ease of use. Metlon Corporation is a trademark of Metallic Yarns in the United States and has been producing metallic yarns for over sixty years. Metlon produces their metallic yarn by wrapping single slit yarns with two ends of nylon. One end of nylon is wrapped clockwise and the other end is wrapped counterclockwise around the metallic yarn. The most commonly used nylon is either 15 denier or 20 denier, but heavier deniers are used for special purposes. Uses Metallic fibers are used in a wide range of sectors and segments. Automotive Metal fiber sintered sheets are used for diesel and gasoline particulate filtration and crankcase ventilation filters. Heat-resistant textile materials are made from metal fibers for automotive glass bending processes. These metal fiber cloths protect the glass during the bending process with highly elevated temperatures and high pressures. Also heating cables for car seat heating and Selective Catalytic Reduction tubes, adblue tanks. Metal fiber heating cables show an extremely high flexibility and durability when compared to copper wire. Aerospace Metal fiber filters are used for Hydraulic fluid filtration in aircraft hydraulic systems. When compared to glass fiber filtration media, metal fibers show excellent durability, as the fibers are metallically bonded together by sintering, instead of kept together by a binder material. Metal fiber sintered porous sheets are used as a sound attenuation medium in the aircraft cabin, reducing HVAC sounds, and auxiliary power unit noise. Technical textiles Metal fibers can serve as antistatic fibers for textiles, which can be used in, amongst others, electrical protective clothing or antistatic big bags. Not only antistatic, but also shielding from electromagnetic interference (EMI) can be achieved by metal fiber textiles. Stainless steel fiber textiles can be heated by applying electrical current and can also be used for cut resistant clothing (gloves). Let's say it's the modern chain mail. Power Metal fiber filters can reach very high porosity, at very low pore sizes, which makes them suitable for HEPA and ULPA filtration. These filters are used in, amongst others, nuclear power plants as a safety measure to prevent eventual release of radio- active steam. Marine Metal fiber filters are used for the purification of marine fuel and lube oil. Other uses of metal fibers Another common use for metallic fibers is upholstery fabric and textiles such as lam√© and brocade. Many people also use metallic fibers in weaving and needlepoint. Increasingly common today are metallic fibers in clothing, anything from party and evening wear to club clothing, cold weather and survival clothing, and everyday wear. Metallic yarns are woven, braided, and knit into many fashionable fabrics and trims. For additional variety, metallic yarns are twisted with other fibers such as wool, nylon, cotton, and synthetic blends to produce yarns which add novelty effects to the end cloth or trim. Stainless steel and other metal fibers are used in communication lines such as phone lines and cable television lines. Stainless steel fibers are also used in carpets. They are dispersed throughout the carpet with other fibers so they are not detected. The presence of the fibers helps to conduct electricity so that the static shock is reduced. These types of carpets are often used in computer-use areas where the chance of producing static is much greater. Other uses include tire cord, missile nose cones, work clothing such as protective suits, space suits, and cut resistant gloves for butchers and other people working near bladed or dangerous machinery. Metal fibers can be used as a reinforcement or electrical conductivity fiber for fiber reinforced composites.

It is the fourth-largest urban park in Canada, and one of the largest urban parks in North America. It is a municipal park, unlike Fish Creek, which is a provincial park. Nose Hill Park is located in the northwest quadrant of Calgary, Alberta. It was created in 1980. Wildlife White- tailed deer are often observed within aspen groves and coulees in Nose Hill Park.The park is large enough to sustain large mammals like deer and coyote as well as porcupine, northern pocket gophers, and Richardson's ground squirrels. Northern harriers and Swainson's hawks feed on smaller species such as mice and voles. Park status In 1971 Hartel Holdings planned to develop a residential community on the site of present day Nose Hill Park and requested amendments to the prevailing zoning by-law. In the 1970s, a grassroots group consisting of members of local communities(most notably North Haven) and Calgary Field Naturalists‚Äô Society, later known as Nature Calgary, worked together to lobby the city to protect Nose Hill from development. In 1972 the City offered Hartel \\"$6873 per acre\\". On July 3, 1972 the City passed a resolution to defer \\"development of the area in question until completion of a sector plan had been made.\\" By April 16, 1973 the City restricted urban development on 4100 acres in the Nose Hill area and began investigating acquiring the land. The City adopted a municipal plan for development of Nose Hill Park on March 12, 1979. and a Master Plan for the park was incorporated in the City‚Äôs General Municipal Plan on June 17, 1980. created a regional park with 1,129 hectares of grassland, \\"one of North America‚Äôs largest municipal parks.\\" In 1984 in Hartel Holdings vs the City of Calgary, the Supreme Court of Canada gave the City the \\"right to purchase land on Nose Hill at its own pace.\\"FONHS history In the 1980s Nose Hill Park was officially designated a protected area by the city. Once considered the northern outskirts of Calgary, the park is today surrounded on all sides by 12 residential communities. Much has been done to preserve the park. Long-abandoned hulks of cars were removed from the coulees in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Today, the park is used year-round by hikers, walkers, cyclists and other outdoor enthusiasts. Environment Sensitive vegetation, terrain, and archaeological sites exist within the park. It contains a significant native rough fescue grassland ecosystem and over 66 native vascular plant species have been found on the hill including parry oat grass, prairie crocus, golden bean, bedstraw and sage. Grasslands of this nature are considered endangered in North America because more than 95 percent have been lost to cultivation, tree encroachment, pollution, and development. The grassland is one of seven major native habitat types on the hill which together provide an excellent habitat for a variety of animals. Over 198 wildlife species have been identified on the hill. Formation leftA large river flowing from the mountains to the west deposited gravels on top of sandstones and shales that formed the hill's bedrock. During the last ice age, about 15,000 years ago, ice sheets wore away the rock and gravel. At the end of the ice age, retreating ice left glacial till on the hill's top. Glacial Lake Calgary was formed in the area and deposited sediments on the side of the hill. A river, later to be known as the Bow, eroded the sediments and helped shape the south side of the hill. History Exposed to the drying and warming effects of the recurrent Chinook winds, Nose Hill provided favorable wintering grounds for bison herds which, in turn, attracted people to the hill's grassy slopes. The park today contains numerous tipi rings circles of stone once used to weigh down the conical- shaped skin dwellings of plains bison hunters. Also within the perimeters of today's park are ancient tool-making stations, a stone cairn, and evidence of bison kills conducted long ago. In 1900, one Euro-Canadian settler in the Nose Hill area described the archaeological residue below the cliffs of the coulee by McPherson Creek as a bone bed nine feet thick and an acre in extent. Establishing the tribal identities of all the people who left archaeological evidence on and around Nose Hill is virtually impossible. Most of the more recent sites, however, probably belonged to the Peigan, who dominated the territory in the vicinity of the Bow Valley when the Europeans first appeared. The origin of the hill's name is unclear but common legend tells of a European explorer asking an aboriginal translator the name of the hill seen far off in the distance. The man replied: Nose Hill is the name it was given because from here it resembles the nose of our chief. In December 1779 a well-known Hudson's Bay Company trader, Peter Fidler, recorded an excursion to the hill he went on with Peigan guides. HBC trader David Thompson wintered at a Peigan encampment on the Bow River in 1787‚Äì1788, and in 1800 returned to the area as a North West Company employee. In his journal for the year, Thompson made specific note of Nose Hill. The details of Fidler's journal entry illustrate well how dramatically the region's warm Chinook winds can affect the cold temperatures that characterize winters in southern Alberta. The temperature on the December day of Fidler's visit to Nose Hill was a balmy 14 degrees Celsius (58 degrees Fahrenheit). John and George McDougall, Methodist missionaries, experienced more typical winter weather when they traveled to Nose Hill to hunt bison some four decades later. En route back to their hunting camp on the bitterly cold night of January 24, 1876, the elder McDougall, George, lost his way. A savage snowstorm delayed efforts to locate the missing man. On February 6, a search party finally discovered McDougall's frozen body on the east side of Nose Creek. Names currently associated with topographical features in and near Nose Hill Park reflect the impact of the European newcomers and European trade goods on the Peigan. For example, Spy Hill, the westward extension of Nose Hill, derived its present name from the aboriginal practice of communicating with distant colleagues by flashing European trade mirrors from elevated locations. Other effects of the Europeans' arrival were more insidious. The six bison that the Methodist missionaries shot during their ill-fated hunting excursion were mere remnants of southern Alberta's once vast buffalo population. By 1879, the bison herds had vanished from Nose Hill. A new chapter of local history had begun. A fledgling Euro-Canadian community, Fort Calgary, had appeared in the valley beneath Nose Hill. The area around Nose Hill itself played a significant economic role in Calgary's subsequent physical transformation from police fort to prairie city. Much of the sandstone used to construct the imposing public buildings that became Calgary's hallmark after 1886 came from quarries local entrepreneurs operated on Nose Creek. Stone from the J A Lewis quarry provided the entrance to the Imperial Bank and part of the new city hall erected in 1909. Masons used materials carted into the city from Nose Creek to build James Short School and Calgary's old courthouse as well. During the construction \\"boom\\" years prior to World War I, Nose Creek also made a significant contribution to less reputable facets of the young city's economy. Bordellos built along the banks of the creek helped sustain the local prostitution trade, and further Calgary's growing notoriety as \\"... the booze, brothel and gambling capital of the far western plains.\\"Gray, James (1971). Red Lights on the Prairies. Toronto: Macmillan of Canada. p. 125. . Business at the brothels flourished until World War I, when competing downtown facilities that operated near the city's saloons and new army barracks diverted attention away from the less accessible Nose Hill and Nose Creek district. In the fall of 1896, a young Blackfoot man, Running Weasel, died south of the Bow River. His final request provides eloquent testimony to Nose Hill's enduring role as a sentinel presiding over the passage of time. At his death, Running Weasel asked that he be \\" ... put where he could see the great city [of Calgary] grow beneath his feet.\\"Calgary Herald. March 11, 1897. His well-known friend Deerfoot (Blackfoot) placed his coffin beside Nose Creek. As Calgary developed and grew, it began encroaching on the hill. Developers discussed constructing a neighborhood along the hill as early as the late 1940s. Some maps began featuring roads as far northwest as 24th Street and 48 Avenue, though none of these roads were ever constructed north of John Laurie Boulevard or west of 14th Street.Bekin's moving ‚Äì Calgary City Map (1958). Cattle grazing continued on the hill unabated until 1969. Vehicle traffic was tolerated on parts of the hill until 1971. People picnicking or just sightseeing from their cars were common sights in summer months. More than 35 years later, remnants of the damage the cars created on the narrow paths can still be seen immediately west of the Calgary Winter Club Parking lot. A brief media sensation occurred in the summer of 2012 when an American police officer wrote a letter to the Calgary Herald lamenting that Canadian gun laws prevented him from carrying a gun in the park where he felt threatened by two men promoting the Calgary Stampede. Prior to the 15th Annual Conference of the Blackfoot Confederacy Confederacy hosted by the Kainai in Tsuu T‚Äôina, in September, 2015, a stone marker was created adjacent to an older site of a stone cairn circle. According to Kainai cultural Elder Andy Black Water, this was a sacred place for ceremonies and vision quests, as well as a lookout for \\"buffalo, the weather and danger\\". The marker represented a Siksikaitsitapi Circle that signifies the world. The four tribes‚ÄîAkainai, Siksika, Piikani and Amskapipikuni‚Äîwere represented by triangle figures in each corner.

The Heschel School is a pluralistic, egalitarian community that includes families from a wide range of Jewish backgrounds, practices and beliefs. Unlike other Jewish Day Schools or other religiously affiliated schools, The Abraham Joshua Heschel School is unique in that it had a much more liberal ideology. It was founded on the principles of Abraham Joshua Heschel who marched for civil rights with Martin Luther King Jr. He believed in Judaism as a tradition for connection to a singular ineffable being without criticizing people who believed in other things. The school emphasizes diversity amongst its students and their differing religious traditions as well as amongst the ideas brought up by its students. The leadership values those who think differently and encourages debate. Other \\"Heschel Schools\\" are located in Los Angeles, California and Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Despite having similar names, the three schools are otherwise unrelated. School The school's building at 30 West End Ave, with part of its adjacent building at 20 West End visible on the right The Abraham Joshua Heschel School was originally housed in three buildings: The Early Childhood (kindergarten and pre-school) Center and lower school was located on West 89th Street, the middle school on West 91st Street, and a newer high school on 60th Street at 20 West End Avenue (opened in 2001). In the summer of 2009, it was announced that construction would begin on a new building on 61st Street at 30 West End Avenue, adjacent to the high school building, which would house the Early Childhood, lower school, and middle school divisions. The planned new facility was referred to as the \\"One Campus Plan,\\" and construction began in 2009. The new facility would include space to expand the number of classes in Kindergarten through 8th grade, and the school began running extra classes starting with the class entering kindergarten in the 2010‚Äì2011 school year. The new facility, officially known as the Ronald P. Stanton Campus and designed by architects IBI Group-Gruzen Samton, opened for the 2012‚Äì2013 school year, on schedule and under budget. On December 18, 2013, the school announced that Columbia Law School Professor Ariela Dubler would take the helm as Head of School in 2014 when longtime Head of School Roanna Shorofsky retires.http://forward.com/news/189601/ariela-dubler-named-head-of-abraham- joshua-heschel/ In early 2015, Heschel High School head Ahuva Halberstam announced that she would be leaving her post at the end of the academic year to help found another Jewish school. She was replaced by Rabbi Noam Silverman, formerly the Principal of Hebrew and Jewish Studies at Gideon Hausner Jewish Day School in Palo Alto, California. =Clubs= Clubs constitute a large part of the social life at The Heschel High School.

The mall's anchor stores are H&M;, Macy's, Morris Home Furniture, Guitar Center, Dick's Sporting Goods, JCPenney, Ross Dress for Less, LensCrafters, Kirkland's, Ulta Beauty, and DSW. There are 2 vacant anchor stores that were once Elder-Beerman and Sears. Located south of downtown Dayton, just north of the junction of Interstate 75 and Interstate 675 between the suburbs of Centerville and Miamisburg, the mall has attracted millions of visitors since its grand opening in 1970. The mall is owned by Washington Prime Group, a Columbus-based firm, which acquired the complex in 1997; the company also owns The Mall at Fairfield Commons nearby. History The Edward J. DeBartolo Corporation announced the construction of the Dayton Mall in 1969. According to developers, it was the largest mall constructed between New York City and Chicago at the time. Over 100 stores were announced, including three anchor stores: J. C. Penney, Sears, and Rike's. Other major tenants included four smaller department stores: Metropolitan, Donenfeld's, Dunhill's, and Thal's. Other major tenants included a J.G. McCrory five and ten store, a Liberal supermarket, Orange Julius, Kinney Shoes, Thom McAn, Jo- Ann Fabrics, Hickory Farms of Ohio, Waldenbooks, Fanny Farmer, Gray Drug, Russell Stover, Lerner New York, Lane Bryant, The Limited, Frederick's of Hollywood, LeRoy's Jewelers, Hallmark Cards, and Chess King. Restaurants announced for the mall included Bresler's Ice Cream, Orange Julius, Hot Sam, Carousel Hot Dogs, Forum Cafeteria, and Vic Cassano's. There were also three outparcel tire and auto service centers. The Dayton Mall's official grand opening was held in 1970, although some stores were already in operation at the time, such as Rike's, Hickory Farms and the single-screen Dayton Mall Cinema. Rike's, owned by Federated Department Stores, was merged with Federated's Shillito's in 1982 as Shillito‚ÄìRike's. The store changed names again in 1986 to Lazarus. After adopting the Lazarus-Macy's brand in 2003, the store fully adopted the Macy's name in 2005; it contains . The over , bi-level shopping center held the distinction of being the largest in southwestern Ohio for many years. Several more stores were added when the Dayton Mall underwent two major renovations of its existing structure in 1984 and 1995-1996. In the first renovation, the interior of the east and west concourses was remodeled, as was the two-level main entrance. The central atrium area was also improved with a food court installed on its mezzanine. On August 4, 1972, Cinema 2 opened on the mezzanine level; in October 1976, Cinemas 3 and 4 opened, also on the mezzanine, across from Cinema 2; Cinemas 5‚Äì8 opened in 1982, attached to the mall but with only exterior public entrances. Cinemas 2, 3 and 4 closed in 1993, 5‚Äì8 closed in 2000, and the original cinema closed in January 2001. Most of the cinema space was reutilized, but as of 2012, the space formerly housing Cinemas 3 and 4 remains unused behind a wall.http://cinematreasures.org/theaters/7139 After the supermarket closed, its space was allocated to a Morrison's Cafeteria and a few other retailers in late 1980. In 1988, the restaurant was rebranded as Morrison's corporate sibling Sadie's Buffet & Grill. In April 1993, the restaurant was replaced by a Discovery Zone children's entertainment facility. In the mid-1990s, a fourth anchor store was added in front of what had been the main entrance. It was occupied by , which moved from its former location at the west end of the mall; its current location contains . The original location became a Cincinnati-based McAlpin's in 1996 and then a Dayton-based Elder-Beerman in 1998; the store contained . After these renovations were completed, the Dayton Mall had nearly 150 retailers under one roof. A Designer Shoe Warehouse (DSW) store opened on July 9, 2000. Anticipated to open prior to the 2000 holiday shopping season, Discovery Zone was replaced by a Linens 'n Things in early 2001; Linens 'n Things was considered a junior anchor of the mall. In addition, a new exterior public entrance and new public restrooms were added to this area of the mall. The Greene Town Center, a retail and entertainment complex, opened in suburban Beavercreek in August 2006, prompting the Dayton Mall and The Mall at Fairfield Commons to extend their properties to attract more visitors. A , open-air, \\"lifestyle component\\" was added in the Dayton Mall's north parking lot, along Ohio State Route 725. Known as \\"The Village At Dayton Mall\\", it added twenty-five tenants and was dedicated in early 2007. With the completion of this addition, the Dayton Mall encompassed . In 2012, the DSW store moved to a space in the \\"lifestyle\\" area of the mall formerly held by Borders Book Stores. In April 2012, Dick's Sporting Goods announced that it would relocate from a nearby location in Miamisburg and occupy the space held formerly by DSW and f.y.e. in the mall, adding another anchor tenant and boosting the mall's occupancy rate above 95 percent. In November 2014, Doppelganger Laboratories opened a store in the Dayton Mall employing a Shapify Booth, manufactured by Luxembourg's Artec Group. The booth takes a 3D scan of a person, then 3D prints a lifelike, full-color miniature figurine of the person. This was the first retail use of the booth in the United States. Linens & More for Less opened at the mall in 2010, taking space formerly occupied by Linens 'n Things.http://www.bizjournals.com/dayton/stories/2010/07/05/daily7.html?page=all Linens & More for Less closed in November 2012; its space was taken over in May 2013 by H. H. Gregg, which relocated from Miamisburg. On April 7, 2017, H. H. Gregg announced that the entire chain was going out of business, and the store closed that May. In 2015, Sears Holdings spun off 235 of its properties, including the Sears at Dayton Mall, into Seritage Growth Properties.http://www.seritage.com/retail/property/2700-miamisburg- centerville-rd/3312595/landing On October 25, 2017, it was announced that the freestanding Sears Auto Center would be converted to an Outback Steakhouse and another unnamed tenant. In December 2017, the mall gained Internet fame in a prank by Dan the Meme Man in which a teenager sleds down an escalator while a man posing as a security guard threatens to call police if he goes down, leading to a dramatic chase after he follows through. The viral video popularized the phrases \\"Sled gang\\" and \\"Eat ass, smoke grass, and sled fast\\". On June 2, 2018, Macy's opened its off-price store concept, a Macy's Backstage outlet, within its mall location. On June 20, 2018, it was announced that a Ross Dress for Less would open in the former H. H. Gregg location; it opened on October 12, 2019. On July 26, 2018, it was announced that The RoomPlace would open a home furniture store in the mall. Sources initially disagreed as to the details. Trade magazine Furniture Today claimed that a store was scheduled to open around late summer 2019. Trade magazine Shopping Centers Today claimed that the RoomPlace would move into an empty anchor store, however, a press release from mall owner Washington Prime Group stated that the store would be in newly-created inline space. In late November 2018, it was reported that Old Navy, with a Dayton Mall location, would open a store in the Austin Landing development, also in Miami Township. On January 30, 2019, the mall's Old Navy location closed and it was reported soon after that the RoomPlace would open in the former Old Navy space later in the year. The RoomPlace was still slated to join the mall as late as February 13, 2020. On February 25, 2020, it was announced that locally-based regional chain Morris Home Furniture would be opening instead in the space planned for The RoomPlace, with The RoomPlace confirming two days later that it had shelved its plans to enter the Dayton market. The Morris showroom was tentatively scheduled to open in spring 2020. Elder-Beerman closed on August 29, 2018, due to the bankruptcy of parent company The Bon-Ton. After an August 22, 2018 announcement that Sears would be closing as part of a plan to close 46 locations nationwide, the store closed on November 25, 2018. On November 27, 2019, it was announced that Washington Prime Group had purchased the former space for $3.6 million. The company plans to redevelop the site, which contains and was valued at over $6.4 million as of 2019.

The collection was published posthumously in 1869 and is associated with literary modernism. Baudelaire mentions he had read Aloysius Bertrand's Gaspard de la nuit (considered the first example of prose poetry) at least twenty times before starting this work. Though inspired by Bertrand, Baudelaire's prose poems were based on Parisian contemporary life instead of the medieval background which Bertrand employed. He said of his work: \\"These are the flowers of evil again, but with more freedom, much more detail, and much more mockery.\\" Indeed, many of the themes and even titles from Baudelaire's earlier collection Les Fleurs du mal are revisited in this work. These poems have no particular order, have no beginning and no end and they can be read like thoughts or short stories in a stream of consciousness style. The point of the poems is \\"to capture the beauty of life in the modern city,\\" using what Jean-Paul Sartre has labeled as being his existential outlook on his surroundings. Published twenty years after the fratricidal June Days that ended the ideal or \\"brotherly\\" revolution of 1848, Baudelaire makes no attempts at trying to reform society he has grown up in but realizes the inequities of the progressing modernization of Paris. In poems such as \\"The Eyes of the Poor\\" where he writes (after witnessing an impoverished family looking in on a new cafe): \\"Not only was I moved by that family of eyes, but I felt a little ashamed of our glasses and decanters, larger than our thirst...\\", showing his feelings of despair and class guilt. The title of the work refers not to the abdominal organ (the spleen) but rather to the second, more literary meaning of the word, \\"melancholy with no apparent cause, characterised by a disgust with everything\\".Definition from Le Nouveau Petit Robert 2009  Major themes in Le Spleen de Paris  Pleasure = Le Spleen de Paris explores the idea of pleasure as a vehicle for expressing emotion. Many of the poems refer to sex or sin explicitly (i.e. \\"Double Bedroom,\\" \\"A Hemisphere in a Head of Hair\\", \\"Temptations\\"); others use subtle language and imagery to evoke sensuality (i.e. \\"the Artist's Confiteor\\"). In both cases, the diction is undeniably sexual; for example, in \\"Double Bedroom\\", \\"Muslin rains abundantly over the windows and around the bed in a snowy cascade. Within this bed is ensconced the Idol, queen of dreams.\\" Baudelaire's obsession with pleasure reflects his love for scandal and wickedness, as well as his philosophy that by seeking pleasure, man taps into his authentic \\"evil\\" self.Richardson, Joanna. Baudelaire. St. Martin's Press: New York, 1994. 50. = Sobriety and intoxication = Many of Baudelaire's prose poems openly advocate drinking and intoxication, such as \\"Be Drunk\\". Intoxication (or any equal pleasure such as creative work, sex, virtue, etc.) creates a euphoria and timelessness that allows you to transcend the limitations of time and truly live \\"in the moment\\". In \\"Be Drunk\\", the speaker commands the reader to engage in something intoxicating: \\"You must be drunk always... Time crushes your shoulders and bends you earthward, you must be drunk without respite.\\" Sobriety, in contrast, forces you to address the harsh realities of the world around you. However, this interpretation has recently been challenged by some critics, who claim that Baudelaire was actually being ironic in his advocacy for drunkenness. Maria Scott, a literary scholar, claims that Baudelaire believed \\"artificial toxication was ... far inferior to 'successive work' and the 'regular exercise of will', that artificial stimulants ... actually amplify time.\\" Thus, it is debatable whether intoxication refers to literal drunkenness as an escape or if symbolizes the pleasure found in writing and expressing oneself. = The artist/poet = In Le Spleen de Paris, the concept of artist and poet intermingle. Baudelaire saw poetry as a form of art, and thus in many of the prose poems the artist is a substitute for a traditional poet or speaker. In \\"The Desire to Paint\\", the artist attempts to depict his beautiful muse with images, just as the poet attempts to express his emotions with language. The relationship between the artist and poet reflects the need to evoke a particular feeling or idea, and this thread is carried through almost every single poem in the text. Ultimately, the artist and the poet become one, since they share the same purpose ‚Äì to describe beauty. In this sense, the work itself (and every individual poem within) is beautiful, a \\"work of art\\" due to its innovative, interesting form. Thus, the poem, according to Baudelaire, is as much an \\"aesthetic experience\\" as it is a literary one.Hiddleston, J. A. Baudelaire and Le Spleen de Paris. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1987. 10‚Äì11. = Women = Women are both admired and ridiculed in Le Spleen de Paris. Some poems, such as \\"The Desire to Paint\\", reflect female power and sexuality in a somewhat positive manner. However, a larger portion of the poems in Baudelaire's work debase women as evil, gaudy, and cold. Many are represented as prostitutes, and according to scholars, \\"the courtesan would seem to be a virtual incarnation, for Baudelaire, of all that is artificial and misleading.\\" In \\"The Rope\\", the speaker's apprentice hangs himself, and his mother comes to collect the rope. The speaker is shocked to discover that she did so not to \\"preserve them as horrible and precious relics\\", but to sell them for a morbid profit. Baudelaire rejects the concept of maternal love and replaces it with a cold economic reality. Still, women are inherently sexual, and in some regards, Baudelaire admires their sensual beauty (connects back to themes of intoxication, pleasure). = Mortality and the passage of time = Many of Baudelaire's prose poems are dominated by the concept of time, usually negatively. The speaker in Le Spleen de Paris fears the passage of time and his/her own mortality. As a result, intoxication, women, pleasure, and writing are all forms of escape from this unavoidable hell. \\"Be Drunk\\" and \\"Already!\\" exemplify Baudelaire's infatuation with the idea of time. In \\"Already!\\" the speaker is incapable of matching the infiniteness and simplicity of nature, and at the end, comes face to face with his own death: \\"I felt pulled down deathwards; which is why, when companions said, 'At last!' I could only cry, 'Already!\\" Also, this theme supports Baudelaire's admiration of art and poetry because although man cannot defeat time and death, a work of art can. Art, poetry, life, and death are inextricably linked within Baudelaire's poems, and perhaps reflect a personal obsession with mortality. =The city= For Baudelaire, the setting of most poems within Le Spleen de Paris is the Parisian metropolis, specifically the poorer areas within the city. Notable poems within Le Spleen de Paris whose urban setting is important include ‚ÄúCrowds‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Old Mountebank.‚Äù Within his writing about city life, Baudelaire seems to stress the relationship between individual and society, frequently placing the speaker in a reflective role looking out at the city. It is also important to note that Baudelaire's Paris is not one of nice shops and beautiful streets. Instead, Baudelaire focuses on dirty, poverty-stricken areas of Paris with social problems rather than the Paris of the upper class. =Poverty/class= In connection with the theme of the Parisian metropolis, Baudelaire focuses heavily on the theme of poverty and social class within Le Spleen de Paris. Important poems from the collection which embody these themes include \\"The Toy of the Poor\\", \\"The Eyes of the Poor\\", \\"Counterfeit Money\\", and \\"Let's Beat Up the Poor\\". In these poems Baudelaire introduces slightly differing views of the urban poor. In \\"The Toy of the Poor\\" Baudelaire heavily stresses the need for equality between social classes in Paris. In comparison, \\"Counterfeit Money\\" and \\"Let's Beat Up the Poor\\" seem to use a sarcastic tone to instil empathy in the reader for those people in poverty. In Michael Hamburger's introduction to his translation, Twenty Prose Poems of Baudelaire, the scholar notes a highly sympathetic view of the poor in Le Spleen de Paris; Baudelaire seems to relate to the poor and becomes an advocate for them in his poetry. =Religion/good vs. evil= Many poems in Le Spleen de Paris incorporate a central theme of religion or the relationship between good and evil in human nature. \\"Cake\\", which centers on a moral battle addressing the question of whether humans are inherently good or evil stands out as an especially important poem within the collection. \\"Loss of a Halo\\" also incorporates similar themes, literally discussing the role of angels as well as the relationship between mankind and religious ideology, questioning the goodness of Christian ideals. Along these lines, Baudelaire repeatedly addresses the theme of sin within his poetry as well as questioning how the hierarchy of class could affect the hierarchy of goodness, implying that those of higher social class tend not to be morally superior to those of lower classes. Many critics of Baudelaire address the prominent role of religion in the poet's life and how that might have affected his writing. Some suspect that since Baudelaire internalized Christian practices, he thought himself capable of accurately portraying God in his writing. Yet by representing God's message within his poetry, Baudelaire placed himself in a position of patriarchal authority, similar to that of the God depicted in Christianity. Poet/reader relationship The following passage is taken from the preface to the 2008 Mackenzie translation of Le Spleen de Paris, entitled \\"To Ars√®ne Houssaye\\": While writing Le Spleen de Paris, Baudelaire made very conscious decisions regarding his relationship with his readers. As seen in the preface to the collection, addressed to his publisher, Ars√®ne Houssaye, Baudelaire attempted to write a text that was very accessible to a reader while pulling the most appealing aspects of both prose and poetry and combining them into the revolutionary genre of prose poetry. For Baudelaire, the accessibility of the text and ability for a reader to set down the book and pick it up much later was crucial, especially considering his implied opinions of his readers. Baudelaire's tone throughout the preface, \\"The Dog and the Vial\\" as well as other poems throughout Le Spleen de Paris seem to illustrate Baudelaire's opinions of superiority over his readers. In \\"The Dog and the Vial\\", a man offers his dog a vial of fancy perfume to smell and the dog reacts in horror, instead wishing to sniff more seemingly unappealing smells, specifically excrement. The poem concludes with the frustration of the speaker with his dog, expressed as the speaker states: \\"In this respect you, unworthy companion of my sad life, resemble the public, to whom one must never present the delicate scents that only exasperate them, but instead give them only dung, chosen with care\\". One can extrapolate this poem to apply more figuratively to the larger themes of the poet-reader relationship, in which Baudelaire deprecates his readers, viewing them as unintelligent and incapable of appreciating his work.  Style  Le Spleen de Paris represents a definitive break from traditional poetic forms. The text is composed of \\"prose poems\\" which span the continuum between \\"prosaic\\" and \\"poetic\\" works. The new, unconventional form of poetry was characteristic of the modernist movement occurring throughout Europe (and particularly in Paris) at the time.Berman, Marshall. \\"Baudelaire: Modernism in the Streets.\\" All that is Solid Melts Into Air: The Experience of Modernity. New York: Penguin Group Inc., 1988. 148. Google Books. 2009. 21 May 2009, books.google.com In the preface to Le Spleen de Paris, Baudelaire describes that modernity requires a new language, \\"a miracle of a poetic prose, musical without rhythm or rhyme, supple enough and striking enough to suit lyrical movements of the soul, undulations of reverie, the flip-flops of consciousness\\", and in this sense, Le Spleen de Paris gives life to modern language. Baudelaire's prose poetry tends to be more poetic in comparison to later works such as Ponge's Le parti pris des choses, but each poem varies. For an example of a more poetic poem, see \\"Evening Twilight\\"; for a prosaic example, see \\"The Bad Glazier\\".  Publication history, influences, and critical reception  Baudelaire's Le Spleen de Paris is unique in that it was published posthumously by his sister in 1869, two years after Baudelaire died. In fact, it was not until his waning years, plagued by physical ailments and the contraction of syphilis that he created a table of contents for the book. Baudelaire spent years 1857 to 1867 working on his book of poems that chronicled daily life in the city of Paris. These poems aimed at capturing the times in which they were written, from the brutally repressed upheavals of 1848 (after which the government censored literature more than ever), the 1851 coup d'√©tat of Louis Bonaparte and generally Paris of the 1850s, demolished and renovated by Napoleon III's prefect, Baron Haussman. In displaying the social antagonisms of the age, Baudelaire drew influence from many great artists of the time. In fact, an active critical essayist himself, his critical reviews of other poets \\"elucidate the recesses of the mind that created Les Fleurs du Mal and Le Spleen de Paris.\\" Influence: While there is much speculation regarding direct influence and inspiration in the creation of Le Spleen de Paris, the following colleagues seem to have clearly influenced the book of small poems: Edgar Allan Poe: \\"Indeed, Poe illustrates his claim with several examples which seem to summarize with uncanny precision the temperament of Baudelaire himself (Poe 273‚Äì4). The affinity between the two writers in this regard seems beyond dispute ... Moreover, 'The Imp of the Perverse (short story)' is less a tale than a prose poem, and both its subject-matter and its movement from general considerations to specific examples leading to an unexpected conclusion may have influenced Baudelaire in his creation of Le Spleen de Paris.\\" Aloysius Betrand's Gaspard de la nuit: Baudelaire himself is quoted as citing this work as an inspiration for Paris Spleen. Gustave Flaubert: Magazine article \\"No ideas but in Crowds: Baudelaire's Paris Spleen\\" cites similarities between the writers in that like Baudelaire, Flaubert held the same motives and intentions in that he too wanted \\"to write the moral history of the men of my generation ‚Äì or, more accurately, the history of their feelings.\\" Critical reception: The way in which the poem was received certainly lends to understanding the climate in which Baudelaire created Le Spleen de Paris, in that \\"It appears to be almost a diary entry, an explicit rundown of the day's events; those events seem to be precisely the kind that Charles Baudelaire would have experienced in the hectic and hypocritical world of the literary marketplace of his day.\\" Notable critical reception: In order to truly understand how Le Spleen de Paris was received, one must first be acquainted with Baudelaire's earlier works. The repressions and upheavals of 1848 resulted in massive censorship of literature, which did not bode well for Baudelaire's perhaps most famous work, Les Fleurs du Mal. Society was so shocked by the satanic references and sexual perversion in the book that at the time it was a critical and popular failure. This put the anticipated reception of Le Spleen de Paris at a disadvantage. Like Flowers of Evil, it wasn't until much later that Paris Spleen was fully appreciated for what it was, a masterpiece that \\"brought the style of the prose poem to the broader republics of the people\\". That being said, just four years after Arthur Rimbaud used Baudelaire's work as a foundation for his poems, as he considered Baudelaire a great poet and pioneer of prose. Appearance in Media: A 2006 film Spleen, written by Eric Bomba-Ire, borrowed its title from Baudelaire's book of prose poems. Baudelaire expressed a particular feeling that he called 'Spleen' which is a mixture of melancholy, rage, eros, and resignation, which ties in well with the movie's darkly woven tale of love, betrayal and passion. Notable quotations In \\"Let us beat up the poor\\", Baudelaire makes up a parable about economic and social equality: no one is entitled to it; it belongs to those who can win it and keep it. And he taunts the social reformer: \\"What do you think of that, Proudhon?\\" \\"At One in the Morning\\" is like a diary entry, a rundown of the day's events. In it, Baudelaire recognizes that he is part of a society full of hypocrites. His individual self becomes \\"blurred...by a hypocrisy and perverseness which progressively undermine the difference between the self and others.\\" This is at least partly what Baudelaire meant by \\"a modern and more abstract life.\\" \\"The Thyrsus\\" is a piece addressed to composer Franz Liszt. The ancient Greek thyrsus had connotations of \\"unleashed sexuality and violence, of the profound power of the irrational.\\" Baudelaire believed the thyrsus to be an acceptable object of representation for Liszt's music. In \\"The Bad Windowpane Maker\\" Baudelaire speaks of a \\"kind of energy that springs from ennui and reverie\\" that manifests itself in a particularly unexpected way in the most inactive dreamers. Doctors and moralists alike are at a loss to explain where such mad energy so suddenly comes from to these lazy people, why they suddenly feel the need to perform such absurd and dangerous deeds. The prefatory letter Baudelaire wrote to Arsene Houssaye, the editor of La Presse, was not necessarily intended to be included in the publication. When Baudelaire drew up his table of contents for the projected book form, he did not include the letter. It is possible, then, that the letter only appeared in La Presse as a means of flattery to ensure that Houssaye would publish the poems. Nevertheless, it allows us to understand Baudelaire's thinking about the genre of prose poetry: > Who among us has not dreamed, in his ambitious days, of the miracle of a > poetic prose, musical without rhythm or rhyme, supple enough and jarring > enough to be adapted to the soul's lyrical movements, the undulations of > reverie, to the twists and turns that consciousness takes?

The mall was opened in 1993 and has two floors. The anchor stores are Macy's, Dick's Sporting Goods, Round 1 Entertainment, Morris Home Furniture, and JCPenney. There is 1 vacant anchor store that was once Elder-Beerman. Located adjacent to Interstate 675, it is near a golf course, Wright Patterson Air Force Base, Wright State University and the Nutter Center entertainment complex. The mall is located just south of the interstate on North Fairfield Road (Veterans Memorial Highway), a main thoroughfare through Beavercreek. It offers over 140 different shops, restaurants, a food court, and department stores. The Mall at Fairfield Commons is owned by Washington Prime Group, the owners of the Dayton Mall. History After a few days of soft openings with invited guests, the mall opened to the public on October 27, 1993 with a Elder-Beerman, a Parisian, a Sears and a as anchors. The store in the mall replaced two other locations in the area: one in the Airway Shopping Center in then-Mad River Township (now Riverside) and a smaller store in Xenia. placement within the mall's basic layout, two parallel concourses connected by a diagonal concourse, allows it to have two sets of interior public entrances on both floors: one set opens to one of the straight concourses, while another opens to the diagonal concourse. This configuration is unlike some malls that require customers to move through an anchor store to reach other parts of the mall; Fairfield Commons customers do not have to move through to reach any other area of the mall. A Lazarus (now Macy's) opened on September 23, 1994, with the official grand opening from September 30 to October 2; the store opened almost a year later than the other four anchors due to the 1992 emergence of Lazarus' parent company, Federated Department Stores, from bankruptcy reorganization, and also due to Lazarus' earlier commitment to a competing mall project. An Dick's Sporting Goods store opened in 2004. Although two stories, the store's only interior public entrance is on the upper level, off the food court. In fall 2007, The Bon-Ton Stores, owner of Elder-Beerman, converted the existing Parisian store to an additional Elder- Beerman location, housing women‚Äôs clothing, cosmetics, shoes and accessories. The existing Elder-Beerman store was reconfigured to house its men's, children's and home departments on the upper level, and a new furniture gallery on the lower level. In April 2014, Elder-Beerman announced that it would consolidate its two mall locations back into its original location and eliminate the furniture gallery; the consolidation was complete on August 20, 2014. The vacated portion of the mall was demolished in early 2015; it was replaced between late 2015 and 2018 with six restaurants: two attached to the mall but with exterior-only public entrances, and four freestanding. An additional freestanding restaurant in the space is scheduled to open in fall 2018. Elder-Beerman closed on August 29, 2018, due to the bankruptcy of parent company The Bon-Ton. After a September 18, 2018 announcement that Sears would be closing as part of a plan to close 12 locations nationwide, the store closed on December 9, 2018. The lower level of the former Sears store opened as Round One Entertainment on November 23, 2019. In spite of the fact that there had yet been no announcement that the Sears store would either be vacated or reduced in size, on July 26, 2018, it was announced that The RoomPlace would open a home furniture store in the mall. Trade magazine Furniture Today claimed that a store was then scheduled to open in fall 2019 in the upper level of the Sears space. The RoomPlace plans were confirmed on September 18, 2018, when the Sears closing was announced, and were reaffirmed as late as February 13, 2020. On February 25, 2020, it was announced that locally-based regional chain Morris Home Furniture would be opening instead in the upper level of the former Sears store, with The RoomPlace confirming two days later that it had shelved its plans to enter the Dayton market. The Morris showroom was tentatively scheduled to open in spring 2020.

It was the first Chrestomanci book and it remains a recommended introduction to the series.Chrestomanci series at ISFDB. Greenwillow Books published a US edition within the calendar year. The Chrestomanci books are collectively named after a powerful enchanter and British government official in a world parallel to ours, where magic is accepted as commonplace. The Chrestomanci is a government office whose duties include the supervision and enforcement of magical law, and only the most powerful enchanter is up to the task. Charmed Life is set during the tenure of Christopher Chant, who serves as Chrestomanci in five of the seven books and is often referred to by his title. Plot summary When the Chant children, Gwendolen and Eric (known as ‚ÄúCat\\") are orphaned after their parents die in a boating accident, Gwendolen petitions Chrestomanci to let them live at Chrestomanci Castle where she can further her magical training under the tutelage of the world's most powerful enchanter. But when Chrestomanci fails to express interest or awe in her skill, spoiled Gwendolen devises a series of nasty tricks that result in Chrestomanci's removal of her magic. The next morning, Gwendolen has disappeared and a confused lookalike named Janet has taken her place. Working to hide Gwendolen's disappearance, Cat and Janet are forced to contend with many complications Gwendolen left in her wake, and Cat must come to terms with his sister's abandonment and his denial of her exploitive nature. Adapting to her new and unexpected environment, Janet quickly realises the scope of Gwendolen's cruelty when she discovers a book of nine matches, five of which are already burnt. When Cat foolishly strikes a match and finds himself engulfed by flames, Janet's suspicions are confirmed: Cat, who has always believed himself utterly lacking in magical ability, is actually a nine-lived enchanter and is thus destined one day to take over the office of Chrestomanci, and Gwendolen has been leeching Cat's magic and wasting his lives to fuel her own magic. When Gwendolen returns with a group of fellow magical insurgents intent on destroying Chrestomanci, Eric must face his sister and reclaim his powers to save himself and his friends.  Characters  The character of Christopher Chant (the Chrestomanci in this novel) appears as a young boy in The Lives of Christopher Chant and as a teenager in Conrad's Fate. ;Eric Emelius \\"Cat\\" Chant: The protagonist of the novel. Cat is a young boy, who is sent to live at Chrestomanci Castle after a steamboat accident causes his parents (Francis and Caroline Chant) to drown. He originally appears to have no magic and indeed holds this notion himself. As Charmed Life progresses it is revealed that Cat is actually an immensely powerful enchanter with nine lives. Unbeknownst to Cat, his sister Gwendolen constantly uses and abuses Cat's magic. He only has three lives remaining, having lost his first life when he only just survived being born, his second when Gwendolen had put his lives into a book of matches (to make them easier for her to use), the third when he drowned in the boating accident that killed his parents, the fourth when Gwendolen used it to turn his fiddle into a cat (which he kept as a pet and named Fiddle), the fifth when Gwendolen used it to take her into her new world where she reigned as queen, and the sixth when he burned a match from his 'life book' of matches in an attempt to prove that he didn't have nine lives and the matches weren't connected to him. This matchbox is his main weakness. ;Gwendolen Chant: The main antagonist of the novel. Like Cat, she survived the boating accident which killed their parents. Cat believed that Gwendolen could not drown because she was a witch, and that he had only survived by clinging to her (he did not realise that he had in fact drowned). She appears to be a gifted witch, although one who uses magic for selfish and dark purposes. It is eventually revealed that she did not have powerful witchcraft of her own, but borrowed substantial amounts of magic from Cat. Although she was very motherly to Cat in the past, she becomes nastier and bossier to him as the story progresses. Gwendolen is extremely ambitious and has master plans to be Queen or to rule the world. Gwendolen greatly dislikes the current Chrestomanci, because he refused to acknowledge her powers and also denied her further witchcraft education. ;Janet Chant: Gwendolen's counterpart from another world. Before being pulled into World Twelve A, she had lived in a nice, ordinary home in a world similar to ours. While Gwendolen was bossy and bold, Janet was quite shy and jolly. No one was to know that Gwendolen had spirited away to another world, so Cat and Janet had to pretend Janet was Gwendolen. When they were trying to keep it a secret, it is later revealed that Chrestomanci had known about it all along. She later decides to stay in Cat's world and becomes Chrestomanci's ward. ;Chrestomanci ‚Äì Christopher Chant: Chrestomanci is very unpredictable and random. He is a nine-lifed enchanter like Cat, but only has two lives left after a series of accidents took place when he was younger. Chrestomanci has very strong magic and must appear whenever summoned; he works for the government, controlling magic and keeping hold on wayward witches and wizards. ;Julia Chant: Julia is one of Chrestomanci's two children. She is quite fat and normally nice, but proves to have a vengeful streak when Gwendolen provokes her. Julia's magic seems to centre on a handkerchief. However, her magic is lesser than Cat's, and she often finds her attempts at revenge disrupted by him. ;Roger Chant: Roger is Julia's brother and the other child of Chrestomanci. He tends to be laid back and not as hot-tempered as his sister. Roger is more inclined to co- operate with Cat and to entertain him. He usually ignores Gwendolen, unless things get too out of hand. Awards Jones and Charmed Life won the annual Guardian Children's Fiction Prize, a once-in-a-lifetime book award judged by a panel of British children's writers. The novel was also a commended runner up for the Carnegie Medal from the Library Association, recognising the year's best children's book by a British subject. It also won the German Preis der Leseratten. Translations Dutch and Finnish-language translations were published in 1980, followed by German. Danish, Italian, and French editions were published in the 1990s (when the four early novels were in print); later Polish and Spanish, Chinese and Vietnamese, Serbian. \\"Formats and Editions of Charmed life\\".

The Florida District Courts of Appeal (DCAs) are the intermediate appellate courts of the Florida state court system. There are five DCAs: *The First District Court of Appeal is headquartered in Tallahassee *The Second District Court of Appeal is headquartered in Lakeland and has a branch in Tampa *The Third District Court of Appeal is headquartered in Miami *The Fourth District Court of Appeal is headquartered in West Palm Beach *The Fifth District Court of Appeal is headquartered in Daytona Beach History The District Courts of Appeal were created by the Florida Legislature in 1957 to provide an intermediate level of appellate review between the trial courts (the county courts and circuit courts) and the Florida Supreme Court. This was done, as in other parts of the United States, to relieve the state supreme court's ever-increasing appellate docket; the lobbying effort by Florida Supreme Court Justice Elwyn Thomas played a large role in the DCAs' creation. Three DCAs were initially created, with the Third District Court of Appeal was given jurisdiction over cases arising from Dade and Monroe counties. Later, the Fourth and Fifth District Courts of Appeal were created. The existence of the DCAs was provided for in the Florida Constitution, which now requires the Legislature to divide the State into appellate court districts, providing each with a DCA. At the time, Florida was the second state to have \\"District Courts of Appeal,\\" as California had created its own District Courts of Appeal in 1904. However, in 1966, California dropped the word \\"District\\" from the names of the California Courts of Appeal, thus leaving Florida as the sole state with DCAs. Judges District Court of Appeal judges, like Florida Supreme Court justices, are first recommended by the Florida Judicial Nominating Commission. They are then appointed by the governor of Florida, but have retention elections every six years, in which voters are asked on the ballot to vote whether the judge should be retained in office. (Retention rates are very high). DCAs have different numbers of judges - currently ranging from 11 to 15 - based on the docket size. Jurisdiction The Court's Jurisdiction is set forth in Florida Rule of Appellate Procedure 9.030.Florida Rule of Appellate Procedure 9.030. Appeals are usually heard by a three-judge panel. Occasionally a DCA will hold an en banc hearing, in which all the judges participate. The decisions of the district courts of appeal represent the law of Florida unless and until they are overruled by the Florida Supreme Court. Stanfill v. State, 384 So.2d 141, 143 (Fla. 1980). Thus, in the absence of interdistrict conflict, district court decisions bind all Florida trial courts. Weiman v. McHaffie, 470 So.2d 682, 684 (Fla. 1985).See Pardo v. State, 596 So. 2d 665 (Fla. 1992). In the event of a conflict between the decisions of different District Courts of Appeal, county and circuit courts must adhere to the case law of their own District Court. District Courts of Appeal may recede from certain case law and precedent in subsequent decisions, or the Supreme Court may override a district court's precedent in favor of conflicting case law from another district. Because the Florida Supreme Court has predominantly discretionary jurisdiction (i.e., can choose which cases it wants to hear), the DCAs provide the final word on the vast majority of cases appealed in the State of Florida. Cases that are affirmed without comment by the district courts cannot be appealed to the Supreme Court, even as a request for discretionary review. Such a case may be reviewed by the United States Supreme Court pursuant to a petition for writ of certiorari.See, e.g., Ibanez v. Florida Department of Professional Regulation, 512 U.S. 136 (1994), in which review had been denied without comment by the Florida First District Court of Appeal. 621 So. 2d 435 (Fla. 1st DCA 1993). Cases involving the death penalty are heard directly and automatically by the Florida Supreme Court, bypassing the District Courts of Appeal.

He also had an interest in faith-healing and the occult and was a companion of the confidence-trickster Cagliostro. Early life The Battle of Camperdown (1799) Landscape with cows, Wilan√≥w Palace, Warsaw Battle of Maida Loutherbourg was born in Strasbourg in 1740, the son of an expatriate Polish miniature painter. Intended for the Lutheran ministry, he was educated at the University of Strasbourg. =Paris= Rejecting a religious calling, Loutherbourg decided to become a painter, and in 1755 placed himself under Charles-Andr√© van Loo in Paris and later under Francesco Giuseppe Casanova. His talent developed rapidly, and he became a figure in the fashionable society of the day. In 1767 he was elected to the French Academy, although below the age required by the rules of the institution, and painted landscapes, sea storms, and battles, all of which work had a celebrity above those of the specialists then working in Paris. He made his debut with the exhibition of twelve pictures, including Storm at Sunset, Night, and Morning after Rain.Defeat of the Spanish Armada, 1588-08-08 by Philip James de Loutherbourg, painted 1796An avalanche, painted 1803 =Travels= Loutherbourg then travelled through Switzerland, Germany and Italy, distinguishing himself as much by his mechanical inventions as by his painting. One of these, showing new effects produced in a model theatre, was the wonder of the day, with its use of lights behind canvas representing the moon and stars, and the illusory appearance of running water produced by clear blue sheets of metal and gauze, with loose threads of silver. LondonTheatre= In 1771 he settled in London, where David Garrick paid him ¬£500 a year to design scenery and costumes and oversee the stage machinery at the Drury Lane Theatre. His stage effects attracted the admiration not just of the general public, but also of artists, including Joshua Reynolds. He devised scenic effects in which, for instance, green trees gradually became russet and the moon rose and lit the edges of passing clouds: illusions achieved through the use of coloured lantern-slides and the ingenious lighting of transparencies. He continued to work at the theatre until 1785. He achieved an even greater success with an entertainment called the Eidophusikon, meaning \\"image of nature\\". This was a miniature mechanical theatre measuring six by eight feet, and described as displaying \\"Various Imitations of Natural Phenomena, represented by Moving Pictures\\". It was presented at Loutherbourg's home from March 1781 in an auditorium seating about 130 people. He used Argand lamps to light the stage and stained glass to change colours. At Christmas, 1781, Loutherbourg mounted a spectacle at a party in the Egyptian Hall at Fonthill for William Beckford, promising (according to Beckford) to \\"present a mysterious something that the eye has not seen or heart of man conceived\\". Following this he attempted rather more fantastical subjects for the Eidophusikon, presenting a scene from Paradise Lost with \\"Satan arraying his troops on the banks of the Fiery Lake, and the rising of the Palace of Pandemonium\\". The Eidophusikon soon closed, however, as the income did not cover the costs and the audience demanded new productions faster than Loutherbourg could create them. He has been called the inventor of the panorama but, although it first appeared about the same time as the Eidophusikon, the first panorama was painted and exhibited by the Scottish painter Robert Barker. =Painting= Coalbrookdale by Night, painted 1801 Despite these other projects, Loutherbourg still found time for painting. Lord Howe's action, or the Glorious First of June (exhibited 1795) and other large naval pictures were commissioned to commemorate British naval victories, many of them ending up soon afterwards in the Greenwich Hospital Gallery (in whose successor, the National Maritime Museum, they still remain). His finest work was the Destruction of the Armada. He also painted the Great Fire of London and several historical works, including the Attack of the Combined Armies on Valenciennes (1793). He was interested in the industrial revolution and his 1801 painting Coalbrookdale by Night shows iron foundries at work. Seven of his paintings, including Lodore Waterfall and Skating in Hyde Park, are in the Government Art Collection. He was made a member of the Royal Academy in 1781. Publications Landscape with Animals, 1767 Two sets of drawings by de Loutherbourg were published, reproduced in aquatint, under the title Picturesque English Scenery in 1801 and 1805. He also contributed illustrations to a bible published by Thomas Macklin in 1800. After his death Cadell and Davies published a volume of the apocrypha. All 110 of his drawings for the vignettes (but not the apocrypha) are pasted in the Bowyer Bible in Bolton Museum. Esoteric interests In 1789 Loutherbourg temporarily gave up painting, in order to pursue an interest in alchemy and the supernatural. He met Alessandro di Cagliostro, who instructed him in the occult. He travelled about with Cagliostro, leaving him, however, before his condemnation to death. He and his wife also took up faith-healing. A pamphlet called A List of a Few Cures performed by Mr and Mrs De Loutherbourg, of Hammersmith Terrace, without Medicine was published in 1789. Written by a follower named Mary Pratt, it claimed that the Loutherbourgs had cured two thousand people between Christmas 1788 and the following July, \\"having been made proper recipients to receive divine manuductions\\". Death Loutherbourg died in Chiswick in 1812. There are paintings by him in the collections of many British institutions including, Tate Britain, The Victoria and Albert Museum, The National Portrait Gallery, The Royal Academy of Art, Leicester, Farnham and Derby Art Gallery. Philip James de Loutherbourg, BBC, accessed August 2011 Loutherbourg was buried in Chiswick Old Cemetery, adjoining the graveyard of St Nicholas Church, Chiswick. Buried nearby are the artists William Hogarth and James Abbott McNeill Whistler. Further reading * Joppier, Rudiger (1973). Philippe Jacques de Loutherbourg, R.A., 1740-1812.

History The group was discovered in November 1819 by a Russian expedition under Bellingshausen, who named them for Jean-Baptiste Prevost de Sansac, Marquis de Traversay (1754‚Äì1831), a French naval officer who joined the Russian navy in 1791, at the request of an √©migr√© Frenchman in Russian service, admiral Nassau-Siegen. He was Minister of Naval Affairs at Saint Petersburg, 1809‚Äì28, and chief promoter of Bellingshausen's Antarctic voyage. The name was previously transliterated as Traverse because it was incorrectly thought that the man commemorated was a Russian. Geography Map of the South Sandwich Islands Zavodovski Island () lies southeast of South Georgia Island. It is the northernmost of the South Sandwich Islands and the nearest to South Georgia. The island is approximately across with a peak elevation of above sea level. The stratovolcano Mount Asphyxia dominates the western side of the island while the eastern half is a low-lying lava plain. Mount Asphyxia is believed to be active with fresh lava reported in 1830 and numerous indications of activity since. Approximately 50% of the island is composed of tephra. The island is home to around two million breeding chinstrap penguins, making it one of the world's largest penguin colonies. Zavodovski Island featured in the initial part of BBC‚Äôs Planet Earth II natural history television series, narrated by David Attenborough and first shown in the UK on 6 November 2016. The programme described in film life in the harsh environment for the 1.5 million Chinstrap penguins ‚Äì the largest penguin colony in the world. Visokoi Island (), which lies to the southeast of Zavodovski, is long and wide, capped by Mount Hodson, a volcanic peak (). The peak is named after Sir Arnold Weinholt Hodson, a governor of the Falkland Islands. Visokoi means \\"high\\". The island's eastern tip, Point Irving, is named for the leader of a British exploratory and mapping expedition, Commander John J. Irving; the father of British writer and Holocaust denier, David Irving. Leskov Island () is located to the west of the main arc of the South Sandwich Islands and is less than long, and lies west of Visokoi. It was named by Bellingshausen after the third lieutenant on the expedition ship Vostok. It is composed of andesitic rather than basaltic lava. The subduction zone forming the South Sandwich Trench lies to the east of the island arc.

The article Japanese addressing system contains related information on postal addresses. Administrative level Most place names are suffixed with its administrative division. These suffixes are often dropped in common usage when no ambiguation is likely. The suffixes are as follows: * -ken (Áúå) for a prefecture; e.g., Yamanashi-ken * -to (ÈÉΩ, lit. \\"capital\\"), prefecture-level region name unique to the capital T≈çky≈ç-to * -fu (Â∫ú, lit. \\"office\\" or \\"area\\"), prefecture-level region (sometimes translated \\"urban prefecture\\") named so for historical reasons. There are now only two: ≈åsaka-fu and Ky≈çto-fu. Tokyo-to was also classified as this before being reorganized. * d≈ç (ÈÅì), an \\"administrative circuit\\", a semi-archaic administrative division formerly widespread. Modern usage is limited to Hokkaido, but terms like T≈çkaid≈ç (southern portion of eastern Japan) remains in common informal usage. Because of the above four suffixes, the prefectures of Japan are commonly referred to as tod≈çfuken (ÈÉΩÈÅìÂ∫úÁúå). And below the level of prefectures, there are: * -gun (ÈÉ°), a district composed of one or more machi or mura, usually rural. The Japanese postal service and many other sources translate this as county. * -shi (Â∏Ç), a city * -ku (Âå∫), a ward of a city; e.g., Naka-ku in Hiroshima. The 23 special wards of Tokyo are separate local governments nearly equivalent to cities. * -machi or -ch≈ç (Áî∫), a town - this can be a local government or a non-governmental division of a larger city * -mura or -son (Êùë), a village; e.g., Kamikuishiki-mura - this can also be a local government or a nongovernmental division of a larger city or town These smaller administrative units are collectively referred to as shikuch≈çson (Â∏ÇÂå∫Áî∫Êùë).

Some examples are * hama (Êµú) for a beach; e.g. Hamamatsu * hant≈ç (ÂçäÂ≥∂) for a peninsula; e.g., Izu Hanto * ishi (Áü≥) or iwa (Â≤©) for a rock; e.g., Ishikawa Prefecture; Iwate Prefecture * izumi (Ê≥â) for a spring; e.g., Hiraizumi, Iwate * kaiky≈ç (Êµ∑Â≥°) for a strait; e.g., Bungo kaiky≈ç * kawa or -gawa (Â∑ù or Ê≤≥) for a river; e.g., Asakawa * ko (Êπñ) for a lake; e.g., Biwa-ko, Kizaki-ko * nada (ÁÅò) for a sea * oka (Â≤°) for a hill; e.g., Fukuoka * saki (Â¥é) or misaki (Â≤¨) for a promontory; e.g., Miyazaki city * san or -zan (Â±±) or yama for a mountain; e.g., Yamanashi Prefecture, Aso-san * sawa or -zawa (Ê≤¢) for a swamp; e.g., Mizusawa, Iwate * shima or -jima (Â≥∂) or t≈ç for an island; e.g., Ie-shima, Iwo Jima, Okinawa Honto * tani or -dani (Ë∞∑) for a valley * wan (Êπæ) for a headland or bay; e.g., Sagami-wan Natural world Other words that express the natural world or agriculture often appear in place names: * ki or -gi (Êú®) for a tree; e.g., Tochigi Prefecture * matsu (Êùæ) for a pine tree; e.g. Takamatsu * mori (Ê£Æ) for a forest; e.g., Aomori Prefecture * sugi (Êùâ) for a sugi tree; e.g., Suginami * ta or -da (Áî∞) for a rice paddy; e.g. ≈åda Former provinces Names and parts of names of former provinces appear in many modern place names: * Yamato: Yamato-Koriyama, a city in Nara Prefecture * Hitachi: naka, a city in Ibaraki Prefecture * Sagami River in Kanagawa Prefecture * Tango: Tango Peninsula in Kyoto * Ch≈´etsu, part of Niigata Prefecture and location of the 2004 Ch≈´etsu earthquake: its name incorporates a kanji from Echigo Province (as do many other place names in the region) Medieval Japan Medieval Japan had many towns that fell into three categories: castle towns, post towns, harbor towns. In addition, the rise of commerce contributed to some place names. Here are some parts of names connected with medieval Japan: * ichi (Â∏Ç), a market; e.g., Yokkaichi: \\"fourth-day market\\" * -j≈ç (Âüé), a castle. Place names giving directions relative to a castle, such as J≈çhoku (North of the Castle), J≈çsai (West of the Castle) or J≈çnan (South of the Castle), are common throughout Japan. * minato (Ê∏Ø) or tsu (Ê¥•) for a harbor; e.g., Minato, Tokyo and Tsu, Mie * shuku or -juku (ÂÆø), a post or station town on a traditional highway; e.g., Shinjuku Hokkaido Many names in Hokkaido originated from words in the Ainu language, as people from mainland Japan conquered and colonized Hokkaido in the Edo period and the Meiji period. Examples of geographic features are -nai and -betsu meaning \\"river\\", as in the names Wakkanai and Noboribetsu. The name Esashi comes from the Ainu word esaushi, meaning \\"cape.\\" Some other names come from places in other parts of Japan because in the past people migrated as a group to Hokkaido, and they give the new settlement a name reminiscent of their old home. Examples include Hiroshima and Date, Hokkaido. Okinawa Place names in Okinawa Prefecture are drawn from the traditional Ryukyuan languages. Many place names use the unique languages names, while other place names have both a method of reading the name in Japanese and a way to read the name in one of the traditional local languages. The capital city Naha is Naafa in the Okinawan language. Uruma, which was incorporated in 2005, comes from an old name for the Okinawa Island meaning \\"coral island\\" and its name is written in hiragana rather than kanji. In Okinawan, nishi meant \\"north\\" rather than \\"west\\" as it does in standard Japanese, so Nishihara means \\"northern field\\" in respect to its position from the old Ry≈´ky≈´ Kingdom capital at Shuri; in contrast, the Okinawan word for \\"west\\" is iri, which appears in the name of Iriomote-jima. Gusuku (Âüé) meaning \\"castle\\" is also common in place names in Okinawa, found in Tomigusuku, Nakagusuku, and Kitanakagusuku, among others. Both Chatan and Yomitan turn tani (Ë∞∑, \\"valley\\") into tan; Chatan also turns kita (Âåó) into \\"cha\\" through the Okinawan language.

It was built as a tribute to Schuppan's 1983 24 Hours of Le Mans victory and 1983 All Japan Sports Prototype Championship title (Schuppan won both driving a Porsche 956).  Performance  The 962CR is a mid-engine, rear-wheel drive car that weighs 1,050 kg (2,315 lb). The car is powered by a water-cooled 3.3-litre Type-935 Flat-6 featuring twin KKK turbochargers producing (about 182 hp/L). Power goes to the rear wheels through a five-speed manual transmission. The engine was borrowed nearly directly from the standard Porsche 962 unit used in the North American IMSA GT Championship with a slight decrease in displacement. The car has a claimed top speed of , and a 0‚Äì60 mph (0-97 km/h) acceleration time of 3.5 seconds. It used a carbon fiber monocoque chassis and used titanium fasteners throughout.  History  The 962CR is based on the dominant Le Mans-winning Porsche 962 race car which Schuppan raced and owned with his own team. The carbon monocoques were built entirely by Reynard Motorsport and the body by Schuppan, although it featured design elements from the 962 race car. Final assembly took place at the 60,000 ft¬≤ Vern Schuppan Ltd production facility in High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, England. Funding was provided by Japanese investors who supported Schuppan's race team that competed in the All Japan Sports Prototype Championship. Failure of payment from Japan for two cars, coupled with the high cost of the car's construction and a worldwide economic recession, forced Schuppan to declare bankruptcy, folding his car company.  Cost  962CR rear end Priced at over US$1.5 million in 1994, the Schuppan 962CR is among the most expensive vehicles ever sold new. Rumors circulated for several years that the 962CR was sold new for US$2.5 million, but this rumor was eventually dispelled by author and Porsche enthusiast Karl Ludvigsen who listed a price of ¬•195 000 000 (Approximately US$1.9 million at the time).Japanese yen#Historical exchange rate  Production  Most sources say that six Schuppan 962CRs were built, with chassis #1 being a prototype chassis. In November 2014, chassis number 006 appeared at Daytona International Raceway on display during the Classic 24 hour race. The current owners confirmed that the car was never driven and had 0 miles on the odometer. The car had been owned by the company until it went bankrupt and it was given to one of the creditors as part of a deal to pay outstanding debt. The car was believed to be the only one in the United States. Even though six were built, there are only four remaining in existence due to one being destroyed in a fire.

Fossil remains are present in Eastern Africa including Kenya and Uganda. Four species have been classified to date: P. africanus, P. gitongai, P. major and P. meswae. The four species differ mainly in body size. Environmental reconstructions for the Early Miocene Proconsul sites are still tentative and range from forested environments to more open, arid grasslands. The gibbons and great apes, including humans, are held in evolutionary biology to share a common ancestral lineage, which may have included Proconsul. Its name, meaning \\"before Consul\\" (Consul being a certain chimpanzee that, at the time of the genus's discovery, was on display in London), implies that it is ancestral to the chimpanzee, which if true would also make it ancestral to the rest of the apes. Description They had a mixture of Old World monkey and ape characteristics, so their placement in the ape superfamily Hominoidea is tentative, with some scientists placing Proconsul outside it, before the split of the apes and Old World monkeys. Proconsul's monkey-like features include pronograde postures, indicated by a long flexible back, curved metacarpals, and an above-branch arboreal quadrupedal positional repertoire. The primary feature linking Proconsul with extant apes is its lack of a tail; other \\"ape- like\\" features include its enhanced grasping capabilities, stabilized elbow joint and facial structure. Proconsul could not hang effortlessly from tree branches like gibbons and other nonhuman apes do today. Discovery and classification The first specimen, a partial jaw discovered in 1909 by a gold prospector at Koru, near Kisumu in western Kenya, was also the oldest fossil hominoid known until recently, and the first fossil mammal ever found in sub-Saharan Africa. The name, Proconsul, was devised by Arthur Hopwood in 1933 and means \\"before Consul\\"; the name of a famous captive chimp in London. At the time Consul was being used as a circus name for performing chimpanzees. The Folies Berg√®re of 1903 in Paris had a popular performing chimpanzee named Consul, and so did the Belle Vue Zoo in Manchester, England, in 1894. On the latter's death in that year Ben Brierley wrote a commemorative poem wondering where the \\"Missing Link\\" between chimpanzees and men was. Hopwood in 1931 had discovered the fossils of three individuals while expeditioning with Louis Leakey in the vicinity of Lake Victoria. The Consul that he selected to use in the name was neither of the ones mentioned above, but another located in the London Zoo. Consul is being used Linnaean-style to symbolize the chimpanzee. Proconsul is therefore \\"ancestral to the Chimpanzee\\" in Hopwood's words. He also added africanus as the species name. Other fossils discovered later were initially classified as africanus and subsequently reclassified; that is, the total pool of fossils originally considered africanus was \\"split\\" and the fragments \\"lumped\\" with other finds to create a new species. For example, Mary Leakey's famous find of 1948 began as africanus and was split from it to be lumped with Thomas Whitworth's finds of 1951 as heseloni by Alan Walker in 1993. This process creates some confusion for the public, which is told that africanus became heseloni. The finds from Koru and Songhor are still considered africanus. Four species are still defined even though many fossils have jumped species. The family of Proconsulidae was first proposed by Louis Leakey in 1963, a decade after he and Wilfrid Le Gros Clark had defined africanus, nyanzae and major. It was not immediately accepted but ultimately prevailed. The history of hominoid classification in the second half of the 20th century is sufficiently complex to warrant a few books itself. Most of the palaeoanthropologists have changed their minds at least once as new fossils have come to light and new observations have been made, and will probably continue to do so. The classifications found in the literature of one decade are not generally the same as those of another.A recapitulation of the changing classifications of fossils at some time regarded as Proconsul can be found in For example, in 1987 Peter Andrews and Lawrence Martin, established palaeontologists, took the point of view that Proconsul is not a Hominoid, but is a sister taxon to it.. They also believed at that time that humans and African apes formed distinct clades. =Reassigned species= The species Proconsul heseloni and P. nyanzae have been reclassified in the new genus Ekembo.

A general strike was called for 6 April. Violent incidents began to occur on the evening ahead of the strike. The Joint People's Agitation Committee had called for a 30-minute 'lights out' in the capital, and violence erupted outside Bir Hospital when activists tried to enforce the 'lights out'. At dawn on 6 April, clashes between strike activists and police outside a police station in Pulchok (Patan) left two activists dead. Later in the day, a mass rally of the Agitation Committee at Tundikhel in the capital Kathmandu was attacked by police forces. As a result, riots broke out, and the Nepal Telecommunications building was set on fire. Police opened fire at the crowd, killing several persons.

The name first appeared around December 1989 in the Department of San Miguel. By April 1995, the group had stated that it had killed seventeen persons, claiming that those killed were criminals or members of gangs.. These vigilante groups are based in El Salvador. The government of El Salvador insists the groups are not under its control. Many Sombra Negra and/or death squads that are caught are incarcerated in separate prisons for their own safety. Sombra Negra members typically blindfolded and tied the hands and/or thumbs of their victims behind their backs. Several hours of torture would follow, often including the removal of the genitalia, hands, tongue, rectum and teeth. Finally, the victims were given tiros de gracia, or shots of grace, meaning they were shot in the base of their skulls with assault rifles and machine guns at close range. Messages were written on the victim's body such as \\"El idiota sufri√≥ una muerte lenta\\" (\\"this idiot suffered a slow death\\") and other insults or gang-related slang. Autopsies performed on murdered gang members found trace amounts of semen, suggesting sexual torture. The Sombra Negra operatives would conceal their face and body with bandanas, anthropomorphic costumes, and use unlicensed vehicles with darkened windows when they carried out their missions in order to avoid full detection. Sombra Negra stated that it killed people because the group believed that the police could not enforce laws of El Salvador and that it is waging a campaign of ‚Äúsocial cleansing‚Äù against gangs. Targeting MS-13 and 18th Street Gang Sombra Negra is well known for its specialty in pursuing and executing members of notorious El Salvador-based criminal organizations referred to as Maras or \\"gangs\\"‚Äîeven if they move and do their business in the United States, particularly Los Angeles. Similarly, Fernando Ramirez, a convicted felon serving 60 years in prison followed by five years of supervised release, asked in an interview for his tattoos to be removed before serving his sentence in San Salvador. Sombra Negra also targets MS-13 rivals the 18th Street Gang. Members of MS-13 are, in extreme cases, asking American judges to grant them asylum in fear of being murdered by Sombra Negra in El Salvador. As of 2014, an increase in gang violence has sparked a revival of activity for these death squads. The Salvadoran attorney general for human rights, David Morales, says this activity may be related to police activity. In an interview with Morales, the attorney general explained that the sombra negra has caused a rash of sexual assaults among gang members: \\"Gang members believe they [Sombra Negra] are infiltrating their ranks. Leadership and members [have] responded by raping suspected infiltrators.\\" Only 19 days into January 2019, El Salvador had already seen 200 murders across the country. Sombra Negra claims that all the murders were caused by gang activity. They claim that the common people are tired of the constant murders and mourning and label the gangs as terrorists. The death squad has expanded its territory of operation to El Salvador‚Äôs neighboring countries of Honduras and Guatemala to purify the three countries of the Northern Triangle. = Notable Killings = In 2014, the year Sombra Negra reemerged, members of the death squad dressed in all black clothing armed with M16 assault rifles raided a house of seven people, four of whom being members of MS-13. The four members were captured and tortured by Sombra Negra. All four were then killed with a single bullet to the back of the head. A few days following the attack, leaflets were posted in El Salvador threatening members of MS-13 to ‚Äúleave within five days or face certain death.‚Äù In March 2016, Sombra Negra members rounded up four MS-13 gang members and put them in the back of a pickup truck in the town of San Antonio Silva. They were taken to a soccer field were shot in the back of the head and their bodies were left on the field. On January 25, 2019, Sombra Negra murdered two members of MS-13. The first was in Para√≠so de Osorio, La Paz, where police found the gang member's corpse in a creek with his hands tied behind his back, legs tied together, gagged, and a bullet in his head. Next to the body was a sign which read \\"La Sombra Negra ha llegado a Para√≠so de Osorio. Ratas de la MS lleg√≥ su fin.\\" (The Sombra Negra has arrived to Para√≠so de Osorio. MS rats your time has come). The second was in San Jorge, San Miguel, with the body found in similar conditions. In popular culture In the 2015 AMC American post-apocalyptic horror drama television series, Fear the Walking Dead the character of Daniel Salazar played by Panamanian actor, Rub√©n Blades is a former member of Sombra Negra who had been coerced into joining one of the Salvadoran Junta death squads and was personally responsible for killing over one-hundred Salvadorans.

The Battle of Rostov (1941) was a battle of the Eastern Front of World War II, fought around Rostov-on-Don between the Army Group South of Nazi Germany and the Southern Front of the Soviet Union. The battle comprised three phases: the German Sea of Azov Offensive Operation by Army Group South (General Gerd von Rundstedt) (begun on 12 September 1941),p.87, Haupt, Army Group South the Soviet Rostov Defensive Operation (5 November 1941 ‚Äì 16 November 1941) by the Southern Front (General Yakov Timofeyevich Cherevichenko), and the Rostov Offensive Operation (27 November 1941 ‚Äì 2 December 1941) executed by the same Soviet Front. After forcing their way across the Mius river on 17 November, the German forces captured 10,000 Soviet troops and took Rostov on 21 November. Six days later the Southern Front, reinforced with the newly raised 37th Army, counterattacked from the north and threatened to surround the overstretched German III Motorized Army Corps. Rundstedt then ordered a retreat to the Mius line from Rostov to prevent the encirclement, which prompted Hitler to immediately fire him. Rundstedt's successor Walther von Reichenau confirmed the retreat order with the backing of the Army High Command Chief of Staff Franz Halder and Hitler relented. The Red Army retook Rostov on 28 November. It was the first successful major Soviet counteroffensive of the war.  Prelude  After concluding the Battle of Kiev in September 1941, the German Army Group South advanced from the Dniepr River to the Sea of Azov coast. Walther von Reichenau's 6th Army captured Kharkov in the First Battle of Kharkov. Carl-Heinrich von St√ºlpnagel's 17th Army advanced through Poltava towards Voroshilovgrad. Erich von Manstein's 11th Army moved into the Crimean Peninsula and took control of all of the peninsula by autumn (except Sevastopol, which held out until 3 July 1942). Ewald von Kleist's 1st Panzer Army advanced from Kiev, and encircled Soviet troops at Melitopol in October, then attacked east along the shore of the Sea of Azov toward Rostov at the mouth of the Don river, known as the gateway to the Caucasus.  Sea of Azov Offensive Operation  Rostov was assigned as the objective for the 11th Army now commanded by General Eugen Ritter von Schobert, however he died in a crash on the same day after landing his liaison aircraft in a minefield. To replace him, Manstein was ordered to travel from the Leningrad sector of the front to the extreme southern sector. He would also receive support from the 4th Luftwaffe Air Fleet. At this time the LIVth Army Corps of the 11th Army was still engaged in Crimea, and because the Romanian forces were still engaged in the Siege of Odessa, the Army's resources for the Rostov objective were severely limited even against retreating Red Army troops. Therefore, Manstein initially replaced the LIV Corps with the smaller XXXth Army Corps and XLIXth Mountain Corps and ordered the LIV Corps into the first echelon in the advance to Rostov. Late in September, the Romanian 3rd Army joined the 11th Army in its advance towards Rostov, but was severely depleted by the attacks of the Soviet 9th and 18th Armies on 26 September. This forced a halt to the Army's advance to safeguard its flank and forced Manstein to use his only mobile reserve unit, the Leibstandarte Brigade to shore up Romanian defenses.p. 91, Haupt, Army Group South  Rostov Defensive Operation  The Soviet counter- attack delivered as part of the general Donbass-Rostov Strategic Defensive Operation (29 September 1941 ‚Äì 16 November 1941) also forced Rundstedt's Army Group South to order his 1st Panzer Army to manoeuvre in order to be better placed to counter any further Soviet thrusts in the Romanian sector of the front, and also to attempt an encirclement of the two Soviet Armies, which was partly successful in the area of Chernigovka where on 8 October the commander of the 18th Soviet Army, General-Lieutenant A.K. Smirnov, was killed by artillery fire on his command post in the village of PopovkaAleksander A. Maslov, Fallen Soviet Generals, ed. & trans. by David M. Glantz, Frank Cass Publishing, London, 1998, p. 44 during the breakout attempt between 5 and 10 October 1941. This was interpreted by Hitler as such a success that he declared \\"The battle of the Sea of Azov is over\\" on 11 October before the troops had even reached their objective.p. 92, Haupt, Army Group South As a commemorative gesture, Hitler issued the order to redesignate the Leibstandarte Brigade as SS Division Leibstandarte. The German 11th Army was ordered back to Crimea to effect the breakthrough of the Isthmus of Perekop. Perceiving that the way to Rostov and the Caucasus was open, Hitler issued an order transferring the objective from the 11th Army to the 1st Panzer Army and attaching to it ill-prepared Romanian 3rd Army, the Italian Alpine Corps, and the Slovakian Motorised Brigade. During the subsequent reorganisation of Axis forces the III Panzer Corps and XIV Panzer Corps took the lead, supported by the XLIX Mountain Corps recently arrived from Crimea. Column of German Panzer III tanks in Rostov, November 1941. By 17 October 1941 the Mius River was crossed by the 14th Panzer Division and Taganrog was captured by German troops, with the mountain troops entering Stalino, forcing the newly formed 12th Army into a renewed withdrawal. However, the autumn rains had begun, and the Rasputitsa (\\"roadlessness\\") had set in slowing the 1st Panzer Army's advance to \\"meter by meter\\".p. 95, Haupt, Army Group South This meant that the leading German units did not reach the outskirts of Rostov until mid-November, having lost contact with the Red Army in the meantime.p.101, Haupt, Army Group South The assault on Rostov began on 17 November, and on 21 November the Germans took the city. However, the German lines were over-extended, and Kleist's warnings that his left flank was vulnerable and that his tanks were ineffective in the freezing weather were ignored.  Rostov Offensive Operation  On 27 November the 37th Army, commanded by Lieutenant-General Anton Ivanovich Lopatin, as part of the Rostov Strategic Offensive Operation (17 November 1941 ‚Äì 2 December 1941), counter-attacked the 1st Panzer Army's spearhead from the north, forcing them to pull out of the city. Adolf Hitler countermanded the retreat. When Rundstedt refused to obey, Hitler sacked him, and replaced him with Reichenau. However, Reichenau saw at once that Rundstedt was right and succeeded in persuading Hitler, via Franz Halder, to authorise the withdrawal,Clark, Alan (1965).

The Central Nucleus, which initially had also included Manmohan Adhikari and Shambhuram Shrestha, had tried to reorganize the party and reunite with the Pushpa Lal group. However, such a merger never took off, partly due to Pushpa Lal's hesitation to merge his own faction into another party (since he claimed to represent the legacy of the original Communist Party of Nepal) and partly due to Pushpa Lal's wish to collaborate with the Nepali Congress against the royal regime (which MBS did not accept). In the end the Central Nucleus was divided. By the mid-1970s, CPN (4th Convention) was the largest and most well-organised communist group in Nepal. The party would however disintegrate in internal divisions. In 1976 the Dang District Committee of the party revolted against the party leadership. The group published a document called Antar Party Sangarshkalagi (For inner-party struggle). The Dang District Committee broke away, and merged with the All Nepal Communist Revolutionary Coordination Committee (Marxist-Leninist).Rawal, Bhim. The Communist Movement in Nepal: Origin and Development. Kathmandu: Accham-Kathmandu Contact Forum, 2007. p. 85-86. In 1979 the Central Committee of the party published a document called Ranjinitik Simhavalokan (Political Appraisal), analysing the state of crisis inside the party. The party was unable to play any significant role in the emerging popular movements in Nepal (see 1979 student protests in Nepal). In 1980 a Central Committee member, Rishi Devkota (alias 'Azad') resigned from the party, accusing it of reformism and being soft on Soviet social imperialism. Split In 1983 the party suffered a serious split. In November 1983 the followers of MBS held a separate conference, and formed Communist Party of Nepal (Masal). Amongst those who followed MBS were Chitra Bahadur K.C., C.P. Gajurel, Mohan Baidhya, Khampa Singh, Bachaspati Devkota, Bhairav Regmi, R. ShresthaRawal, Bhim. The Communist Movement in Nepal: Origin and Development. Kathmandu: Accham-Kathmandu Contact Forum, 2007. p. 87. as well as future Maoist leaders like Pushpa Kamal Dahal and Baburam Bhattarai. The remainder, led by Nirmal Lama, continued to work under the name of CPN (4th Convention). The party held a National Organising Conference in December 1983. This was followed by a First National Conference of the party. In the conference there were 31 delegates from 17 districts, 17 observers and two representatives of the CPN (Masal) group. Notable members who stayed with CPN (4th Convention) were Jaya Govinda Shah, Suryanath Yadav, Dil Bahadur Shrestha, Nara Bahadur Karmacharya, Niranjan Chapagain, Shyam Shrestha and Kaila Ba (Devendra Lal Shrestha).Rawal, Bhim. The Communist Movement in Nepal: Origin and Development. Kathmandu: Accham-Kathmandu Contact Forum, 2007. p. 87-89. In a simplified manner one might say that the key issue behind the split was diverging opinion on who was the main enemy of the party. MBS claimed that the main enemy was India expansionism, which was backing up the royal house in Nepal. Since the Nepali Congress, according to him, were Indian puppets cooperation with them was not feasible. According to Lama was feudalism as the main enemy, and that the royal regime was propping up the feudal system. The main priority was to fight against the royal regime for a democratic opening, and thus fight against feudalism itself. To Lama, the Nepali Congress was a potential ally in this struggle. People's movement and transition to democracy CPN (4th Convention) was a member of the United Left Front and took part in the uprising against the autocratic regime in 1990. In November 1990, CPN (4th Convention) merged with Communist Party of Nepal (Mashal) and other smaller fractions, forming the Communist Party of Nepal (Unity Centre). Social analysis The party considered Nepal as a semi- feudal and semi-colonial country. The party identified the proletariat, peasants (ranging from poor to rich), petty bourgeoise and national capitalists as friendly classes, and saw feudal landlords and comprador- bureaucratic capitalists as class enemies.Rawal, Bhim.

Prime Head is the northernmost point of this peninsula. Some 20 kilometers southeast of Prime Head is Hope Bay with the year-round Argentinian Esperanza Base. History It was first sighted on 30 January 1820 by Edward Bransfield, Master, Royal Navy, immediately after his charting of the newly discovered South Shetland Islands nearby. In the century following the peninsula's discovery, chartmakers used various names (Trinity Land, Palmer Land, and Land of Louis Philippe) for this portion of it, each name having some historical merit. The recommended name derives from \\"Trinity Land\\", given by Bransfield during 1820 in likely recognition of the Corporation of Trinity House, Britain's historical maritime pilotage authority, although the precise application by him has not been identified with certainty and is a matter of different interpretation by Antarctic historians.

He is known for implementing Neoplatonic thought into mainstream kabbalistic tradition.  Biography  Azriel ibn Menahem ibn Ibrahim al-TarƒÅs was born around 1160 in Girona, Catalonia to the al-Taras family. His father Menahem was a minor rabbi in Girona. In his early years, Azriel moved to southern France, where he studied under Isaac the Blind. Azriel later travelled across Spain, preaching his kabbalistic views, however this proved to be unsuccessful, with Azriel later stating that \\"the philosophers believe in nothing that can not be demonstrated logically.\\" He later returned to Girona, where he founded a kabbalistic school. Amongst his main students, were Nachmanides and Abraham Zacuto. The poet Meshullam of Gerona hails Azriel as the greatest Kabbalist of Spain, and Isaac the Blind, later opposed Azriel's open propagation of kabbalistic doctrines in wider circles.  Theology  According to Azriel, the status and importance of the will of God surpasses all other attributes. He laid the foundation for the idea of Ein-Sof, by stating that God can have no desire, thought, word, or action, emphasized by it the negation of any attribute. Azriel goes on to adopt a gnostic approach, going as far as to say that all qualities of God are ascribed. Azriel investigates the relation of this En-Sof to the universe, asking \\"has the universe been created from nothing?\\" he explains \\"No, Aristotle is perfectly right in saying that nothing can proceed from nothing. Moreover, creation implies a decrease in the Creator's essence through subtraction, and that can not be predicated of the En-Sof. Nor can the universe have existed eternally, as Aristotle asserts, because nothing is eternal except for God.\\" In order to solve the problem of creation, Azriel recourses to the theory of emanation, which he develops as follows: The universe, with all its manifestations, was latent in the essence of the En-Sof, in which, notwithstanding its infinite variety, it formed an absolute unit, just like the various sparks and colors that proceed from the one and indivisible flame potential in the coal. The act of creation did not consist in producing an absolutely new thing; it was merely a transformation of potential existence into realized existence. Thus there was really no creation, but an Atziluth. The effluence was effectuated through successive gradations from the intellectual world to the material, from the indefinite to the definite. This material world, being limited and not perfect, could not proceed directly from the En-Sof; neither could it be independent of God. In that case God would be imperfect. There must have been, therefore, intermediaries between the En-Sof and the material world, and these intermediaries were the Ten Sefirot. The first Sefirah was latent in the En- Sof as a dynamic force. The second Sefirah emanated as a substratum for the intellectual world; afterward the other Sefirot emanated, forming the moral, the material, and the natural worlds. But this fact of emanation does not imply a gradation in the En-Sof, the flame of which is capable of igniting an indefinite number of lights. The Sefirot, according to their nature, are divided into three groups: the three superior forming the world of thought, the next three the world of soul, the last four the world of corporeality. They all depend upon one another, being united like links to the first one. Each of them has a positive and a passive quality, which emanates and receives.  Works  Azriel's works are as: * Shaar ha-Shoel (\\"The Gate of the Enquirer\\") - an explanation of the doctrine of the ten Sefirot in question and answer form, with the addition of Azriel's personal commentary. * Perush Sefer Yetzirah - a commentary on Sefer Yetzirah. * Perush Aggadot - a commentary to the talmudic aggadot. * Perush Tefillah - a commentary on the Jewish liturgy. Azriel also wrote a number of shorter treatises, the most important of which is a large section of a partly-preserved work called Derekh haEmunah veDerekh haKefirah (\\"The Way of Belief and the Way of Heresy\\").

He was born on the Leeuwkop farm, in the district of Smithfield in the Boer Republic of the Orange Free State. He later resided at Dewetsdorp, named after his father, Jacobus Ignatius de Wet. De Wet is mentioned in Rudyard Kipling's poem Ubique.Rudyard Kipling ‚Äì The Bard of British Imperialism at www.zeitcom.com He was a close personal friend of Helene Kr√∂ller-M√ºller, who commissioned a statue of him in the Hoge Veluwe National Park in the Netherlands. Military career De Wet served in the first Anglo-Boer War of 1880‚Äì81 as a field cornet, taking part in the Battle of Majuba Hill, in which the Boers achieved a victory over the British forces under Major General Sir George Pomeroy Colley. This eventually led to the end of the war and the reinstatement of the independence of the Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek, more commonly known as the Transvaal Republic. In the years between the First and Second Boer Wars, from 1881 to 1896, he lived on his farm, becoming a member of the Volksraad in 1897. =Second Boer War= In September 1899, de Wet and his three sons were called up as ordinary private burghers without any rank. He was a member of the Heilbron kommando and they were ordered to proceed to the Natal frontier.De Wet, Christiaan Rudolf, Three Years War (October 1899 ‚Äì June 1902), Archibald Constable and Co Ltd, Westminster, 1902, p. 10. On 11 October 1899, while he was reconnoitring the Natal frontier, De Wet was elected vice-commandant of Heilbron.De Wet (Archibald), supra, p. 13. He participated in the fight at Nicholson's Nek on 30 October, when 954 British officers and men surrendered.Thomas Pakenham, The Boer War, Weidenfeld and Nicolson, London, 1979, p. 155; De Wet (Archibald), supra, pp. 21‚Äì26. Thereafter, he took part in the Siege of Ladysmith.De Wet (Archibald), supra, pp. 29‚Äì31. On 9 December 1899, De Wet received a telegram from the State President, M.T. Steyn, informing him that he had been appointed a fighting general and was to proceed to the Western frontier.De Wet (Archibald), supra, p. 35. He found General Piet Cronj√© in command of the Boer forces ensconced at Magersfontein, south of Kimberley, while the English were at the Modder River. De Wet was to be Cronje's second-in-command.De Wet (Archibald), supra, p. 37. The British advance commenced on 11 February 1900, with General French outflanking Cronje at Magersfontein and riding towards Kimberley.Pakenham, supra, pp. 311‚Äì2 De Wet's raid on the ox wagon convoy at Watervals Drift, capturing 1600 oxen, did not stem the tide.Pakenham, supra, p. 319; De Wet (Archibald), supra, p. 47. The Siege of Kimberley was relieved on 15 February, and Cronje surrendered with 4000 men at Paardeberg on 27 February.De Wet (Archibald), supra, p. 63. Shortly thereafter, de Wet was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Free State forces.De Wet (Archibald), supra, p. 67. They could not contain the British advance towards the Free State capital, Bloemfontein, which was taken unopposed on 13 March 1900.De Wet (Archibald), supra, p. 73. His next successful action was the surprise attack on Sanna's Post near Bloemfontein on 31 March 1900. That was followed on 4 April by the victory of Reddersburg.Pakenham, supra, p. 580 De Wet came to be regarded as the most formidable leader of the Boers in their guerrilla warfare. Sometimes severely handled by the British, sometimes escaping only by the narrowest of margins from the columns which attempted to surround him, and falling upon and annihilating isolated British posts, De Wet continued his successful career to the end of the war, striking heavily where he could, and evading every attempt to bring him to bay. His brother, Piet Daniel De Wet, another successful Boer general, was captured by the British in July 1901 and subsequently served against Christiaan as a member of the National Scouts, who were Boers serving with the British forces.Thomas Pakenham, page 542 The Boer War, During the last phase of the war, the Afrikaner people of Winburg taunted the local British Army garrison with an English-language parody of Sir Walter Scott's Bonnie Dundee: > De Wet he is mounted, he rides up the street The English skedaddle an A1 > retreat!

De Wet took an active part in the peace negotiations of 1902. On 30 May 1902, he briefly took on the role of acting State President of the Orange Free State, when President Steyn had to leave the negotiations due to illness. De Wet was one of the signatories of the Treaty of Vereeniging.De Wet (Archibald), supra, pp. 373‚Äì392 Political career At the conclusion of the war he visited Europe with other Boer generals. While in England the generals unsuccessfully sought a modification of the peace terms concluded in Pretoria. De Wet wrote an account of his campaigns, an English version of which appeared in November 1902 under the title De Stryd tusschen Boer en Brit (Three Years War). In November 1907, he was elected a member of the first parliament of the Orange River Colony and was appointed minister of agriculture. In 1908-9 he was a delegate to the Closer Union Convention. De Wet was one of the leaders of the Maritz Rebellion which broke out in 1914. He was defeated at Mushroom Valley by General Botha on 12 November 1914, taken prisoner by cmdt Jorrie Jordaan (the commanding officer was Colonel Brits) on 1 December on a farm called Waterbury in the Northwest province near Tosca. The general remarked: \\"Thank God it is not an Englishman who captured me after all\\". He was sentenced to a term of six years imprisonment, with a fine of ¬£2000. He was released after one year's imprisonment, after giving a written promise to take no further part in politics. A monument/needle was erected at Waterbury and consecrated by his grandson Dr Carel de Wet on 14 February 1970, who was then minister of Health De Wet progressively weakened and at length, on 3 February 1922, he died on his farm. General Smuts, who had become prime minister, cabled his widow: \\"A prince and a great man has fallen today.\\" De Wet was given a state funeral in Bloemfontein and buried next to President Steyn and Emily Hobhouse at the foot of the memorial to the women and children who died in the concentration camps. On the hundredth anniversary of his birth, a bronze equestrian statue, by Coert Steynberg, was unveiled at the Raadzaal in Bloemfontein. Under the leadership of General Christiaan Rudolf de Wet a seemingly impossible war against an overwhelming and ruthless foreign aggressor came to an unprecedented end as a combined British force of over 50,000 soldiers could not capture De Wet and his remaining 700 Boer fighters on horse back. His relentless attacks and De Wet's strategic guerilla warfare tactics combined with mounting political pressure from the drawn-out war caused England to initiate a truce that ended the war. Generaal Christiaan Rudolf de Wet is described as an unyielding strict leader that united the Boer forces and inspired exceptional loyalty. A man of great faith, conviction and tenacity, De Wet evidently never doubted that they would ultimately prevail against the English aggressors. \\"If God is for us, who can stand against us?\\" The Fighting General.

The Aramaic epithet \\"Saggi Nehor\\" meaning \\"of Much Light\\" in the sense of having excellent eyesight, an ironic euphemism for being blind.. Some historians suspect him to be the author of the Book of the Bahir, an important early text of Kabbalah. Others (especially Gershom Scholem, see his Origins of the Kabbalah, p. 253) characterize this view as an \\"erroneous and totally unfounded hypothesis\\". Isaac was the son of the famous talmudist, Abraham ben David of Posqui√®res (Raavad). The Bahir first appeared in the Middle Ages, around 1200 CE in France. It discusses a number of ideas that became important for Kabbalah, and even though the origins of the anonymous work are obscure, there were important Kabbalists who were writing at the same time in France. The most influential of these was Isaac the Blind. Isaac the Blind's mystical concepts Image popularly thought to be a portrait of Isaac Isaac considered the sefirot as having their origins in a hidden and infinite level deep within the Ayn Sof, or Divine Being (lit. That Without End). He believed that from the Ayn Sof emanated Makhshava (Divine Thought), which was the first supernatural quality. The rest of the sefirot emanated from the Divine Thought. Individual beings in the world are material manifestation of the sefirot, albeit on a lower level of reality. Mystic experience aids in reascending the levels of emanations to unite with Divine Thought. The most famous student of Isaac was Azriel of Gerona.

CPN (Masal) was formed in 1983, following a split in the Communist Party of Nepal (Fourth Convention). The party was led by Mohan Bikram Singh. In 1984 CPN (Masal) was one of the founding parties of the Revolutionary Internationalist Movement. In 1985 the party split into Communist Party of Nepal (Masal) (led by MBS, which was in minority) and Communist Party of Nepal (Mashal) (led by Mohan Vaidya). Masal retained the RIM membership for some time. Masal was sometimes nicknamed Patalo Masal ('Thin Masal') to differentiate it from Moto Masal ('Thick Masal), i.e. Masal. Following the split, the Masal group was also known as Communist Party of Nepal (Mashal-COC). At the time of the mass upsurge against the monarchic dictatorship, Masal, Mashal and Communist Party of Nepal (Marxist-Leninist-Maoist) joined hands and formed the United National People's Movement as a common front. In 1991 a minority broke led by Dr. Baburam Bhattarai broke away from CPN (Masal) and joined the Communist Party of Nepal (Unity Centre). CPN (Masal) took part in the Joint People's Agitation Committee, which had called for a general strike on April 6, 1992. Violence erupted in the capital during the strike, and according to the human rights NGO HURON 14 people were killed in police firing.Hoftun, Martin, William Raeper and John Whelpton.

Sharma's group called for boycott of elections and support to armed struggle led by Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist). It later merged with the Maoists. At the party convention held December 1-December 5, 2001 CPN (Masal) decided to merge with Communist Party of Nepal (Unity Centre).Unity Centre and Masal to Unite - Nepali Times The merger became effective in early 2002, and the Communist Party of Nepal (Unity Centre-Masal) was formed. Social analysis The party considered Nepal as a semi-feudal and semi-colonial country. The party identified the proletariat, peasants (ranging from poor to rich), petty bourgeoise and national capitalists as friendly classes, and saw feudal landlords and comprador- bureaucratic capitalists as class enemies.Rawal, Bhim.

It was first published in the book Rosa y Azul, in 1977. In 1983, it was collected in the book Shakespeare's Memory. Plot The narrator of the story, Alexander Craigie, is a professor of logic who teaches at the University of Lahore in India, although he himself is of Scottish descent. He states that, since childhood, he has been fascinated by tigers, and when he hears of reports that a brilliantly colored blue tiger has been seen in the Ganges delta, he sets out to investigate. The narrator arrives at a village in rural India where the reports seem to have originated. The village elders are at first suspicious of his presence, but when he explains that the purpose of his visit is to capture the blue tiger, they are relieved. That night, he is awakened by the villagers who claim to have spotted the tiger, but when they take him to the scene, it is gone. After this happens several nights in a row, the narrator realizes that the people of the village are inventing these stories of sightings for his benefit, and begins to wonder if the tiger even exists. He begins to sense that these people have some other secret which they are keeping from him. One afternoon, the narrator suggests exploring the jungle-clad hill at whose foot the village is built. The villagers, in consternation, exclaim that the hill is sacred and terrible things will happen to anyone who sets foot on it. Craigie does not argue, but late that night, he leaves his hut and goes to climb the hill for himself. By the time he reaches the summit of the hill, it is close to dawn, and although the sky is beginning to brighten, not a single bird is singing. Although by this point he doubts whether the blue tiger exists, he instinctively looks down at the ground for tracks. In a crevice in the ground, he catches sight of a color: a brilliant blue color, the same one as the tiger of his dreams. Amazed, he looks more closely and finds that it is filled with small stones, all alike, so smooth and circular they seem more like buttons or coins than something natural. He puts a handful of the stones in his pocket and returns to the village. Back in his hut the next morning, the narrator takes the stones out of his pocket, only to find that there are between thirty and forty of them, far more than he picked up initially. He piles them up on the table and tries to count them, but finds to his astonishment that this is impossible. The disks seem to multiply, so that when he tries to separate one from all the rest, it becomes many. No matter how many times he repeats this experiment, the \\"obscene miracle\\" keeps recurring; and finding himself seized by a sort of terror, he scoops them all up at once and throws them out the window, somehow realizing in the process that their number has dwindled again. The villagers soon discover the stones, of whose existence they were aware (they call them \\"the stones that spawn\\"), and realize where Craigie has been. Some of them are superstitiously terrified, but others are curious, and for a time he shows them off, demonstrating how their numbers mysteriously multiply and dwindle. Soon, however, he too feels a sort of revulsion and ceases the demonstration, returning to his hut. The more time passes, the more he becomes obsessed, consumed with what he describes as the monstrousness of these stones that cannot be counted. He begins to wish that he was mad, since he feels that would be preferable to the discovery that the universe itself can tolerate this sort of irrationality. Becoming fearful that the villagers may try to murder him for having profaned their secret, Craigie returns to Lahore, but finds no relief from his growing obsession with the blue stones, which begin to haunt his dreams as well as his days. He performs experiments that involve marking the stones by cutting holes or lines in them; the marked stones vanish when the quantity changes, sometimes reappearing later, sometimes disappearing forever. He performs countless experiments, dividing the stones into groups and trying to determine some pattern in the way their numbers vary, but his efforts are fruitless; there is no order to them that he can determine. After a month he abandons his efforts, and during a sleepless night and dawn he walks through the gates of a mosque. Not knowing why, he dips his hands in the fountain and prays to be freed from his burden. He hears no footsteps, but suddenly a beggar is there, a blind man who asks for alms. Craigie says that he has no coins, but the beggar insists that he has many. Understanding, Craigie gives him the stones, and the beggar says that he will give him a gift in return: \\"You may keep your days and nights, and keep wisdom, habits, the world.\\" As silently as he appeared, the beggar vanishes into the dawn, taking the stones with him. Themes The story reiterates themes found elsewhere in Borges's writings. In particular, \\"The Zahir\\", \\"The Book of Sand\\", and \\"The Library of Babel\\" similarly deal with revulsion in the face of contemplating the infinite.

A number of his pictures are in the National Gallery, the Victoria and Albert Museum and The Collection, Lincoln. He died in London. Biography The early 19th-century Hilton House was the Lincoln home of celebrated artist Peter de Wint De Wint was the son of an English physician of Dutch extraction who had come to England from New York. He was born in Stone, Staffordshire. In 1800, William Hilton was apprenticed to the engraver John Raphael Smith, and around the same time enrolled at the Royal Academy school. Another apprentice from 1802 was Peter De Wint, they were inseparable friends. Apprenticed to John Raphael Smith, the mezzotint engraver and portrait painter, he bought his freedom from Smith in 1806, on condition that he supplied 18 oil paintings over the following two years. In 1806 he visited Lincoln for the first time, with the painter of historical subjects William Hilton, R.A., whose sister Harriet he married in 1810. De Wint and Hilton lived together in Broad Street, Golden Square, where John Varley lived. Varley gave De Wint lessons and introduced him to Dr Monro, who ran an informal academy for young artists. De Wint often visited Hilton's home in Up-Hill, Lincoln and painted many of his charming landscapes in the district. De Wint first exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1807, and the following year at the Gallery of Associated Artists in Watercolours. In 1809 entered the Royal Academy schools. He was elected an Associate of the Old Water Colour Society in 1810 and was made a full member the following year. By that time, as an established drawing-master, he was spending his summers teaching well-to-do provincial families. In 1812 he became a member of the Society of Painters in Watercolours, where he exhibited for many years, as well as at the Academy. De Wint's life was devoted to art; he painted admirably in oils, and he ranks as one of the chief English watercolorists. \\"No artist\\", asserted Alfred William Rich, \\"ever came nearer painting a perfect picture than did Peter de Wint.\\" He frequently visited his wife's home city of Lincoln, and many of his panoramic landscapes and haymaking scenes are set in Lincolnshire. He occasionally toured in Wales, and in 1828 travelled to Normandy. In Lincoln cathedral is a cenotaph erected by Harriet De Wint (1791-1866) in memory of the two artists - De Wint her husband, and Hilton, her brother. He was buried in the Hilton family grave in the Savoy Chapel (destroyed by fire on 7th July, 1864). The chapel was restored in 1866 and Mrs De Wint placed a beautiful font in the edifice. Close by a tablet bears the words. 'This font was presented to the Chapel Royal of the Savoy by Harriet De Wint, in place of a Monument previously erected to the memory of her brother William Hilton R.A. her husband Peter de Wint, and other members of her family, whose remains are interred in the adjoining cemetery. The Monument was destroyed by the fire, July VII., MDCCCLXIV. May this tribute be long preserved to the glory of God'.

History Messerschmitt, temporarily not allowed to manufacture aircraft, had turned its resources to making other products. In 1952, Fend approached Messerschmitt with the idea of manufacturing small motor vehicles.\\"Ist das nicht ein Kabinenroller?\\" p.163 These were based on his Fend Flitzer invalid carriage.\\"Ist das nicht ein Kabinenroller?\\" p.164-165 The first of Fend's vehicles to enter production at Messerschmitt's Regensburg factory was the KR175.\\"Ist das nicht ein Kabinenroller?\\" p.167 The title Kabinenroller means \\"scooter with cabin\\".\\"Ist das nicht ein Kabinenroller?\\" p.162 While the Messerschmitt name and insignia were used on the car, a separate company, incorporated as Regensburger Stahl- und Metallbau GmbH, was created to manufacture and market the vehicle. The KR200 replaced the KR175 in 1955. While using the same basic frame as the KR175 with changes to the bodywork (notably including wheel cutouts in the front fenders) and an improved canopy design,\\"Ist das nicht ein Kabinenroller?\\" p.168 the KR200 was otherwise an almost total redesign.Bruce Weiner Microcar Museum: 1955 Messerschmitt KR200 The rear suspension and engine mounting were reworked, and hydraulic shock absorbers were installed at all three wheels. Tire sizes were enlarged to 4.00√ó8. Retailing for around DM 2,500, the KR200 was considered an instant success with almost 12,000 built during its first year,\\"Erinnern Sie sich? Messerschmitt KR 200: Menschen in Aspik\\", pp. 74 ‚Äì 76 which was the highest annual production for Kabinenroller models. A maximum speed in excess of despite a claimed power output of only , 1 more PS than the 175 cc engine fom the KR175, reflected the vehicle's light weight and low aerodynamic drag. The KR200, however, was 23 kg heavier than the KR175 it replaced but had a 10 km/h (6 mph) higher top speed. An \\"Export\\" package included a two-tone paint scheme, painted hubcaps, a fully trimmed interior, a heater, a clock, and a sunshade for the canopy. In 1956, around a year after West Germany joined NATO, Messerschmitt was allowed to manufacture aircraft again and lost interest in Fend's microcars. Messerschmitt sold the Regensburg works to Fend who, with brake and hub supplier , formed Fahrzeug- und Maschinenbau GmbH Regensburg (FMR) to continue production of the KR200 and his other vehicles.\\"Ist das nicht ein Kabinenroller?\\" p.169 In 1957 the KR201 Roadster was launched and remained in production until 1964 with very limited numbers produced. It had a frameless windscreen with no window frames, an optional folding cloth roof and removable side curtains made from transparent plastic. In February FMR KaroExtrapost February 1958 1958, the KR200 Kabrio Limousine model was released, featuring a cloth convertible top and fixed side window frames. A Sport model was later offered with a cut down plexiglas windscreen with no roof and with fixed side panels so that the driver would have to climb in and out at the top of the car. Production of the Sport was extremely limited and, apart from the KR200 'Super' (see below) it is the rarest type of KR200.

The demand for basic economical transport in Germany had diminished as the German economy boomed. A similar situation developed in other parts of Europe such as in the manufacturer's biggest export destination, the United Kingdom, where sales were particularly affected by the increasing popularity of the Mini. A total of 30,286 units of the KR200 were built. =24-hour record run= Messerschmitt record car In 1955, in order to prove the KR200's durability, Messerschmitt prepared a KR200 to break the 24-hour speed record for three-wheeled vehicles under . The record car had a special single-seat low-drag body and a highly modified engine, but the suspension, steering, and braking components were stock. Throttle, brake, and clutch cables were duplicated.

Similar in concept to the Harley-Davidson Servi-Car and the Indian Dispatch Tow, the Service Car had a detachable tow bar and clamp, a revised front suspension to accommodate the tow bar when in use, and a storage system inside the car to accommodate the tow bar when not in use. The service technician would drive the Service Car to the customer's car and, if the customer's car was drivable, attach the tow bar to the front of the Service Car, clamp the other end of the tow bar to the bumper of the customer's car, and drive the customer's car to the garage. When the service was complete, he would drive the car back to the customer while towing the Service Car, detach the Service Car from the customer's car, and drive back to the garage. Approximately 12 were built; only one is known to exist at present.Bruce Weiner Microcar Museum: 1961 Messerschmitt Service Car Features The KR200 incorporated several features unique to the KR line and its four-wheeled derivative, the FMR Tg500.

Accessed and added 2014-09-20 The tandem seating also centralized the mass of the car along the longitudinal axis which, combined with the low center of gravity, low weight, and wheel placement at the vehicle's extremes, gave the KR200 good handling characteristics\\"Cleared for take-off\\", p.46 A more minor advantage of tandem seating was that it made an export version to countries that drive on the left unnecessary. An \\"Export\\" model was built, but this denoted a more luxurious trim level. =Bubble canopy= Messerschmitt Kabinenroller with Yƒ±lmaz Onay and Erol Keskin in Turkey, 1968 Entry to most KR models except the KR201 Sport Roadster and a corresponding Tg500 version was through a canopy door hinged on the right side of the vehicle. The door included all the windows (windshield, window frames on all but the Roadster models, folding top on Roadster and Kabrio models, and acrylic bubble on other versions) and the frame in which it was set, extending from the right side of the monocoque tub to the left. On Sport Roadster models, the canopy was fixed and there was neither a top nor any windows at all, only a tonneau cover. KR200 Kabrio; the folding top replaces the bubble in this version. The bubble top on the KR200 was simplified over that of the KR175 by the use of a larger curved glass windshield that formed A-pillars with the side window frames. This allowed the bubble to be simpler and more compact than the KR175 bubble, and it was consequently easier and less expensive to produce. The windshield wiper, manual on the KR175, was electric on the KR200. =Engine and transmission= The KR200 ran on a Fichtel & Sachs forced-air (fan) cooledMotor Cycle Data Book 1960, p.107 Brief specifications of three-wheeled light cars George Newnes Ltd., London. Accessed and added 2014-09-20 single cylinder two-stroke engine positioned in front of the rear wheel, just behind the passenger's seat. The engine had two sets of contact breaker points and, to reverse, the engine was stopped and then restarted, going backwards. This was effected by pushing the key further in the ignition switch than normal, whether intentionally or not. One result of this was that the KR200's sequential, positive-stop transmission provided the car with the same four gear ratios available in reverse as in forward movement. =Controls= Instruments and controls of a KR201 Roadster Apart from the dual-mode ignition, the KR200 had a steering bar reminiscent of that of an aircraft. To steer the KR200, the driver would swivel the steering bar about its axis from the horizontal (straight-ahead) position instead of rotating it as with a conventional steering wheel. The mechanism was connected directly to the track rods of the front wheels, providing an extremely direct response best suited to small amounts of movement, unlike other common steering mechanisms which involved reduction gearing.

The word is from the Latin recludere, which means \\"shut up\\" or \\"sequester\\". Historically, the word referred to a hermit's total isolation from the world. Examples are Symeon of Trier, who lived within the great Roman gate Porta Nigra with permission from the Archbishop of Trier, or Theophan the Recluse, the 19th-century Orthodox monk who was later glorified as a saint. Many celebrated figures of human history have spent significant portions of their lives as recluses. Causes There are many potential reasons for becoming a recluse, including, but are not limited to: a personal philosophy may reject consumer society; a mystical religious outlook may involve becoming a hermit or an anchorite; a survivalist may be practicing self-sufficiency; a criminal might hide away from people to avoid detection by police; or a misanthrope may be unable to tolerate human society. In the Russian Orthodox and Catholic Church tradition, a temporary hermit is called a Poustinik, where one has been called to pray and fast alone in a cabin for a minimum of 24 hours. In ancient Chinese culture, scholars are encouraged to be a public servant in a scrupulous and well-run government but are expected to go into reclusion as a yinshi (Èö±Â£´, 'gentleman-in-hiding') when the government is rife with corruption.Analects 8:13 „ÄäË´ñË™û ¬∑ Ê≥∞‰ºØ„ÄãÔºöÂ§©‰∏ãÊúâÈÅìÂâáË¶ãÔºåÁÑ°ÈÅìÂâáÈö±„ÄÇShow you talents [through public service] in a well-governed world; go into hiding in dark times. Others, like Dongfang Shuo, became hermits to practice Taoism, or in later centuries, Chan (Zen) Buddhism. It can also be due to psychological reasons, such as posttraumatic stress disorder, social anxiety disorder, apathy, autism, depression, obsessive‚Äìcompulsive disorder, intellectual disability, schizoid personality disorder, schizotypal personality disorder or avoidant personality disorder. In Japan, an estimated 1.2 million people are part of the phenomenon of \\"Hikikomori\\" or \\"social withdrawal\\", a problem often blamed on Japan's education system and social pressure to succeed. Commentary Entrepreneur Kim Smiley wrote, \\"We live in a society that stigmatizes seclusion, yet has an almost rabid fascination with it at the same time. A survey of history shows that some of the most brilliant thinkers, writers and artists turned their backs on society to embrace a life of voluntary seclusion.\\" Melanie Tannenbaum also noted in Pacific Standard that socially isolated children are \\"significantly less likely than their more social counterparts to engage in delinquent behavior during middle and high school\\". In Psychology Today, career coach Marty Nemko argued that the reclusive lifestyle is worthy of more consideration, stating that people who live alone are more likely to find satisfying work due to a lack of responsibility to support a family. Notable recluses Many high achievers of human history were reclusive. These include the writers Virgil, Meng Haoran, Emily Bront√´, J. D. Salinger, Emily Dickinson, Gustave Flaubert, H. P. Lovecraft, Thomas Ligotti, Marcel Proust, Thomas Pynchon, John Swartzwelder, and Caryl Churchill; the painters Michelangelo, Paul C√©zanne, and Jackson Pollock; the scientists Isaac Newton, Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, and Marie Curie; the musical figures George Harrison, Mina Mazzini, Arturo Benedetti Michelangeli,\\"Arturo Benedetti Michelangeli, Reclusive Pianist, Is Dead at 75,\\" The New York Times, 13 June 1995 Glenn Gould, Lee Mavers, Layne Staley, Syd Barrett, Michael Jackson, and Mark Hollis; the inventors Nikola Tesla and Paul Allen; chess player Bobby Fischer; basketball player Pete Maravich; naturalist Richard Proenneke; filmmaker Jean-Luc Godard; aviator Howard Hughes; and actress Greta Garbo.

Today it is one of the most visited and widely used parks in the city by residents, nearby office workers and tourists. The gardens are notable for their archaeological, horticultural, historical and social significance to the history of Melbourne. The gardens are 7.2 hectares (18 acres) of Crown Land bounded by William, La Trobe, King and Dudley streets, managed by the City of Melbourne. On the southeast corner opposite is the entrance to Flagstaff railway station. Diagonally opposite stands the Victorian branch of the Royal Mint, established 7 August 1869. The former Royal Mint building is a well-preserved example of Victorian Gold Rush boom-period classical styled architecture. The facade features paired columns with scrolled capitals and the Royal Mint coat-of- arms. On the northeast corner over William Street, is the Queen Victoria Market. The park contains extensive lawns with a variety of mature trees, flowerbeds and wild animals including possums. The southern end is characterised by deciduous trees, while the northern end contains mature eucalypts. Avenues of elms shade pathways along with several large Moreton Bay Fig trees. The north corner contains a bowling lawn, rose beds, flower and shrub beds. Along William Street there are tennis courts, which also double as volleyball, handball and netball courts. Electric barbecues nearby provides a popular site for office parties in December. Scattered about the lawns and gardens are memorials and sculptures that illuminate some of the social significance of the area. Flagstaff Gardens have been classified by the National Trust of Australia (Victoria) and is listed by the Australian Heritage Commission and the Victorian Heritage Register. At the listing ceremony by the Victorian Heritage Council in April 2004, Council Chair Chris Gallagher said \\"This listing ensures the much loved trees, landscaping and other individual features are conserved and protected. But it also means the whole site is recognised as an important place for gaining an insight into our historical, archaeological, aesthetic, horticultural and social heritage.\\" History With the establishment of Melbourne in 1835, the first deaths in the colony were buried on high ground between William and King Streets, in what was colloquially called Burial Hill.

Life Decamps was born in Paris. In his youth he travelled in the East, and reproduced Oriental life and scenery with a bold fidelity to nature that puzzled conventional critics. His powers, however, soon came to be recognized, and he was ranked along with Delacroix and Ingres as one of the leaders of the French school. At the Paris Exhibition of 1855 he received the grand or council medal. Most of his life was passed in the neighborhood of Paris. He was fond of animals, especially dogs, and indulged in all kinds of field sports. Endnote: *Adolphe Moreau, Decamps et son oeuvre (Paris, 1869) He died in 1860 in consequence of being thrown from a horse while hunting at Fontainebleau. Founding father of Orientalism Decamps was the founding father of Orientalism since he revealed everyday Oriental life in the 1831 Salon in Paris. His subjects and style with strong contrast of light and thick material became the reference for painters but also photographers and writers. He was the most influential painter on Orientalism and was proclaimed the chief of the new Orientalist School. Delacroix referred to him in the Women of Algiers (1834), and the Fanatics of Tangiers (1838). Th√©ophile Gautier's Constantinople (1853) was described as an ‚Äúimmense verbal Decamps‚Äù by Henry James. Maxime Du Camp named him the Christopher Columbus of the Orient and Th√©ophile Gautier compared his role as the discoverer of the Orient to the role of Jean-Jacques Rousseau as the discoverer of nature in the eighteenth century. Christine Peltre concludes that the only equivalent to his fame were the Arabian Nights (One Thousand and One Nights). Works Decamps' style was characteristically and intensely French. It was marked by vivid dramatic conception, bold and even rough brushstrokes, and startling contrasts of color and of light and shade. His subjects embraced an unusually wide range. He availed himself of his travels in the East in dealing with scenes from Scripture history, which he was probably the first of European painters to represent with their true and natural local background. Of this class were his Joseph sold by his Brethren, Moses taken from the Nile, and his scenes from the life of Samson, nine vigorous sketches in charcoal and white. A version of The Turkish Patrol (1831) Perhaps the most impressive of his historical pictures is Defeat of the Cimbri, representing the conflict between a horde of barbarians and a disciplined army. Decamps produced a number of genre pictures, chiefly scenes from French and Turkish domestic life, the most marked feature of which is humour. The same characteristic attaches to many of his numerous animal paintings; Decamps was especially fond of painting monkeys. His well-known painting The Monkey Connoisseurs satirizes the jury of the French Academy of Painting, which had rejected several of his earlier works on account of their divergence from any known standard. His paintings and drawings were first made familiar to the English public through the lithographs of Eugene le Rouit.

He was the primary representative of the musical movement known as musique mesur√©e, and a significant composer of the \\"Parisian\\" chanson, the predominant secular form in France in the latter half of the 16th century. His fame was widespread in Europe, and he ranks as one of the most influential composers of the time. Life He was born in Valenciennes, where he probably received his early musical training. Sometime fairly early in life he became a Protestant. The first record of his musical activity is from 1552, when four chansons attributed to him were published at Leuven, in anthologies of works by several composers.Frank Dobbins and Isabelle His, \\"Claude Le Jeune,\\" The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians Second Edition 14 (New York: Macmillan Publishers Limited, 2001), 531. In 1564 he moved to Paris, where he became acquainted with the Huguenots.Reese, p. 383 By this time he had already acquired some international fame, as evidenced by the appearance of his name in a list of \\"contemporary composers of excellence\\" in a manuscript copy of the Penitential Psalms of Orlande de Lassus, which were probably composed in the 1560s in Munich. Lassus may have met Le Jeune in the mid-1550s during a trip to France; however this has not been definitely established. In 1570 Le Jeune began his association with the Academie de musique et de po√©sie, headed by Jean-Antoine de Ba√Øf, an association which was to be decisive both on Le Jeune's music and on the direction taken by the Academie. That Ba√Øf was a Catholic, who even wrote a sonnet extravagantly praising the St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre in 1572 (in which somewhere between 5,000 and 30,000 Protestants were murdered) appears not to have dissuaded Le Jeune from working with him, and Le Jeune continued to set his poetry, and follow the ideals of the Academie, into the 1580s. In 1581, in collaboration with Ba√Øf, d'Aubign√© and Ronsard, he wrote incidental music for the wedding of the Duke of Joyeuse and the queen's half- sister, Marie de Lorraine.Dobbins/His, Grove online Unfortunately, Le Jeune was found out to be the author of an anti-Catholic tract in 1589, and was forced to flee Paris during the siege that year: only the intervention of his friend, the composer Jacques Mauduit, at the city's St. Denis gate saved his life and prevented the destruction of the manuscripts he carried with him (according to Marin Mersenne, who wrote extensively about both composers in his Harmonie universelle of 1637). Other Huguenot composers were not so fortunate. Claude Goudimel, a very similar composer who Le Jeune may have known, was murdered by a Catholic mob in Lyon during the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre in late August 1572. Next, Le Jeune settled in La Rochelle, a stronghold of the Huguenots, but sometime in the mid-1590s he must have returned to Paris, for his name appears in a list of musicians of the royal household of Henry IV both in 1596 and 1600. Few other details from late in his life are known, but he must have been composing prolifically, judging by the enormous quantity of music which remained in manuscript at his death, most of which was published in the first two decades of the 17th century. He died in Paris, and is buried in the Protestant cemetery of La Trinit√©. Music and influence Le Jeune was the most famous composer of secular music in France in the late 16th century, and his preferred form was the chanson. After 1570, most of the chansons he wrote incorporated the ideas of musique mesur√©e, the musical analogue to the poetic movement known as vers mesur√©e, in which the music reflected the exact stress accents of the French language. In musique mesur√©e, stressed versus unstressed syllables in the text would be set in a musical ratio of 2:1, i.e. a stressed syllable could get a quarter note while an unstressed syllable could get an eighth note. Since the meter of the verse was usually flexible, the result was a musical style which is best transcribed without meter, and which sounds to the modern ear to have rapidly changing meters, for example alternating 2/8, 3/8, etc. In opposition to the chanson style of the Netherlandish composers writing at the same time, Le Jeune's \\"Parisian\\" chansons in musique mesur√©e were usually light and homophonic in texture. They were sung a cappella, and were usually from three to seven voices, though sometimes he wrote for as many as eight. Probably his most famous secular work is his collection of thirty-three airs mesur√©s and six chansons, all to poems by Ba√Øf, entitled Le printemps. Occasionally he wrote in a contrapuntal idiom reminiscent of the more severe style of his Netherlandish contemporaries, sometimes with a satirical intent; and in addition he sometimes used melodic intervals which were \\"forbidden\\" by current rules, such as the expressive diminished fourth; these strictures were codified by contemporary theorists such as Gioseffe Zarlino in Venice, and were well known to Le Jeune. Le Jeune also was keenly aware of the current humanist research into ancient Greek music theory. Greek use of the modes and the three genera intrigued him, and in his music he used both the diatonic genus (a tetrachord made up of semitone, tone, and tone) and the chromatic genus (a tetrachord made up of semitone, semitone, and an augmented second). (The enharmonic genus, consisting of quarter tone, quarter tone, and major third, was rarely used in the 16th century, although Italian theorist and composer Nicola Vicentino constructed an instrument allowing it to be used in performance.) His chansons using the chromatic genus are among the most chromatic compositions prior to the madrigals of Gesualdo. Probably Le Jeune's most famous sacred work is his Dod√©cacorde, a series of twelve psalm settings which he published in La Rochelle in 1598. Each of the psalms is set in a different one of the twelve modes as given by Zarlino. Some of his psalm settings are for large forces: for example he uses sixteen voices in his setting of Psalm 52. Published posthumously was a collection of all 150 psalms, Les 150 pseaumes, for four and five voices; some of these were extremely popular, and were reprinted in several European countries throughout the 17th century. His last completed work, published in 1606, was a collection of thirty-six songs based on eight-line poems, divided into twelve groups, each of which contained three settings in each of the twelve modes. The work, Octonaires de la vanit√© et inconstances du monde (Eight-line Poems on the Vanity and Inconstancy of the World), based on poems by the Calvinist preacher Antoine de Chandieu, was for groups of three or four voices. According to Le Jeune's sister Cecile, who wrote the introduction to the publication, he had intended to complete another set for more voices but died before finishing it. It was one of the last collections of chansons of the Renaissance, of any type; following its publication, the air de cour was the predominant genre of secular song composition in France. Of Le Jeune's sacred music, a total of 347 psalm settings, thirty-eight sacred chansons, eleven motets, and a mass setting have survived. His secular output included 146 airs, most of which were in the style of musique mesur√©e, as well as sixty-six chansons, and forty-three Italian madrigals. In addition, three instrumental fantasias were published posthumously in 1612, as well as some works for lute. He was fortunate in that his copious manuscripts were published after his death: his friend, the equally gifted and prolific composer Jacques Mauduit, was fated to have most of his music lost. Contemporary critics accused Le Jeune of violating some of the rules of good melodic writing and counterpoint, for example using the melodic interval of the major sixth (something Palestrina would never have done), and frequently crossing voices; some of these compositional devices were to become features of the Baroque style, premonitions of which were beginning to appear even in France towards the end of the 16th century.

Ein Sof may be translated as \\"unending\\", \\"(there is) no end\\", or infinity.morfix online dictionary It was first used by Azriel ( 1160 ‚Äì 1238), who, sharing the Neoplatonic belief that God can have no desire, thought, word, or action, emphasized by it the negation of any attribute. Of the Ein Sof, nothing (\\"Ein\\") can be grasped (\\"Sof\\"-limitation). It is the origin of the Ohr Ein Sof, the \\"Infinite Light\\" of paradoxical divine self-knowledge, nullified within the Ein Sof prior to creation. In Lurianic Kabbalah, the first act of creation, the Tzimtzum self \\"withdrawal\\" of God to create an \\"empty space\\", takes place from there. In Hasidic Judaism, the Tzimtzum is only the illusionary concealment of the Ohr Ein Sof, giving rise to monistic panentheism. Consequently, Hasidism focuses on the Atzmus divine essence, rooted higher within the Godhead than the Ein Sof, which is limited to infinitude, and reflected in the essence (etzem) of the Torah and the soul. Explanation The Zohar explains the term \\"Ein Sof\\" as follows: In other words, \\"Ein Sof\\" signifies \\"the nameless being\\". In another passage the Zohar reduces the term to \\"Ein\\" (non-existent), because God so transcends human understanding as to be practically non-existent.Zohar, ib. part iii. 288b In addition to the Sefer Yetzirah and the Zohar, other well-known explications of the relation between Ein Sof and all other realities and levels of reality have been formulated by the Jewish mystical thinkers of the Middle Ages, such as Isaac the Blind and Azriel. Judah ·∏§ayya·π≠, in his commentary Min·∏•at Yehudah on the Ma'areket Elahut, gives the following explanation of the term \\"Ein Sof\\": The Ten Sefirot According to Gershom Scholem, the Ein Sof is the emanator of the ten sefirot. Sefirot are energy emanations found on the Kabbalistic Tree of Life. Ein Sof, the Atik Yomin (\\"Ancient of Days\\"), emanates the sefirot into the cosmic womb of the Ayin in a manner that results in the created universe. The three letters composing the word \\"Ayin\\" (◊ê◊ô◊¥◊ü), indicate the first three purely intellectual sefirot, which precede any emotion or action.Shoshan Sodot, 1b The order of devolution can be described as: The ten sefirot were preceded by a stage of concealment called tzimtzum, which \\"allows space\\" for creations to perceive themselves as separate existences from their creator. The sefirot exhibit reflection in sets of triads between more exalted states of being (or \\"non-being,\\" when \\"otherness\\" does not yet exist) and the lower, more mundane levels of existence: * Ayin, Ein Sof, Ohr Ein Sof * Keter, Chokhmah, Binah * Chesed, Gevurah, Tiferet * Netzach, Hod, Yesod The sefirot consist of lights invested in vessels, similar to water poured into a glass. While taking on the shape of the glass, the water is essentially unchanged. Concerned that misinterpretation could lead to the idolatrous belief of duality or multiplicity in God, the Kabbalists frequently stress that the sefirot are bound up in the Ein Sof, and that without the Ein Sof the sefirot have no existence. However, there is an apparent contradiction, since in Kabbalah, the sefirot are sometimes called divine in themselves, despite the assertion that they are only vehicles to manifest God. Moses ben Jacob Cordovero, who gave the first full systemization of Kabbalah in the 16th century, resolved the contradiction, explaining that the sefirot consist of lights invested in vessels. In detail, whereas the vessels are differentiated vehicles for creation, the light is the undifferentiated light of the Ein Sof. This is similar to how water poured into differently-shaped vessels will take on the vessels' forms, or how light streaming through different colors of glass appears in different colors. Despite the change in appearance, the water and the light emanate from a single source and are essentially unchanged; the vessels merely serve to filter and veil the light to reveal different aspects of the creator, and to permit creations to benefit from his light. This explanation was accepted and expanded upon in later works of Kabbalah and Hasidic philosophy.Tanya, ch. 2, author's note.Hemshech Samech Vov, pp. 3-4, 6. Atzmus Hasidic Judaism in the 18th century internalised the esoteric, transcendent emanations of Kabbalah into immanent, psychological perception and correspondence.Overview of Chassidut from inner.org The term in Hasidic philosophy for the divine source is Atzmus (\\"essence\\"). While the Ein Sof of Kabbalah can only be infinite, Atzmus, rooted higher in the Godhead, is beyond finite/infinite duality. As the Etzem, it both transcends all levels, and permeates all levels. This is reflected in the paradoxical acosmic monism of Hasidic panentheism, and relates to the essence of the Torah and the soul. In Hasidic thought, Kabbalah corresponds to the World of Atzilus, the sephirah of Chochmah and the transcendent soul level of Chayah; Hasidic philosophy corresponds to the World of Adam Kadmon, the sephirah of Keter and the soul essence of Yechidah.On the essence of Chassidus, Kehot publications, New York The Baal Shem Tov taught that the only reflection of Atzmus is the sincerity of the soul in performing the Jewish observances and prayer. Consequently, Hasidism gave new emphasis to the common folk, and to prayer and action over traditionally pre-eminent Torah study, as Atzmus is most reflected in the lowest levels, the purpose of creation in making a \\"dwelling place\\" for God in the lowest realms.

He was born in Berlin, and was educated at the University of Berlin. He subsequently studied mining in Bochum and Essen, and was in 1820 placed in the mining department of the Prussian state, serving on the staff until 1864. Dechen was a professor at the University of Berlin from 1834‚Äì41, after which he became director of the Prussian mining department while stationed at Bonn. In the early years he made journeys to study the mining systems of other countries, and with this object he visited England and Scotland in company with Karl von Oeynhausen (1797‚Äì1865). In the course of his work he paid special attention to the coal-formation of Westphalia and northern Europe generally, and he greatly furthered the progress made in mining and metallurgical works in Rhenish Prussia. He made numerous contributions to geological literature; notably the following: * Geognostische Umrisse der Rheinl√§nder zwischen Basel und Mainz mit besonderer R√ºcksicht auf das Vorkommen des Steinsalzes (with von Oeynhausen and La Roche), 2 vols.

As the oldest son and oldest living child of civil rights leaders Martin Luther King Jr. and Coretta Scott King, King served as the 4th President of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference from 1997 to 2004.  Early life  Martin Luther King III was born on October 23, 1957, to civil rights advocates Martin Luther King Jr. and Coretta Scott King. His mother had reservations about naming him after his famous father, \\"realizing the burdens it can create for the child,\\" but King Jr. always wanted to name his son Martin Luther III. King's birth occurred as his father was speaking to members of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, and he announced his son's name after being told of the birth.Manheimer, p. 46. King's birth caused much of his mother's time to be taken away from her artistry and she spent the remainder of his birth year caring for him and his older sister Yolanda.Bagley, p. 148. Martin Luther King III has three siblings; the late Yolanda Denise King, Dexter Scott King and Rev. Bernice Albertine King. They were raised in Vine City, an urban neighborhood in Atlanta, Georgia. When he was eight years old and only in the third grade, he began to endure racial comments and insults from a Caucasian boy in his class, who also happened to like to draw. When he approached the boy and complimented him on a drawing of his, the harassment ceased. King was ten years old when his father was assassinated. Years prior to his father's death, Harry Belafonte set up a trust fund for King and his siblings. After he attended The Galloway School, King attended Morehouse College, the same school where his father, grandfather, and great-grandfather attended. King is a member of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity, as was his father. He received his B.A. degree in political science from Morehouse College in 1979. King lived with his mother in his childhood home until his adulthood.  Adult life and career  On June 26, 1985, King was arrested, along with his mother and his sister Bernice, while taking part in an anti-apartheid protest at the Embassy of South Africa in Washington, D.C. On January 7, 1986, Martin Luther King III and his sisters were arrested for \\"disorderly conduct\\" by officers deployed to a Winn Dixie supermarket, which had been the subject of some protesting since September of the previous year. On June 9, 1986, he announced his candidacy for the Fulton County Commission, becoming the first of his father's immediate family to become directly involved in politics. Alongside Kerry Kennedy, King opposed the death penalty in 1989, stating \\"If we believed in an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth, most of us would be without eyes and without teeth.\\". King served as an elected county commission member in Fulton County, Georgia, the county encompassing most of Atlanta, from 1987 to 1993. Also in 1993, King helped found the Estate of Martin Luther King Jr. Inc., the company that manages the license of Martin Luther King Jr.'s image and intellectual property. King remains a commissioner in the company as of 2008. During his service as a commissioner in Fulton County, King expressed appreciation to an officer who potentially saved his mother from harm from a crazed man. In February 2009, King and his wife traveled to India, fifty years after his father and mother made the trip. During his stay in India, King led a delegation, which included John Lewis and Andrew Young. In New Delhi, King visited museums on Mahatma Gandhi's life and answered questions from students. King denounced the war in Iraq and the Mumbai attacks during a lecture at the Indian Council for Cultural Relations. King urged Texas to grant a reprieve to death row inmate Rodney Reed in 2019 and urged Alabama to stop the execution of Nathaniel Woods in 2020.  Working with Barack Obama  Martin Luther King III spoke on behalf of the 2008 Democratic Party presidential nominee, Senator Barack Obama, at the Democratic National Convention on August 28, 2008. The event marked the 45th anniversary of the \\"I Have a Dream\\" speech and the first time an African American accepted the presidential nomination of a major party.Rodgers, Jacob. \\"DNC: Martin Luther King III speaks on historic anniversary.\\" Fort Collins Weekly, August 28, 2008. Retrieved on August 28, 2008. King said his father would be \\"proud of Barack Obama, proud of the party that nominated him, and proud of the America that will elect him.\\"\\"Tonight we witness what has become of his dream...\\" New England Cable News, August 28, 2008. Retrieved on August 28, 2008. However, he also warned that his father's dream would not be completely fulfilled even if Obama won the presidency, because the country was suffering from a poor health care system, education system, housing market and justice system, and that \\"we all have to roll up our sleeves and do work to ensure that the dream that he shared can be fulfilled.\\" On January 19, 2009, the Martin Luther King Jr. national holiday, King joined Obama in painting and refurbishing the Sasha Bruce Youthwork shelter for homeless teens in Northeast Washington for the nationwide day of community service. Michael Jackson's memorial service Martin Luther King III gave a tribute at Michael Jackson's memorial service on July 7, 2009, and spoke at Jackson's funeral at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, California, alongside his sister, Bernice. He also spoke as a campus guest speaker at SUNY Canton on February 23, 2010, at the College Union Board's invitation.  Public response during Trump impeachment trial  On Monday, February 3, 2020, Kenneth Starr, a member of President Trump's legal counsel in the Impeachment Trial, quoted Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. on the Senate floor in his defense of the President. Martin Luther King III responded in a public statement released the following day. The Hill reported that \\"King accused the Trump administration of invoking his father while failing to address the political issues most important to him and his civil rights advocacy.\\" . In his statement, King stated: \\"Martin Luther King Jr.‚Äôs name is synonymous with justice and fairness. He certainly believed that justice and fairness should be available to everyone. But what mockery, what hypocrisy, and rank opportunism to equate my father‚Äôs views about 246 years of enslavement and almost 100 year of segregation and their client‚Äôs intent to undermine constitutional governance\\".  Southern Christian Leadership Conference  In 1997, King was unanimously elected to head the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), a civil rights organization his father founded. King was the fourth president of the group, which sought to fight police brutality and start new local chapters during the first years of his tenure. Under King's leadership, the SCLC held hearings on police brutality, organized a rally for the 37th anniversary of the \\"I Have a Dream\\" speech and launched a successful campaign to change the Georgia state flag, which previously featured a large Confederate cross. Within only a few months of taking the position, however, King was criticized by the SCLC board for failing to answer their correspondence or to take up issues important to the organization. The board also felt he failed to demonstrate against national issues the SCLC would previously have protested, including the disenfranchisement of black voters in the Florida election recount and time limits on welfare recipients implemented by then-President Bill Clinton. King was further criticized for failing to join the battle against AIDS, allegedly because he feels uncomfortable talking about condoms. He also hired Lamell J. McMorris, an executive director who, according to The New York Times, \\"rubbed board members the wrong way.\\" In January 2000, King joined members of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference in getting tested for prostate cancer during a program of the group aimed encouraging aging African-American men to do the same. Comedian Dick Gregory participated in the program as well. On April 4, 2000, the thirty- second anniversary of his father's death, King joined his mother, brother, sister Bernice and aunt Christine King Ferris in going to his father's tomb. The Southern Christian Leadership Conference suspended King from the presidency in June 2001, concerned that he was letting the organization drift into inaction. The group's national chairman at the time, Claud Young, sent a June 25 letter to King that read, \\"You have consistently been insubordinate and displayed inappropriate, obstinate behavior in the (negligent) carrying out of your duties as president of SCLC.\\" King was reinstated only one week later after promising to take a more active role. Young said of the suspension, \\"I felt we had to use a two-by-four to get his attention. Well, it got his attention all right.\\" After he was reinstated, King prepared a four- year plan outlining a stronger direction for the organization, agreeing to dismiss McMorris and announcing plans to present a strong challenge to the Bush administration in an August convention in Montgomery, Alabama. In a rally on August 5, 2001, in Montgomery, SCLC leaders, including Rev. Joseph Lowery, former United Nations Ambassador Andrew Young and Rev. Jesse Jackson all pledged their support for King. \\"I sit beside my successor, to assure him of my love and support,\\" said Rev. Lowery.Suggs, Ernie (August 6, 2001). \\"Many in SCLC Rally Behind King\\". The Atlanta Constitution. King said he also planned to concentrate on racial profiling, prisoners' rights and closing the digital divide between whites and blacks. However, King also suggested the group needed a new approach, stating, \\"We must not allow our lust for 'temporal gratification' to blind us from making difficult decisions to effect future generations.\\"  King Center  In 2006, King founded an organization called Realizing the Dream, which has been absorbed into The King Center under King as president. CEO Dexter King had accused Martin of establishing the foundation to make money off their parents' legacy that should go to the King Center.Keefe, Bob (August 19, 2008), \\"King family lawsuit called 'disheartening'\\", The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Retrieved September 20, 2008. On April 4, 2008, the fortieth anniversary of his father's death, King and Al Sharpton led a march around Memphis, Tennessee. There, he visited the Lorraine Hotel for the first time since his father's death and placed a wreath where he stood before being shot. As he spoke to those who participated in the march, King called for them to continue his father's fight and promoted Realizing the Dream, which he said sought to eliminate poverty. = Lawsuits involving Dexter King = In July 2008, Martin Luther King III and Bernice King filed a lawsuit against his brother, Dexter King, accusing him of improperly taking money from the estate of their late mother and transferring it to the Estate of Martin Luther King Jr. Inc., where Dexter King serves as president. According to the suit, Dexter failed to keep Martin and Bernice informed about the company's financial affairs. It alleged the company's assets were being \\"misapplied or wasted,\\" and demanded that Dexter produce documents pertaining to the 2006 sale of some of Martin Luther King Jr.'s documents. In response, Dexter King accused his siblings of continuously using their parents' legacy for their own benefit and \\"to further their own personal and religious agendas.\\" Although critics said the lawsuit was at odds with their father's message and legacy, King III maintained it was in keeping with his history of negotiation and nonviolent direct action, claiming, \\"My father also used the court system.\\" Dexter filed a similar countersuit against Martin and Bernice on August 18, 2008, claiming they breached their duties to the King Center and their father's estate, misused assets belonging to the center and kept money that should have gone back to the center and estate. Among the claims in the suit were that Martin improperly kept a $55,000 Lincoln Navigator SUV donated to the King Center for his own personal use, and that he \\"commandeered a reception\\" being held at the King Center and \\"turned it into his own wedding reception.\\" Dexter claimed he made numerous attempts to get his siblings to stop such misuses of power but was unsuccessful. King III's lawyer, Jock Smith, denied the allegations as petty and misguided, and said the suit demonstrates Dexter King's misuse of power and his history of making poor decisions involving the Center without seeking proper input from his siblings. In October 2008, Martin Luther King III had not seen his brother since June, and Dexter had yet to meet his niece, Yolanda. Martin, Bernice, and Dexter have each expressed love for each other and hope that they will reconcile once their legal matters have been resolved. In October 2009, Martin and his siblings settled the lawsuit out of court. = Reconciliation with siblings and return to King Center = On April 6, 2010, Martin Luther King III, brother Dexter King, and sister Bernice King issued a joint statement, announcing the re-election of Martin Luther King III as President and CEO of The King Center. \\"It's the right time, and Martin is in the right place to take this great organization forward,\\" Dexter King said in a statement. Bernice King said she is \\"proud that my brothers and I are speaking with one voice to communicate our parents' legacy to the world.\\" Martin King added, \\"We are definitely working together. My brother and sister and I are constantly in communication ... It's a great time for us.\\" As president of The King Center, King has been credited with spearheading an innovative \\"King Center Imaging Project\\" in partnership with JPMorgan Chase, which is digitizing and photographing an estimated 200,000 historic documents, including his father's speeches, sermons, correspondence and other writings and making the documents available on-line to the world.Eversley, Melanie (January 16, 2012), \\"Martin Luther King Papers Go Online\\", USA Today. In addition, King launched \\"The King Center Audio and Visual Digitization Project\\" in partnership with Syracuse University which will \\"preserve and digitize some 3,500 hours of audio and video footage\\" of his father.McDowell, Scott. \\"Syracuse University and The King Center announce The King Center Audio and Visual Digitization Project\\", Inside Syracuse University. November 16, 2011. He has also developed a $100 million renovation plan to upgrade The King Center's Freedom Hall Complex, the first major improvement in the Center's site and facilities in its 30-year history. Along with Reverend Al Sharpton and a number of other civil rights leaders, on August 28, 2010, King took part in the 'Reclaim the Dream' commemorative march, marking the 47th anniversary of the historic Great March on Washington. They spoke at Dunbar High School in Washington, D.C. followed by a reassemblage at the site of the future Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial location in the center of the National Mall. The event coincided with Glenn Beck's Restoring Honor rally planned for the same day on the eastern part of the Mall. King wrote a Washington Post op-ed column offering measured criticism of Beck's event: MLK April 4, 2011 rally On April 4, 2011, the 43rd anniversary of the assassination of his father, King helped to lead nationwide demonstrations against initiatives to eliminate and undermine collective bargaining rights of public workers in Wisconsin and other states. King led a mass march in Atlanta and spoke to a crowd of supporters at the Georgia state capitol, urging them to \\"defend the collective bargaining rights of teachers, bus drivers, police, firefighters and other public service workers, who educate, protect and serve our children and families.\\" On November 17, 2011, King and AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka co-authored an article for CNN, calling for reforms to end oppressive immigration laws. In August 2013, King went to Philadelphia, where he joined Mayor Michael Nutter in announcing the city's joining of a national campaign on poverty, jobs and education. To commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the March on Washington, King traveled to Washington, along with other civil rights leaders. On November 21, 2013, King spoke at DePauw University regarding his memories of John F. Kennedy's assassination. King appeared on MSNBC's \\"The Cycle\\" on May 9, 2014. He was asked by co-host Tour√© if he believed that Democratic Party has done enough to get the overwhelming support from African-Americans it receives. King's answer is said to have shocked the host. \\"The party does not do enough,\\" he said. \\"It's our responsibility to hold the party accountable. And I'm not sure we do that. I think we have to find a way to hold the parties accountable. He went on to say that he believed there should be communication between African- Americans and the Tea Party Movement, saying \\"the only way you change is you have to be at least communicating\\".  Ferguson, Missouri  In August 2014, King addressed the shooting of Michael Brown and reported that he would come to Ferguson, Missouri. King was present at a rally with Michael Brown's parents on August 17. On an interview with Fox News, King said his father would be \\"greatly disappointed\\" with the violence that occurred in Ferguson after the grand jury verdict. King attended Brown's funeral on August 25.  Other pursuits and interests  In January 2011, it was reported that King will attempt to become a \\"strategic partner\\" in the New York Mets baseball team. \\"This was blown up way out of proportion,\\" King told the Associated Press. \\"While I'm not leading a group and I'm not having direct conversations ... I think it is very important to promote diversity in ownership.\\" King was among the co-founders of Bounce TV, a black-oriented digital broadcasting network. He currently serves on the Board of Advisors of Let America Vote, an organization founded by former Missouri Secretary of State Jason Kander that aims to end voter suppression.  Ministers March for Justice  On August 28, 2017, King marched with Al Sharpton in Washington D.C. for the Ministers March for Justice leading over 3,000 ministers to protest the policies of President Donald Trump. King was under major controversy when he agreed to meet with Trump in January 2017.  Family  In May 2006, Martin Luther King III married longtime partner Arndrea Waters. On May 25, 2008, the couple had a daughter, Yolanda Renee King, the first and only grandchild of Martin Luther King and Coretta Scott King. She was named after her aunt, Yolanda King, who had died of a heart condition at age 51 in Santa Monica, California, the previous year. Yolanda Renee appeared with her family at the 50th anniversary of the March on Washington celebration, where President Obama and various leaders and other notable persons were charmed by her presence. Yolanda Renee helped her family ring a bell that once hung in Birmingham's 16th St. Baptist Church, which had been bombed 18 days after the original March On Washington, killing four young girls. At age nine Yolanda Renee King spoke at the March for Our Lives demonstration in Washington, D.C. on March 24, 2018.

Robinson, Loretta Young, and Orson Welles. It is Welles's third completed feature film as director and his first film noir, about a war crimes investigator tracking a high-ranking Nazi fugitive to a Connecticut town. It is the first Hollywood film to present documentary footage of the Holocaust. The original story by Victor Trivas was nominated for an Academy Award. The film entered the public domain when its copyright was not renewed. Plot The Stranger Mr. Wilson of the United Nations War Crimes Commission is hunting for Nazi fugitive Franz Kindler, a war criminal who has erased all evidence which might identify him, with no clue left to his identity except \\"a hobby that almost amounts to a mania‚Äîclocks.\\" Wilson releases Kindler's former associate Meinike, hoping the man will lead him to Kindler. Wilson follows Meinike to the United States, to the town of Harper, Connecticut, but loses him before he meets with Kindler. Kindler has assumed a new identity and is known locally as \\"Charles Rankin,\\" and has become a prep school teacher. He is about to marry Mary Longstreet, daughter of Supreme Court Justice Adam Longstreet, and is involved in repairing the town's 400-year-old Habrecht-style clock mechanism with religious automata that crowns the belfry of a church in the town square. When Kindler and Meinike do meet, Meinike, who is repentant, begs Kindler to confess his crimes. Instead, Kindler strangles Meinike, who might expose him. Eventually, Wilson deduces that Rankin is Kindler, but not having witnessed the meeting with Meinike, he has no proof. Only Mary knows that Meinike came to meet her husband. To get her to admit this, Wilson must convince her that her husband is a criminal‚Äîbefore Rankin decides to eliminate the threat to him by killing her. Kindler's pose begins to unravel when Red, the family dog, discovers Meinike's body. To further protect his secret, Kindler poisons Red. Meanwhile, Mary begins to suspect her husband is not being honest with her. She is torn between her desire to learn the truth concerning her husband as a possible murderous monster and the idea of helping him create his new life. Mr. Wilson shows her graphic footage of Nazi concentration camps and explains how Kindler developed the idea of genocide. Not until Mary discovers Kindler's plot to kill her does she finally accept the truth. She dares her husband to kill her. Kindler tries, but he is prevented by Wilson and his brother-in-law Noah. Kindler then flees into the church belfry, to hide and finish fixing the clock mechanism needed to operate the bell. Shortly afterwards Mary confronts him and a struggle between the two ensues; during this time the clock bell begins to chime, bringing most of the town to the foot of the building. Wilson climbs up to the top of the tower where he too confronts Kindler, and grabs the gun which Mary had managed to dislodge. Kindler is then shot and staggers out of the belfry and onto the clock face, where he is impaled by the clock mechanism he labored to repair, and falls to his death.

Production Left to right: Edward G. Robinson, Richard Long, Loretta Young, Martha Wentworth, Orson Welles, Philip Merivale, Byron Keith, and an unidentified actress in The Stranger (1946) Produced by Sam Spiegel (who then billed himself as S. P. Eagle), The Stranger was the last International Pictures Production distributed by RKO Pictures. Filming took place from late September to November 21, 1945, at Samuel Goldwyn Studios and Universal Studios. The film's musical score is by Bronis≈Çaw Kaper. Spiegel initially planned to hire John Huston to direct The Stranger. When Huston entered the military, Welles was given the chance to direct the film and prove himself able to make a film on schedule and under budget‚Äîsomething he was so eager to do that he accepted a disadvantageous contract. In September 1945 Welles and his wife Rita Hayworth signed a guarantee that Welles would owe International Pictures any of his earnings, from any source, above $50,000 a year if he did not meet his contractual obligations. He also agreed to defer to the studio in any creative dispute. The Stranger was Welles's first job as a film director in four years. Editor Ernest J. Nims was given the power to cut any material he considered extraneous from the script before shooting began. \\"He was the great supercutter,\\" Welles said, \\"who believed that nothing should be in a movie that did not advance the story. And since most of the good stuff in my movies doesn't advance the story at all, you can imagine what a nemesis he was to me.\\" For directing and acting in The Stranger, Welles was to receive $2,000 a week plus $50,000 when the film was completed, and a chance to sign a four-picture deal with International Pictures, making films of his own choosing. Welles was given some degree of creative control. He worked on the general rewrite of the script, wrote all of the scenes in the drugstore, and wrote scenes at the beginning of the picture that were shot but subsequently cut by Spiegel and executive producer William Goetz. Welles had endeavored to personalize the film and develop a nightmarish tone. There is uncertainty about how much of this material was actually shot and how much was removed. Some scenes elaborated on Meinike's flight through Latin America, shadowed by an agent named Marvales and his wife, a woman in distinctive gold earrings who is murdered by savage dogs kept by the Nazis-in-exile. A brief vestige of the sequence remains in the final release version. In a 1982 interview, Nims said 32 pages of the script were eliminated at his suggestion, including the first 16 pages. An early scene showing a meeting of Mary and Rankin was filmed but removed. She finds him in the woods, looking at the incongruous 16th century Gothic clock in the town square, and tells him it was \\"brought by sailing ship from the shores of the Mediterranean\\" by one of her ancestors. Rankin is familiar with the clock and her family's history, and as they walk through the cemetery he notes the many Longstreets who are buried there and their patriotic service. \\"Character development suffers from the loss of these scenes,\\" wrote film historian Bret Wood, who also observes that inclusion of the Latin American pursuit would have increased the sense of foreboding before the story enters the idyllic town of Harper. A sense of mystery would also have been set up by an imaginative but unrealized pre-title sequence in the Welles version; instead, the titles are simply superimposed over the image of the clock. Welles wanted Agnes Moorehead to portray the investigator. \\"I thought it would be much more interesting to have a spinster lady on the heels of this Nazi,\\" Welles said. Edward G. Robinson was cast instead. Welles planned to use the campus of his alma mater, the Todd School for Boys in Woodstock, Illinois, as the setting for The Stranger. The idea was ruled out by budget restrictions, but a few artifacts are seen in the film. A sign in the gymnasium reads \\"Harper vs. Todd\\" and refers to Clover Hall, a building on the Todd campus, and \\"Mrs. Collins\\"‚ÄîAnnetta Collins, teacher, housemother, and director of kitchen services. It was Collins who had recruited Welles for Todd in 1926, after meeting the boy at his father's hotel in Grand Detour. A note on a blackboard, in Welles's handwriting, refers to Wallingford Hall, another building at Todd. A notice on the wall is signed \\"Coach Roskie\\"‚ÄîAnthony C. Roskie, Todd's longtime athletic director. Perry Ferguson, production designer for Citizen Kane, was borrowed from Samuel Goldwyn Productions. For Welles, Ferguson created a complete town square, an interlocking series of sets in related proximity to each other. Scenes could be filmed that provided deep views of adjacent buildings through windows or reflected in their glass, adding richness and dimension. \\"When we're filming inside the drug store, we get a sense of depth that is extremely rare in a Hollywood movie,\\" said film historian Bret Wood: > In the shot where Wilson plays checkers with Potter, you can look behind > Potter and see a mirror behind him, and through the mirror see Potter and > Wilson again, and then see the window behind the camera, and see through > that window to cars, buildings and natural sunlight. It's truly radical. If > it were deep focus the way Gregg Toland had shot Citizen Kane, maybe it > would have been noticed or written about in the last 70-odd years. The set facilitated long takes in which conversations begin indoors, move outside to actual storefronts, and continue across the town square. Welles used long takes as a way to protect the integrity of his film, giving \\"the great supercutter\\" nothing to cut away to. The long takes are so subtle that they go unnoticed. At a time when a one-minute take was a rarity, Welles presents one unbroken scene between Kindler and Meinike in the woods that is four minutes long‚Äîlonger than the bravura opening of Touch of Evil (1958). Welles and Billy House in The Stranger The character of Potter‚Äîa comic druggist who plays checkers‚Äîwas played by actor Billy House, a burlesque star who became a particular favorite of Welles. The character was not initially a major part of the film, but Welles expanded the role as filming progressed. Feeling that these revisions came at his expense, Edward G. Robinson complained ineffectually to studio executives. Welles recalled Loretta Young's support in a dispute with Spiegel, when the producer ordered a closeup of Young during a medium-full shot of Mary's fight with Kindler. \\"It would have been fatal,\\" Welles said. \\"I told that to Loretta, and she said, 'Well then, we're not going to make it.'\\" When Spiegel continued to insist on the closeup, Young brought in her agent. \\"Imagine getting a star's agent in to ensure that she wouldn't get a closeup!\\" Welles said. \\"She was wonderful.\\" \\"No one who worked on the film can remember any special anecdotes or problems concerning it,\\" wrote biographer Frank Brady. \\"Welles has said, since the making of The Stranger‚Äîwhich he completed one day before schedule and under budget‚Äîthat nothing in the film was his, this despite the fact that the unmistakable Wellesian moods, shadows, acute angles, and depth-of-focus shots are pervasive. Within the film is a second film, another Wellesian touch, consisting of snatches of documentary footage showing Nazi atrocities.\\" The Stranger was the first commercial film to use documentary footage from the Nazi concentration camps. Wilson (Edward G. Robinson) steps into the projected image of the Holocaust footage in The Stranger \\"What we tend to forget today is that in the 1940s a large percentage of the population could not believe that the Nazi death camps were real,\\" said Bret Wood. Welles had seen the footage in early May 1945 in San Francisco, as a correspondent and discussion moderator at the United Nations Conference on International Organization.Display advertisement, \\"What America's Youngest News Network Is Doing About the Greatest News Story of Our Time\\". American Broadcasting Company, Inc., The Blue Network. Broadcasting, April 30, 1945, pp. 22‚Äì23 Welles wrote of the Holocaust footage in his syndicated column for the New York Post (May 7, 1945). > No, you must not miss the newsreels.

New York Post, May 7, 1945. \\"It is clear that the visual power of the newsreels had struck him deeply, and it is no surprise that clips from them would be included only a few months later in The Stranger,\\" wrote film scholar Jennifer L. Barker. Three of the four post-liberation scenes included in The Stranger are from Nazi Concentration Camps (1945), a film assembled by George Stevens, James B. Donovan and Ray Kellogg and used as evidence in the Nuremberg Trials. Within weeks of the completion of The Stranger, International Pictures backed out of its promised four-picture deal with Welles. No reason was given, but the impression was left that The Stranger would not make money.  Reception  Contemporary response featured on a poster for The Stranger The Stranger was the only film made by Welles to have been a bona fide box office success upon its release. Its cost was $1.034 million; it earned $2.25 million in U.S. rentals in its first six months, and 15 months after its release it had grossed $3.216 million. \\"The Stranger exists as an answer to the critics who complained that Welles could not make a 'program' picture,\\" wrote film noir scholar Carl Macek. \\"He did, and it has found a niche in the canon of the film noir.\\" At the 19th Academy Awards, Victor Trivas received an Oscar nomination for Writing (Original Motion Picture Story). The award went to Clemence Dane, for Vacation from Marriage. The Stranger holds an aggregate 96% rating at Rotten Tomatoes based on 23 critic reviews, including two contemporaneous reviews. The sole \\"rotten\\" review is that of New York Times critic Bosley Crowther, published in July 1946. Crowther called the film a \\"bloodless, manufactured show\\" in which Welles \\"gave no illusion of the sort of depraved and heartless creatures that the Nazi mass-murderers were. He is just Mr. Welles, a young actor, doing a boyishly bad acting job in a role which is highly incredible‚Äîanother weak feature of the film. As a matter of fact, the writing of The Stranger, by Anthony Veiller, is the weakest thing about it-- and that estimation includes another silly performance by Loretta Young as the killer's wife. For the premise is not only farfetched, but the whole construction of the tale relieves very soon all the mystery and suspense that such a story should have.\\" More favorable coverage was found in Variety, which called the film \\"a socko melodrama, spinning an intriguing web of thrills and chills. Director Orson Welles gives the production a fast, suspenseful development, drawing every advantage from the hard-hitting script from the Victor Trivas story. ‚Ä¶ A uniformly excellent cast gives reality to events that transpire. The three stars, Robinson, Young and Welles, turn in some of their best work, the actress being particularly effective as the misled bride.\\" Life magazine featured The Stranger as Movie of the Week in its issue dated June 3, 1946. On its release, The Stranger was unfavorably compared to Alfred Hitchcock's Shadow of a Doubt (1943). \\"One reason for the similarities is the recutting, supervised by Ernest Nims,\\" wrote film historian Bret Wood. \\"By removing the Latin American sequence and many of the political elements (such as the clock/fascist analogy),The Stranger is transformed from a socially relevant drama to a small town murder story, with the villain more a psychopath than a political fugitive. Nims cut the film to play like a conventional thriller with little regard to Welles's subtextual purposes.\\" In his audio commentary for the 2013 Blu-ray release of The Stranger, Wood calls it \\"an undervalued film\\" due to the absence of the \\"stylistic swagger\\" of Citizen Kane and The Magnificent Ambersons. He regards Welles's third completed film as \\"deceptive and much more complex stylistically and thematically\\" than has so far been appreciated. Adaptations The premiere issue of Movie Mystery Magazine (July‚ÄìAugust 1946) featured a novelization of The Stranger The debut issue (July‚ÄìAugust 1946) of the short-lived pulp digest Movie Mystery Magazine presented a novelized condensation of the screenplay for The Stranger. A half-hour adaptation of The Stranger aired on CBS Radio's This Is Hollywood on December 7, 1946. Robinson re-created his role from the film, performing with Ruth Hussey, Roland Morris, and Gerald Mohr. Copyright The copyright on the film originally belonged to The Haig Corporation, but the film is in the public domain because the producers did not renew the copyright in 1973.The Stranger, DVD#9_9346,Madacy Entertainment Group, Inc. 2002 Home media After the film fell into the public domain, a number of poor-quality versions of The Stranger were released by various sources. Some versions were duplicated from second- or third-generation releases, and were severely and badly edited, until MGM Home Entertainment edited the film in DVD in 2004.

He was active as a professional wrestler from 1953 until 1969 before becoming a manager until 1995. Over the course of his 42-year career, Albano guided 15 different tag teams and three singles competitors to championship gold. Albano was one of the \\"Triumvirate of Terror\\", a threesome of nefarious WWF managers which included The Grand Wizard of Wrestling and Freddie Blassie. The trio was a fixture in the company for a decade until The Grand Wizard's death in 1983. A unique showman, with an elongated beard, rubber band facial piercings, and loud outfits, Albano was the forefather of the 1980s Rock 'n' Wrestling Connection. Collaborating with Cyndi Lauper, Albano helped usher in wrestling's crossover success with a mainstream audience. Capitalizing on his success, he later ventured into Hollywood with various television, film, and music projects. He became well known to a new generation of fans as the actor and voice of Mario in The Super Mario Bros. Super Show! Early life Albano's parents, Carmen Louis Albano and Eleanor Albano n√©e Morrone, were of Italian heritage but both born in the United States. Eleanor was a classical concert pianist who had performed at Carnegie Hall and later became a registered nurse. Her brother, a physician, introduced her to Carmen in the 1930s, who was training to be an obstetrician. After marrying, they temporarily relocated to Italy while Carmen pursued his medical degree at the University of Bari. He later co-patented a forceps instrument to assist in breech birth deliveries. Louis Albano was born in Italy when his father had three months remaining at the university. He was baptized in the Vatican, and his parents shortly thereafter returned to the New York City area aboard the RMS Majestic. Lou was one of nine children, of whom five lived to adulthood. The family settled in the Mount Vernon area. Lou attended Archbishop Stepinac High School in White Plains, New York, where he competed in track and field, and finally rose to the position of captain of the football team. It was this rank that later inspired his wrestling moniker, \\"Captain\\" Lou Albano.Albano, 2008, p. 64 His skills were such that he received 32 offers of full scholarship from universities around the country, and he chose the University of Tennessee on the strength of their football team. Here, Albano was teammates with the likes of Darris McCord, Doug Atkins, and his roommate, Sam Rutigliano. Albano had conflicts with the dean due to poor behavior and was expelled after attempting to cheat on a final exam. He then joined the United States Army, but due to a childhood injury exacerbated by his football days, Albano was honorably discharged after only eight months.Albano, 2008, pp. 10-13 Professional wrestling careerEarly career (1953-1967)= Although Albano's father, retired from medicine, wanted to open an insurance agency with his son, Lou instead began training as a boxer. A distant cousin and family friend, Lou Duva, introduced Albano to Willie Gilzenberg, a boxing promoter who later became the first titular president of the WWWF. Gilzenberg, noting Albano's relatively short stature, instead encouraged him to enter wrestling. Albano's father had himself been an amateur wrestler, and Albano himself had been introduced to professional wrestling at an event held at Fort Dix during his tenure in the Army, where he had seen the likes of Gorgeous George, Arnold Skaaland, Soldier Barry, and Lenny Montana‚Äîall of whom Albano later worked with. Gilzenberg asked Soldier Barry to help train Albano, and in 1952, the two began doing house shows in the New York area.Albano, 2008, pp. 11-15 Albano was originally seen as a \\"pretty boy,\\" and wrestled as the babyface \\"Leaping Lou Albano.\\" After a non-wrestling injury caused a gash on his forehead, he purposefully did not allow the scar to heal, and the minor disfigurement allowed him to turn heel. Now billed as the \\"Mount Vernon Mauler,\\" and occasionally a pirate, he began establishing himself in the New York professional wrestling community. At this point, Gilzenberg introduced Albano to Vince McMahon Sr., promoter of the new Capitol Wrestling Corporation in Washington, D.C.‚Äîthe first predecessor to what is today WWE. Albano worked for Capitol Wrestling and its successors, under Vince McMahon and his son, for most of the rest of his career.Albano, 2008, pp. 14-15 Albano made little impact as a solo wrestler, working prelims in various circuits, but he achieved moderate success as a tag team performer with partner Tony Altomare. Dubbed The Sicilians, Altomare and Albano competed as a stereotypical Italian gangster combo in the mode of the then-popular television series The Untouchables. The pair won the Midwest tag team championship on the undercard of June 30, 1961 Comiskey Park event starring Pat O'Connor and Buddy Rogers that set the all-time record gate in the United States to that point. Their realistic depiction of gangster characters caught the attention of actual mafiosi in 1961. In Chicago, Tony Accardo and two associates \\"requested\\" that Albano and Altomare cease using the word \\"mafia.\\" During their run as Midwest tag team champions, personal differences with bookers and other wrestlers resulted in the pair abandoning the territory quickly enough that they did not lose the title before leaving.Albano, 2008, pp. 23-25 =WWWF/WWF (1964, 1967-1986)= In 1964, Albano wrestled for the World Wide Wrestling Federation as a singles competitor. The Sicilians and breakup (1967-1969) Albano returned in 1967 and again partnered with Tony Altomare as \\"The Sicilians\\". In July, they won the WWWF United States Tag Team Championship from Arnold Skaaland and Spiros Arion.Ellison, Lillian. First Goddess of the Squared Circle, pp. 166‚Äì167. Albano and Altomare only held the championship for two weeks, a title change which was not even acknowledged on WWWF television outside the Atlantic City market. But several photographs of the pair with their title belts were taken, which elevated Albano's reputation in the wrestling magazines of the time, and provided good publicity fodder later in his career. By 1969 The Sicilians disbanded and went their separate ways. Albano went as a singles competitor. Becoming a manager (1970) In 1970, fellow wrestler Bruno Sammartino mentioned to McMahon that Albano, a mediocre wrestler who was nonetheless an entertaining speaker, might be better utilized as a manager. In professional wrestling, a manager might be tasked with behind-the-scenes efforts to help push forward a charge's career or handle his booking, but plays an equal or even greater role in the ring, speaking for his charge and helping rile up the crowd for or against him. Sammartino recalled: \\"One day I said to Vince Sr., this guy [Albano] isn't the best wrestler, as a team, they [Albano & Altomare] can only go so far. But he'd be a great mouthpiece for some guy. Lou has such a gift of gab that he can help out some people. As a wrestler, he just seemed limited. He was always the same. He was never looked upon by promoters as someone who could be anyone special. But as a manager, he shined. That was his calling.\\" Albano, realizing that wrestlers had only a limited lifespan in the ring, and still dealing with his old football injury, agreed. Although it was his decision to split up his ten-year tag team partnership with Altomare, the two remained very close until the latter's death in 2003. At this time, managers were relatively rare in the pro wrestling world‚ÄîWWWF had only two others. However, a promising new wrestler, Oscar \\"Crusher\\" Verdu, had just recently emigrated from Spain. His in-ring capabilities were hampered by a limited command of English, and Albano was assigned to be his mouthpiece. Albano emphasized Verdu's physique and insisted that he had never been taken off his feet during a match. To rile up audiences, he also engaged in ethnic slurs, which were then a more common part of WWWF banter; Albano promised that Verdu would stomp on \\"that Italian\\" (Sammartino); the fact that Albano was known to be Italian himself only heightened the audience's reaction. Sammartino later said, \\"They wanted to see me beat the hell out of Verdu to make Albano a liar. He could get the kind of heat that nobody else could.\\" The result was a Madison Square Garden sellout when Verdu faced Sammartino in June 1970, the first for the company in five years and a then-record gate for a wrestling event in that arena. The record lasted only a month, when a rematch brought in over $85,000 in ticket receipts. After losing that match, Verdu cycled out of the WWWF rotation, but Albano remained as the top heel manager for the next 15 years. Thus began his transition into the brash, bombastic manager \\"Captain\\" Lou Albano. With a quick wit and a grating personality, Albano delivered memorable promos and earned the scorn of the wrestling audience as he attempted to dethrone World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF) superstar and Heavyweight Champion Bruno Sammartino. Albano described the strategy behind his overblown, ranting interview style: \\"I just remember the point I wanna bring across, and then I just babble before, during, and after. Somehow, in the middle, I said the two or three sentences that sold tickets. Mostly, I just tried to make people want to see me get my ass kicked, and along the way, hopefully the guy I was managing would catch a beating too!\\" Growing out his hair and beard, and packing on extra pounds, Albano gave the image of a wild man. He developed a later trademark, applying rubber bands to his beard, after having seen a homeless man do the same. He also often wore a rubber band hanging from a safety pin pushed through his cheek. Career as a manager (1971-1984) In January 1971, Albano was the manager when Ivan Koloff ended Sammartino's seven-year reign as champion. Koloff's title reign was a transitional one, lasting just three weeks. Koloff had a typical heel run against Sammartino in 1969, but Albano spent months claiming that his previous manager had trained him incorrectly, and that Koloff would beat Sammartino under Albano's expert tutelage. The shock of Koloff's victory was such that the crowd fell totally silent, and Sammartino momentarily feared that he'd lost his hearing. Koloff and Albano were quickly rushed out of the ring by security without the championship belt as the crowd began to riot. Albano, his wife, and a family friend, who were both in attendance, escaped to a taxi outside the Garden. The mob surrounded the cab and began breaking windows, so the trio ran to a nearby bar, followed by the crowd who were pelting them with mud and objects. The mob was beginning to destroy the bar as the police finally arrived. Vince McMahon received a bill for damages totaling $27,000 ($171,472 in 2019 dollars), cementing Albano's unparalleled ability to \\"draw heat\\" (arouse anger in the audience).Albano, 2008, p. 38. Albano then resumed his role as the mastermind trying to lead his latest bad guy protege to the gold. For the remainder of the 1970s and into the mid-1980s, Albano's cadre of loyal henchmen were unable to re-secure the heavyweight championship, held by either Sammartino, Pedro Morales, Bob Backlund or Hulk Hogan. However, Albano guided singles wrestlers Don Muraco and Greg Valentine to the Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship. Furthermore, Albano guided fifteen teams to the WWF World Tag Team Championships, including The Valiant Brothers, The Wild Samoans, The Yukon Lumberjacks, The Blackjacks, The Moondogs, The Masked Executioners, and after becoming a face (short for babyface, a wrestling term for a good guy/heroic character), the U.S. Express and the British Bulldogs.Lou Albano ‚Äì Rotten Tomatoes Celebrity Profile, retrieved on October 15, 2009. It was during his stewardship of the Valiant Brothers that Albano picked up his \\"Captain\\" nickname, as the act was promoted as \\"Captain Lou and the Valiants too.\\" By the end of his career, Albano had managed over 50 different wrestlers who won two dozen championships. Albano could also help elevate wrestlers by splitting from them. In 1982, despite being managed by the villainous Albano, Jimmy Snuka was unexpectedly becoming a fan favorite due to his high-flying ring style. An interview segment revealed that Snuka had no legal contract with Albano, and thus was able to leave his manager.Jimmy \\"Superfly\\" Snuka vs. Ray \\"The Crippler\\" Stevens, Madison Square Garden, New York, NY, December 28, 1982, retrieved on October 15, 2009. Shortly thereafter, a bloody beatdown by Albano, Freddie Blassie and Ray Stevens, helped transform Snuka into a sympathetic figure, and triggered the most successful period of his career.Jimmy \\"Superfly\\" Snuka ‚Äì Wrestling Legends ‚Äì WWE Hall of Fame legend ‚Äì Media Man Australia, retrieved on October 15, 2009. Albano had previously helped turn the villainous Intercontinental Champion Pat Patterson into a fan favorite, by \\"purchasing\\" Patterson's contract against his will. He also managed the U.S. Express at WrestleMania. Final storylines (1984-1986) In 1984, Albano met pop singer Cyndi Lauper on a plane flight from Puerto Rico. Her manager, David Wolff, suggested that the two collaborate on a project at some point in the future. In 1984, the opportunity came when Lauper's video for \\"Girls Just Want to Have Fun\\" needed an actor to play the singer's father, and Albano was suggested. Initially reluctant, he was convinced by his wife to agree, and Lauper and Albano thereafter formed a lifelong friendship. He appeared in several of her music videos and she appeared on Roddy Piper's \\"Piper's Pit\\" program to discuss the collaboration. Albano, in character, began denigrating Lauper and women in general and claimed to have written all her songs and been the only reason for her success. Lauper, in turn, assaulted Albano with her purse, and the two agreed to settle their differences in the ring. Albano and Lauper agreed to compete by proxy, each choosing a female wrestler to contend. Lauper chose Wendi Richter, while Albano chose The Fabulous Moolah. The match, scheduled for July 23, 1984, was dubbed The Brawl to End it All, and was broadcast live on MTV.Shields, Brian. Main Event: WWE in the Raging 80s, p.87. During the match, Lauper interfered on Richter's behalf by hitting Moolah in the head with her purse, dubbed \\"The Loaded Purse of Doom\\". At the conclusion of the match, Richter had defeated Moolah for the WWF Women's Championship, which the WWF had promoted Moolah as having held for the previous 28 years.Ellison, Lillian. First Goddess of the Squared Circle, p.171‚Äì173. For a time in the 1980s, Albano also managed the rock group NRBQ. The group recorded a 1986 album, \\"Lou and the Q,\\" which contained a song titled \\"Captain Lou\\"‚Äîon which Albano himself sings and rants. In the meantime, Albano had become involved in several charities. His brother's brother-in-law had recently died of multiple sclerosis, and the experience led Albano to lend his time to raising awareness and funds to combat the disease, occasionally alongside Lauper. His increasingly public benevolence clashed with his in-ring persona, which violated the principles of kayfabe‚Äîmaintaining the appearance of reality within professional wrestling‚Äîwhich were still strictly adhered to at the time. In 1984, Albano decided it was time, after 32 years as a heel, to turn face. He therefore arranged for Lauper to receive an in-ring award for her contributions to both wrestling and the fight against MS, for which he also came out and congratulated her. In the course of the ceremony, Roddy Piper and \\"Cowboy\\" Bob Orton came into the ring to sarcastically praise Albano before breaking Lauper's award, a gold record plaque, over his head. Lauper and her boyfriend-manager David Wolff were also attacked by Piper and Orton. The melee was broken up by Hulk Hogan, but the altercation allowed Albano to now wrestle and manage as a crowd favorite. His last two (heel) singles prot√©g√©s, Valentine and Ken Patera, were paired with Jimmy Hart and Bobby Heenan, respectively, after Albano's face turn. Although he continued his overblown, rambling interviews‚Äîone of the lead announcers for the WWF, Gorilla Monsoon, continued to refer to Albano as \\"The Fountain of Misinformation\\"‚ÄîAlbano was now leading fan favorites such as The U.S. Express, George Steele, The British Bulldogs, Hulk Hogan and Andr√© the Giant into battle. The U.S. Express and British Bulldogs became the first tag teams to win the WWF Tag Team Championships with Albano as a \\"face\\" manager. =Retirement (1986-1991)= Albano left the WWF in late 1986 with one final match on an episode of Wrestling Challenge that aired on November 16, 1986, teaming with The British Bulldogs to defeat The Dream Team and Luscious Johnny Vailant. Albano would then make a one-time appearance on a \\"Piper's Pit\\" on an episode of Superstars of Wrestling in February 1987 to ask Andr√© the Giant to reconsider his recent alignment with Bobby Heenan. Albano briefly worked in Herb Abram's UWF promotion in 1991, where he hosted an interview segment. =Return to WWF (1994-1995)= Albano returned to the WWF in 1994 to manage the newly face- turned Headshrinkers, helping lead them to the WWF Tag Team Championship. He left in early 1995, making sporadic appearances as a guest from then-on, but never again as a manager. =Pennsylvania Championship Wrestling (1996-1997)= Albano returned to wrestling in 1996 for the independent promotion, Pennsylvania Championship Wrestling. He had not wrestled in a decade. On November 1, Albano defeated Judd the Studd in a \\"stretcher match\\". They would subsequently have a feud. Albano's last match was on June 7, 1997, as he lost to Judd the Studd. =Legacy in the WWE= The events leading up to Albano's face turn proved to be pivotal in the history of the WWF. Hogan, Piper, and Orton began a feud at Lauper's award ceremony that culminated in The War to Settle the Score (which also featured the culmination of Lauper and Moolah's continuing feud). The outcome of the War‚ÄîHogan winning by disqualification‚Äîwas the impetus for the primary match at the first WrestleMania, in which Albano also participated, as a face manager. More importantly, the involvement of Lauper, a celebrity completely unrelated to wrestling, in the pro wrestling world was unprecedented. MTV's decision to broadcast the Brawl to End it All tremendously increased the WWF's public profile, especially in the coveted young adult demographic. This led directly to the 1980s professional wrestling boom. Wrestling Observers Dave Meltzer wrote, \\"Without Albano, wrestling history would have been monumentally different because if you take Lauper's involvement out of the equation, the early losses on expanding nationally and buying so much television time were on the verge of putting the company under... Without her, there would have been no MTV special, no national media publicity, and it's highly unlikely without it that the first WrestleMania would have been a success. If you take Albano's participation out of the equation, there is a good chance the McMahon expansion would have hit an iceberg and died in early 1985... the attention garnered by the Rock & Wrestling Connection, stemming from that chance meeting on an airplane between Lauper and Albano less than two years earlier, led NBC to make the decision to air Saturday Night's Main Event several times per year in the Saturday Night Live time slot.\\" Television and film Albano appeared in the 1986 film Wise Guys, starring Danny DeVito. He played the role of Mario, Nintendo's mascot, in both the live-action and animated segments of The Super Mario Bros. Super Show!, a TV series based on the Super Mario Bros. game series. He also had roles in the TV series 227, Hey Dude, and Miami Vice, the 1992 film Stay Tuned, and was a recurring guest on the game show Hollywood Squares. Albano played a villainous caricature of himself named \\"Captain Lou Morano\\" in the 1987 movie Body Slam, starring Dirk Benedict and Roddy Piper. The film also featured cameo appearances by wrestlers Ric Flair, Freddie Blassie, and Bruno Sammartino. Albano played the role of the father in Cyndi Lauper's music videos for \\"Girls Just Want to Have Fun\\", \\"The Goonies 'R' Good Enough\\" and \\"She Bop\\", as well as a cook in the video for her song \\"Time After Time\\". Personal life and death In 1953, Albano married his high school sweetheart, Geraldine Tango. The marriage lasted 56 years, until his death. Albano has been noted by several others for his faithfulness to his wife, a rare characteristic in the on-the-road world of 1970s and 1980s professional wrestling.Sammarino, Bruno. (2008). Bruno Sammartino: An Autobiography Of Wrestling's Living Legend. CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform. Albano released his autobiography, Often Imitated, Never Duplicated, on July 20, 2008, through his website. The book includes a foreword by Cyndi Lauper. The other Albano siblings are Vincent, George, Eleanor, and Carl, all of whom became teachers. Albano's brother, Carl, taught health for 32 years at Ridgewood High School in Ridgewood, New Jersey, and was head of the Ridgewood High health department from 1974 until 2001.15, 2004&pid;=1415176 Carl M. Albano Obituary , retrieved on October 15, 2009. Carl's students have noted that he used his brother Lou as an example of the difference between crazy and unique. George served as the principal of Lincoln Elementary School in Mount Vernon, New York and often brought Lou in to delight the school's students during their lunch hour. Vincent was an art teacher and lived part-time in a lake house in Connecticut. Eleanor was a music teacher for preschool students in Connecticut and impacts the lives of countless students through music. Albano's son, Carl Albano, has been a member of the Putnam County Legislature since 2011. During the 1990s, Albano shed 150 pounds (70 kg) following a health scare. In May 2005, Albano suffered a heart attack, but later recovered. Albano was sent home from the hospital and again began watching his health. The song \\"Captain Lou\\" by Kimya Dawson is dedicated to him. In 1983 the band NRBQ wrote a song about Albano called \\"Captain Lou.\\" Albano was featured as a singer on that song as well on another called \\"Boardin' House Pie.\\" Both of these songs appear on NRBQ's Tap Dancin' Bats compilation, their Lou and Q spoken-word comedy record, as well as their out-of-print, hard-to- find single which Albano used to sell at his wrestling matches. Albano died on October 14, 2009, of a heart attack while residing in hospice care.Pro wrestler, music video icon Albano dies at 76 , retrieved on October 15, 2009. He was 76 years old.

He is also the chairman of the Cooler Heads Coalition, a loose coalition formed in 1997 which presents itself as \\"focused on dispelling the myths of global warming by exposing flawed economic, scientific, and risk analysis\\". In September 2016, he was appointed by then Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump to lead his transition team for the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). In these organizations, Ebell has been central in promoting climate change denial, distributing his views to the media and politicians. Ebell, who is not a scientist, has been described as a climate change skeptic, a climate contrarian and a climate change denier. Ebell claims that he advocates \\"for sensible energy policies that benefit everyone. Instead of policies that simply reacts [sic] to alarmism.\\" Education and early career Ebell grew up on a cattle ranch at Baker City, Oregon, which was first homesteaded by the Ebells in the 1860s, and is still held by his relatives. In 1971 he went to Colorado College, where he majored in philosophy and then obtained a master's degree in political theory from the London School of Economics. Ebell undertook further postgraduate research at the University of California at San Diego and at Cambridge University before returning to the United States where he worked in a succession of public-policy jobs in Washington. Around 1988 he bought a house in Prince George's County, Maryland. He worked as assistant to the chairman of the National Taxpayers Union, and by 1990 he was a lobbyist representing the National Inholders Association, campaigning against federal policies which restricted property owners in U.S. national parks and national forests. He worked for this organisation, which was renamed the American Land Rights Association (ALRA), on such policy topics as tobacco regulation and endangered species. In 1995 he sent a nine-page memo to staff at the United States House Committee on Natural Resources opposing Newt Gingrich's proposals to reform the Endangered Species Act (ESA). Ebell wrote that Gingrich's \\"soft feelings for cuddly little critters is still going to be a big problem\\", and \\"We are going to need to get some of the freshmen and women to work on him.\\" Ebell became a senior legislative assistant to Republican Representative John Shadegg and advocated the elimination of federal conservation regulations, leaving protection of the environment in the hands of state and local officials. In December 1995, he was hired as policy director of Senator Malcolm Wallop's recently founded Frontiers of Freedom Institute. Wallop described Ebell as having \\"a broad background in public policy with a concentration on land use, environmental and tax policy. He is widely considered the key staff member responsible for and author of the \\"Shandegg\\" bill reform of the ESA.\\" Frontiers of Freedom promoted property rights and criticized environmental regulations such as the Endangered Species Act.  Political views  Tobacco industry = In the 1990s, while serving as Policy Director at the Frontiers of Freedom Institute, Ebell worked as part of a team to make regulating the tobacco industry \\"politically unpalatable\\". In 2011, as part of its \\"Control Abuse of Power\\" (CAP) project, the CEI launched lawsuits challenging the constitutionality of the 1998 tobacco Master Settlement Agreement (MSA).$240 Billion Tobacco Deal Challenged in Supreme Court in S&M; Brands v. Caldwell = Global warming = At a meeting on April 3, 1998, Ebell was one of 12 public relations experts and think-tank representatives who produced what they called their \\"Global Climate Science Communications\\" plan, with the aim of persuading \\"a majority of the American public\\" that \\"significant uncertainties exist in climate science\\", intending to convince the public and policymakers that the science was faulty and could be ignored. ExxonMobil, the coal utility Southern Company and the American Petroleum Institute were represented at the meeting, and there were proposals for industry funding., Global Climate Science Communications Plan 1998, p. 2 Ebell has been referred to as a \\"public-policy wonk‚Äînot, he hastens to clarify, a lobbyist for the energy industry, as many of his fellow skeptics are, or a scientist whose research is underwritten by the energy industry, or a politician who takes contributions from the energy industry.\\" After this meeting, ExxonMobil, even though aware as early as 1981 that fossil fuels affected climate change, began funding Frontiers of Freedom, where Ebell was a staff member. In 1999 Ebell transferred to the Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI), and from 1998 to 2005 ExxonMobil provided CEI with over $2 million of funding. On October 27, 2006, Democratic senator Jay Rockefeller and Republican senator Olympia Snowe sent a joint bipartisan letter to Rex Tillerson, the new CEO of ExxonMobil, about its funding of various groups, stating \\"We fervently hope that reports that ExxonMobil intends to end its funding of the climate change denial campaign of the Competitive Enterprise Institute are true.\\"Joint letter dated October 27, 2006, from senator Jay Rockefeller and senator Olympia Snowe to Rex Tillerson, CEO of ExxonMobil In 2007, Ebell said funding had no relevance as \\"We're not beholden to our donors, because we don't say, 'If you give us this money, we'll do this project',\\" and said \\"I can't even quite tell you who supports us on global warming\\". At that time, CEI had funding from the American Petroleum Institute, the Dow Chemical Company, Eli Lilly and Company, and William A. Dunn of Dunn Capital Management. During an August 2015 discussion on C-SPAN, Ebell did not dispute the statement by Jeremy Symons of the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) that CEI received funds from the Murray Energy Corporation coal mining group. Ebell responded that his group's total budget of about $6 million was far smaller than that of EDF. Ebell has falsely claimed that \\"the rate of warming according to the data is much slower than the models used by the IPCC.\\" Climate scientists note that past climate models have accurately predicted subsequent rates of global warming.  The Clean Power Plan  Ebell has opposed the Clean Power Plan developed by the Environmental Protection Agency. The plan entailed far-reaching regulations that seek to reduce carbon emissions from electricity generation especially by coal-burning power plants. The plan has been tied up in legal proceedings since it was finalized in 2015; Ebell argues that the plan is harmful to the economy and illegal.  Paris Agreement  In September 2016, the Washington Times quoted Ebell as saying \\"Congress should prohibit any funding for the Paris Climate Agreement, the Green Climate Fund, and the underlying UN Framework Convention on Climate Change.\\" Environmental Protection Agency and George W. Bush The first National Climate Assessment was prepared over several years. ExxonMobil did not participate in public consultations, but on August 10, 2000, ran an advertisement in the Washington Post raising various objections to a draft. The report was delivered to Congress in November 2000.RE: With regard to the ExxonMobil facsimile on February 6, 2001, letter of September 26, 2002, from Michael MacCracken, Office of the U. S. Global Change Research Program, to Lee Raymond of ExxonMobil. The incoming George W. Bush administration appointed moderate Republican Christine Todd Whitman as chair of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and American Petroleum Institute lobbyist Philip Cooney as chief of staff of the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ). During the campaign, Bush had promised to cap carbon dioxide emissions. Shortly after the inauguration Ebell heard a rumor that Bush was going to repeat the pledge in a speech. Ebell contacted Robert Novak who was due to interview Whitman, and Novak questioned her on CNN's Crossfire. It became a hot topic, and CEI circulated it to anyone with influence. Bush dropped the pledge, and in March withdrew from the Kyoto Protocol. In line with the \\"Global Climate Science Communications\\" plan to manufacture uncertainty, Cooney edited the EPA's 2002 US Climate Action Report before sending it to the UN in May, but on June 3, 2002, the New York Times headlined its story \\"U.S. Sees Problems In Climate Change\\", saying in a \\"stark shift\\" the administration \\"for the first time mostly blames human actions for recent global warming\\". That same day, Cooney contacted Ebell, who emailed back \\"I know you're in crisis mode\\", and advised \\"what we can do is limited until there is an official statement from the administration repudiating the report\\". On June 4 Bush dismissed the report as something \\"put out by the bureaucracy\\", and said policy was unchanged. Ebell had said in his email that \\"the folks at EPA are the obvious fall guys\\", to be tackled \\"high up as possible\\". He had already given several interviews \\"blaming EPA for freelancing\\", and \\"Perhaps tomorrow we will call for Whitman to be fired.\\" She eventually resigned the EPA chair in May 2003. The recently introduced Data Quality Act had already been used by industry to suppress scientific information, and on August 6, 2003, the CEI sued the Bush administration's Office of Science and Technology Policy under the Act, demanding that it should invalidate the National Assessment as allegedly inaccurate, biased and not based on \\"sound science\\", and should also invalidate the Climate Action Report which was based on the Assessment. The attorneys general of Maine and Connecticut obtained documents including Ebell's June 2002 email through a Freedom of Information Act request. On August 11, they asked the U.S. Justice Department under John Ashcroft to investigate ‚Äì Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal said the email \\"indicates a secret initiative by the administration to invite and orchestrate a lawsuit against itself to discredit an official United States government report on global warming dangers\\", which could be improper and possibly illegal; G. Steven Rowe as attorney general of Maine said \\"The idea that the Bush administration may have invited a lawsuit from a special interest group in order to undermine the federal government's own work under an international treaty is very troubling.\\" On 24 August, Senator Joe Lieberman wrote to the White House expressing hope that the lawsuit was \\"not the result of a collusive plan conceived by the CEI in concert with the Administration, itself. It would be wrong in any circumstances to reject the well founded findings of the [Climate Action Report], but for the Administration to use an outside group to pursue such an ill-conceived goal would be doubly wrong, and could also be abuse of the courts at the expense of the taxpayers.\\" Ashcroft turned down the request for an investigation. On November 4, 2003, the CEI's lawsuit was dismissed by the court, with prejudice so that it could not be re- filed. Media coverage Ebell has been given extensive media coverage, frequently cited or interviewed by journalists in a way that presents a false balance by giving Ebell's lay views equal weight with those of expert climatologists, and thus misrepresents the consensus of scientific opinion on climate change. A study of false equivalence in the media used as an example the Scripps Howard media company \\"incredibly\\" giving equal space to Ebell's comments that reports of recent warming from the World Meteorological Organisation and the National Climatic Data Center were unsurprising because of the Little Ice Age, so \\"it isn‚Äôt much to worry about\\", and of a Science paper by Thomas R. Karl and Kevin Trenberth that \\"the Karl-Trenberth analysis is nothing new ‚Äî it's just kind of a summary of what the establishment thinks is true\\". Academia.edu In an interview on BBC Radio 4 in 2005, Ebell said that the UK's Chief Scientist David King was \\"an alarmist with ridiculous views who knows nothing about climate change\\". An early day motion deploring \\"in the strongest possible terms\\" Ebell's \\"unfounded and insulting criticism\\" was raised in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom, and was signed by 66 Members of Parliament. In 2006, CEI arranged a public-service television commercial about carbon dioxide with the slogan \\"They call it pollution; we call it life.\\" Also in 2006, Ebell wrote an article in Forbes titled \\"Love Global Warming\\". In the article, Ebell wrote, \\"More people die from blizzards and cold spells than from heat waves. Increased death rates usually persist for weeks after the unusually cold temperatures have passed, which suggests that the cold is killing people who would otherwise live into another season at least. Mortality rates during heat waves are just the reverse. The increase ends and often the rate drops below normal as soon as temperatures cool, which suggests that the higher temperatures are killing people who are likely to die soon anyway.\\" In a 2007 discussion with Michael Shnayerson, Ebell criticized James Hansen's writings on climatic effects on animals by saying \\"James Hansen was not trained as a climate scientist\\", instead \\"He was trained as an astronomer. He's a physicist\\" and \\"you know from him talking about species' going north, he knows nothing about biology.\\" Ebell similarly argued that Robert Corell \\"is not a climate scientist\\" and \\"not an Arctic expert\\"; Corell told Shnayerson that his Arctic research visits began in 1968. Ebell has no scientific training, and told Shnayerson that, when asked about scientific topics in interviews, he would say \\"I'm not a climate scientist. I'm just giving you the informed layman's perspective\\". His view is that \\"If science is going to be discussed in the public arena, then shouldn't people other than scientists be allowed to participate? Isn't that what a representative democracy is?\\" Through CEI, Ebell has stated his belief that global warming is a hoax, that most of the data predicting climate change is false, and that the scientific consensus was \\"phony\\". In 2009 a Climatic Research Unit computer server at the University of East Anglia was hacked and thousands of emails and computer files were uploaded to a Russian server. Ebell said the hacked emails \\"make it clear that the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is an organized conspiracy dedicated to tricking the world into believing that global warming is a crisis that requires a drastic response.\\"Lauren Morello. Second Batch of Stolen \\"Climategate\\" Messages Emerges, Scientific American, November 23, 2011. =Environmentalists= Ebell has stated that environmentalists believe \\"humans are evil, the use of human power is always bad; everything we do to nature is bad.\\" Ebell views forced energy conservation as an infringement on American rights; he has stated: \\"Energy is fundamental to mobility, to comfort. When you start limiting people's access to energy, you limit their ability to live the way they want, to make choices.\\" Ebell compared his efforts and those of his colleagues to a \\"David versus Goliath struggle\\" against \\"corrupt environmentalism and big government\\", and has said that the \\"environmental movement is not an objective, well-intentioned movement that cares about saving the planet\\", but one which emerged from the New Left, and which always proposes the same solutions regardless of the issue: lower material standards of living, more government control, and more power for the technocratic elite. = The Endangered Species Act = In opposing a 2005 update, Ebell said that the Endangered Species Act unfairly infringes on land owners' property rights, as well as undermining the protection of rare species by encouraging land owners to make their property inhospitable to such species in order to escape regulation. Ebell stated in an interview that the CEI is \\"adamantly opposed\\" to the Endangered Species Act, and that they are working on it in a limited way now because they could not attract funding.\\"Some Like It Hot\\" (PDF) Chris Mooney, Mother Jones May/June 2005 issue. Trump Environmental Protection Agency transition team In September 2016, Ebell was appointed by then Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump to lead his transition team for the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). As of January 27, 2017, he was described as the former head of the transition team.http://time.com/4651407/trump-wants-to-slash-the-epas-workforce-and- budget-transition-official-says/  Personal life  Ebell resides in a suburb of Washington, D.C. with his wife and four children.

Biography He was born at Lyon, the son of √âtienne Delessert (1735‚Äì1816), the founder of the first fire insurance company and the first discount bank in France. Young Delessert was travelling in England when the French Revolution broke out, but he hastened back to join the Paris National Guard in 1790, becoming an officer of artillery in 1793. His father bought him out of the army, however, in 1795 in order to entrust him with the management of his bank. Gifted with remarkable energy, he started many commercial enterprises, founding the first cotton factory at Passy in 1801, and a sugar factory in 1802 where Jean- Baptiste Qu√©ruel developed the industrial manufacture of sugar from sugar beet, and for which he was created a baron of the Empire. He sat in the chamber of deputies for many years, and was a strong advocate for many humane measures, notably the suppression of the Tours or revolving box at the foundling hospital, the suppression of the death penalty, and the improvement of the penitentiary system. He was made regent of the Bank of France in 1802, and was also member of, and, indeed, founder of many, learned and philanthropic societies. In 1818 he founded with Jean-Conrad Hottinger the first savings bank in France, the Groupe Caisse d'Epargne and maintained a keen interest in it until his death in 1847. Benjamin had one daughter, Caroline Delessert. In 1858 Caroline married Baron Jean-Henri Hottinguer. Caroline Delessert. (Franz Xaver Winterhalter,1851) He was also an ardent botanist and conchologist; his botanical library contained 30,000 volumes, of which he published a catalogue Mus√©e botanique de M.

Like nuclear reactors, they generate electricity from nuclear energy, but differ in that they do not use a chain reaction. Although commonly called batteries, they are technically not electrochemical and cannot be charged or recharged. In comparison they are very costly, but have an extremely long life and high energy density, and so they are mainly used as power sources for equipment that must operate unattended for long periods of time, such as spacecraft, pacemakers, underwater systems and automated scientific stations in remote parts of the world.\\"A nuclear battery the size and thickness of a penny\\". Gizmag, 9 October 2009.\\"Tiny 'nuclear batteries' unveiled\\". BBC News, Thursday, 8 October 2009. Nuclear battery technology began in 1913, when Henry Moseley first demonstrated a current generated by charged particle radiation. The field received considerable in-depth research attention for applications requiring long-life power sources for space needs during the 1950s and 1960s. In 1954 RCA researched a small atomic battery for small radio receivers and hearing aids.\\"Atomic Battery Converts Radioactivity Directly Into Electricity\\". Popular Mechanics, April 1954, p. 87. Since RCA's initial research and development in the early 1950s, many types and methods have been designed to extract electrical energy from nuclear sources. The scientific principles are well known, but modern nano-scale technology and new wide-bandgap semiconductors have created new devices and interesting material properties not previously available. Nuclear batteries can be classified by energy conversion technology into two main groups: thermal converters and non-thermal converters. The thermal types convert some of the heat generated by the nuclear decay into electricity. The most notable example is the radioisotope thermoelectric generator (RTG), often used in spacecraft. The non-thermal converters extract energy directly from the emitted radiation, before it is degraded into heat. They are easier to minutarize and do not require a thermal gradient to operate, so they are suitable for use in small-scale applications. The most notable example is the betavoltaic cell. Atomic batteries usually have an efficiency of 0.1‚Äì5%. High-efficiency betavoltaic devices can reach 6‚Äì8% efficiency.  Thermal conversion  Thermionic conversion = A thermionic converter consists of a hot electrode, which thermionically emits electrons over a space-charge barrier to a cooler electrode, producing a useful power output. Caesium vapor is used to optimize the electrode work functions and provide an ion supply (by surface ionization) to neutralize the electron space charge. = Thermoelectric conversion = Radioisotope-powered cardiac pacemaker being developed by the Atomic Energy Commission, is planned to stimulate the pulsing action of a malfunctioning heart. Circa 1967. A radioisotope thermoelectric generator (RTG) uses thermocouples. Each thermocouple is formed from two wires of different metals (or other materials). A temperature gradient along the length of each wire produces a voltage gradient from one end of the wire to the other; but the different materials produce different voltages per degree of temperature difference. By connecting the wires at one end, heating that end but cooling the other end, a usable, but small (millivolts), voltage is generated between the unconnected wire ends. In practice, many are connected in series (or in parallel) to generate a larger voltage (or current) from the same heat source, as heat flows from the hot ends to the cold ends. Metal thermocouples have low thermal-to-electrical efficiency. However, the carrier density and charge can be adjusted in semiconductor materials such as bismuth telluride and silicon germanium to achieve much higher conversion efficiencies. = Thermophotovoltaic conversion = Thermophotovoltaic (TPV) cells work by the same principles as a photovoltaic cell, except that they convert infrared light (rather than visible light) emitted by a hot surface, into electricity. Thermophotovoltaic cells have an efficiency slightly higher than thermoelectric couples and can be overlaid on thermoelectric couples, potentially doubling efficiency. The University of Houston TPV Radioisotope Power Conversion Technology development effort is aiming at combining thermophotovoltaic cells concurrently with thermocouples to provide a 3- to 4-fold improvement in system efficiency over current thermoelectric radioisotope generators. = Stirling generators = A Stirling radioisotope generator is a Stirling engine driven by the temperature difference produced by a radioisotope. A more efficient version, the advanced Stirling radioisotope generator, was under development by NASA, but was cancelled in 2013 due to large-scale cost overruns.The ASRG Cancellation in Context Future Planetary Exploration  Non-thermal conversion  Non-thermal converters extract energy from emitted radiation before it is degraded into heat. Unlike thermoelectric and thermionic converters their output does not depend on the temperature difference. Non-thermal generators can be classified by the type of particle used and by the mechanism by which their energy is converted. = Electrostatic conversion = Energy can be extracted from emitted charged particles when their charge builds up in a conductor, thus creating an electrostatic potential. Without a dissipation mode the voltage can increase up to the energy of the radiated particles, which may range from several kilovolts (for beta radiation) up to megavolts (alpha radiation). The built up electrostatic energy can be turned into usable electricity in one of the following ways.  Direct-charging generator  A direct-charging generator consists of a capacitor charged by the current of charged particles from a radioactive layer deposited on one of the electrodes. Spacing can be either vacuum or dielectric. Negatively charged beta particles or positively charged alpha particles, positrons or fission fragments may be utilized. Although this form of nuclear-electric generator dates back to 1913, few applications have been found in the past for the extremely low currents and inconveniently high voltages provided by direct-charging generators. Oscillator/transformer systems are employed to reduce the voltages, then rectifiers are used to transform the AC power back to direct current. English physicist H. G. J. Moseley constructed the first of these. Moseley‚Äôs apparatus consisted of a glass globe silvered on the inside with a radium emitter mounted on the tip of a wire at the center. The charged particles from the radium created a flow of electricity as they moved quickly from the radium to the inside surface of the sphere. As late as 1945 the Moseley model guided other efforts to build experimental batteries generating electricity from the emissions of radioactive elements.  Electromechanical conversion  Electromechanical atomic batteries use the buildup of charge between two plates to pull one bendable plate towards the other, until the two plates touch, discharge, equalizing the electrostatic buildup, and spring back. The mechanical motion produced can be used to produce electricity through flexing of a piezoelectric material or through a linear generator. Milliwatts of power are produced in pulses depending on the charge rate, in some cases multiple times per second (35 Hz). = Radiovoltaic conversion = A radiovoltaic (RV) device converts the energy of ionizing radiation directly into electricity using a semiconductor junction, similar to the conversion of photons into electricity in a photovoltaic cell. Depending on the type of radiation targeted, these devices are called alphavoltaic (AV, Œ±V), betavoltaic (BV, Œ≤V) and/or gammavoltaic (GV, Œ≥V). Betavoltaics have traditionally received the most attention since (low-energy) beta emitters cause the least amount of radiative damage, thus allowing a longer operating life and less shielding. Interest in alphavoltaic and (more recently) gammavoltaic devices is driven by their potential higher efficiency.  Alphavoltaic conversion  Alphavoltaic devices use a semiconductor junction to produce electrical energy from energetic alpha particles.NASA Glenn Research Center, Alpha- and Beta- voltaics (accessed 4 October 2011)Sheila G. Bailey, David M. Wilt, Ryne P. Raffaelle, and Stephanie L. Castro, Alpha-Voltaic Power Source Designs Investigated , Research and Technology 2005, NASA TM-2006-214016, (accessed 4 October 2011)  Betavoltaic conversion  Betavoltaic devices use a semiconductor junction to produce electrical energy from energetic beta particles (electrons). A commonly used source is the hydrogen isotope tritium. Betavoltaic devices are particularly well-suited to low-power electrical applications where long life of the energy source is needed, such as implantable medical devices or military and space applications.  Gammavoltaic conversion  Gammavoltaic devices use a semiconductor junction to produce electrical energy from energetic gamma particles (high-energy photons). They have only recently (in the 2010s) been considered. A gammavoltaic effect has been reported in perovskite solar cells. Another patented design involves scattering of the gamma particle until its energy has decreased enough to be absorbed in a conventional photovoltaic cell. Gammavoltaic designs using diamond and Schottky diodes are also being investigated. = Radiophotovoltaic (optoelectric) conversion = In a radiophotovoltaic (RPV) device the energy conversion is indirect: the emitted particles are first converted into light using a radioluminescent material (a scintillator or phosphor), and the light is then converted into electricity using a photovoltaic cell. Depending on the type of particle targeted, the conversion type can be more precisely specified as alphaphotovoltaic (APV or Œ±-PV), betaphotovoltaic (BPV or Œ≤-PV) or gammaphotovoltaic (GPV or Œ≥-PV). Radiophotovoltaic conversion can be combined with radiovoltaic conversion to increase the conversion efficiency.  Radioisotopes used  Atomic batteries use radioisotopes that produce low energy beta particles or sometimes alpha particles of varying energies. Low energy beta particles are needed to prevent the production of high energy penetrating Bremsstrahlung radiation that would require heavy shielding. Radioisotopes such as tritium, nickel-63, promethium-147, and technetium-99 have been tested. Plutonium-238, curium-242, curium-244 and strontium-90 have been used. Micro-batteries Nuclear engineers at the University of Wisconsin, Madison have explored the possibilities of producing minuscule batteries which exploit radioactive nuclei of substances such as polonium or curium to produce electric energy. As an example of an integrated, self-powered application, the researchers have created an oscillating cantilever beam that is capable of consistent, periodic oscillations over very long time periods without the need for refueling. Ongoing work demonstrate that this cantilever is capable of radio frequency transmission, allowing MEMS devices to communicate with one another wirelessly. These micro-batteries are very light and deliver enough energy to function as power supply for use in MEMS devices and further for supply for nanodevices. The radiation energy released is transformed into electric energy, which is restricted to the area of the device that contains the processor and the micro-battery that supplies it with energy.

Biography Demochares is first heard of in 322, when he spoke in vain against the surrender of Demosthenes and the other anti-Macedonian orators demanded by Antipater. During the next fifteen years he probably lived in exile. On the restoration of the democracy by Demetrius Poliorcetes in 307 he occupied a prominent position, but was banished in 303 for having ridiculed the decree of Stratocles, which contained a fulsome eulogy of Demetrius. Demochares was recalled in 298, and during the next four years he fortified and equipped the city with provisions and ammunition. In 296 (or 295) he was again banished for having concluded an alliance with the Boeotians, and did not return until 287 (or 286). In 280 he induced the Athenians to erect a public monument in honour of his uncle with a suitable inscription. After his death (some five years later) the son of Demochares proposed and obtained a decree cites Plutarch, Vitae decem oratorum, p. 851 that a statue should be erected in his honour, containing a record of his public services, which seem to have consisted in a reduction of public expenses, a more prudent management of the state finances (after his return in 287) and successful begging missions to the rulers of Egypt and Macedon. Although a friend of the Stoic Zeno, Demochares regarded all other philosophers as the enemies of freedom, and in 306 supported the proposal of one Sophocles, advocating their expulsion from Attica. According to Cicero cites Cicero, Brutus, 83 Demochares was the author of a history of his own times, written in an oratorical rather than a historical style. As a speaker he was noted for his freedom of language (Parrhesiastes cites Seneca, De ira, iii. 23). He was violently attacked by Timaeus, but found a strenuous defender in Polybius. cites Polybius, xii. 13 See also Plutarch, Demosthenes, cites Plutarch, Demosthenes, 30 Demetrius, cites Plutarch, Demetrius 24 Vitae decem oratorum; cites Plutarch, Vitae decem oratorum p. 847 J.

The success of Operation Uranus, launched on 19 November 1942, had trapped 250,000‚Äì300,000 troops of General Friedrich Paulus' German 6th Army and parts of General Hoth‚Äôs 4th Panzer Army in Stalingrad. To exploit this victory, the Soviet general staff planned a winter campaign of continuous and highly ambitious offensive operations, codenamed \\"Saturn\\". Later Joseph Stalin reduced his ambitious plans to a relatively small campaign codenamed \\"Operation Little Saturn\\". The offensive succeeded in smashing Germany's Italian and Hungarian allies, applied pressure on the over stretched German forces in Eastern Ukraine and prevented further German advances to the relief of the entrapped forces at Stalingrad. Despite these victories, the Soviets themselves became over extended, setting up the stages for the German offensives of the Third Battle of Kharkov and the Battle of Kursk. Background On 17 May 1942, German Army Groups A and B launched a counteroffensive against advancing Soviet armies around the city of Kharkov, resulting in the Second Battle of Kharkov;Glantz (1997), p. 116 this would ultimately be expanded on 28 June into Case Blue, which aimed the capture of the Caucasus oil fields.Glantz (1997), p. 117 By 6 July, General Hermann Hoth's Fourth Panzer Army had taken the city of Voronezh, threatening to collapse the Red Army's resistance.Cooper (1978), pp. 415‚Äì416 By early August, General Paul Ludwig Ewald von Kleist's First Panzer Army had reached the oil center of Maykop, south of the city of Rostov,McCarthy & Syron (2002), p. 132 which had been taken by the Fourth Panzer Army on 23 July.Erickson (1975), p. 362 The rapid German advance threatened to cut the Soviet Union off from its southern territories, while also threatening to cut the lend-lease supply lines from Persia.Beevor (1998), p. 84 However, the offensive began to peter out, as the offensive's supply train struggled to keep up with the advance and spearhead units began to run low on fuel and manpower;Glantz (1997), pp. 119‚Äì120 for example, some panzer divisions were down to 54 tanks.Glantz (1997), p. 120 Eventually, the German focus shifted towards Stalingrad in an attempt to cut off supply shippings on the Volga river. The fall of Stalin‚Äôs namesake city would also mean a psychological boost for the Germans and, vice versa, a blow to the Soviets. However, after months of brutal fighting in which more than 90% of the city had been conquered by the Germans, the city would eventually deplete the German forces - the 6th Army and units from 4th Panzer Army - in their unsuccessful and exhausting attempt to expel the remainder of the Soviet defences. Both sides suffered enormous casualties during this battle, but, most importantly for the final outcome, the Germans severely depleted their forces, made them strip their flanks ever increasingly, leaving these in the hands of overstretched and poorly equipped Italian, Hungarian, and Romanian Allies. The dangerous situation that evolved, while addressed several times by worried German Generals, were ignored and, thus, had set the circumstances for the ultimate disaster for the Germans and their Allies. =Operation Uranus= Operation Uranus was the codename of the Soviet strategic operation in World War II which led to the encirclement of the German Sixth Army, Third and Fourth Romanian armies, and portions of the German Fourth Panzer Army. The operation formed part of the ongoing Battle of Stalingrad, and was aimed at destroying German forces in and around Stalingrad. Planning for Operation Uranus had commenced as early as September 1942, and was developed simultaneously with plans to envelop and destroy German Army Group Center and German forces in the Caucasus. The Red Army took advantage of the fact that German forces in the southern Soviet Union were overstretched around Stalingrad, using weaker Romanian armies to guard their flanks; the offensive's starting points were established along the section of the front directly opposite Romanian forces. These Axis armies were deployed in open positions on the steppe and lacked heavy equipment to deal with Soviet armor. =German attempt to relieve Stalingrad= Operation Winter Storm (Unternehmen Wintergewitter), undertaken between 12‚Äì23 December 1942, was the German Fourth Panzer Army's attempt to relieve encircled Axis forces during the Battle of Stalingrad. In late November, the Red Army completed Operation Uranus, which resulted in the encirclement of Axis personnel in and around the city of Stalingrad. German forces within the Stalingrad Pocket and directly outside were reorganized under Army Group Don, under the command of Field Marshal Erich von Manstein. As the Red Army continued to build strength, in an effort to allocate as many resources as possible to the eventual launch of the planned Operation Saturn, which aimed to isolate Army Group A from the rest of the German Army, the Luftwaffe had begun an attempt to supply German forces in Stalingrad through an air bridge. However, as the Luftwaffe proved incapable of carrying out its mission and it became more obvious that a successful breakout could only occur if it was launched as early as possible, Manstein decided to plan and launch a dedicated relief effort. Soviet counter- offensive: Operation Little Saturn After the defeat of the Romanian Army around Stalingrad and the successful encirclement of the German Sixth Army, Stalin started a counter-offensive nicknamed \\"Operation Little Saturn\\" in order to enlarge the area controlled by the Soviet Army in eastern Ukraine to Kharkov and Rostov. Zhukov states the South-Western Front was assigned a mission in which the 1st and 3rd Guard armies and the 5th Tank Army \\"were to strike out in the general direction of Morozovsk and destroy the enemy grouping in that sector.\\" They would be supported by the 6th Army of the Voronezh Front. =First stage: December 1942= The first stage -- an attempt to cut off the German Army Group A in the Caucasus -- had to be rapidly revised when General Erich von Manstein launched Operation Winter Storm on 12 December in an attempt to relieve the trapped armies at Stalingrad. While General Rodion Malinovsky's Soviet 2nd Guards Army blocked the German advance on Stalingrad, the modified plan Operation Little Saturn was launched on 16 December. Soviet forces during Operation Little Saturn in December 1942 This operation consisted of a pincer movement which threatened to cut off the relieving forces. General Fyodor Isidorovich Kuznetsov's 1st Guards Army and General Dmitri Danilovich Lelyushenko's 3rd Guards Army attacked from the north, encircling 130,000 soldiers of the Italian 8th Army on the Don and advancing to Millerovo. The Italians resisted the Soviet attack for nearly two weeks, although outnumbered 9 to 1 in some sectors, but with huge losses. Manstein sent the 6th Panzer Division to the Italians' aid: of the 130,000 encircled troops, only 45,000 survived after bloody fighting to join the Panzers at Chertkovo on 17 January. To the south the advance of General Gerasimenko's 28th Army threatened to encircle the 1st Panzer Army and General Trufanov's 51st Army attacked the relief column directly. In a daring raid, by 24 December tanks of the 24th Tank Corps had reached Tatskinskaya, the air base closest to Stalingrad from which the Luftwaffe had been supplying the besieged troops. The Soviet tanks drove through snowstorms onto the airfield and roamed about for hours, destroying the German transport planes at their leisure. With the relief column under threat of encirclement, Manstein had no choice but to retreat back to Kotelnikovo on 29 December, leaving the encircled Germans at Stalingrad to their fate. Of the 200,000 - 250,000 soldiers encircled 90,000 survived to be taken prisoner. Only 5,000 lived to return to Germany. The limited scope of the Soviet offensive also gave General Ewald von Kleist time to withdraw his Army Group A in the direction of the Kuban, with the exception of 1st Panzer Army which joined Army Group Don via Rostov. =Second stage: January 1943= The second stage of operations opened on 13 January 1943 with an attack by four armies of General Golikov's Voronezh Front that encircled and destroyed the Hungarian Second Army near Svoboda on the Don. As a consequence the Hungarian Second Army, as most other Axis armies in the Army Group B, ceased to represent a meaningful fighting force (indeed the German Sixth Army, encircled in Stalingrad, was destroyed on February 2, 1943) The Italian 8th Army's Alpini Corps, consisting of Alpine Divisions 3rd Julia, 2nd Tridentina and 4th Cuneense and the 156th Vicenza Infantry Division to their rear, were at this point largely unaffected by the Soviet offensive on their right flank. But on January 13, 1943, the Soviets launched their second stage of Operation Saturn, where four armies of Soviet General Filipp Golikov's Voronezh Front attacked, encircled, and destroyed the Hungarian Second Army near Svoboda on the Don to the northwest of the Italians. The Soviets then attacked and pushed back the remaining units of the German 24th Army Corps on the Alpini left flank and contemporarily attacked the Alpini themselves. Route of the Alpini toward Nikolaievka The Alpini held the front, but within three days the Soviets advanced to the left and right of the Alpini, who were thus encircled and forced to try to escape a siege (like the one of German sixth Army in Stalingrad). Preparations for a general retreat began on January 15. On the evening of January 17, the commanding officer of the corps General Gabriele Nasci ordered the retreat, which was fully carried out on January 19. By February first remnants of the Alpini reached the Kharkov area, where the Axis forces successfully organized a line of defense. The 4 Alpine Division Cuneense was annihilated. Only about one tenth of the 3 Alpine Division Julia reached the German lines (approximately 1200 of 15000 troops deployed) and only about one third of the 2 Alpine Division Tridentina remained (approximately 4250 of 15000 troops deployed). = Voronezh- Kastornensk operation = An attack on the German 2nd Army further north threatened to bring about an encirclement; although the German 2nd Army managed to escape, it was forced to retreat and by 5 February troops of the Voronezh Front were approaching Kursk and Kharkov.

It traces its origins to unions founded in the pastoral and mining industries in the 1880s and currently has approximately 100,000 members. It has exercised an influence on the Australian trade union movement and on the Australian Labor Party throughout its history. The AWU is one of the most powerful unions in the Labor Right faction of the Australian Labor Party.  Structure  The AWU is a national union made up of state, regional and industry-based branches. Each AWU member belongs to one of nine geographic or industry-based branches. Every four years AWU members elect branch and national officials: National President, the National Secretary, and the National Assistant Secretary. They also elect the National Executive and the Branch Executives which act as the Board of Directors for the union. The AWU's rules are registered with Fair Work Australia and its internal elections are conducted by the Australian Electoral Commission. The AWU is affiliated with the Australian Labor Party, Australian Council of Trade Unions, the International Metalworkers' Federation, the International Union of Foodworkers and the International Transport Workers Federation. The current AWU National President is Bill Ludwig, and the National Secretary is Daniel Walton. History Australian Workers' Union Hall, Chillagoe, Queensland, ca. 1915 Union building named in honour of Clarrie Fallon, 1953 The AWU grew from a number of earlier unions, notably the Australasian Shearers' Union, founded by William Spence, Alexander Poynton (OBE, an inaugural member of the Australian House of Representatives), brother Charles Poynton, and David Temple in Creswick, Victoria in 1886.Smith, Bruce A. created 20 April 2001, last modified 6 August 2010.

In 1894 this union amalgamated with the General Labourers Union, which had formed in 1891, to form the Australian Workers' Union.Smith, Bruce A. created 20 April 2001, last modified 6 August 2010. Trade Union Entry: General Labourers Union of Australasia. Australian Trade Union Archives. Retrieved 11 November 2011. The Queensland Shearers Union, formed in 1887, and the Queensland Workers Union merged in 1891 to form the Amalgamated Workers Union of Queensland. In 1904 the AWUQ amalgamated with the AWU, to form a union with a combined membership of 34,000. The AWU later absorbed a number of other unions in the pastoral, mining and timber industries notably the Amalgamated Workers Association of Queensland in 1913, and the Federated Mining Employees Association of Australia in 1917. Since these industries were the principal sources of Australia's wealth in the 19th century, the AWU soon became Australia's largest and most powerful union. The defeat of the great 1891 shearers' strike and the 1890 Maritime strike led the AWU to reject direct action, and it has been a force for moderation in the Australian union movement ever since. It was a firm opponent of the Industrial Workers of the World, the Communist Party of Australia, NSW Premier Jack Lang and other radical forces in the Australian labour movement. For many years Communists were banned from AWU membership. In the 1930s the Communist Party launched a rival Pastoral Workers Industrial Union, but this failed to break the AWU's grip on its membership. The Northern Territory branch of the AWU was a central faction in the most recent worker's rebellion in Australia, the Darwin Rebellion in 1912 - 1918. When the trade unions formed the Australian Labor Party following the defeat of the 1890s strikes, the AWU became a powerful influence in the party, particularly in Queensland and Western Australia, and to a lesser extent in the other states. Labor state governments were heavily influenced by AWU leaders such as Edward Grayndler, Tom Dougherty and NSW AWU Secretary Charlie Oliver. Labor was in government in Queensland from 1915 to 1929 and from 1932 to 1957, and the AWU was able to exert considerable political influence through long-serving premiers such as William Forgan Smith and Ned Hanlon. The federation of the Australian colonies in 1901 led to the establishment of the Australian Arbitration system. The AWU strongly supported arbitration as a mechanism of resolving industrial disputes without resorting to strike action. The Pastoral Industry Award, negotiated by the AWU, was the first federal award granted by the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration. The AWU maintained its registration under state industrial systems and continues to participate in many state awards. During the years since federation that the Australian industrial relations system has been dominated by the Court and its successors, the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission and the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, the AWU and its members were among that system's principal beneficiaries. The AWU remains a strong advocate of arbitration in the union movement. The AWU was not affiliated with the Australian Council of Trade Unions for many years, preferring to maintain its independent relationship with the arbitration system. With the shift in employment from the pastoral industries to the urban manufacturing and service sectors, the AWU's political influence and power declined as the pastoral areas became less significant in terms of employee numbers. This shift led to many rural electorate areas that were influenced by the AWU and workers falling to the conservative side of politics and in particular the National Party. The split in the Queensland ALP in 1957, which resulted in Labor being in opposition for 32 years, deprived the AWU of its greatest area of influence, although it remained influential in the long- serving (1941‚Äì65 and 1976‚Äì88) New South Wales Labor governments. In 1993 the AWU amalgamated with the Federation of Industrial Manufacturing and Engineering Employees (itself an amalgamation of the Federated Ironworkers' Association of Australia and the Australasian Society of Engineers) to form the AWU-FIMEE Amalgamated Union. In 1995 the union reverted to using the name Australian Workers' Union. In recent years the AWU has sought to modernise and to broaden its membership beyond its declining traditional base. Today it represents workers in the metals, aviation, oil and gas, mining, construction, food processing and retail industries, as well as its traditional base in the pastoral and mining areas. Its expansion into new areas has brought the AWU into conflict with some other unions, particularly the National Union of Workers and the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union. For many years the AWU published two newspapers, The Australian Worker in New South Wales and The Worker (founded in 1890) in Brisbane. Under the editorship of Henry Boote from 1916 to 1943 they were among the most influential union newspapers in Australia. The two papers were merged in 1974 and today The Australian Worker is published in a magazine format in association with Australian Consolidated Press. On 24 October 2017 the unions offices in Sydney and Melbourne were raided by the Australian Federal Police. The raids were on behalf of the Registered Organisations Commission (ROC). =Support for White Australia policy= Melbourne Trades Hall was opened in 1859 with Trades and Labour Councils and Trades Halls opening in all cities and most regional towns in the following forty years. During the 1880s Trade unions developed among shearers, miners, and stevedores (wharf workers), but soon spread to cover almost all blue-collar jobs. Shortages of labour led to high wages for a prosperous skilled working class, whose unions demanded and got an eight-hour day and other benefits unheard of in Europe. Eight-hour day march circa 1900, outside Parliament House in Spring Street, Melbourne. Australia gained a reputation as \\"the working man's paradise.\\" Some employers tried to undercut the unions by importing Chinese labour. This produced a reaction which led to all the colonies restricting Chinese and other Asian immigration. This was the foundation of the White Australia Policy. The \\"Australian compact\\", based around centralised industrial arbitration, a degree of government assistance particularly for primary industries, and White Australia, was to continue for many years before gradually dissolving in the second half of the 20th century. The growth of the sugar industry in Queensland in the 1870s led to searching for labourers prepared to work in a tropical environment. During this time, thousands of \\"Kanakas\\" (Pacific Islanders) were brought into Australia as indentured workers. This and related practices of bringing in non-white labour to be cheaply employed was commonly termed \\"blackbirding\\" and refers to the recruitment of people through trickery and kidnappings to work on plantations, particularly the sugar cane plantations of Queensland (Australia) and Fiji. In the 1870s and 1880s, the growing trade union movement began a series of protests against foreign labour. Their arguments were that Asians and Chinese took jobs away from white men, worked for \\"substandard\\" wages, lowered working conditions and refused unionisation. Objections to these arguments came largely from wealthy land owners in rural areas. It was argued that without Asiatics to work in the tropical areas of the Northern Territory and Queensland, the area would have to be abandoned. Despite these objections to restricting immigration, between 1875 and 1888 all Australian colonies enacted legislation which excluded all further Chinese immigration. Asian immigrants already residing in the Australian colonies were not expelled and retained the same rights as their Anglo and Southern compatriots. Agreements were made to further increase these restrictions in 1895 following an Inter-colonial Premier's Conference where all colonies agreed to extend entry restrictions to all non-white races. However, in attempting to enact this legislation, the Governors of New South Wales, South Australia and Tasmania reserved the bills, due to a treaty with Japan, and they did not become law. Instead, the Natal Act of 1897 was introduced, restricting \\"undesirable persons\\" rather than any specific race. The British government in London was not pleased with legislation that discriminated against certain subjects of its Empire, but decided not to disallow the laws that were passed. Colonial Secretary Joseph Chamberlain explained in 1897: > We quite sympathise with the determination...of these colonies...that there > should not be an influx of people alien in civilisation, alien in religion, > alien in customs, whose influx, moreover, would seriously interfere with the > legitimate rights of the existing labouring population.Speech to Colonial > Conference of 1897, quoted in J.

Crocker-Amazon covers the area south of Mission Street and Geneva Avenue, extending toward suburban Daly City. The neighborhood is adjacent to Crocker-Amazon Park, named after the Charles Crocker land holdings that once made up the area, and Amazon Avenue in the Excelsior. The winding streets of the neighborhood straddle the border between San Francisco and Daly City and largely blend in with the adjacent Daly City neighborhoods of Crocker and Southern Hills. Attractions and characteristics Crocker-Amazon neighborhood is slightly more affluent than the Excelsior, but retains much of the same racial diversity, including a large Filipino community. The majority of the neighborhood consists of single-family homes. Crocker-Amazon Park borders the neighborhood to the north. It has four playgrounds and recently renovated and lighted soccer and baseball fields. Adjacent to the east of Crocker-Amazon park is McLaren Park, San Francisco's second largest park after Golden Gate. It has a golf course, two lakes, jogging and hiking trails, a public pool, an old reservoir that is used as a dog swimming area, and the Jerry Garcia Amphitheater which houses concerts and festivals. The neighborhood benefits from some of the most varied weather in the city, with a balance of sun and fog. The top of the neighborhood boasts outstanding views of downtown San Francisco in the gap between McLaren Park and Twin Peaks. Parts of the neighborhood, particularly heading toward Southern Hills, feature free-standing single-family homes with at least 10 feet on either side (in many San Francisco neighborhoods, there is a gap of no more than a few inches between homes). The diverse architecture of the homes throughout the neighborhood include Marina, Arts & Crafts, Victorian, Edwardian, and Mid- Century Modern styles. The area is well-served by public transportation. MUNI Routes 8X, 8BX, and 54 serve the Geneva Avenue corridor and the 43 bus also serves Geneva Avenue, as well as Naples, Cordova, and Munich Streets. During rush hour, the Balboa Park Bart Station is only about a five-minute drive, an eight-minute bus ride, or a 15-minute walk. The neighborhood is convenient to nearby Interstate 280, and to the Alemany Boulevard thoroughfare. Crocker- Amazon is served by two elementary schools, Guadalupe and Longfellow. Geneva Avenue and Mission Street, which bound the neighborhood, feature commercial businesses, including a barber shop and a separate barber school, an optometrist, pizzerias, pharmacies, a hardware store and a vegetable market. The area also features a growing number of restaurants and cafes, many featuring various types of Mexican and Latin American (particularly Salvadoran) cuisine.

The bill was signed into law on September 4, 2003. Background Public awareness of prison rape is relatively recent and estimates of its prevalence vary widely. In 1974 Carl Weiss and David James Friar wrote that 46 million Americans would one day be incarcerated; of that number, they claimed, 10 million would be raped. A 1992 estimate from the Federal Bureau of Prisons conjectured that between 9 and 20 percent of inmates had been sexually assaulted. Studies in 1982 and 1996 both concluded that the rate was somewhere between 12 and 14 percent. A 1986 study by Daniel Lockwood put the number at around 23 percent for maximum security prisons in New York. In contrast, Christine Saum's 1994 survey of 101 inmates showed 5 had been sexually assaulted. In 2001 Human Rights Watch (HRW) released a paper called \\"No Escape: Male Rape in U.S. Prisons\\", the single event that contributed most to PREA's passage two years later. HRW had published several papers on the topic of prison rape in the years since its initial report called \\"All Too Familiar: Sexual Abuse of Women in U.S. State Prisons\\", released in 1996, when there was barely any Congressional support for legislation aimed at prison rape. A 1998 attempt by Representative John Conyers, Jr. (D-MI), known as the Custodial Sexual Abuse Act of 1998, was attached to the reauthorization bill for the Violence Against Women Act but summarily removed and never reintroduced. Michael Horowitz, a Hudson Institute senior fellow, has been credited with playing a part in passing PREA by helping to lead a coalition of the bill's supporters. Support and lobby The Prison Rape Elimination Act of 2003 was supported by a broad base of activists, lobbyists, and organizations, particularly Just Detention International. The Southern Baptist Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission lobbied for the passage of the legislation as did the conservative organization Concerned Women for America. These groups were part of a diverse coalition of human rights and religious groups which backed the legislation; other groups which supported the act were: Amnesty International USA, Focus on the Family, Human Rights Watch, the NAACP, the National Association of Evangelicals, Penal Reform International, Physicians for Human Rights, the Presbyterian Church USA, Prison Fellowship, the Salvation Army and the Union of American Hebrew Congregations. The bill was sponsored, in both houses of the U.S. Congress, by a bipartisan group of legislators. The initial sponsors of the bill in the Senate were Edward Kennedy (D-MA) and Jeff Sessions (R-AL) and, in the House of Representatives the legislation was sponsored by Representative Frank Wolf (R-VA) and Rep. Bobby Scott (D-VA), who was the initial co-sponsor. The Senate bill picked up four co-sponsors on the day it was passed, they were: Senators Mike DeWine (R-OH), Dick Durbin (D-IL), and Dianne Feinstein (D-CA). The House bill had a total of 32 co-sponsors, including Scott.H.R.1707 - Bill Summary & Status File\\", The Library of Congress THOMAS.gov, September 4, 2003 (last update), accessed June 5, 2008.

ActProvisions= The Act was passed by both houses of the U.S. Congress and subsequently signed by President George W. Bush in a White House ceremony on September 4, 2003.Jordan, Andrew, Morgan, Marcia, and McCampbell, Michael. \\"The Prison Rape Elimination Act: What Police Chiefs Need to Know\\", The Police Chief, vol. 73, no. 4, April 2006, accessed June 3, 2008.\\"Press Gaggle by Scott McClellan Aboard Air Force One en route to Kansas City, Missouri\\", The White House, (Press briefing transcript), September 4, 2003. The act aimed to curb prison rape through a \\"zero-tolerance\\" policy, as well as thorough research and information gathering. The act called for developing national standards to prevent incidents of sexual violence in prison. It also made policies more available and obvious. By making data on prison rape more available to the prison administrators as well as making corrections facilities more accountable for incidents pertaining to sexual violence and of prison rape it would more than likely decrease the crimes.National Institute of Justice Staff, \\"NIJ's Response to the Prison Rape Elimination Act\\", (PDF), Corrections Today, February 2006, accessed June 5, 2008. A major component of the PREA was the establishment of a \\"National Prison Rape Reduction Commission\\". The panel was established by the act and appointed in June 2004, though the law itself called for the commission's creation within 60 days of its passage.Marshall, Carolyn. \\"Panel on Prison Rape Hears Victims' Chilling Accounts \\", The New York Times, August 20, 2005, accessed June 3, 2008. The panel, known as the National Prison Rape Elimination Commission (NPREC), was charged with undertaking a study on the comprehensive effects of prison rape and its occurrences. The commission was also charged with information gathering through a variety of sources including public hearings. Eventually the commission will issue a report which includes its findings, conclusions and any recommendations.\\"About NPREC \\", National Prison Rape Elimination Commission, accessed June 5, 2008. In addition the law mandated that the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) \\"make the prevention of prison rape a top priority in each prison system\\". The DOJ's Bureau of Justice Statistics was mandated to produce an annual report on its activities concerning the topic of prison rape in the U.S. prison system. The law also made several other mandates for the DOJ. The National Institute of Corrections (NIC) was ordered to offer training and technical assistance, provide a clearinghouse for information and produce its own annual report to Congress. PREA required the DOJ to create a review panel designed to conduct hearings on prison rape, this panel was given subpoena power as well. At the top of the Justice Department PREA authorized the Attorney General to dispense grant money to facilitate implementation of the act. These grants are administered by the Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA) and the National Institute of Justice (NIJ). Representative Danny K. Davis (D-IL) introduced the Second Chance Act of 2007 on March 20 of that year, among its provisions was an amendment to PREA. The miscellaneous provisions of what was largely a law designed to help reintegrate criminal offenders into the community, extended the existence of the NPREC from 3 to 5 years after its inception date.H.R. 1593 - Bill Summary & Status File\\", The Library of Congress THOMAS.gov, April 9, 2008 (last update), accessed June 5, 2008. The Senate version was introduced nine days later and sponsored by then- Senator Joe Biden (D-DE). The Second Chance Act passed the House 347‚Äì62 on November 13, 2007. The bill passed the Senate by unanimous consent on March 11, 2008, and the life of the NPREC was extended when Bush signed the Second Chance Act of 2007 on April 9, 2008. =Juvenile justice= PREA covers all adult, as well as juvenile detention facilities; the definition of prison for the purposes of the act includes \\"any juvenile facility used for the custody or care of juvenile inmates.\\" U.S. Congress, within the text of PREA, noted that young, first-time offenders are at an increased risk of sexually motivated crimes. Juveniles held in adult facilities are five times more likely to be sexually assaulted than juveniles held in juvenile facilities. =Signing statement= Upon signing PREA, Bush issued a signing statement to accompany the law's passage. The signing statement specifically exempted the executive branch from two parts of section 7 of PREA. Section 7 deals with access for the NPREC to any federal department or agency's information that it deemed necessary to complete its job. The two specific sections that the signing statement allowed the executive branch to ignore if \\"disclosure could impair deliberative processes of the Executive or the performance of the Executive's constitutional duties\\" were 7(h) and 7(k)3. The signing statement maintained that this was within the Constitutional authority of the president. =Temporary lock-ups= PREA defines \\"prison\\" quite broadly, as \\"any federal, state, or local confinement facility, including local jails, police lockups, juvenile facilities, and state and federal prisons.\\" Thus, short-term lockups, such as holding facilities, and local jails, regardless of size, are also subject to the provisions of PREA. Failure by local authorities and operators of such facilities to comply with the provisions of PREA results in a 5% reduction in federal funding to that agency for each year they fail to comply. ImplementationGrants= PREA authorizes money in the form of grants for a wide variety of implementation associated activities. The grants can be utilized by state agencies for personnel, training, technical assistance, data collection, and equipment to prevent, investigate, and prosecute prison rape. Each state recipient is required to submit a report within 90 days laying out on what activities the money was spent on as well as the effect of those activities on prison rape within the state. In 2004 Congress appropriated US$25 million dollars for the grant program and in 2005 US$20 million. The BJA handed out $10 million of the 2004 appropriation in the fourth quarter of that year. The largest grant amount that year, $1 million, was handed out to the Department of Corrections in Iowa, Michigan, New York, Texas and Washington. =Immigration detention centers= PREA also applies to all federal immigration detention centers. In December 2006, NPREC held two days of hearings focusing on sexual violence and rape in immigration detention facilities. During the hearings they heard testimony from a female victim of sexual assault in an immigration facility as well as testimony from prison staff. The panel issued a statement reiterating that its policy of \\"zero- tolerance\\" applied to federal immigration facilities. In oral statements made by the U.S. delegation to the Committee Against Torture in 2006, Thomas Manheim with the U.S. DOJ responded to queries by Nora Sveaass about the implementation of PREA in immigration detention facilities. Some of the steps Manheim asserted Department of Homeland Security has taken included the development of a classification system to segregate violent and non-violent offenders, \\"widespread posting of instructions on how to report sexual misconduct\\", and PREA training for detention officers in the facilities. =Juvenile facilities= NPREC held hearings focusing specifically on the elimination of juvenile prison rape victims on June 1, 2006. Individual states have sought to comply with the mandates of PREA concerning juveniles, for instance, the Massachusetts Department of Youth Services worked with consultants from the Moss Group, Inc. to develop PREA policies and training. Research and studiesAnnual reports= In December 2007 United States Department of Justice published its 2006 report about rapes and sexual violence in American prisons. The report, which included information obtained from about 1.3 million prisoners, reported 60,500 cases of sexual violence ranging from unwanted touching to rape in 2006. In total, 4.5 percent of American prisoners reported an incident of sexual violence in the study.Kaufman, Pat. \\"Prison Rape: Research Explores Prevalence, Prevention\\", NIJ Journal, No. 259, March 2008, National Institute of Justice, United States Department of Justice, accessed June 5, 2008. =Congressional findings= The U.S. Congress, within the text of PREA, conservatively estimated that at least 13 percent of the inmates in the United States have been sexually assaulted in prison. Under this estimate, nearly 200,000 inmates now incarcerated have been or will be the victims of prison rape. The total number of inmates who have been sexually assaulted in the past 20 years likely exceeds 1,000,000.\\"Sigler, Mary, \\"By the Light of Virtue: Prison Rape and the Corruption of Character\\", (Abstract w/ link to document), Iowa Law Review, Vol. 91, pp. 561-607, 2006, accessed June 5, 2008. These numbers were derived based on the \\"testimony of social scientists and penologists\\". =Contracted research= PREA mandated that the NIJ provide funding for research conducted by private contractors, considered experts within the field. In 2006 alone, NIJ funded three major studies of sexual assault in prison. One study, initially released in January 2006 before being finalized or peer reviewed, by Mark Fleisher at Case Western Reserve University showed that prison rape was rarer than estimated. Fleisher's study reported that most prisoners who claim to have been raped are looking for money, publicity, a transfer, or lying. The study was immediately questioned and disputed by members of NPREC. Both Reggie B. Walton, NPREC chair, and commissioner Cindy Struckman-Johnson spoke out against the study, with Struckman-Johnson calling it unscientific.\\"Disputed study: Prison rape, sexual assault rare\\", Associated Press via NBC News, January 17, 2006, accessed June 5, 2008. Fleisher released a substantially revised version of the report in November 2006, Stop Prisoner Rape (now Just Detention International) stated it was \\"still plagued by many of the same fundamental flaws as the initial version.\\" Reaction The speed with which the bill passed, and the fact it was passed without public pressure, has been called \\"surprising\\". PREA went through both houses in July 2003, was presented to the president on September 2, 2003 and signed two days later. Human Rights Watch urged President Bush to sign the bill, and stated that if it were implemented correctly it would \\"catalyze nationwide efforts to eliminate prison rape by inmates and correctional staff.\\" Robert Weisberg, co-writing with David Mills, argued in Slate in October 2003 that PREA did little more than collect data. They argued that the bill's original title, the \\"Prison Rape Reduction Act\\", was probably a more likely predictor of its outcome. A similar position was put forth by Mike Farrell, writing in The Huffington Post, where he stated, \\"the National Prison Rape Elimination Commission meets periodically to 'study the impact of prisoner rape.' While they study, rape continues.\\" See also *Prison rape in the United States *Sexual abuse of women in American prisons ReferencesFurther reading *Beck, Allen J., et al. \\"Sexual Violence Reported by Correctional Authorities, 2006\\", (PDF), Bureau of Justice Statistics, August 2007, accessed on June 5, 2008. *Fleisher, Mark and Krienert, Jesse. \\"The Culture of Prison Sexual Violence\\", (PDF), November 2006, National Institute of Justice, accessed June 5, 2008. *Mariner, Joanne, et al.

Biography 1631 portrait of Feilding William Feilding was the son of Basil Fielding of Newnham Paddox in Warwickshire (High Sheriff of Warwickshire in 1612) and of Elizabeth, daughter of Sir Walter Aston (1530‚Äì1599) and his wife, Elizabeth (n√©e Leveson). cites . Feilding matriculated at Queens' College, Cambridge in 1603. Knighted on 4 March 1607, he was created Baron and Viscount Feilding in 1620. Two years later he was appointed Master of the Great Wardrobe and Custos Rotulorum of Warwickshire and Earl of Denbigh on 14 September 1622., He attended Prince Charles on the Spanish adventure, served as admiral in the unsuccessful Cadiz Expedition in 1625, and commanded the disastrous attempt upon Rochelle in 1628, becoming the same year a member of the Council of war, and in 1633 a Member of the Council of Wales and the Marches. In 1631, Lord Denbigh visited the East as erstwhile ambassador to the court of Safi of Persia as well as toured the East India Company's fledgling Indian possessions. On the outbreak of the English Civil War he served under Prince Rupert of the Rhine and was present at the Battle of Edgehill. On 3 April 1643 during Rupert's attack on Birmingham he was wounded and died from the effects on the 8th, being buried at Monks Kirby in Warwickshire. His courage, unselfishness and devotion to duty are much praised by Edward Hyde, Earl of Clarendon. Family In 1606 Feilding married Susan, daughter of Sir George Villiers, sister of the future Duke of Buckingham, and on the rise of Buckingham received various offices and dignities.

Zymography is an electrophoretic technique for the detection of hydrolytic enzymes, based on the substrate repertoire of the enzyme. Three types of zymography are used; in gel zymography, in situ zymography and in vivo zymography For instance, gelatin embedded in a polyacrylamide gel will be digested by active gelatinases run through the gel. After Coomassie staining, areas of degradation are visible as clear bands against a darkly stained background. Modern usage of the term zymography has been adapted to define the study and cataloging of fermented products, such as beer or wine, often by specific brewers or winemakers or within an identified category of fermentation such as with a particular strain of yeast or species of bacteria. Zymography also refers to a collection of related, fermented products, considered as a body of work. For example, all of the beers produced by a particular brewery could collectively be referred to as its zymography. See also Zymology or the applied science of zymography. Zymology relates to the biochemical processes of fermentation, especially the selection of fermenting yeast and bacteria in brewing, winemaking, and other fermented foods. For example, beer-making involves the application of top (ale) or bottom fermenting yeast (lager), to produce the desired variety of beer. The synthesis of the yeast can impact the flavor profile of the beer, i.e. diacetyl (taste or aroma of buttery, butterscotch). Gel zymography Samples are prepared in a standard, non-reducing loading buffer for SDS-PAGE. No reducing agent or boiling are necessary since these would interfere with refolding of the enzyme. A suitable substrate (e.g. gelatin or casein for protease detection) is embedded in the resolving gel during preparation of the acrylamide gel. Following electrophoresis, the SDS is removed from the gel (or zymogram) by incubation in unbuffered Triton X-100, followed by incubation in an appropriate digestion buffer, for an optimized length of time at 37 ¬∞C. The zymogram is subsequently stained (commonly with Amido Black or Coomassie Brilliant Blue), and areas of digestion appear as clear bands against a darkly stained background where the substrate has been degraded by the enzyme. Variations on the standard protocol The standard protocol may require modifications depending on the sample enzyme; for instance, D. melanogaster digestive glycosidases generally survive reducing conditions (i.e. the presence of 2-mercaptoethanol or DTT), and to an extent, heating. Indeed, the separations following heating to 50 ¬∞C tend to exhibit a substantial increase in band resolution, without appreciable loss of activity. A common protocol used in the past for zymography of Œ±-amylase activity was the so-called starch film protocol of W.W. Doane. Here a native PAGE gel was run to separate the proteins in a homogenate. Subsequently, a thin gel with starch dissolved (or more properly, suspended) in it was overlaid for a period of time on top of the original gel. The starch was then stained with Lugol's iodine. Gel zymography is often used for the detection and analysis of enzymes produced by microorganisms. This has led to variations on the standard protocol e.g. mixed-substrate zymography. Reverse zymography copolymerizes both the substrate and the enzyme with the acrylamide, and is useful for the demonstration of enzyme inhibitor activity. Following staining, areas of inhibition are visualized as dark bands against a clear (or lightly stained) background.

Basil Fielding, 2nd Earl of Denbigh (c. 160828 November 1675) was a diplomat, politician and parliamentarian army officer during the English Civil War. He was the eldest son of William Feilding, 1st Earl of Denbigh and Susan Feilding, Countess of Denbigh. Biography Like his father, the son was educated at Emmanuel College, Cambridge. He was summoned to the House of Lords as Baron Fielding in March 1629. After seeing military service in the Netherlands he was sent in 1634 by Charles I as ambassador to Venice, where he remained for five years. When the English Civil War broke out Fielding, unlike the other members of his family, ranged himself among the Parliamentarians, led a regiment of horse at the battle of Edgehill (his father being on the other side that day), and, having become Earl of Denbigh in April 1643, was made commander-in-chief of the Parliamentary army in Warwickshire and the neighbouring counties, and lord-lieutenant of Warwickshire. During the year 1644 he was fairly active in the field, but in some quarters he was distrusted and he resigned his command after the passing of the Self-denying Ordinance in April 1645. At the Treaty of Uxbridge in 1645 Denbigh was one of the commissioners appointed to treat with the king, and he undertook a similar duty at Carisbrooke in 1647. Clarendon relates how at Uxbridge, Denbigh declared privately that he regretted the position in which he found himself, and expressed his willingness to serve Charles I. He supported the New Model Army in its dispute with Long Parliament, but he would take no part in the regicide of Charles I. Under the government of the Commonwealth Denbigh was a member of the Council of State, but his loyalty to his former associates grew lukewarm, and gradually he came to be regarded as a royalist. In 1664 the earl was created Baron St Liz. Although four times married he left no issue when he died in 1675. His titles devolved on his nephew William Feilding, 3rd Earl of Denbigh (1640‚Äì1685), son and heir of his brother George (created Baron Fielding of Lecaghe, Viscount Callan and Earl of Desmond), and the earldom of Desmond has been held by his descendants in conjunction with the earldom of Denbigh.

He played most of his major league career with the Boston Red Sox, with his final season being for the New York Mets. He batted and threw right-handed. He was also a coach for the Los Angeles Dodgers. College career Valentin attended Seton Hall University, where he played college baseball for the Pirates under head coach Mike Sheppard. Valentin's teammates included future major leaguers Mo Vaughn and Craig Biggio. In 1988, he played collegiate summer baseball in the Cape Cod Baseball League for the Hyannis Mets. He was drafted by the Boston Red Sox in the 5th round of the 1988 MLB Draft. Professional career Valentin made his MLB debut as the starting shortstop against the Texas Rangers on July 27, 1992. He had one hit in four at-bats in his debut, with his first hit coming on an RBI single to short in the bottom of the 8th inning off of the Rangers Terry Mathews. He hit his first home run on August 22, 1992, off of Mike Schooler of the Seattle Mariners. On July 8, 1994, Valentin turned the 10th unassisted triple play in MLB history, in a game against the Mariners. In the 6th inning, Valentin playing shortstop, caught Marc Newfield's line drive, tagged second base before Mike Blowers could return to tag up, and tagged out Keith Mitchell who had been attempting to advance to second base. His best season was 1995, when he batted .298 with 27 home runs, 37 doubles, 20 stolen bases and 81 walks. Valentin finished ninth in the American League MVP voting, and helped lead the Red Sox to its first division title since 1990. Valentin had a .971 fielding percentage in his first three years as a shortstop for the Red Sox. On June 6, 1996, he hit for the cycle. During the 1996 season, Red Sox prospect Nomar Garciaparra battled for the spot of shortstop with Valentin, who had held the position for his entire career. Garciaparra took over the shortstop position in 1997, forcing Valentin to second base. Later that season, he shifted to third base after the regular third baseman, Tim Naehring, was injured. Valentin spent four more seasons with the Red Sox (playing only a total of 30 games over his last two years in a Red Sox uniform, the 2000 and 2001 seasons) He signed with the New York Mets as a free agent after the 2001 season and played in 114 games for them in 2002. In 11 seasons with the Red Sox and Mets, Valentin had a .279 batting average, and accumulated a total of 1093 hits. He hit 124 career home runs, and had 558 runs batted in. Valentin is the only Major League player to have pulled off an unassisted triple play, hit for the cycle and hit three home runs in a game.. Post-playing days In January 2008, Valentin joined the Inland Empire 66ers of San Bernardino (the High-A minor league affiliate of the Los Angeles Dodgers) as hitting coach for the 2008 season.ie66ers.com: \\"66ers Staff Set For 2008\\" Shortly after accepting this assignment, manager Dave Collins resigned for personal reasons, and Valentin was promoted to manager of the 66ers .

Jund Filastin, which encompassed most of Palaestina Prima and Palaestina Tertia, included the newly established city of Ramla as its capital and eleven administrative districts (kura), each ruled from a central town. History and structure According to al-Biladhuri, the main towns of the district, following its conquest by the Rashidun Caliphate, were Gaza, Sebastia, Nablus, Caesarea, Ludd, Yibna, Imwas, Jaffa, Rafah, and Bayt Jibrin. At first, under the early Umayyad caliphs, Ludd served as the district capital. After the caliph Sulayman ibn Abd al-Malik founded the nearby city of Ramla, he designated it the capital, and most of Ludd's inhabitants were forced to settle there. In the 9th century, during Abbasid rule, Jund Filastin was the most fertile of Syria's districts, and contained at least twenty mosques, despite its small size. The Arab tribes that settled Jund Filastin after the Muslim conquest were the Lakhm, Kindah, Qays, Amila, Judham and the Kinana; at the time of the Arab conquest, the region had been inhabited mainly by Aramaic-speaking Miaphysite Christian peasants. The population of the region did not become predominantly Muslim and Arab in identity until several centuries after the conquest. At its greatest extent, Jund Filastin extended from Rafah in the south to Lajjun in the north, and from the Mediterranean coast well to the east of the southern part of the Jordan River. The mountains of Edom, and the town of Zoar (Sughar) at the southeastern end of the Dead Sea were included in the district. However, the Galilee was excluded, being part of Jund al-Urdunn in the north. After the Fatimids conquered the district from the Abbasids, Jerusalem eventually became the capital, and the principal towns were Ashkelon, Ramla, Gaza, Arsuf, Caesarea, Jaffa, Jericho, Nablus, Bayt Jibrin, and Amman. The district persisted in some form until the Seljuk invasions and the Crusades of the late 11th century.

The KPTV host was well known locally for his iconic, button-covered sweater which he wore on air. He was rumored to have been the inspiration for Krusty the Clown, a character on the long-running animated sitcom The Simpsons, but this was eventually refuted. Biography Anders grew up in Multnomah County, Oregon and was born at St. Vincent's Hospital. He began his career in radio broadcasting in the 1950s, singing and playing music on Saturday mornings for Tillamook radio station KTIL. He stayed with KTIL until he was drafted into the armed forces, where he served as a radio repairman. When his tenure was up, he returned to radio, filling on-air positions beginning in 1958 at KFLW in Klamath Falls, Oregon and continuing to KXL and KPOJ. While working for KPOJ, Anders heard of an opening for a host on a local children's show called Popeye's Pier 12 on KPTV. He replaced host Bob Adkins (better known as \\"Addie Bobkins\\"). In the early 1970s, the show was renamed The Ramblin' Rod Show. By the late 1970s, Anders had begun to wear message buttons on his cardigan, all of which were given to him by fans. Within a few years, his cardigan was almost completely covered. At one point, the host estimated that he had received 10,000 to 15,000 buttons. Each year, Anders helped anchor local KPTV coverage of the Jerry Lewis MDA Telethon and the Easter Seals Telethon. He served as a moderator on a Saturday morning public affairs show called 12 in the Morning and appeared in many advertisements for Mike Salta Pontiac and Beaverton Toyota, two local automobile dealerships. Anders also served as one of KPTV's in-house studio announcers for many years. He retired in August 1997. In 1994, Anders constructed the Apple Valley Airport on land near his log cabin home in Buxton, Oregon, west of Portland. During his retirement, Anders enjoyed flying and spending time with his family. He died in May 2002 after succumbing to a stroke suffered while making a personal appearance at a Portland Volunteers of America Thrift Store located at 181st and Division streets, now defunct. Show According to an article that appeared in the Eugene Register-Guard, the premise of The Ramblin' Rod Show was that children \\"love slapstick comedy... and kids love to see themselves on television, which is why Anders insisted on the individual shots of each child.\\" The show was very popular, with a 20-25% share in its time slot and an audience that was often booked a month in advance. The show originally highlighted Popeye, cartoons, but later showed Hanna-Barbera, and Warner Bros. cartoons and also hosted a smile contest featuring members of the audience as contestants. Anders began each show by arriving on the set in a mobile tug-boat prop. The series, originally entitled Popeye's Pier 12, had several marine-themed characters but they were phased out over time, replaced with Chuck E. Cheese and his Pizzatime Players, who would come out and do a song and dance number with the audience, usually to slightly altered Americana songs, such as Dancing in the Street. The format of The Ramblin' Rod Show remained simple throughout Anders' tenure. The host introduced each guest, spoke with them, celebrated birthdays, played cartoons, and hosted smile contests. In the early years, Anders played guitar and had a skunk puppet named Petunia, which was phased out in later years. While he always appeared to be a smiling, friendly host, happily interacting with the kids on camera, many who visited the show as children reported that Anders was frequently impatient, unfriendly and aloof behind the scenes. In the 1970s and '80s, Smile contest winners and children celebrating their birthdays were entitled to complimentary Archway brand cookies and Pop Shoppe soda pop. Krusty the Clown inspiration A decades-old rumor claims that Ramblin' Rod inspired Matt Groening to create the character Krusty the Clown, the bitter host of a fictional children's program on The Simpsons. Groening, who grew up in Portland, was likely aware of Anders' show on KPTV. However, in interviews, Groening has mentioned that it was Ramblin' Rod's predecessor on KPTV, a somewhat melancholy clown named Rusty Nails, who was the creation of Jim Allen and served as a partial inspiration for the character of Krusty. Trivia In autumn of 2011, the Fizz Soda and Candy Shop, located in Portland, created, and are still adding to, a shrine to Ramblin' Rod. KPTV donated his microphone and an original Ramblin' Rod button to the shrine.Web Staff. (2012, Feb 23). Portland sweets shop pays tribute to ramblin‚Äô rod.

It is located on the East Fork Illinois River, about a mile southeast of the ghost town of Waldo. As of the 2010 census, it had a population of 378. Takilma is considered an alternative community and an informal artist colony, which is home to several artists, such as Commedia dell'arte Masks and Kendall Art Glass. It may be best known as the site of a tree house resort operated by Out'n'About. History According to Oregon Geographic Names, Takilma was originally called \\"Taklamah\\", probably by Col. T. W. Draper of the Waldo Copper Company for an Indian chief. The name was changed to \\"Takilma\\" in 1902, after the Takelma tribe, who lived on the Rogue River. The Takilma post office operated from 1902 until 1967. After that time the building became a general store, but was burned to the ground in 1988 after a man was murdered by the store's owner. =Counterculture= In the winter of 1968, hippies began moving into the Illinois Valley as part of the back to the land movement, notably into Takilma. Signs stating \\"We do not solicit hippy patronage\\" soon appeared in the windows of Cave Junction businesses. Despite this, the hippies stayed and became a force in the community. They founded the Takilma People's Clinic and later the Siskiyou Community Health Center, the Dome School, the Illinois Valley Fire District's Takilma station, the Siskiyou Regional Education Project and the Jefferson Baroque Orchestra. The Takilma People's Clinic was started in 1973, bringing the first new doctor to the Illinois Valley in years. The 1987 Longwood fire forced the clinic, now called the Siskiyou Community Health Center, to move into Cave Junction. It has since spawned sister clinics in Grants Pass and Roseburg. The Dome School opened in 1975 as an alternative to public education. It educates about 60 preschool through high school children each year, and runs a federally funded summer program for at risk children. The Illinois Valley Fire District's Takilma station was organized in the late 1970s and worked the firelines during the 1987 Longwood fire. The Jefferson Baroque Orchestra was formed in 1994 by Takilma resident Jim Rich, and is now in its 20th season, with performances in Grants Pass and Ashland. Many of the hippies were activists from California universities. They created Takilma's environmental organization, the Siskiyou Regional Education Project, in 1982. It now has offices in Grants Pass and Portland. A 1996 proposal for a prison near Cave Junction and Takilma brought the two communities together, but environmental issues still create a divide between them.

She was the second Navy ship named for Rear Admiral Charles Henry Davis (1807‚Äì1877). She served with the United States Coast Guard as (CG-21). Davis was launched 15 August 1916 by Bath Iron Works, Bath, Maine, sponsored by Miss E. Davis, granddaughter of Admiral Davis; and commissioned 5 October 1916, Lieutenant Commander R. F. Zogbaum, Jr., in command. Service historyWorld War I= Assigned to Destroyer Force, Atlantic Fleet, Davis operated on the east coast and in the Caribbean until the United States entered World War I. She sailed from Boston 24 April 1917 as one of six destroyers in the first American destroyer detachment to reach European waters, arriving at Queenstown, Ireland, 4 May. She performed patrol duty off the coast of Ireland and escorted merchant convoys through the zone of greatest danger from submarines. Between 25 and 28 June she met and escorted troop transports carrying the first American Expeditionary Force to France. She also rescued many survivors of torpedoed vessels, and on 12 May 1918 picked up 35 members of the crew of the German submarine , which had been sunk by , turning her prisoners over to British military authorities at Milford Haven. On 13 December 1918 she formed part of the escort force to take , with President Woodrow Wilson embarked, into the harbor at Brest, France, then passed in review before the President. =United States Coast Guard= Davis returned to New York 7 January 1919 and after an overhaul there joined Division 4, Flotilla 8, Destroyer Force, Atlantic Fleet, to cruise on the east coast. From September 1919 to November 1920 she was in reserve at Philadelphia Navy Yard. Arriving at Charleston, South Carolina, 3 December 1920, she operated from that port and Newport in reduced commission until arriving at Philadelphia Navy Yard 29 March 1922. She was decommissioned there 20 June 1922 and transferred to the Coast Guard 25 March 1926. Homeported in New London, Connecticut, she served as part of the Rum Patrol. Davis returned to the Navy on 30 June 1933. She was retained in a decommissioned status until sold 22 August 1934.

She was the second Navy ship named for Commodore Charles Wilkes (1798‚Äì1877). She served with the United States Coast Guard as (CG-25). Wilkes was laid down on 11 March 1915 at Philadelphia by the William Cramp & Sons Ship & Engine Building Co., launched on 18 May 1916, sponsored by Miss Carrie Mclver Wilkes; and commissioned on 10 November 1916, Lieutenant Commander Julius F. Hellweg in command. Service historyWorld War I= Wilkes spent the winter preceding America's entry into World War I outfitting‚Äîfirst in the Philadelphia Navy Yard and later in the Torpedo Station located at Newport, R.I.‚Äîand conducting fleet maneuvers in Cuban waters. She returned from those operations at the height of the crisis over the German declaration of unrestricted submarine warfare, arriving in Norfolk on 7 March 1917. Just one month later, on 6 April, the United States joined the war against the Central Powers. At the end of April, the destroyer escorted the French cruiser Amiral Aube from Norfolk to New York. On 15 June, she departed New York in the screen of the first American troop convoy to voyage to Europe. She escorted her charges into Saint Nazaire on 26 June then headed for Portsmouth, England, where she celebrated Independence Day. From there, she continued on to her permanent European base, Queenstown, Ireland, where she arrived on the 6th. Wilkes operated from the Queenstown base for the duration of World War I. For the most part, she conducted antisubmarine patrols and escorted convoys bound for England on the last leg of their voyage. Occasionally, however, she was called upon to shepherd convoys into port at Brest and Saint Nazaire, France. Although her duties appeared routine, they were strenuous. She spent many arduous days at sea in the stormy Atlantic with only hours or, at most, a day or two in port to provision. Though it appears that she never saw combat with German U-boats, she did witness the results of their depredations once when she rescued 23 survivors of the torpedoed British merchantman SS Purley on 25 July 1917. She continued her patrol and escort duties until after Christmas 1918, over a month after the cessation of hostilities. On 26 December, she departed Queenstown and headed for home. On 7 January 1919, she arrived in New York. Immediately upon her return, Wilkes began overhaul at New York. That occupied her time until 1 May when the destroyer embarked upon her most noteworthy postwar mission‚Äîduty as a picket ship for the first transatlantic flight. Only one of the four Navy-Curtiss (NC) flying boats slated for the mission actually completed the flight. NC-4 reached the Azores at Horta on 17 May, made the hop to Ponta Delgada on the 20th, and departed the Azores for Lisbon, Portugal, on the 27th. Wilkes served as a picket on that second leg of the flight as the fourth ship in a line of 14 destroyers between the Azores and the European continent. The NC-4 reached her destination that same day, and Wilkes' part in the event was completed. While NC-4 finished the third and last leg of its flight‚Äîfrom Lisbon to Plymouth, England‚Äîon 30 and 31 May, Wilkes pointed her bow homeward. The destroyer reentered New York harbor on 4 June and resumed peacetime operations along the Atlantic coast. For the next 34 months, she plied the waters off the eastern seaboard in the spring, summer, and fall. Late each fall, she headed south to participate in fleet maneuvers in Cuban waters, the Caribbean, and the Gulf of Mexico. During that time, she was based at three different ports‚ÄîNewport, R.I.; New York, N.Y.; and Charleston, S.C. On 12 April 1922, Wilkes entered the Philadelphia Navy Yard where she was placed out of commission on 5 June 1922. =United States Coast Guard= Wilkes remained inactive at Philadelphia for over four years. In the summer of 1926, she was turned over to the Coast Guard, desperately in need of additional ships to suppress the illegal, but lucrative, traffic in alcoholic beverages spawned by Prohibition. She was commissioned a Coast Guard destroyer at New London, Connecticut, on 23 August 1926, Lieutenant Commander M. J. Ryan, USCG, in command. For the next eight years, she patrolled the east coast from New England to Florida. In 1934, the repeal of Prohibition brought an end to the illicit alcohol trade and the \\"Rum Patrol\\" as well. Wilkes completed her last Coast Guard patrol at Philadelphia on 15 March 1934. There, she was placed out of commission on 29 March and returned to the Navy. On 5 July 1934, her name was struck from the Navy list. She was sold on 22 August 1934 for scrapping under the terms of the London Treaty for the limitation of naval armaments.

It is also known as Neem city because many of the city's streets are lined with Neem trees. Climate Monywa and neighbouring parts of the 'Dry Valley' are the only places in South East Asia where you find the Hot Semi-arid/steppe climate(BSh). The city barely misses the Tropical savanna/Wet and dry climate(Aw) classification due to the very high temperatures(high evaporation levels) and a long dry season. This has to do with the 'Dry valley' being located in the rain shadow of the Arakan Mountains. Temperatures are very high throughout the year, although the winter months (December‚ÄìFebruary) are significantly milder(around 21 ¬∞C in January). The early monsoon months from April to July are especially hot, with average high temperatures reaching in April. Monywa received of rainfall on 19 Oct 2011. This was a new record for rainfall within 24 hours in October in Monywa for the last 47 years. The previous record was on 24 Oct 1967.http://www.mrtv3.net.mm/newpaper/2110newsm.pdf Page 19 Col 2 Transport River Chindwin at Monywa Monywa is served by the Mandalay- Budalin branch railway line, but is best reached by bus as the road from Mandalay is in reasonably good shape. Monywa is linked by road to Budalin, Dabayin, Ye-U and Kin-U, and by rail to Sagaing and the Mandalay - Myitkyina line. River transport on the Chindwin has always been important as it is navigable for to Hkamti during the monsoon season, and most of the year to Homalin. Economy Thanboddhay Pagoda Market Monywa is a major centre for trade and commerce and for agricultural produce from the surrounding Chindwin valley, especially beans, orange, pulses and jaggery (palm sugar). In addition, the local industry includes mills for the production of cotton, flour, noodles, and edible oils. Sausages from Alon called wet udaunk are quite popular, and Budalin longyi (sarong) is known for the strength of the fabric and its checked patterns. Monywa's rough cotton blankets are famous throughout Myanmar (with Monywa providing 80% of the country's blankets for a century), and some can even be found sewn up into knapsacks sold to unsuspecting tourists in Bangkok. Other regional crafts include bamboo and reed products, bullock carts and agricultural implements. The village of Kyaukka is well known for its lacquerware utensils for everyday use. Black market goods from India, especially saris and bicycle parts, pass through Monywa on their way to other parts of Myanmar. Attractions the entrance of the city The major tourist attraction in Monywa is Thambuddhe Pagoda , a Buddhist temple with a huge stupa resembling Indonesia's Borobudur. It dates from 1303, although it was reconstructed in 1939. It is said to contain over 500,000 images of Buddha. Close by is the Maha Bodhi Tahtaung Laykyun Sekkya standing Buddha statue, the 3rd tallest statue in the world, with 115,82 metres (at a total of 129.23 metres, including pedestal). This is the focal point of a sprawling site filled with Buddha statues, bodhi trees, and pagodas, established by the Maha Bodhi Ta Htaung Sayadaw in the 1960s. It includes also a 95-metre long reclining Buddha statue. Another attraction is the Phowintaung cave complex across the Chindwin River, approximately west of Monywa. Nyaung-gan Bronze Age cemetery, dated to between 1,500 BCE and 500 BCE, in Budalin with bronze tools, ceramics and stone artifacts is 60 minutes travel on a narrow road north of Monywa.Once feted by Myanmar's junta, Bronze Age cemetery site returns to the spotlight, Forntier Myanmar. Very few tourists visit Monywa as its facilities are limited.

Although the BCP is no longer active, the Myanmar military presence in Monywa remains heavy.  Writing community  Monywa is known nationally as a center for poets, and is often described as the poetic center of the north of Myanmar. It is home to contemporary poet and publisher Min Swe Hnit, who has published nearly 100 volumes of poetry as of Winter 2019.

Nc3 This fairly uncommon opening may have more names than any other: it is also called the Heinrichsen Opening, Baltic Opening, Van Geet Opening, Sleipnir Opening, Kotrƒç's Opening, Me≈°troviƒá Opening, Romanian Opening, Queen's Knight Attack, Queen's Knight Opening, Millard's Opening, Knight on the Left, and (in German) der Linksspringer. Origin of names The names Heinrichsen and Baltic derive from Lithuanian chess player Arved Heinrichsen (1876-1900). The opening was analyzed and played by the New York master Ted A. Dunst (1907-1985), giving the opening its most popular name in the United States. The Dutch International Master and correspondence grandmaster Dirk Daniel (\\"Dick D.\\") van Geet (1932-2012) frequently played 1.Nc3, so it is often called the Van Geet Opening in the Netherlands. The appellation Sleipnir seems to come from Germany. Sleipnir is Odin's (Wotan in German) magical eight- legged horse, and chess knights are horses with up to eight different possible moves each turn. Czech Jan Kotrƒç (1862-1943), editor and publisher of the magazine ƒåesk√© Listy, said the opening was analyzed by English players. Zvonimir Me≈°troviƒá (b. 1944) is a Slovenian International Master who often adopts this opening. Tim Harding refers to it as the \\"Queen's Knight Attack\\" . National Master Hugh Myers called it \\"Millard's Opening\\" after Henry Millard (1824-1891), a blind correspondence chess player who drew with the opening in a simultaneous exhibition against Joseph Henry Blackburne. Blackburne later played the opening himself against Josef Noa in the London 1883 international chess tournament .Blackburne‚ÄìNoa, London 1883. ChessGames.com. Retrieved on 2009-02-06. The German FIDE Master Harald Keilhack in his 2005 book on the opening states that it has also been referred to as the Romanian Defense, and that he prefers the neutral appellation \\"Der Linksspringer\\" or, in English, \\"the Knight on the Left\\" . General remarks The opening move 1.Nc3 develops the knight to a good square where it attacks the central e4 and d5 squares. Although quite playable, 1.Nc3 is rarely seen; it is only the eighth most popular of the 20 possible first moves, behind 1.e4, 1.d4, 1.Nf3, 1.c4, 1.g3, 1.f4, and 1.b3. As of February 6, 2009, out of the over 500,000 games in ChessGames.com's database, only 644--about 1 out of every 780--begins with 1.Nc3.Opening Explorer. ChessGames.com. Retrieved on 2009-02-06. The third- ranking 1.Nf3 is 66 times as popular. Some very strong correspondence chess players employ 1.Nc3 frequently, and it is occasionally seen over-the-board. The reasons for 1.Nc3's lack of popularity are that it does not stop Black from occupying the center (while 1.Nf3 prevents 1...e5, 1.Nc3 does not prevent 1...d5 because the d-pawn is guarded by the queen), and it blocks White's c-pawn from moving, thus making it impossible to play c3 or c4 (which are often desirable moves) without moving the knight first. In addition, after 1...d5, the knight's position is unstable because Black may attack it with ...d4. Although 1.Nc3 develops a piece to a good square (unlike 1.Na3 or 1.Nh3), and does not weaken White's position (unlike, e.g., 1.g4 or 1.f3) or waste time (unlike, e.g., 1. c3), the above-stated drawbacks make it an inferior way of attempting to exploit White's first-move advantage. Of the 644 games with 1.Nc3 in ChessGames.com's database, White won 34.8%, drew 23.9%, and lost 41.3%, for a total winning percentage of only 46.75%.White's overall winning percentage is derived by taking the percentage of games won by White and adding half of the percentage of drawn games, in this case 34.8 plus half of 23.9. White scores much better with the more popular 1.e4 (54.25%), 1.d4 (55.95%), 1.Nf3 (55.8%), 1.c4 (56.3%), and 1.g3 (55.8%). However, as of October 2018, for the 38,043 games with 1.Nc3 in Lichess.org's database, White has a total winning percentage of 57.25% (55% won, 5% drawn, 40% lost), although it is still only the tenth most popular first move for White. Possible continuations1...d5= This is one of Black's best replies, occupying the center and underscoring the unsettled position of White's knight. White can prevent 2...d4 by playing 2.d4 himself, but he then obtains a somewhat inflexible position in the Queen's Pawn Game with his knight blocking the c-pawn . Also possible is 2.Nf3 (and if 2...d4, 3.Ne4), a sort of Black Knights' Tango with an extra move . A third line is 2.e3, which Keilhack calls \\"the M√ºller game,\\" when White hopes for 2...e5 (other moves are also playable, of course) 3.Qh5!?, e.g. 3...Nc6 4.Bb5 Qd6 5.d4 exd4 6.exd4 Nf6 7.Qe5+! Be6?! (Keilhack recommends 7...Kd8!! 8.Bxc6 bxc6 9.Nf3 Bg4) 8.Bf4 0-0-0 9.Bxc6 Qxc6? 10.Nb5!, when White wins at least a pawn . White's most common response to 1...d5 is 2.e4. This is the same position as 1.e4 d5 2.Nc3, an obscure branch of the Scandinavian Defense. Black has five plausible responses to 2.e4: 2...e6 and 2...c6 transpose to the French and Caro‚ÄìKann Defenses, and 2...Nf6 to a variation of Alekhine's Defence. The move 2...d4 gives Black a spatial advantage, which White may work to undermine along the lines of hypermodernism. Keilhack writes, \\"2...d4 is chosen either by somewhat naive players who are attracted by the fact that Black wins time and space ... or by strong players who are aware of the strategic risks but are striving for a complex battle.\\" He considers the Van Geet Attack, 2...d4 3.Nce2 followed by Ng3, to be \\"the core of the 1.Nc3 opening,\\" \\"a fully independent entity which strives for early knight activity on the kingside,\\" usually with Ng3, Nf3, Bc4 or Bb5, 0-0, and d3 . Alternative lines for White include the unusual 3.Nb1!?, with which van Geet once drew Spassky, and, after 3.Nce2, playing a sort of King's Indian Attack with d3, g3, Bg2, f4, Nf3, and 0-0 ‚Äì a line Keilhack calls the \\"Lizard Attack\\" . The fifth alternative, 1...d5 2.e4 dxe4, leads to more open play. After 3.Nxe4, Black has a number of playable moves, including 3...e5, 3...Nc6, 3...Bf5, 3...Nd7, 3...Nf6, and even 3...Qd5!?, when 4.Nc3 transposes to the Scandinavian Defense . After 3...e5, White's thematic move is 4.Bc4, when several of Black's plausible moves lead to disaster, e.g. 4...Be7? 5.Qh5! and White wins at least a pawn after 5...g6 6.Qxe5 or 5...Nh6 6.d3; or 4...Nf6? 5.Ng5! Nd5 and now 6.d4!, 6.Qf3!, and 6.Nxf7!? Kxf7 7.Qf3+ are all possible, with positions similar to the line of the Two Knights Defense beginning 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Nf6 4.Ng5 d5 5.exd5 Nxd5?! . However, 3...e5 4.Bc4 Nc6! is playable . International Master Richard Palliser, in his 2006 book Beating Unusual Chess Openings, recommends 1...d5 2.e4 dxe4 3.Nxe4 Nd7 for Black. He explains, \\"Black doesn't attempt to refute White's opening or to gain lots of space (as with 2...d4), but simply settles for sensible development. The position should be compared to both a Caro-Kann Defense and a French Rubinstein. Black will hope to demonstrate that he has gained from the omission of an early ...c6 or ...e6, while White will generally omit d4, preferring a setup with Bc4 and d3\\" . After 4.Bc4, the natural move 4...Ngf6!? leads to very sharp and unclear play if White responds with 5.Bxf7+!? Kxf7 6.Ng5+ Kg8 7.Ne6 Qe8 8.Nxc7 . More solid is 4...e6 (\\"!\\" ‚Äì Keilhack) . =1...c5= 1...c5 is often played by devotees of the Sicilian Defence, into which the game often transposes, either immediately after 2.e4 or at a later point. Alternatively, White can remain in independent 1.Nc3 lines, at least for the time being, with 2.Nf3 followed by 3.d4, which gives Black a large choice of possible responses. One line Palliser recommends for Black is 2.Nf3 Nf6 3.d4 (3.e4 transposes to a Sicilian) cxd4 4.Nxd4 d5!? (seizing the center) 5.Bg5 Nbd7! 6.e4 (more critical than the passive 6.e3?!) dxe4 7.Qe2 e6!? 8.0-0-0 Be7 9.Nxe4 0-0 when \\"White doesn't appear to have any advantage\\" . If White chooses to transpose to standard Sicilian lines, the fact that his knight is committed to c3 may be a disadvantage in certain lines. The Closed Sicilian, commonly reached by 1.e4 c5 2.Nc3, without an early d4 by White, gives Black few theoretical difficulties . If White instead chooses to play an Open Sicilian with 2.e4 and 3.Nf3 or Nge2, followed by d4, the knight's placement on c3 prevents White from playing the Mar√≥czy Bind with c4. This makes the Accelerated Dragon Variation with 2...Nc6 and 3...g6 particularly attractive . Black may also stop White's intended d4 by playing an early ...e5, e.g. 1.Nc3 c5 2.e4 Nc6 3.Nf3 e5 or 3.Nge2 e5 . =1...Nf6= Grandmaster Larry Kaufman recommends 1...Nf6, intending to meet 2.e4 with 2...e5 or 2.d4 with 2...d5 . Keilhack writes that \\"1...Nf6 is one of the most unpleasant replies for the 1.Nc3 player. Black keeps all options open, he can choose between a central (...d5, possibly followed by ...c5) and an Indian (...g6, ...Bg7) setup. ... Among the many possible [second] moves [for White], none really stands out.\\" . The most straightforward moves for White are 2.d4 and 2.e4, but neither promises White a significant advantage. After 2.d4, 2...d5 leads to the Richter-Veresov Attack (3.Bg5) or another type of Queen's Pawn Game where White, having blocked his c-pawn, has little chance for advantage . After 2.e4, Black can again play 2...d5 with a type of Alekhine's Defense; or 2...d6 3.d4 g6 with a Pirc Defense or 3...e5 with a Philidor's Defense. The most solid response to 2.e4 is 2...e5, leading to a Vienna Game or, after 3.Nf3 Nc6, to a Four Knights Game‚Äîneither of which offers White an appreciable advantage . Keilhack also analyzes a number of offbeat possibilities, including 2.b3, 2.Nf3, 2.f4 (an unusual form of Bird's Opening that Keilhack calls the \\"Aasum System\\"), 2.g3, and even the gambit 2.g4?! Palliser writes that none of the alternatives to 2.e4 \\"really convince or should greatly trouble Black over the board\\" . =1...e5= This natural move is playable, but dangerous if Black does not know what he is doing. One of the main lines is 1...e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.d4, with poor chances for Black, continued by 3...exd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Bg5. Keilhack writes that this variation \\"occurs rather often and offers excellent chances for an early knockout\\" by White and that \\"only two [moves] (5...Bb4 and 5...Bc5) do not immediately ruin Black's game\\" . (See, e.g., the Dunst‚ÄìGresser game given below.) Transpositions to other openings The move 1.Nc3 is considered an irregular opening, so it is classified under the A00 code in the Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings (also see List of chess openings). Transpositions to more common openings are possible, many of which are discussed in the preceding section. In addition, 1.Nc3 d5 2.e4 reaches a position in the Scandinavian Defense; 1.Nc3 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.d4 exd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.e4 leads to a Scotch Four Knights Game; 1.Nc3 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.e4 Bc5 or 3...g6 gives a Three Knights Game; 1.Nc3 Nc6 2.d4 d5 3.e4, or 2...e5 and now 3.d5 Nce7 4.e4 or 3.dxe5 Nxe5 4.e4, yields a Nimzowitsch Defense; and 1.Nc3 b6 2.e4 Bb7 3.d4 is an Owen's Defense. Transposition to a Dutch Defense is also possible after 1.Nc3 f5 2.d4, but Keilhack considers 2.e4! more dangerous, intending 2...fxe4 3.d3, a reversed From's Gambit . Black alternatives to 2...fxe4 include 2...d6, when 3.d4 transposes to the Balogh Defense; and 2...e5?!, when 3.Nf3 produces a Latvian Gambit, but 3.exf5!, as in a game between Steinitz and Sam Loyd, may be stronger.Steinitz‚ÄìLoyd, London 1867 Sample games *Here is a quick victory by Dunst himself against nine-time U.S. Women's Champion Gisela Gresser.

The M'alayah's contemporary equivalent in East Africa is the chura of Tanzania. The dance is sexually suggestive in nature, with women tying up their lower torso with a piece of cloth or Keffiyeh, and performing sensual fast movements. There is no set pattern and method of performing the dance although some of its movements can be likened to those in bellydance, hip hop (\\"booty popping\\"), or Mapouka. It is known for its fast sensual movements of the buttocks and backside. Primarily this dance is more often performed by groups that usually comprise singers, dancers and also backup musicians. These groups perform in special occasions such as weddings. The dance is accompanied by singing various songs that are unique to this type of dance.

It originated in the Syracuse University newspaper The Daily Orange. The comics are usually three or four panels long, and are generally characterized by the juxtaposition of whimsical childlike imagery or fantasy with morbid, sudden or unexpected surreal humor. Common subjects include irony, religion, sexuality, war, science fiction, suicide, violence, and death. The comic received its title, taken from the name of a church in Perry, Maine, in its Daily Orange incarnation.\\" Interview: Nicholas Gurewitch Pt. 1 (of 2) \\" Daily Crosshatch, February 27, 2007.  Art The art in The Perry Bible Fellowship varies from strip to strip. While some comics feature simplistic human figures with little more than a mouth and eyes for a face, other strips are extensively colored and meticulously detailed. Sometimes, the artistic style changes within the strip itself. A recurring feature of the strip is simplistically-drawn human figures exhibiting little detail or realism, and heads reminiscent of smiley faces. Some strips emulate the styles of famous illustrators such as Shel Silverstein, Edward Gorey, and Robert Crumb, made evident by marginal notes such as \\"(Apologies, R. Crumb)\\". Gurewitch is also known for including Easter eggs in various strips. =Awards= Gurewitch has received multiple major awards for The Perry Bible Fellowship, such as the Ignatz Award for Outstanding Online Comic in 2005 and 2006. The Perry Bible Fellowship has also won the Web Cartoonist's Choice Award for outstanding comic in 2006 and 2007. In total, PBF has received eight Web Cartoonist's Choice Awards in various categories. Most recently, Gurewitch won the 2007 Harvey Award for \\"Best Online Comics Work\\". In July 2008, Perry Bible Fellowship: The Trial of Colonel Sweeto and Other Stories won an Eisner Award.2008 Eisner Award Winners =Publishing= The comic first appeared in 2002 in The Daily Orange of Syracuse, New York, while Gurewitch was art director at Syracuse University, and by 2007 was also being printed in Maxim, The Guardian, the Boston Weekly Dig, The Baltimore City Paper, and The Chicago Reader. According to the official website, the comic also appeared in several other publications, including the New York Press. On August 1, 2006, after several months on a temporary site managed by Cheston Gasik, the comic moved to its permanent web site at \`pbfcomics.com\`. On February 18, 2008, Nicholas Gurewitch announced he was cutting back on the production of the comic strip, saying \\"I feel I owe it to myself and the Perry Bible Fellowship not to turn a joyful diversion into a long career.\\" Previously a weekly strip, it is now infrequently updated.

MethodsFinite difference method= In this method, functions are represented by their values at certain grid points and derivatives are approximated through differences in these values. =Method of lines= The method of lines (MOL, NMOL, NUMOLHamdi, S., W. E. Schiesser and G. W. Griffiths (2007), Method of lines, Scholarpedia, 2(7):2859.) is a technique for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) in which all but one dimension is discretized. MOL allows standard, general-purpose methods and software, developed for the numerical integration of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and differential algebraic equations (DAEs), to be used. A large number of integration routines have been developed over the years in many different programming languages, and some have been published as open source resources. The method of lines most often refers to the construction or analysis of numerical methods for partial differential equations that proceeds by first discretizing the spatial derivatives only and leaving the time variable continuous. This leads to a system of ordinary differential equations to which a numerical method for initial value ordinary equations can be applied. The method of lines in this context dates back to at least the early 1960s.E. N. Sarmin, L. A. Chudov (1963), On the stability of the numerical integration of systems of ordinary differential equations arising in the use of the straight line method, USSR Computational Mathematics and Mathematical Physics, 3(6), (1537‚Äì1543). =Finite element method= The finite element method (FEM) is a numerical technique for finding approximate solutions to boundary value problems for differential equations. It uses variational methods (the calculus of variations) to minimize an error function and produce a stable solution. Analogous to the idea that connecting many tiny straight lines can approximate a larger circle, FEM encompasses all the methods for connecting many simple element equations over many small subdomains, named finite elements, to approximate a more complex equation over a larger domain. =Gradient discretization method= The gradient discretization method (GDM) is a numerical technique that encompasses a few standard or recent methods. It is based on the separate approximation of a function and of its gradient. Core properties allow the convergence of the method for a series of linear and nonlinear problems, and therefore all the methods that enter the GDM framework (conforming and nonconforming finite element, mixed finite element, mimetic finite difference...) inherit these convergence properties. =Finite volume method= The finite-volume method is a method for representing and evaluating partial differential equations in the form of algebraic equations [LeVeque, 2002; Toro, 1999]. Similar to the finite difference method or finite element method, values are calculated at discrete places on a meshed geometry. \\"Finite volume\\" refers to the small volume surrounding each node point on a mesh. In the finite volume method, volume integrals in a partial differential equation that contain a divergence term are converted to surface integrals, using the divergence theorem. These terms are then evaluated as fluxes at the surfaces of each finite volume. Because the flux entering a given volume is identical to that leaving the adjacent volume, these methods are conservative. Another advantage of the finite volume method is that it is easily formulated to allow for unstructured meshes. The method is used in many computational fluid dynamics packages. =Spectral method= Spectral methods are techniques used in applied mathematics and scientific computing to numerically solve certain differential equations, often involving the use of the fast Fourier transform. The idea is to write the solution of the differential equation as a sum of certain \\"basis functions\\" (for example, as a Fourier series, which is a sum of sinusoids) and then to choose the coefficients in the sum that best satisfy the differential equation. Spectral methods and finite element methods are closely related and built on the same ideas; the main difference between them is that spectral methods use basis functions that are nonzero over the whole domain, while finite element methods use basis functions that are nonzero only on small subdomains. In other words, spectral methods take on a global approach while finite element methods use a local approach. Partially for this reason, spectral methods have excellent error properties, with the so-called \\"exponential convergence\\" being the fastest possible, when the solution is smooth. However, there are no known three-dimensional single domain spectral shock capturing results.pp 235, Spectral Methods: evolution to complex geometries and applications to fluid dynamics, By Canuto, Hussaini, Quarteroni and Zang, Springer, 2007. In the finite element community, a method where the degree of the elements is very high or increases as the grid parameter h decreases to zero is sometimes called a spectral element method. =Meshfree methods= Meshfree methods do not require a mesh connecting the data points of the simulation domain. Meshfree methods enable the simulation of some otherwise difficult types of problems, at the cost of extra computing time and programming effort. =Domain decomposition methods= Domain decomposition methods solve a boundary value problem by splitting it into smaller boundary value problems on subdomains and iterating to coordinate the solution between adjacent subdomains. A coarse problem with one or few unknowns per subdomain is used to further coordinate the solution between the subdomains globally. The problems on the subdomains are independent, which makes domain decomposition methods suitable for parallel computing. Domain decomposition methods are typically used as preconditioners for Krylov space iterative methods, such as the conjugate gradient method or GMRES. In overlapping domain decomposition methods, the subdomains overlap by more than the interface. Overlapping domain decomposition methods include the Schwarz alternating method and the additive Schwarz method. Many domain decomposition methods can be written and analyzed as a special case of the abstract additive Schwarz method. In non-overlapping methods, the subdomains intersect only on their interface. In primal methods, such as Balancing domain decomposition and BDDC, the continuity of the solution across subdomain interface is enforced by representing the value of the solution on all neighboring subdomains by the same unknown. In dual methods, such as FETI, the continuity of the solution across the subdomain interface is enforced by Lagrange multipliers. The FETI- DP method is hybrid between a dual and a primal method. Non-overlapping domain decomposition methods are also called iterative substructuring methods. Mortar methods are discretization methods for partial differential equations, which use separate discretization on nonoverlapping subdomains. The meshes on the subdomains do not match on the interface, and the equality of the solution is enforced by Lagrange multipliers, judiciously chosen to preserve the accuracy of the solution. In the engineering practice in the finite element method, continuity of solutions between non-matching subdomains is implemented by multiple-point constraints. Finite element simulations of moderate size models require solving linear systems with millions of unknowns. Several hours per time step is an average sequential run time, therefore, parallel computing is a necessity. Domain decomposition methods embody large potential for a parallelization of the finite element methods, and serve a basis for distributed, parallel computations. =Multigrid methods= Multigrid (MG) methods in numerical analysis are a group of algorithms for solving differential equations using a hierarchy of discretizations. They are an example of a class of techniques called multiresolution methods, very useful in (but not limited to) problems exhibiting multiple scales of behavior. For example, many basic relaxation methods exhibit different rates of convergence for short- and long-wavelength components, suggesting these different scales be treated differently, as in a Fourier analysis approach to multigrid. MG methods can be used as solvers as well as preconditioners. The main idea of multigrid is to accelerate the convergence of a basic iterative method by global correction from time to time, accomplished by solving a coarse problem. This principle is similar to interpolation between coarser and finer grids. The typical application for multigrid is in the numerical solution of elliptic partial differential equations in two or more dimensions. Multigrid methods can be applied in combination with any of the common discretization techniques. For example, the finite element method may be recast as a multigrid method. In these cases, multigrid methods are among the fastest solution techniques known today. In contrast to other methods, multigrid methods are general in that they can treat arbitrary regions and boundary conditions. They do not depend on the separability of the equations or other special properties of the equation. They have also been widely used for more- complicated non-symmetric and nonlinear systems of equations, like the Lam√© system of elasticity or the Navier-Stokes equations. Comparison The finite difference method is often regarded as the simplest method to learn and use. The finite element and finite volume methods are widely used in engineering and in computational fluid dynamics, and are well suited to problems in complicated geometries. Spectral methods are generally the most accurate, provided that the solutions are sufficiently smooth.

It is a well-known and easily identifiable landmark in the city, alongside its \\"architectural cousin\\", the Hillbrow Tower. Although always intented for both radio and television transmission, it carried only FM radio transmissions until the 1970s.  History  The tower's construction commenced in 1961, and was completed in 1962. The tower was designed by Ove Arup and Partners and built by Christiani and Nielsen SA. Upon completion, the Sentech Tower was the tallest man-made structure in Africa in its time until it was overtaken by the Hillbrow Tower. It cost R300,000 to construct.https://techcentral.co.za/the-story-behind-sentechs-iconic- tower/18447/ The first transmission took place 22 December 1961. Presently, Sentech broadcasts 18 FM programs and seven TV stations. Backup power to the tower is 1 MW using two 500 kVA Volvo generators. Towards 2001, naming rights for the tower were sold to Sentech, the TV and radio signal distributor in South Africa that is owned by the South African Government. Up until 1982, an observation deck affording panoramic views of the city was open to the public, but was closed due to security fears. The tower viewing deck has not re-opened to the public since then.  Construction and structure  In architectural terms, the Sentech Tower is a vertical cantilever structure, the shaft of which is made of reinforced concrete. On windy days, the tower has been known to lean up to , as measured from its uppermost mast. In addition, the tower was built to withstand winds of and gusts of up to .

Instances of replacement players  National Football League - 1987 = The National Football League Players Association (NFLPA) went on strike in 1987, and the owners brought in replacement players to continue the season. After three weeks, many of the players on strike returned, weakening the union's position. = Major League Baseball - 1995 = In 1994, the Major League Baseball Players Association (MLBPA) went on strike. Spring training in 1995 started with replacement players. However, the dispute was settled before regular season games were played. Players who agreed to serve as replacement players were subsequently blacklisted by the MLBPA. = United States national soccer team - 2005 = In 2005, the labor conflict between the United States Soccer Federation and its players led to U.S. national team players not reporting to camp in lieu of qualification for the 2006 World Cup. With almost every single Major League Soccer player, even those not in the U.S. player pool, refusing to participate, the camp was made up from players from the lower divisions of US Soccer, the United Soccer Leagues. The two sides came to an agreement before any matches were played. = Toronto Triumph - 2011 = Twenty of the 26 players on the Lingerie Football League's Toronto Triumph - including team captain Krista Ford - quit the team after its first game in 2011, citing numerous complaints, including injury concerns, incompetent coaching, and league management. The mass exodus left only starting quarterback Donna Paul and five other players still on the team. The Triumph added ten replacement players to their roster to finish out the season. = Arena Football League - 2012 = The Arena Football League Players Union voted to go on strike on March 9, 2012, the same day as they were scheduled to begin the 2012 season. However, the strike only lasted for six hours and only affected the season opener between the Pittsburgh Power and Orlando Predators. For that game, about 20 of the 25 players were replacement players, but some regulars returned in the game during the second quarter. The regular players returned for the rest of the 2012 season.  Replacement officials  Though not technically players, professional officials have associations very similar to players associations. = National Hockey League - 1993 = The National Hockey League Officials Association struck in 1993. The league decided to bring in replacement officials, however many officials from the minor leagues and high-level junior hockey stood with the union and refused to break the picket line. This led to the resolution of the strike after 17 days. = Major League Baseball - 1999 = In 1999, 22 Major League Baseball umpires resigned since their collective bargaining agreement did not allow them to strike. The 12 umpires who decided not to resign were joined by 25 replacements. The umpires' posturing was unsuccessful and led to a lengthy legal battle. In the end, some - but not all - of the umpires who resigned were rehired, and a new union, the World Umpires Association, was created to represent the umpires. = National Football League= 2001  Before the 2001 NFL season, the NFL and its officials' union were unable to secure a deal, resulting in the officials going on strike partway through the season. Replacement officials from the NCAA and Arena Football League were brought in to officiate games. Much to the surprise of the league, many fans found the replacement officials to be better than the ones who were doing the officiating in the first place, but after four weeks, an agreement was reached and the original officials returned to the field.  2012  In June 2012, the NFL referees association's collective bargaining agreement expired, resulting in the original officials being locked out. As a result, the league announced that replacement officials from the lower levels of the NCAA, the Arena Football League, and the Indoor Football League would be used for the preseason and at least the first few weeks of the regular season (the league expressly avoided using upper-level NCAA officials to avoid tarnishing their careers as scabs). Unlike the 2001 replacements, the 2012 replacements were widely criticized. The criticism spiked after a September 2012 Monday Night Football game ended in controversy after the replacements awarded possession of the ball in a crucial end-of-game Hail Mary pass to the wrong team, thus directly altering the outcome of the game. The NFL refused to overturn the erroneous call but intensified their efforts to reach a deal with the union. The two sides came to an agreement on September 26, 2012. The NFLRA officials officiated the Thursday night game the next day. Auto racingNASCAR= At the 1969 NASCAR Talladega 500, many of the top drivers in the Grand National Series boycotted the race, due to safety issues. The drivers who were part of the newly formed PDA (Professional Driver Association) led by Richard Petty, cited dangerous high speeds, coupled with tire grip/wear issues at the brand new Alabama International Motor Speedway. NASCAR scrambled to fill the field last- minute with other drivers not affiliated with the PDA, and drivers from the Grand American series (\\"pony cars\\") to run a race for the fans, most notably Richard Childress, who later won eleven NASCAR national titles as an owner. Bobby Isaac won the pole position, and Richard Brickhouse won the race, his only career victory.Boycotted race in '69 led to surprise winner, changes =IndyCar= During the first open wheel \\"split\\" between USAC and CART, the 1981 Pocono 500 was boycotted by most of the CART-based entries. USAC responded by filling out the field with Silver Crown cars. A rag-tag field of Indycars and converted dirt-track cars ran a two-class race. Rain halted the race shortly after the halfway point, and ended the race early. Among the filler drivers were Jack Hewitt and Larry Rice. The Silver Crown cars ran about 50 mph slower than the Indycars, and when the race was called at lap 122, the highest-running Silver Crown car was 18 laps down in 11th place. It would be USAC's final Indycar race outside of the Indianapolis 500. CART-based teams boycotted the 1996 Indianapolis 500 in the wake of the formation of the Indy Racing League, and the creation of the \\"25/8 rule,\\" which they interpreted as a lockout by the IRL and the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. CART teams staged a competing race, the U.S. 500 at Michigan. Participants in the 1996 Indy 500 included several familiar Indy car teams such as Foyt, Dick Simon, and Menard. However, many of the drivers were inexperienced rookies from an obscure range of backgrounds, giving the impression of a field of replacement drivers. The 1996 Indy 500 entrants managed to fill the field to 33 cars, but only one car was bumped (then-unknown Billy Boat), and there was a post-WWII record 17 rookies. The field included such unknown drivers as Racin Gardner (land speed records), Brad Murphey (who was also a former bronco riding champion), Joe Gosek (supermodifieds), as well as Johnny Parsons and Danny Ongais; both of whom had not driven in the race since 1986.

During the transitional period from a traditional hunter-gatherer society to pueblo people, there were several distinct cultural changes:Wenger, Gilbert R. The Story of Mesa Verde National Park. Mesa Verde Museum Association, Mesa Verde National Park, Colorado, 1991 [1st edition 1980]. pp. 27‚Äì38. . Early hunters :Hunter- gatherers from 10,000 years Before Present hunted and lived in a difficult terrain, traversed deep canyons and areas of few animals and limited vegetation, and managed limited access to water ‚Äì which made life difficult and limited the size of their hunt groups. They were adaptive to find sufficient food, supplementing their diet with nuts, seeds and fruit from wild plants.Wenger, Gilbert R. The Story of Mesa Verde National Park. Mesa Verde Museum Association, Mesa Verde National Park, Colorado, 1991 [1st edition 1980]. p. 27.. Artifacts were found 1) of Paleo-Indians who camped and hunted along the Cajon Mesa of Hovenweep as early as 8,000 BC and 2) from 20 sites with evidence of Archaic-Early Basketmaker people from about 6,000 BC. Late Basketmaker II Era AD 50 to 500 :The people living in the Four Corners region were introduced to maize and basketry through Mesoamerican trading about 2,000 years ago. Able to have greater control of their diet through cultivation, the hunter-gatherers lifestyle became more sedentary as small dispersed groups began cultivating maize and squash. They also continued to hunt and gather wild plants.Wenger, Gilbert R. The Story of Mesa Verde National Park. Mesa Verde Museum Association, Mesa Verde National Park, Colorado, 1991 [1st edition 1980]. pp. 27‚Äì30. . :They were named \\"Basketmakers\\" for their skill in making baskets for storing food, covering with pitch to heat water, and using to toast seeds and nuts. They wove bags, sandals, belts out of yucca plants and leaves ‚Äì and strung beads. They occasionally lived in dry caves where they dug pits and lined with stones to store food. These people were ancestors of the pueblo people of the Hovenweep pueblo settlement and Mesa Verde. Basketmaker III Era 500 to 750 :The next era, Modified Basketmakers, resulted in the introduction of pottery which reduced the number of baskets that they made and eliminated the creation of woven bags. The simple, gray pottery allowed them a better tool for cooking and storage. Beans were added to the cultivated diet. Bows and arrows made hunting easier and thus the acquisition of hides for clothing. Turkey feathers were woven into blankets and robes. On the rim of Mesa Verde, small groups built pit houses which were built several feet below the surface with elements suggestive of the introduction of celebration rituals.Wenger, Gilbert R. The Story of Mesa Verde National Park. Mesa Verde Museum Association, Mesa Verde National Park, Colorado, 1991 [1st edition 1980]. 33‚Äì37. . Pueblo I Era 750 to 900 :From pueblos at Mesa Verde we learn of some advancements during this period which are reflected in the Hovenweep structures built in the next cultural period. Pueblo buildings were built with stone, windows facing south, and in U, E and L shapes. The buildings were placed more closely together and reflected deepening religious celebration. Towers were built near kivas and likely used for look-outs. Pottery became more versatile, not just for cooking, but now included pitchers, ladles, bowls, jars and dishware for food and drink. White pottery with black designs emerged, the pigments coming from plants. Water management and conservation techniques, including the use of reservoirs and silt- retaining dams also emerged during this period.Wenger, Gilbert R. The Story of Mesa Verde National Park. Mesa Verde Museum Association, Mesa Verde National Park, Colorado, 1991 [1st edition 1980]. pp. 39‚Äì45. . = Ancient Puebloan people = Pueblo II Era ‚Äì 900‚Äì1150 :About 900, the number of Hovenweep residential sites increased.

Buildings with one story towers were built about 1000. By about 1160, they began building larger pueblo residential complexes, up to 3-story towers, dams, and reservoirs.Gibbon, Guy E.; Ames, Kenneth M. Archaeology of Prehistoric Native America: An Encyclopedia. 1998. p. 375, 377. . They moved their fields into areas where water could be controlled. They also built large stone towers, living quarters and other shelters to safeguard springs and seeps. The stone course pueblos and towers of the Hovenweep people exhibit expert masonry skills and engineering. The builders did not level foundations for their structures, but adapted construction designs to the uneven surfaces of rock slabs. These stone pueblos were understandably referred to as castles by 19th-century explorers. Prominent structures are Hovenweep Castle, Hovenweep House, Square Tower, Rim Rock House, Twin Towers, Stronghold House and Unit-type house.

Cutthroat Castle :Researchers studying prehistoric diets have found sagebrush flowers, seeds, and leaves in the Puebloans' waste. As a minor part of their diet, sagebrush would have been a good source of iron and Vitamin C. In larger amounts, it kills intestinal parasites. Natural resources :The area surrounding Hovenweep supplied a number of materials to support the Hovenweep people's lifestyle. Trees were used for building materials and fires. Baskets were sealed with pi√±on sap. Clothing and sandals were made from juniper bark. Tools, such as projectile points for hunting, scrapers and knives were made from quartz stones.Cutthroat Castle National Park Service. Retrieved 9-20-2011. Migration from Hovenweep :These construction and water related activities lead archaeologists to speculate that climatic change and increased population placed the communities under stress. The Hovenweep people left their pueblos in the late 13th century, possibly in response to a 23-year regional drought. People in the entire Four Corners region were also abandoning smaller communities at that time, and the area may have been nearly empty by 1350. Archaeological and cultural evidence leads scientists to believe people from this region migrated south to live with the Hopi of Arizona and the puebloan people of the Rio Grande in New Mexico.  Discovery  Holly Group In 1854, William D. Huntington, on a missionary trip to the southwestern United States for Brigham Young, discovered the ruins of the present Hovenweep National Monument. The ruins were already known to the Ute and Navajo guides who considered them haunted and urged Huntington to stay away.Blanchard, Mark.

The name Hovenweep, which means \\"deserted valley\\" in the Ute language, was adopted by pioneer photographer William Henry Jackson and William Henry Holmes in 1878.

Career J√≥n √ûorl√°ksson (usually transcribed Thorlaksson) was a farmer's son, from Vesturh√≥psh√≥lar in H√∫navatnss√Ωsla in the northwest of Iceland. He and his two sisters and one brother were unusually gifted. One of his sisters, Bj√∂rg √ûorl√°ksd√≥ttir, was for example the first Icelandic woman to receive a doctorate, from the Sorbonne in 1926. J√≥n √ûorl√°ksson graduated from Menntask√≥linn √≠ Reykjav√≠k in 1897, highest in his class and with the best results ever given to a student at that school. He studied civil engineering at the Polytechnic College in Copenhagen (later the Danish Technical University), graduating in 1903. In 1905, he became Iceland's Chief Engineer, overseeing in the next 12 years the construction of roads and bridges in the country, and advocating (and helping to build) hydroelectric power plants and the use of Iceland's ample resources of thermal power to heat houses. J√≥n resigned from his office in 1917, starting a company which imported building materials, but also working as an independent engineer on several projects. He was elected to the parliament in 1921, on a list opposed to the nascent socialist party. Respected rather than popular, he soon became the leader of the conservative and libertarian elements in the parliament, founding in 1924 the Conservative Party. J√≥n √ûorl√°ksson became Minister of Finance of Iceland in the government formed by the Conservative Party in 1924, raising the value of the Icelandic crown in 1925, very much as Winston Churchill raised the value of the pound at the same time. Upon the sudden death of Prime Minister J√≥n Magn√∫sson in 1926, he became Prime Minister as well. After the defeat of the Conservative Party in the parliamentary elections of 1927, J√≥n √ûorl√°ksson became the leader of the opposition. He was the first leader of the Independence Party which was formed by a merger of the Conservative Party and a small Liberal Party in 1929. He became Mayor of Reykjav√≠k in December 1932. Because of failing health he resigned as leader of the Independence Party in 1934 and died one year later. He was married and had two adopted daughters. Political ideas A biography of J√≥n √ûorl√°ksson (in Icelandic) was published in 1992 J√≥n √ûorl√°ksson was a classical liberal who had learnt his economics from the well-known Swedish economist Gustav Cassel. In a magazine article in 1926, J√≥n √ûorl√°ksson distinguished between conservative and radical ideas on the one hand and libertarian and authoritarian ideas on the other hand. He said that those two sets of ideas could exist in all four combinations. His opponents in the Icelandic left-wing or socialist parties were for example, he contended, both radical and authoritarian. Sometimes libertarians also had to be radical. But at present they should be conservative, because essentially their task was to conserve the freedom won in the battles of the 18th and 19th centuries, and to defend them against socialism. Thus, J√≥n √ûorl√°ksson defined himself as a conservative libertarian. In a paper read to the general meeting of the Conservative Party in 1929, he briefly, but clearly, outlined the classical liberal idea of how people could, by working solely for their own personal interest, in a competitive environment, unwittingly serve the public interest. There, he forcefully defended free trade and limited government. Publicly, J√≥n √ûorl√°ksson proposed the privatisation of the two commercial banks in Iceland, then in the hands of government.

Overview Apparatus theory maintains that cinema is by nature ideological because its mechanics of representation are ideological, and because the films are created to represent reality. Its mechanics of representation include the camera and editing. The central position of the spectator within the perspective of the composition is also ideological. In the simplest instance the cinematic apparatus purports to set before the eye and ear realistic images and sounds. However, the technology disguises how that reality is put together frame by frame. The meaning of a film, plus the way the viewing subject is constructed and the mechanics of the actual process and production of making the film affect the representation of the subject. Apparatus theory also states that within the text's perspective, the central position of the viewer is ideological. This effect is ideological because it is a reproduced reality and the cinematic experience affects the viewer on a deep level. This theory is explored in the work of Jean-Louis Baudry. This is where the Marxist aspect of the theory comes into play. The idea is that the passive viewers (or Marx's proletariat) cannot tell the difference between the world of cinema and film and the real world. These viewers identify with the characters on screen so strongly that they become susceptible to ideological positioning. In Baudry's theory of the apparatus he likens the movie-goer to someone in a dream. He relates the similarities of being in a darkened room, having someone else control your actions/what you do, and the inactivity and passivity of the two activities. He goes on to say that because movie-goers are not distracted by outside light, noise, etc., due to the nature of a movie theater, they are able to experience the film as if it were reality and they were experiencing the events themselves. Apparatus theory also argues that cinema maintains the dominant ideology of the culture within the viewer. Ideology is not imposed on cinema, but is part of its nature and it shapes the way the audience thinks. Apparatus theory follows an institutional model of spectatorship.  Apparatus theorists  (this is an incomplete list) *Gregory Ulmer *Louis Althusser - Marxist writer who wrote about mirror mis-recognition and the role it plays in forming identities, to explore the relationship between cinema goers and film texts. *Jean-Louis Comolli *Christian Metz - argued that viewing film is only possible by voyeurism (or ‚Äòscopophila‚Äô: Greek for love of looking), best seen in silent film. *Giorgio Agamben *Laura Mulvey *Peter Wollen *Jean-Louis Baudry - argued that film theory was metaphysical.

Discovered in 1969 by Phillips Petroleum Company, it remains one of the most important oil fields in the North Sea. This was the first discovery of oil after the drilling of over 200 exploration wells in the North Sea \\"triggered\\" by the Groningen gas field discovery.Van den Bark, E., and Thomas, O.D., 1980, Ekofisk: First of the Giant Oil Fields in Western Europe, in Giant Oil and Gas Fields of the Decade: 1968-1978, AAPG Memoir 30, Tulsa, American Association of Petroleum Geologists, pp. 195-197 In 1971, Phillips started producing directly to tankers from four subsea wells. Oil production is planned to continue until at least 2050. The Greater Ekofisk Area consists of Cod, Ekofisk, West Ekofisk, Tor, Albuskjell, Eldfisk, Edda and Embla oil fields. The Ekofisk Center is a vast complex of platforms and structures creating a transportation hub also for surrounding fields such as Valhall, Hod, Gyda, Ula, Statfjord, Heimdal, Tommeliten and Gullfaks. The whole complex consists of 29 platforms. Produced oil is transported by the Norpipe oil pipeline to the Teesside Refinery in England. Natural gas is transported by the Norpipe gas pipeline to Emden in Germany. Geology The Ekofisk field is a north‚Äìsouth trending anticline, with a central graben, forming a structure that is in area, with of vertical closure and a hydrocarbon column long, formed by Permian Zechstein salt movement in the form of salt pillows.Van den Bark, E., and Thomas, O.D., 1980, Ekofisk: First of the Giant Oil Fields in Western Europe, in Giant Oil and Gas Fields of the Decade: 1968-1978, AAPG Memoir 30, Tulsa, American Association of Petroleum Geologists, p. 211 The production zones at a depth of about 3 km, include the Paleocene Ekofisk Formation and the Upper Cretaceous Tor Formation, both Chalk Group rocks containing porosities of 30-40%.Van den Bark, E., and Thomas, O.D., 1980, Ekofisk: First of the Giant Oil Fields in Western Europe, in Giant Oil and Gas Fields of the Decade: 1968-1978, AAPG Memoir 30, Tulsa, American Association of Petroleum Geologists, pp. 195, 208 and 200 \\"The reservoir rock...is a true chalk-a fine-grained limestone composed of the skeletal remains of pelagic unicellular golden-brown algae or coccolithophores\\".Van den Bark, E., and Thomas, O.D., 1980, Ekofisk: First of the Giant Oil Fields in Western Europe, in Giant Oil and Gas Fields of the Decade: 1968-1978, AAPG Memoir 30, Tulsa, American Association of Petroleum Geologists, p. 200 The source rocks are the Upper Jurassic Kimmeridgian shales.Van den Bark, E., and Thomas, O.D., 1980, Ekofisk: First of the Giant Oil Fields in Western Europe, in Giant Oil and Gas Fields of the Decade: 1968-1978, AAPG Memoir 30, Tulsa, American Association of Petroleum Geologists, pp. 211-213 The structure was discovered using seismic reflection data in the 1960s, although the initial interpretations were distorted due to zones of high gas saturation in the overlying Cenozoic rocks causing low seismic velocities. However, the high porosity of the reservoir rock does cause an increase in seismic amplitude which can be used with an isopach map to determine net pay. Subsidence In the mid-1980s the Ekofisk field as a whole and the platforms in particular were found to be suffering from an unexpected degree of subsidence. Detailed geological investigation showed that it was the result of delayed compactional diagenesis of the Chalk Formation reservoir rocks. As hydrocarbons were produced the pore pressure declined and the effective stress increased leading to subsidence.Sulak, R. M. & Danielsen, J. (1989), Reservoir aspects of Ekofisk subsidence Journal of Petroleum Technology, Society of Petroleum Engineers, 41, 709-716 Water injection was initiated to repressurize the reservoir, but due to the lower compaction strength of water-saturated chalk compared with oil-saturated chalk the seafloor continued subsiding and displacements of several metres were recorded. It was calculated that the total subsidence would almost be at the end of the concession of Phillips Petroleum, too much to keep the platforms secure. The Norwegian government pressed Phillips to take action and the French company Technip was ordered to find a solution. As 5 of 7 platforms were interconnected, they had to be jacked-up by about at the same time. The solution was that the steel tubular legs of the platforms would be extended. Subsequently, large flanges were welded to these legs and when all flanges were welded and the legs cut, five platforms would be lifted simultaneously in one operation then extension pipes would be mounted in between the flanges. After bolting all flanges the platforms would be safe again. The four days lifting was completed on 17 August 1987, at 11:30 p.m. thanks to 108 hydraulic cylinders synchronised with a network of 14 NUM 760FCNCs. The position tolerance of the cylinders with each other (+/- for a extension per platform and +/- between platforms) was to be kept for 38 hours. During the welding of the flanges to the legs, these hydraulic cylinders took over the entire load. A couple of days before this great jack-up, the hotel platform was lifted, as it was not interconnected with the others. The total lifting capacity of all these cylinders was approximately and was published in the Guinness World Records as being the largest jack-up. Bravo blowout In April 1977, an oil well blowout occurred at the Ekofisk Bravo platform, due to an incorrectly installed downhole safety valve.Oil Rig Disasters ‚Äì Ekofisk Bravo Platform At an estimated total, it was the largest blowout in the North Sea. Red Adair and his crew assisted with capping the blowout. Images File:Ekofisk.pngAnnual oil production from Ekofisk. File:Ekofisk complex.jpgThe Ekofisk complex in 2010.

Before that he had been mayor of Reykjav√≠k and a member of the Icelandic parliament, the Althing. Early life and education Geir Hallgr√≠msson was born in Reykjav√≠k and educated at Menntask√≥linn √≠ Reykjav√≠k and at the University of Iceland, where he studied law; he spent a year in the US at Harvard University, studying law and economics. Career Geir was mayor of Reykjav√≠k from 1959 to 1972. During his term he greatly expanded the city and improved its infrastructure. Under his guidance the geothermal heating system was expanded to the whole city; it had previously only been available to less than half. He also improved the streets by turning the mostly gravel roads into modern asphalt streets. He was popular as mayor and in an open primary for the municipal elections he won 99% of the votes in 1970. In the fall of 1970 he came in number one in the primary for elections to Althing, ahead of prime minister J√≥hann Hafstein and former mayor Gunnar Thoroddsen. He was a member of parliament from 1970 (taking his permanent seat with the death of prime minister Bjarni Benediktsson) until 1983. In 1971 he was elected vice chairman of the Independence Party and in 1973 he became chairman after J√≥hann Hafstein resigned for health reasons. In 1974 he led the Independence Party to one of its greatest victories. The party won 42.5% of the vote and 25 out of 60 parliamentary seats. He then led a coalition government with the Progressive party from 1974 to 1978. His government expanded the fishing limits to 200 miles (370 km) and had to fight Britain in the 'Cod War'. After Iceland had broken diplomatic relations with Britain in 1976 over the dispute, negotiations led to an agreement in June that year. According to the agreement Britain accepted the 200 mile zone. In 1978 the government suffered a setback after it had set a law that limited wage increases. The law was an attempt to curb inflation, which was running close to 50%. The two government parties lost five parliamentary seats each and a new coalition government was formed without the Independence Party. A year later the Independence Party failed to make significant gains in an election after the government had resigned. Geir also faced opposition within his own party and came in number two in primary elections in 1978. Albert Gudmundssson won the first seat. A year later Geir won the first seat back. He twice won elections against his opponents for the chairmanship. In both 1979 and 1981 he received about 75% of the vote, first against Albert Gudmundsson and then against P√°lmi J√≥nsson, then minister of agriculture. In 1980 the vice chairman of the Independence Party, Gunnar Thoroddsen, decided to break ranks within the party and lead a group of four members to form a coalition government with the People's Alliance (Socialist party) and the Progressive Party. Geir was leader of the opposition. The Independence Party was united in the 1983 parliamentary election. However Geir suffered a setback when he came in seventh in the primary for the parliamentary elections and lost his seat in parliament. After the elections he announced that he would not seek re- election as party chairman. He served as foreign minister in the coalition government with the Progressive Party from 1983 until 1986. He left government in 1986, becoming one of the three Governors of the Central Bank of Iceland, a position he held till his death in September 1990.https://www.sedlabanki.is/library/Skraarsafn/ymsar- skrar/Bankastjorn%20fra%20upphafi.pdf References - Halgrimsson Geir Halgrimsson Geir Category:Leaders of the Independence Party (Iceland) Category:Mayors of Reykjav√≠k Category:Members of the Althing Halgrimsson Geir Category:Prime Ministers of Iceland Category:Governors of the Central Bank of Iceland Category:University of Iceland alumni ","title":"Geir Hallgr√≠msson"},{"id":"1634790","text":"In mathematics, the Grothendieck group construction constructs an abelian group from a commutative monoid in the most universal way, in the sense that any abelian group containing a homomorphic image of will also contain a homomorphic image of the Grothendieck group of . The Grothendieck group construction takes its name from a specific case in category theory, introduced by Alexander Grothendieck in his proof of the Grothendieck‚ÄìRiemann‚ÄìRoch theorem, which resulted in the development of K-theory. This specific case is the monoid of isomorphism classes of objects of an abelian category, with the direct sum as its operation. Grothendieck group of a commutative monoidMotivation= Given a commutative monoid M, \\"the most general\\" abelian group K that arises from M is to be constructed by introducing additive inverses. Such an abelian group K always exists; it is called the Grothendieck group of M. It is characterized by a certain universal property and can also be concretely constructed from M. Note that the existence of a zero element in the monoid runs counter to the inverse property, as the embedded zero element in K must have an inverse element 0^{-1} whose sum with 0 must simultaneously be 0 and 1, forcing 0 = 1. The general construction in the presence of zero elements always constructs the trivial group, as the only group which satisfies this equation. =Universal property= Let M be a commutative monoid. Its Grothendieck group K is an abelian group with the following universal property: There exists a monoid homomorphism :i : M \\\\to K such that for any monoid homomorphism :f : M \\\\to A from the commutative monoid M to an abelian group A, there is a unique group homomorphism :g : K \\\\to A such that :f = g \\\\circ i. This expresses the fact that any abelian group A that contains a homomorphic image of M will also contain a homomorphic image of K, K being the \\"most general\\" abelian group containing a homomorphic image of M. =Explicit constructions= To construct the Grothendieck group K of a commutative monoid M, one forms the Cartesian product M \\\\times M. The two coordinates are meant to represent a positive part and a negative part, so (m_1, m_2) corresponds to m_1- m_2 in K. Addition on M\\\\times M is defined coordinate-wise: :(m_1, m_2) + (n_1,n_2) = (m_1+n_1, m_2+n_2). Next one defines an equivalence relation on M \\\\times M, such that (m_1, m_2) is equivalent to (n_1, n_2) if, for some element k of M, m1 \\\\+ n2 \\\\+ k = m2 \\\\+ n1 \\\\+ k (the element k is necessary because the cancellation law does not hold in all monoids). The equivalence class of the element (m1, m2) is denoted by [(m1, m2)]. One defines K to be the set of equivalence classes. Since the addition operation on M √ó M is compatible with our equivalence relation, one obtains an addition on K, and K becomes an abelian group. The identity element of K is [(0, 0)], and the inverse of [(m1, m2)] is [(m2, m1)]. The homomorphism i:M\\\\to K sends the element m to [(m, 0)]. Alternatively, the Grothendieck group K of M can also be constructed using generators and relations: denoting by (Z(M), +') the free abelian group generated by the set M, the Grothendieck group K is the quotient of Z(M) by the subgroup generated by \\\\\\\\{(x+'y)-'(x+y)\\\\mid x,y\\\\in M\\\\\\\\}. (Here +‚Ä≤ and ‚àí‚Ä≤ denote the addition and subtraction in the free abelian group Z(M) while + denotes the addition in the monoid M.) This construction has the advantage that it can be performed for any semigroup M and yields a group which satisfies the corresponding universal properties for semigroups, i.e. the \\"most general and smallest group containing a homomorphic image of M\\". This is known as the \\"group completion of a semigroup\\" or \\"group of fractions of a semigroup\\". =Properties= In the language of category theory, any universal construction gives rise to a functor; one thus obtains a functor from the category of commutative monoids to the category of abelian groups which sends the commutative monoid M to its Grothendieck group K. This functor is left adjoint to the forgetful functor from the category of abelian groups to the category of commutative monoids. For a commutative monoid M, the map i : M->K is injective if and only if M has the cancellation property, and it is bijective if and only if M is already a group. =Example: the integers= The easiest example of a Grothendieck group is the construction of the integers \\\\Z from the (additive) natural numbers \\\\N. First one observes that the natural numbers (including 0) together with the usual addition indeed form a commutative monoid (\\\\N, +). Now when one uses the Grothendieck group construction one obtains the formal differences between natural numbers as elements n ‚àí m and one has the equivalence relation :n - m \\\\sim n' - m' \\\\Leftrightarrow n + m' + k = n'+ m + k for some k \\\\Leftrightarrow n + m' = n' + m. Now define :\\\\forall n \\\\in \\\\N: \\\\qquad \\\\begin{cases} n := [n - 0]  -n := [0 - n] \\\\end{cases} This defines the integers \\\\Z. Indeed, this is the usual construction to obtain the integers from the natural numbers. See \\"Construction\\" under Integers for a more detailed explanation. =Example: the positive rational numbers= Similarly, the Grothendieck group of the multiplicative commutative monoid (\\\\N^*, *) (starting at 1) consists of formal fractions p/q with the equivalence :p/q \\\\sim p'/q' \\\\Leftrightarrow pq'r = p'qr for some r \\\\Leftrightarrow pq' = p'q which of course can be identified with the positive rational numbers. =Example: the Grothendieck group of a manifold= The Grothendieck group is the fundamental construction of K-theory. The group K_0(M) of a compact manifold M is defined to be the Grothendieck group of the commutative monoid of all isomorphism classes of vector bundles of finite rank on M with the monoid operation given by direct sum. This gives a contravariant functor from manifolds to abelian groups. This functor is studied and extended in topological K-theory. =Example: The Grothendieck group of a ring= The zeroth algebraic K group K_0(R) of a (not necessarily commutative) ring R is the Grothendieck group of the monoid consisting of isomorphism classes of finitely generated projective modules over R, with the monoid operation given by the direct sum. Then K_0 is a covariant functor from rings to abelian groups. The two previous examples are related: consider the case where R = C^\\\\infty(M) is the ring of complex-valued smooth functions on a compact manifold M. In this case the projective R-modules are dual to vector bundles over M (by the Serre-Swan theorem). Thus K_0(R) and K_0(M) are the same group. Grothendieck group and extensionsDefinition= Another construction that carries the name Grothendieck group is the following: Let R be a finite-dimensional algebra over some field k or more generally an artinian ring. Then define the Grothendieck group G_0(R) as the abelian group generated by the set \\\\\\\\{[X] \\\\mid X \\\\in R\\\\mathrm{-Mod}\\\\\\\\} of isomorphism classes of finitely generated R-modules and the following relations: For every short exact sequence :0\\\\to A\\\\to B\\\\to C\\\\to 0 of R-modules add the relation :[A] - [B] + [C] = 0. This definition implies that for any two finitely generated R-modules M and N, [M \\\\oplus N] = [M] + [N], because of the split short exact sequence. : 0 \\\\to M \\\\to M \\\\oplus N \\\\to N \\\\to 0. =Examples= Let K be a field. Then the Grothendieck group G_0(K) is an abelian group generated by symbols [V] for any finite dimensional K-vector space V. In fact, G_0(K) is isomorphic to \\\\Z whose generator is the element [K]. Here, the symbol [V] for a finite K-vector space V is defined as [V] = \\\\dim_K V, the dimension of the vector space V. Suppose one has the following short exact sequence of K-vector spaces. : 0 \\\\to V \\\\to T \\\\to W \\\\to 0 Since any short exact sequence of vector spaces splits, it holds that T \\\\cong V \\\\oplus W . In fact, for any two finite dimensional vector spaces V and W the following holds. :\\\\dim_K(V \\\\oplus W) = \\\\dim_K(V) + \\\\dim_K(W) The above equality hence satisfies the condition of the symbol [V] in the Grothendieck group. : [T] = [V \\\\oplus W] = [V] + [W] Note that any two isomorphic finite dimensional K-vector space has the same dimension. Also, any two finite dimensional K-vector space V and W of same dimension are isomorphic to each other. In fact, every finite n-dimensional K-vector space V is isomorphic to K^{\\\\oplus n}. The observation from the previous paragraph hence proves the following equation. :[V] = \\\\left [K^{\\\\oplus n} \\\\right ] = n[K] Hence, every symbol [V] is generated by the element [K] with integer coefficients, which implies that G_0(K) is isomorphic to \\\\Z with the generator [K]. More generally, let \\\\Z be the set of integers. The Grothendieck group G_0(\\\\Z) is an abelian group generated by symbols [A] for any finitely generated abelian groups A. One first notes that any finite abelian group G satisfies that [G] = 0. The following short exact sequence holds, where the map \\\\Z \\\\to \\\\Z is multiplication by n. : 0 \\\\to \\\\Z \\\\to \\\\Z \\\\to \\\\Z /n\\\\Z \\\\to 0 The exact sequence implies that [\\\\Z /n\\\\Z] = [\\\\Z] - [\\\\Z] = 0, so every cyclic group has its symbol equal to 0. This in turn implies that every finite abelian group G satisfies [G] = 0 by the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian groups. Observe that by the Fundamental Theorem of Finitely Generated Abelian Groups, every abelian group A is isomorphic to a direct sum of a torsion subgroup and a torsion-free abelian group isomorphic to \\\\Z^r for some non-negative integer r, called the rank of A and denoted by r = \\\\mbox{rank}(A) . Define the symbol [A] as [A] = \\\\mbox{rank}(A). Then the Grothendieck group G_0(\\\\Z) is isomorphic to \\\\Z with generator [\\\\Z]. Indeed, the observation made from the previous paragraph shows that every abelian group A has its symbol [A] the same to the symbol [\\\\Z^r] = r[\\\\Z] where r = \\\\mbox{rank}(A). Furthermore, the rank of the abelian group satisfies the conditions of the symbol [A] of the Grothendieck group. Suppose one has the following short exact sequence of abelian groups. : 0 \\\\to A \\\\to B \\\\to C \\\\to 0 Then tensoring with the rational numbers \\\\Q implies the following equation. : 0 \\\\to A \\\\otimes_\\\\Z \\\\Q \\\\to B \\\\otimes_\\\\Z \\\\Q \\\\to C \\\\otimes_\\\\Z \\\\Q \\\\to 0 Since the above is a short exact sequence of \\\\Q-vector spaces, the sequence splits. Therefore, one has the following equation. : \\\\dim_\\\\Q (B \\\\otimes_\\\\Z \\\\Q ) = \\\\dim_\\\\Q (A \\\\otimes_\\\\Z \\\\Q) + \\\\dim_\\\\Q (C \\\\otimes_\\\\Z \\\\Q ) On the other hand, one also has the following relation. For more information, see: Rank of Abelian Group. :\\\\operatorname{rank}(A) = \\\\dim_\\\\Q (A \\\\otimes_\\\\Z \\\\Q ) Therefore, the following equation holds. :[B] = \\\\operatorname{rank}(B) = \\\\operatorname{rank}(A) + \\\\operatorname{rank}(C) = [A] + [C] Hence one has shown that G_0(\\\\Z) is isomorphic to \\\\Z with generator [\\\\Z]. =Universal Property= The Grothendieck group satisfies a universal property. One makes a preliminary definition: A function \\\\chi from the set of isomorphism classes to an abelian group X is called additive if, for each exact sequence 0 \\\\to A \\\\to B \\\\to C \\\\to 0, one has \\\\chi(A)-\\\\chi(B)+\\\\chi(C)= 0. Then, for any additive function \\\\chi: R\\\\text{-mod} \\\\to X, there is a unique group homomorphism f:G_0(R) \\\\to X such that \\\\chi factors through f and the map that takes each object of \\\\mathcal A to the element representing its isomorphism class in G_0(R). Concretely this means that f satisfies the equation f([V])=\\\\chi(V) for every finitely generated R-module V and f is the only group homomorphism that does that. Examples of additive functions are the character function from representation theory: If R is a finite-dimensional k-algebra, then one can associate the character \\\\chi_V: R \\\\to k to every finite-dimensional R-module V: \\\\chi_V(x) is defined to be the trace of the k-linear map that is given by multiplication with the element x \\\\in R on V. By choosing a suitable basis and writing the corresponding matrices in block triangular form one easily sees that character functions are additive in the above sense. By the universal property this gives us a \\"universal character\\" \\\\chi: G_0(R)\\\\to \\\\mathrm{Hom}_K(R,K) such that \\\\chi([V]) = \\\\chi_V. If k=\\\\Complex and R is the group ring \\\\Complex[G] of a finite group G then this character map even gives a natural isomorphism of G_0(\\\\Complex[G]) and the character ring Ch(G). In the modular representation theory of finite groups k can be a field \\\\overline{\\\\mathbb{F}_p}, the algebraic closure of the finite field with p elements. In this case the analogously defined map that associates to each k[G]-module its Brauer character is also a natural isomorphism G_0(\\\\overline{\\\\mathbb{F}_p}[G])\\\\to \\\\mathrm{BCh}(G) onto the ring of Brauer characters. In this way Grothendieck groups show up in representation theory. This universal property also makes G_0(R) the 'universal receiver' of generalized Euler characteristics. In particular, for every bounded complex of objects in R\\\\text{-mod} : \\\\cdots \\\\to 0 \\\\to 0 \\\\to A^n \\\\to A^{n+1} \\\\to \\\\cdots \\\\to A^{m-1} \\\\to A^m \\\\to 0 \\\\to 0 \\\\to \\\\cdots one has a canonical element : [A^*] = \\\\sum_i (-1)^i [A^i] = \\\\sum_i (-1)^i [H^i (A^*)] \\\\in G_0(R). In fact the Grothendieck group was originally introduced for the study of Euler characteristics. Grothendieck groups of exact categories A common generalization of these two concepts is given by the Grothendieck group of an exact category \\\\mathcal{A}. Simply put, an exact category is an additive category together with a class of distinguished short sequences A ‚Üí B ‚Üí C. The distinguished sequences are called \\"exact sequences\\", hence the name. The precise axioms for this distinguished class do not matter for the construction of the Grothendieck group. The Grothendieck group is defined in the same way as before as the abelian group with one generator [M] for each (isomorphism class of) object(s) of the category \\\\mathcal{A} and one relation :[A]-[B]+[C] = 0 for each exact sequence :A\\\\hookrightarrow B\\\\twoheadrightarrow C. Alternatively and equivalently, one can define the Grothendieck group using a universal property: A map \\\\chi: \\\\mathrm{Ob}(\\\\mathcal{A})\\\\to X from \\\\mathcal{A} into an abelian group X is called \\"additive\\" if for every exact sequence A\\\\hookrightarrow B\\\\twoheadrightarrow C one has \\\\chi(A)-\\\\chi(B)+\\\\chi(C)=0; an abelian group G together with an additive mapping \\\\phi: \\\\mathrm{Ob}(\\\\mathcal{A})\\\\to G is called the Grothendieck group of \\\\mathcal{A} iff every additive map \\\\chi: \\\\mathrm{Ob}(\\\\mathcal{A})\\\\to X factors uniquely through œÜ. Every abelian category is an exact category if one just uses the standard interpretation of \\"exact\\". This gives the notion of a Grothendieck group in the previous section if one chooses \\\\mathcal{A}:=R-mod the category of finitely generated R-modules as \\\\mathcal{A}. This is really abelian because R was assumed to be artinian and (hence noetherian) in the previous section. On the other hand, every additive category is also exact if one declares those and only those sequences to be exact that have the form A\\\\hookrightarrow A\\\\oplus B\\\\twoheadrightarrow B with the canonical inclusion and projection morphisms. This procedure produces the Grothendieck group of the commutative monoid (\\\\mathrm{Iso}(\\\\mathcal{A}),\\\\oplus) in the first sense (here \\\\mathrm{Iso}(\\\\mathcal{A}) means the \\"set\\" [ignoring all foundational issues] of isomorphism classes in \\\\mathcal{A}.)  Grothendieck groups of triangulated categories Generalizing even further it is also possible to define the Grothendieck group for triangulated categories. The construction is essentially similar but uses the relations [X] - [Y] + [Z] = 0 whenever there is a distinguished triangle X ‚Üí Y ‚Üí Z ‚Üí X[1]. Further examples * In the abelian category of finite-dimensional vector spaces over a field k, two vector spaces are isomorphic if and only if they have the same dimension. Thus, for a vector space V ::[V] = \\\\left [k^{\\\\dim(V)} \\\\right ] \\\\in K_0 (\\\\mathrm{Vect}_{\\\\mathrm{fin}}). :Moreover, for an exact sequence :: 0 \\\\to k^l \\\\to k^m \\\\to k^n \\\\to 0 :m = l + n, so :: \\\\left [k^{l+n} \\\\right ] = \\\\left [k^l \\\\right ] + \\\\left [k^n \\\\right ] = (l+n)[k]. :Thus ::[V] = \\\\dim(V)[k], :and K_0(\\\\mathrm{Vect}_{\\\\mathrm{fin}}) is isomorphic to \\\\Z and is generated by [k]. Finally for a bounded complex of finite-dimensional vector spaces V*, :: [V^*] = \\\\chi(V^*)[k] :where \\\\chi is the standard Euler characteristic defined by :: \\\\chi(V^*)= \\\\sum_i (-1)^i \\\\dim V = \\\\sum_i (-1)^i \\\\dim H^i(V^*). * For a ringed space (X,\\\\mathcal{O}_X), one can consider the category \\\\mathcal{A} of all locally free sheaves over X. K_0(X) is then defined as the Grothendieck group of this exact category and again this gives a functor. * For a ringed space (X,\\\\mathcal{O}_X), one can also define the category \\\\mathcal A to be the category of all coherent sheaves on X. This includes the special case (if the ringed space is an affine scheme) of \\\\mathcal{A} being the category of finitely generated modules over a noetherian ring R. In both cases \\\\mathcal{A} is an abelian category and a fortiori an exact category so the construction above applies. * In the case where R is a finite-dimensional algebra over some field, the Grothendieck groups G_0(R) (defined via short exact sequences of finitely generated modules) and K_0(R) (defined via direct sum of finitely generated projective modules) coincide. In fact, both groups are isomorphic to the free abelian group generated by the isomorphism classes of simple R-modules. * There is another Grothendieck group G_0 of a ring or a ringed space which is sometimes useful. The category in the case is chosen to be the category of all quasi-coherent sheaves on the ringed space which reduces to the category of all modules over some ring R in case of affine schemes. G_0 is not a functor, but nevertheless it carries important information. * Since the (bounded) derived category is triangulated, there is a Grothendieck group for derived categories too. This has applications in representation theory for example. For the unbounded category the Grothendieck group however vanishes. For a derived category of some complex finite-dimensional positively graded algebra there is a subcategory in the unbounded derived category containing the abelian category A of finite-dimensional graded modules whose Grothendieck group is the q-adic completion of the Grothendieck group of A.

The field, which is 25 km long by 7 km wide, was discovered in 1979 and its development is known to be one of the significant milestones in emergence of Norway's independent oil and gas industry.OLJEDIREKTORATET Norwegian Petroleum Directorate. Oseberg The Oseberg field was named after Oseberg ship, one of Norway's most significant archeological discoveries. The ancient Viking ship from the early 9th century was discovered in a 1904 historical excavation of a burial mound at the Oseberg Farm, south of Oslo. An extensive subsea pipeline network called Oseberg Transport System (OTS) transports up to from the Oseberg area to Sture terminal in Norway.Oil Pipelines in Norway and Downstream Activities The sea depth in the Oseberg area is 100 meters. The Oseberg Field Centre consists of three platforms: Oseberg A, B and D, connected to each other by bridges, in the southern part of the Oseberg field and the Oseberg C platform, which is located 14 kilometers north of the field center. The operator is Equinor, in partnership with Petoro, Total, ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips. The field extends into blocks 30/6 and 30/9, parts of Production licenses (PL) 053 and 079. Exploration history The first exploration well on the PL053 license, 30/6-1, was drilled as a wildcat and spudded on 19 June 1979. The well was plugged and abandoned as a gas discovery on 22 September. Subsequent appraisal wells proved oil in addition to the gas found by the discovery well and Oseberg was produced as an oilfield. The first exploration well on the PL079 license, 30/9-1 was drilled as a wildcat at the end of 1982, but treated as an appraisal after it encountered oil and gas considered to form part of the same accumulation. In 2006, well 30/9-B-19 A proved reserves in the underlying Upper Triassic to Lower Jurassic Statfjord formation. Tests are also being carried out on the overlying Upper Cretaceous Chalk Group reservoir to evaluate the flow characteristics. The vertical gas column in the Alpha block was 380 m while the underlying oil column was about 215 m before production began. A total of 31 exploration and appraisal wells have been drilled on the Oseberg structure, although this includes sidetracks and re-entries. Of these wells, only three proved 'dry'. Development history Development drilling began in 1985 with a production well drilled from the B template. By the end of 2009 184 development wells had been completed, consisting of a mixture of production wells, observation wells, water injectors, gas injectors and cuttings injectors. Production was from deviated wells until 1992, when the first horizontal well was drilled. By June 1997, 28 horizontal wells had been completed, including three multilaterals. Horizontal drilling close to the oil-water contact was considered key to prolonging the plateau oil production period and achieving high recovery rates. Seismic data acquisition The initial discovery well was sited using 2D seismic reflection data. In 1982, the first 3D seismic dataset was acquired over Oseberg, to assist with continuing exploration and appraisal drilling. In 1989 and 1991 Statoil acquired two sets of 3D data over the field, using the same parameters, as a feasibility study for a full 4D seismic study. Following the success of the pilot study, additional surveys were shot in 1992, 1999, 2004 and 2007. These surveys are used to actively monitor changes in the gas- oil contact and the water-oil contact as production continues. Production Oseberg Field Center. Oseberg A is a concrete base platform which includes process equipment and accommodation quarters; Oseberg B sits on top of a steel jacket, and has drilling, production and injection facilities; Oseberg D is a steel platform with gas processing and export equipment which was connected to the Field Centre by a bridge in 1999. Oseberg C is an integrated drilling, accommodation and production platform with a steel jacket.Statoil website. Oseberg area Oseberg Vestflanke was developed with a subsea template tied back to Oseberg B. Oseberg Delta will be developed with a subsea template tied back to Oseberg D. Production from the Gamma Main structure in the Statfjord Formation started in the spring of 2008 with two wells from the Oseberg Field Center. The facilities at the field center process oil and gas from the fields Oseberg √òst, Oseberg S√∏r and Tune. The Plan for Development and Operation (PDO) for the northern part of Oseberg was confirmed on 19 January 1988. The PDO for Oseberg D was approved on 13 December 1996, for Oseberg Vestflanke ‚Äì on 19 December 2003 and for Oseberg Delta on 23 September 2005. The oil from the field is produced by maintenance of pressure through gas and water injection and by water gas injection (WAG). Injection gas used for pressure maintenance was previously brought from Troll √òst (TOGI) and Oseberg Vest. Other smaller parts of the field produce by pressure depletion. The field has been producing since 1 December 1988. Plateau oil production of 81,000 Sm3 per day ended in 1997. Current production (total for 2009 to September) as per stats is 3.788063 mill S m3 of oil, 2.926727 bill Sm3 of gas, 0.462964 mill tonnes of NGL. GeologyRegional setting= The Oseberg field is one of a series of hydrocarbon accumulations within the Viking Graben. This part of the northern North Sea has been affected by two main rift episodes; in the Permo-Triassic and the mid-late Jurassic. This leads to complex variations of the earlier syn-rift sequence thickness across the later rift structures. In the Oseberg area, the major faults formed during these two phases dip in opposite directions and the size of the earlier basins are typically double the size of the later. The east-tilted Late Jurassic Oseberg structure is underlain by a larger-scale west-tilted Permo-Triassic half-graben. =Reservoirs= The main reservoirs are sandstones of the Middle Jurassic Oseberg, Rannoch, Etive, Ness and Tarbert formations of the Brent Group. These are the deposits of prograding delta systems, with an overall shallowing upwards as the delta filled the available accommodation space. The Oseberg formation represents the deposits of a series of sand-rich deltas that advanced westwards from the Norwegian coastline. The rest of the group are the deposits of the massive northward prograding Brent delta system, which occupied the entire southern part of the Viking graben area. There is a progressive transition in the depositional environment from subaqueous fans, through fan deltas and shoreface to delta plain. The uppermost Tarbert formation may represent reworked delta plain deposits at the onset of the marine transgression shown by the overlying claystones of the Viking group. The Brent Group reservoirs, which lie at depths between 2300 and 2700 m, generally have excellent properties with porosities around 20‚Äì30% and permeabilities ranging up to several darcys. The Statfjord formation, which is of Ryazanian to Sinemurian age is separated from the Brent Group by the Dunlin Group, which is a non-reservoir sequence. This means that there is normally no communication between the Statfjord formation and the Brent Group reservoirs. The Statfjord formation consists of massive sandstones. The lower boundary is taken at the transition from red continental shales of the Lunde formation to the overlying sandstones. The top of the unit, which consists of calcareous sandstones, shows a relatively sharp transition to the dark shales and siltstones of the overlying Dunlin group. The depositional environment changes from alluvial plain and braided stream deposits that make up the bulk of the formation to coarse sandstones with pebble lags and channeling, thought to indicate a coastal environment. The presence of glauconite and marine fossils in the uppermost sandstones indicate deposition in a shallow marine environment. =Structure= The trap is a group of three easterly dipping tilted fault blocks associated with westerly dipping normal faults formed by rifting during the Late Jurassic on the east side of the Viking Graben. The three main fault blocks are known as Alpha, Gamma and Alpha North. The eastern boundary of the Oseberg fault blocks with the Horda Platform is formed by the major Brage fault. The structural dip is an average 6‚Äì10 degrees. =Seal= The top seal is formed by Upper Jurassic Viking group or Lower Cretaceous Cromer Knoll claystones. There is also evidence in the Oseberg area for some element of fault seal. =Sources= The oil in Oseberg is sourced from the Upper Jurassic Draupne formation, equivalent to the Kimmeridge Clay formation. Oils generated in at least two different 'kitchens' have been identified within the Oseberg area. The gas is likely to be sourced from over-mature Draupne formation in the deepest part of these kitchens. Reserves Initial recoverable reserves for the Oseberg field are estimated as 366.4 million Sm3 oil, 107.0 billion Sm3 gas and 9.3 million tonnes NGL. As of 31 December 2008 remaining recoverable reserves were estimated at 21.1 million Sm3 oil, 85.6 billion Sm3 gas and 3.5 million tonnes NGL.

A Klabautermann is a water kobold that assists sailors and fishermen on the Baltic and North Sea in their duties. It is a merry and diligent creature, with an expert understanding of most watercraft, and an irrepressible musical talent. It is believed to rescue sailors washed overboard. The name comes from the Low German verb klabastern meaning \\"rumble\\" or \\"make a noise\\". An etymology deriving the name from the verb kalfatern (\\"to caulk\\") has also been suggested.Leander Petzoldt, Kleines Lexikon der D√§monen und Elementargeister, Becksche Reihe, 1990, p. 109. His image is of a small sailor in yellow with a tobacco pipe and woolen sailor's cap, often carrying a caulking hammer. This likeness is carved and attached to the mast as a symbol of good luck. Despite the positive attributes, there is one omen associated with his presence: no member of a ship blessed by his presence shall ever set eyes on him. He only ever becomes visible to the crew of a doomed ship. More recently, the Klabautermann is sometimes described as having more sinister attributes, and blamed for things that go wrong on the ship. This incarnation of the Klabautermann is more demon- or goblin-like, prone to play pranks and, eventually, doom the ship and her crew. This deterioration of image probably stems from sailors, upon returning home, telling stories of their adventures at sea. Since life at sea can be rather dull, all creatures - real, mythical, and in between - eventually became the centre of rather ghastly stories.  Klabautermann in fiction  *In \\"The Musician's Tale: The Ballad of the Carmilhan\\" in Tales of a Wayside Inn by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, the \\"Klaboterman\\" appears to the crew of the doomed ship Valdemar, saving only the honest cabin boy. *In the manga and anime series One Piece, the pirate ship Going Merry, unknown by the crew, had its own Klabautermann. This Klabautermann fixed the boat when it was too damaged to go on, and spoke to Usopp, telling him not to worry because the boat would carry everyone a little longer. It was later revealed that the repairs the Klabauterman made were only temporary: the ship was too badly damaged to be permanently repaired, and sank shortly afterwards. This Klabautermann was portrayed in a manner strongly in line with the original, benevolent version of the creature (minus the pipe). Strangely enough, it was ranked as the 49th most popular character in One Piece (with 46 votes), 2 votes more than the Going Merry itself. *Dschinghis Khan released a single in 1982 called \\"Klabautermann\\". *Pumuckl, a German TV (1980s) and radio (1960s) series Kobold, descends from the dynasty of the Klabauterm√§nner. *In \\"Jeder stirbt f√ºr sich allein\\" (published in English as Every Man Dies Alone or \\"Alone in Berlin\\") by Hans Fallada, the author depicts the \\"resistance of the little people\\" to the Nazi regime. The novel shows the determined and sustained two-year campaign of Berlin residents Otto and Anna Quangel to protest against the government by the act of writing and distributing anti- Nazi postcards. This brave act, which begins when the couple lose their son in combat in France, eventually unleashes severe and disastrous consequences for many, not least for the main investigator assigned to the case, Kommissar Escherich of the Gestapo. In pursuit of the perpetrator for most of the novel, it is Escherich who nicknames the postcards' author \\"der Klabautermann\\".

Ratcliff and published for MS-DOS systems by Electronic Arts in 1994. The player takes command of a US Seawolf-class submarine and fights in 33 missions with targets under and above water including Russian attack subs, destroyers, missile cruisers, aircraft carriers and frigates. The game is a sequel to Electronic Arts' 688 Attack Sub, and has a similar mission structure and variety. Missions might require the player to defend friendly surface ships from attack, or sink those of the enemy. Other missions have their focus entirely underwater, with the player similarly either defending friendly submarines or hunting enemy missile and attack boats. While missions in Seawolf are pre- scripted, there are a number of initial setups which provides some variation in a mission's precise starting conditions. The game's opponents include the Soviet , and nuclear-powered attack submarines, which often guard or ballistic missile submarines. Some missions may pit the player against the very quiet diesel-electric submarine. Seawolf models the ocean environment, including thermal layers which can be used to deflect enemy sonar and hide the player's submarine. Sonar plays a central role in the game, and the player has access to the submarine's spectrographic 'waterfall' display which is used to detect and classify contacts. Additionally, the game includes marine life, such as whales and schools of fish, that could generate noise or reflect active sonar and create additional contacts. Like its predecessor, Seawolf allows two players, on different PCs, to play each other via a modem, or null-modem cable, and adds the option of using an IPX local network which can provide a more reliable connection. Reception Computer Gaming World in May 1994 said that \\"Certain hard-core simulation features have been left out to enhance overall playability, but the state-of-the-art graphics, tremendous music by the Fat Man, and mind blowing sound effects all combine to lock this product dead-on-target\\". In June 1994 it criticized the game's unrealistic weapons load, \\"deficient\\" manual, \\"poor\\" AI, and lack of game balance, but said that \\"the game is still a whole heck of a lot of fun. This is definitely a game for someone who wants to enjoy a few hours of blowing up Russian ships, and not for the next Admiral Nimitz\\".

Currently (2004), it consists of over 40,000 baptized members in 200 congregations spread throughout both countries. The LCCA maintains the Lutheran Seminary for the training of ministers, in Lusaka, the capital of Zambia, and the Lutheran Bible Institute, a pre-seminary pastoral training school based in Lilongwe, Malawi. StructureGovernment= Technically, the two members of the LCCA, the Lutheran Church of Central Africa - Malawi Conference (LCCA-MC) and the Lutheran Church of Central Africa - Zambia Conference (LCCA-ZC) are both members of the overarching synod known as the Lutheran Church of Central Africa. In practice, due to political borders, both conferences operate independently of one another, their only true link being in the sharing of pastoral training facilities in Lusaka and Lilongwe. The LCCA-MC and LCCA-ZC are led by a president and a chairman, respectively, both elected for four year terms in bienual conventions within their own conferences. Synodical conventions are intended to be held regularly, but often are not, due to political borders. =Educational institutions= The LCCA runs two facilities for the training of clergy. The first is the Lutheran Bible Institute, located in Lilongwe, Malawi. It is intended as a three-year pre-seminary school and serves students from both of the LCCA's conferences. The second facility is the Lutheran Seminary located in Lusaka, Zambia. The Lutheran Seminary is a three-year seminary for the training of clergy for the LCCA and trains students from both of the LCCA's conferences. Following training at the Lutheran Seminary students typically serve a one-year vicarship after which they are ordained as clergy. =Other institutions= The LCCA maintains The Lutheran Press on the campus of the Lutheran Seminary, in Lusaka, Zambia and at the Lutheran Bible Institute in Lilongwe. The Lutheran Press publishes and prints various religious materials for use by the LCCA. Among Lutheran Press publications are various local language hymnals, educational materials and an occasional newsletter. History The Lutheran Church of Central Africa was established by Lutheran missionaries from the Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod. First exploratory mission work began in the 1949 (with the first resident missionaries arriving in 1953) in the British colony of Northern Rhodesia (later to become the country of Zambia). In 1955, an official denomination, named the Rhodesian Lutheran Church Conference was organized. In 1962, the Rhodesian Lutheran Church Conference was reorganized and became The Lutheran Church of Central Africa. Exploratory mission work in the neighboring country of Malawi after 1962 led to the foundation of the Malawi Conference of the LCCA. The LCCA is currently involved in mission work in Mozambique, with the eventual goal of setting up a sister church there. Beliefs The LCCA teaches that the Bible is the only authoritative source for doctrine. It subscribes to the Lutheran Confessions (the Book of Concord, 1580) as accurate presentations of what Scripture teaches. It teaches that Jesus is the center of Scripture and the only way to eternal salvation, and that the Holy Spirit uses the gospel alone in Word and Sacraments (Baptism and Holy Communion) to bring people to faith in Jesus as Savior and keep them in that faith, strengthening them in their daily life of sanctification. Doctrinally, both conferences of the LCCA are in union. Ecumenical relations Fellowship relations between the LCCA and other church groups are established only upon investigation and confirmation that both church groups hold complete unity in scriptural doctrine and practice. The LCCA is closely associated with the Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod. It is also a member of the Confessional Evangelical Lutheran Conference (CELC),Who we are - Membership a worldwide organization of confessional Lutheran church bodies.

The company primarily produced collectible card games as a subsidiary of Games Workshop, PLC. Sabertooth Games was considered a \\"sister company\\" of the other divisions in BL Publishing. =Background= Sabertooth Games was a small company which primarily targeted hobby stores, rather than attempting to sell through standard mass-market channels. The company's mission statement from CEO Stephen Horvath emphasizes that this focus benefited and helped to support such smaller retailers. In an interview with GameSpy, Horvath notes that the company encourages players to \\"buy the game where you play the game.\\" Towards this end, the company often sponsors events and provides free promotional cards at local stores. The games produced by Sabertooth Games made use of existing game licenses or intellectual property. Traditionally, these games were based on other board game or role- playing game properties, such as the Warhammer 40,000 universe. However, with the introduction of the Universal Fighting System in 2006, the company expanded into the area of video game properties, partnering with Capcom, Namco, and others. In early 2008, following the financial difficulties of Games Workshop, a number of Sabertooth Games' assets, including the Universal Fighting System, were sold to Fantasy Flight Games, along with licenses for board games. =Games= The company produced and sold the following collectible card game products: * Warhammer 40,000 Collectible Card Game * Horus Heresy * Dark Millennium * Universal Fighting System * WarCry Each of these products includes several different sets or expansions, and new expansions continued to be released on an ongoing basis (for at least several of these) in order to maintain consumer interest.

That morning, 16-year-old Jeff Weise killed his grandfather (a tribal police sergeant) and his grandfather's girlfriend at their home. After taking his grandfather's police weapons and bulletproof vest, Weise drove his grandfather's police vehicle to Red Lake Senior High School, where he had been a student some months before. Weise shot and killed seven people at the school and wounded five others. The dead included an unarmed security guard at the entrance of the school, a teacher, and five students. After the police arrived, Weise exchanged gunfire with them. After being wounded, he shot and killed himself in a classroom. At the time, it was the deadliest school shooting in the United States since the Columbine High School massacre.  Background  By some accounts, at the time of the shooting Weise was living with his paternal grandfather, Daryl Lussier, Sr., a sergeant with the Red Lake Police Department, run by the Red Lake Ojibwe tribal government. The household included his grandfather's 32-year-old girlfriend, Michelle Leigh Sigana. His paternal aunts Shauna and Tammy Lussier said he had lived mostly with them for the past several years, and they helped him get treatment to deal with some of his behavioral issues and depression. In 1999, Jeff Weise's mother suffered severe brain damage in an alcohol-related car accident and since then lived and received care in a nursing home. Still a child, Weise was forced to move from Minneapolis to live with his father's family on the reservation. His father had died by suicide in 1997, so Weise was officially placed with his grandmother, Shelda (Gurneau) Lussier. His aunts Shauna and Tammy Lussier helped care for him, especially after the grandmother's death in 2003. The reservation of the Red Lake Band of Ojibwe (aka Chippewa) is in northwest Minnesota and is one of two nationally that are \\"closed\\"; only Ojibwe tribal members may live there and own land. Its residents suffer high rates of unemployment, violence, and suicide. Housing is poor, and many students do not finish high school. Work opportunities are limited on the reservation, which has a population of more than 5,000. A study in 2004 found that a high proportion of students in high school had thought of suicide.  Shootings  The day of the shootings, Weise retrieved a Ruger MK II .22 caliber pistol from his bedroom and fatally shot his grandfather as he was sleeping; he shot him two times in the head and ten times in the chest. According to Weise's friends, the teenager may have had the gun for as long as a year. He took Lussier's two police-issue weapons, a .40 caliber Glock 23 pistol and a Remington 870 12 gauge pump-action shotgun, a gunbelt and a bulletproof vest. He then fatally shot Sigana, his grandfather's girlfriend, two times in the head as she carried laundry up the stairs. Weise drove his grandfather's squad car to Red Lake Senior High School, arriving at around 2:45 p.m. Central Standard Time. As he entered the school through the main entrance, he encountered two unarmed security guards manning a metal detector. Weise shot and killed security guard Derrick Brun, while the other security guard escaped without injury. Weise proceeded into the main corridor of the school. He began shooting into an English classroom, killing three students and one teacher, and wounding three students. Student Ashley Lajeunesse said that Chase Lussier (no direct relation to Weise's father or grandfather) sheltered her, and was one of those shot and killed by Weise. Jeffrey May, a 16-year-old sophomore, tried to wrestle Weise inside the classroom, and stabbed him in the stomach with a pencil. His diversion allowed students to flee the classroom to safety, but Weise shot May two times in the neck and once in the jaw, leaving him seriously injured. Witnesses said Weise smiled as he was shooting at people. One witness said that Weise asked a student if he believed in God. This is believed to have been a reference to a widely publicized exchange during the 1999 Columbine High School massacre between Dylan Klebold and Valeen Schnurr, a Columbine survivor. At around 2:52 p.m., Weise returned to the main entrance, where he killed two students and wounded two others. The police had arrived quickly and engaged him in gunfire. FBI special agent Paul McCabe said the shootout lasted for about four minutes. None of the police officers were injured. After being hit three times in the lower back, right leg, and right arm by police gunfire, Weise retreated to a vacant classroom. He leaned against a wall, put the shotgun barrel to his chin, and fired, killing himself. The shootings lasted nine minutes. Weise fired a total of 59 shots during the shooting spree; 14 at his grandfather's home and 45 at the school. He fired 37 rounds from his grandfather's Glock handgun, 14 from his Ruger handgun, and eight from the shotgun.Feds: Assault at Red Lake over in nine minutes = Fatalities and funerals= Police said a total of ten people, including the perpetrator, had died in these events. * Daryl Allen Lussier, Sr., age 58, Police Sergeant and Jeff Weise's paternal grandfather. * Michelle Leigh Sigana, age 32, Lussier's girlfriend. * Derrick Brian Brun, age 28, Security Guard. * Neva Jane Wynkoop-Rogers, age 62, English teacher. * Alicia Alberta White, age 14, student. * Thurlene Marie Stillday, age 15, student. * Chanelle Star Rosebear, age 15, student. * Chase Albert Lussier, age 15, student. * Dewayne Michael Lewis, age 15, student. * Jeffrey James Weise, age 16, student/perpetrator. The night after the shooting, many people of the community gathered at the high school gymnasium for a healing ceremony. They performed traditional Ojibwe ceremonies and prayed. Within days, preparations started for funerals on the reservation. Tribal members drew from Ojibwe traditions as well as Catholic rites. They \\"collected bundles of sage, to be given as gifts and burned during funeral ceremonies.\\" Families picked personal items to be placed in the caskets.  Related events  * Buck Jourdain, Chairman of the Red Lake Band of Chippewa Indians, said that the shootings were \\"one of the darkest and most painful occurrences in the history of our tribe.\\" * Louis Jourdain, the son of the Tribal Chairman Floyd \\"Buck\\" Jourdain Jr., was arrested in connection with the shootings on March 28, 2005 and charged with conspiracy to commit murder. He was charged based on several email messages which he exchanged with Weise related to plans for the Red Lake High School shooting. The government dropped the conspiracy charge; however, Jourdain pleaded guilty to transmitting threatening messages through the Internet. * Derrick Brun, the killed security guard, was recognized for his bravery, with special recognition by President George W. Bush. * Jeffrey May, a sophomore injured while trying to attack Weise, was highly praised. He was featured in Reader's Digest.  Aid to victims and families  Minnesota has a state fund that aids victims and their families. In addition, the Red Lake Band of Chippewa established a memorial fund; it reached $200,000 in donations from across the country by April 2005. Initially, the tribe made 15 grants of $5,000 each to victims and their families, including one to Weise's relatives. A tribal spokesman noted his family was not eligible for state compensation and said that they carried \\"a double burden.\\" The grant was to help pay for Weise's funeral and burial. On July 21, 2006, the Red Lake school district reached a settlement with the families of the massacre victims. The school district agreed to pay $1,000,000 total to 21 of the victims' families, the maximum amount allowed by Minnesota law. Of the settlement, $900,000 will immediately be granted to the families, and the remaining $100,000 will be set aside for future distribution.  Perpetrator  Jeffrey Weise was labeled an outsider in the community and had recently been placed in \\"homebound\\" schooling for breaking school rules. He is remembered as a quiet kid that normally wore a black trench coat and gel in his hair. Weise had grown up with a difficult and disrupted family life; his parents were a young unmarried couple who separated before he was born. His mother Joanne Weise was 17 years old at the time of his birth. Joanne's family insisted that she give up her son to the father, Daryl Lussier, Jr., who was a few years older than her. Jeff Weise did not live with his mother again until after he was two years old, when she reclaimed him and took him to live in Minneapolis. In later Internet postings, Weise wrote that his mother had become an alcoholic who was sometimes physically and emotionally abusive. In 1992, she started dating Timothy \\"Troy\\" DesJarlait, and they married in 1998 after having had two children together. Jeff moved around often because of his mother, and attended several different schools during his adolescence. In 1997, when Weise was eight years old, his father Daryl Lussier, Jr. died by suicide at age 32, shooting himself after a days-long standoff with Red Lake tribal police. Lussier's own father, Daryl Lussier, Sr., was a sergeant with the tribal police and was involved in the standoff. In 1999, when Weise was ten, his mother was in an alcohol-related car accident and suffered severe brain damage. She had to be committed to a nursing home for rehabilitation. After separating from her in 2000, Timothy DesJarlait divorced Weise's mother in May 2004. DesJarlait took custody of the two children he'd had with Weise's mother, but did not opt to take custody of Jeff. Jeff was placed in the custody of his paternal grandmother Shelda (Gurneau) Lussier, who lived on the Red Lake Reservation. He had to leave Minneapolis, where he had lived most of his life, to live with her and other paternal relatives in Red Lake. His maternal grandmother Rita Weise also lived on the Red Lake Reservation. = Motives = Police investigators began searching for a motive behind the shootings. According to their findings and media reports, Weise was often bullied or teased in school by classmates. A tall youth weighing 250 pounds (115 kg), he was known to wear dark eyeliner, as well as a long black trench coat and other black clothing to school year round. He was referred to as a \\"goth kid\\" by many of his classmates. He did not usually respond to taunts. Some fellow students thought of him as a loner, but he had his own circle of friends. Jeff Weise expressed frustration about living in Red Lake, and felt his life was beyond his control. During these years, he got close to his grandfather, Daryl Lussier, Sr., who gave him a bedroom of his own. Lussier, Sr. lived with his companion Michele Sigana. Weise was said to have a good relationship with his grandfather. Although Jeff had been separated from his mother and stepfather for years by the time of their divorce in May 2004, he attempted suicide soon after, and again in June 2004. At that time, his aunts and the Red Lake Medical Center arranged for Weise to be taken to a hospital for psychiatric treatment, where he stayed for three days. The teen was prescribed Prozac as an anti-depressant, to be continued as treatment together with counseling. His doctor had increased his dosage a week before the shooting, to 60 mg a day of Prozac. His aunts Shauna and Tammy Lussier, with whom Weise lived much of the time at Red Lake, said they had arranged for his medical care and were concerned about the increase in his dosage. Weise's actions reopened the debate about Prozac use among children and adolescents. In October 2004, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had issued a warning about its use, but it is still the only anti-depressant that is FDA-approved for children. Lorene Gurneau, a relative of Weise's paternal grandmother, said she and other family members thought Jeff had never gotten over his father's suicide in 1997. In addition, his mother's car accident in 1999 had left her brain damaged and in a nursing home, which meant that Jeff had effectively lost both parents by the age of ten. When his mother's ex-husband refused to take custody of him, he felt like he didn't belong. = Internet activities = Weise was discovered to have been quite active on the Internet. According to The Smoking Gun, Weise created two violent Flash animations for the flash website Newgrounds, using the alias \\"Regret\\". One animation entitled Target Practice features a character who murders three people with a rifle, blows up a police car with a grenade, and kills a Klansman. The 30-second animation ends with the shooter putting the gun in his mouth and pulling the trigger. Weise had created another Flash animation entitled Clown in which a clown kills a man by eating his head. A LiveJournal account, apparently created by Weise, contained three entries posted between December 2004 and January 2005. The weblog was customized to be rendered in black and white. In his posts, Weise expressed his desire for change and salvation in his life. Weise was a fan of the music genre known as horrorcore, and was particular a fan of rappers such as Mars, Jimmy Donn and Prozak. Weise was known to frequent the Mars website. Jimmy Donn's song \\"Game Over\\" (which is a song about a school shooting) was said to be one of Weise's favorite songs, and Weise owned Jimmy Donn's album The Darker Side.  Legacy and memorials  Siblings of the victims and survivors participated in the 2018 School Walk Outs, which was designed to show respect for shooting victims seen nationally but especially in Florida and Red Lake.

Their unique blend of folk music revival and psychedelia gave them a cult-like following from the late 1960s into the 1970s. For a time the group also included the playwright and actor Sam Shepard. Origin of the name Stampfel explained the origin of the name in the webzine Perfect Sound Forever: :We kept changing the name. First it was the Total Quintessence Stomach Pumpers. Then the Temporal Worth High Steppers. Then The Motherfucker Creek Babyrapers. That was just a joke name. He was Rinky-Dink Steve the Tin Horn and I was Fast Lightning Cumquat. He was Teddy Boy Forever and I was Wild Blue Yonder. It kept changing names. Then it was the Total Modal Rounders. Then when we were stoned on pot and someone else, Steve Close maybe, said Holy Modal Rounders by mistake. We kept putting out different names and wait until someone starts calling us that then. When we got to Holy Modal Rounders, everyone decided by accumulation that we were the Holy Modal Rounders. That's the practical way to get named. Career Stampfel and Weber were introduced to each other by Greenwich Village figure Antonia, who also wrote or co-wrote many of their songs.McFadden, John. Bear Suit Follies: The Songs, Stories and Letters of Antonia, 2007, Lulu.com, Their first album, The Holy Modal Rounders, released in 1964, contained their version of \\"Hesitation Blues\\", the lyrics of which included the first use of the term psychedelic (here pronounced \\"psycho-delic\\") in popular music.M. Hicks, M. (2000). Sixties Rock: Garage, Psychedelic, and Other Satisfactions. University of Illinois Press. pp. 59‚Äì60., Shortly after the release of their second album, The Holy Modal Rounders 2, in 1965, they joined Ed Sanders and Tuli Kupferberg in the Fugs for a short time. Their 1965 recordings with the Fugs are on the albums The Village Fugs, Virgin Fugs, and Fugs 4, Rounders Score. Weber wrote the cult classic \\"Boobs a Lot\\" for the Fugs, which the Rounders later recorded on the album Good Taste Is Timeless. After leaving the Fugs, the Rounders re-formed with Sam Shepard and Lee Crabtree to record their third album, Indian War Whoop, and appeared in Shepard's play Forensic. Their fourth album, The Moray Eels Eat the Holy Modal Rounders, recorded in 1968, included \\"Bird Song\\" (essentially Ray Price's \\"You Done Me Wrong\\" with altered lyrics), which was featured in Dennis Hopper's film Easy Rider. In 1968, the band performed \\"You've Got the Right String but the Wrong Yo Yo\\" on the TV series Laugh-In, with appearances by the park-bench oldtimers played by Ruth Buzzi and Arte Johnson. In 1970, Robin Remailly and Dave Reisch joined the band, which relocated to Boston and then Oregon, adding Ted Deane, Roger North, and Jeff \\"Skunk\\" Baxter. Stampfel stayed in New York but played and recorded with the band on occasion. The band's fifth album, Good Taste Is Timeless, was released by Metromedia in 1971, and their sixth, Alleged in Their Own Time, was released by Rounder Records in 1975. Later history Stampfel formed the short-lived Unholy Modal Rounders (1975‚Äì1977) with Kirby Pines, Charlie Messing, Jeff Berman and Paul Presti. The group was part of the collaboration Have Moicy!, with Michael Hurley and Jeffrey Frederick and the Clamtones. After releasing Last Round in 1978, the Holy Modal Rounders broke up once again. Stampfel and Weber reunited briefly to record Going Nowhere Fast (1980). While working for his wife, Betsy Wollheim, as submissions editor of DAW Books Stampfel formed the Bottle Caps, releasing Peter Stampfel and the Bottlecaps (1986), The People's Republic of Rock n' Roll (1989), and an album of standards, You Must Remember This (1994). He won a Grammy Award in 1998 for writing part of the liner notes for the CD reissue of the Anthology of American Folk Music. When asked if he had plans for his award, he was quoted in The New York Times as saying \\"I'm going to put honey on mine and lick it off.\\" The Holy Modal Rounders continued for 20 years without Stampfel, as the band relocated to Portland, Oregon, while Stampfel stayed in New York. The band toured the United States and Scandinavia but remained rooted in Portland, still billed as the Holy Modal Rounders. Some fans have nicknamed them \\"The Electric Rounders\\", since like many other bands they changed their acoustic sound to attract larger audiences. Stampfel and Weber reunited again under the Rounders name for Too Much Fun in 1999. Since then, Stampfel has released records with the Du-Tels (No Knowledge of Music Required, 2001) and the Bottle Caps (The Jig Is Up, 2004). He continues to be active musically, playing with a number of groups, largely in New York City. Some of the performances from a 2008 tour of the Pacific Northwest were scheduled to be released by Frederick Productions in 2009. In 2010 he released his Dook of the Beatniks album. Weber reportedly later worked on solo material, according to people who knew him. In 2005, Frederick Productions/Red Newt Records released Steve Weber and the Holy Modal Rounders, B.C. Taken from a 1976 radio show out of Vancouver, BC, this is the only commercial album featuring Weber and the full Portland band in its heyday. A number of Rounders live albums have also surfaced in recent years. In 2006 a documentary film, The Holy Modal Rounders: Bound to Lose, was released, directed by Paul Lovelace and produced by Sam Douglas. The film offers insight into the lives of Weber and Stampfel and their career as The Holy Modal Rounders. However, after the movie was released Weber went on record saying the film grossly misrepresented him and that the filmmakers deliberately got him drunk to make a fool out of him. Weber said the movie destroyed the Holy Modal Rounders, strained the relationship in the band, and made any future reunion impossible. Weber died on February 7, 2020, aged 76, in Mount Clare, West Virginia. \\"Stephen P. Weber June 22, 1943 ~ February 7, 2020\\", Davis Funeral Home.

The definition is generalized to the largest t-free divisor of n, \\\\mathrm{rad}_t, which are multiplicative functions which act on prime powers as : \\\\mathrm{rad}_t(p^e) = p^{\\\\mathrm{min}(e, t - 1)} The cases t=3 and t=4 are tabulated in and . The notion of the radical occurs in the abc conjecture, which states that, for any Œµ > 0, there exists a finite KŒµ such that, for all triples of coprime positive integers a, b, and c satisfying a + b = c, :c < K_\\\\varepsilon\\\\, \\\\operatorname{rad}(abc)^{1 + \\\\varepsilon} For any integer n, the nilpotent elements of the finite ring \\\\mathbb{Z}/n\\\\mathbb{Z} are all of the multiples of \\\\operatorname{rad}(n).

Two series were broadcast, the first consisting of six episodes in 1975, and the second series of seven episodes in 1976. A Christmas special was broadcast on Boxing Day 1975. It was Idle's first television project after Monty Python's Flying Circus, which had ended the previous year, and was the catalyst for The Rutles. Rutland Weekend Television or RWT ostensibly centred on \\"Britain's smallest television network\\", situated in England's smallest (and mainly rural) county, Rutland. This framework allowed for a range of sketches and material to be presented, all as part of the fictional network's hosted programming. Nevertheless, even this very loose concept was frequently ignored and material was presented with a more stream-of-consciousness approach, with no particular tie-in to the RWT framework. Typically, in addition to sketch material, each episode would also feature two music videos (a term not yet coined in 1975) of Neil Innes songs, which would be woven into the flow of the show. The show's title alludes to London Weekend Television (then part of ITV and since renamed ITV London). A Rutland TV station would be pretty small (representing roughly 30,000 people in an area less than 150 square miles), so a Rutland Television would have to be ridiculously tiny. The joke was doubly meaningful as Idle had accidentally been granted a presentation budget instead of the more lavish budgets associated with light entertainment ‚Äì so the weekly patter about their inability to buy props and sets reflected reality. Indeed, the last show of the first series featured Idle and Innes, stripped and shivering in blankets under a bare bulb, singing about how the power's about to be shut off. Idle speaks bitterly about these conditions now but his attempts to overcome them formed the basis of a lot of the show's jokes. Idle, in a 1975 Radio Times interview, remarked, \\"It was made on a shoestring budget, and someone else was wearing the shoe. The studio is the same size as the weather forecast studio and nearly as good. We had to bring the sets up four floors for each scene, then take them down again. While the next set was coming up, we'd change our make-up. Every minute mattered. It's not always funny to be funny from ten in the morning until ten at night. As for ad-libbing, what ad-libbing? You don't ad-lib when you're working with three cameras and anyway the material goes out months after you've made it.\\"  A typical episode  The episode begins with the announcer, usually with something going wrong or with something out of the ordinary, from announcements catching fire to open auditions for the announcer itself. Occasionally the announcement would be sung, or performed by more than one person. In one episode, the announcements are performed by \\"The Ricochet Brothers\\" (spelled Ricochet, but pronounced Rick-ot-chet) who begin the episode as a pair, and expand to a full cast, each group speaking the announcement in unison. The role of the announcer was to announce the \\"programmes\\" (typically sketches) ‚Äì many programmes would lead into, or announce, one of many songs and accompanying strange vignettes by Neil Innes. Innes recalled that the cheaper-looking sets added to the show; \\"It was sometimes a problem but that was in fact the whole raison d‚Äôetre of the programme. It was such a cheap budget programme that it worked in our favour. You could actually show how cheap and cheerful it was because it was ‚ÄòRutland Weekend Television‚Äô. It was made in a studio at the BBC called Presentation B, which is where they do the weather from.\\"Gent, James. \\"Neil Innes: When Does A Dream Begin\\". We Are Cult  Cast and guest stars Regular cast= *Eric Idle - As the star of the show, Idle plays many of the lead roles in the series. He is also the first person to appear in the show, as an interviewer in the first sketch, \\"Gibberish\\" in which Idle and Woolf talk in completely nonsensical sentences: > Ham sandwich, bucket and water plastic Duralex rubber McFisheries underwear. > Plugged rabbit emulsion, zinc custard without sustenance in kipling-duff > geriatric scenery, maximises press insulating government grunting sapphire- > clubs incidentally. But tonight, sam pan Bombay Bermuda in diphtheria rustic > McAlpine splendour, rabbit and foot-foot-phooey jugs rapidly big biro > ruveliners musk-green gauges micturate with nipples and tiptoe rusting > machinery, rustically inclined. Good evening and welcome. *Neil Innes - A former member of the Bonzo Dog Doo Dah Band and The World, longtime songwriter for and performer with Monty Python, then current member of Grimms, and later to lead The Rutles, Innes wrote and performed most of the songs in the show, often in the guise of another character, such as Stoop Solo. Innes and members of his band, Fatso, also performed many songs written or co-written by Idle during the tenure of the show. Aside from the musical items, Innes was also a regular cast member, performing in many of the sketches. *David Battley - Best remembered for his performance as the schoolteacher Mr. Turkentine in Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory (1971) and the hapless Ergo in Krull (1983). In the show, he was often the straight man, and second only to Idle in the number of his performances throughout the series. He was the Paul McCartney character in the original (RWT) Rutles sketch, but was not involved in the TV special All You Need Is Cash (1978). Battley also appears in the final episode as David Frost, whom he had also portrayed in a stage production. *Henry Woolf - Often paired with Battley, appearing at his side in many sketches, though occasionally complains about being cast as \\"the short one\\", or \\"The Jewish One\\". He would later star as the Surrey mystic, Arthur Sultan, in All You Need Is Cash. In the fourth episode of series two, Woolf bitterly complains that \\"I'm a writer‚ÄîI've had plays on!\\" Both claims are true. *Gwen Taylor - As the main female performer, Taylor appeared in a lot of sketches, but is still much more noticeably absent than Idle or Battley. Credibly, she frequently plays genuine female characters, instead of the more \\"decorative\\" roles from the other female contributors. She too would go on to star in All You Need Is Cash, as the mother of Leggy Mountbatten and Ron Nasty's wife, Chastity; as well as appearing in Palin and Jones's Ripping Yarns and in several roles in Monty Python's Life of Brian (1979), including Mrs. Bignose (\\"Don't pick your nose!\\"), the elderly woman bent double under the weight of a dummy donkey and the ineffectual heckler during Pilate's passover address (\\"and a pickpocket!\\"). It could be said that she was an official \\"new\\" fringe member of Monty Python around this time, alongside Charles McKeown and Terence Bayler, frequently appearing in its creators' projects. *Terence Bayler - Appearing from the last episode of series one onwards, Bayler played a variety of characters, including a shy and apparently forgetful announcer, the greasy presenter of \\"Rutland Showtime\\", and the Pink Panzer (a pink-uniformed SS officer who greets the camera with an effete Nazi salute and a breathless \\"Heil Hitler\\"). He would later appear as the manager of the Rutles in All You Need Is Cash, and as Gregory (\\"I'm Brian and so's my wife!\\") in Monty Python's Life of Brian (1979). =Guest stars= *Bunny May, Lyn Ashley, Carinthia West - Three performers who were given the more \\"token\\" roles, often playing attractive, silent characters, in sharp contrast to the well rounded performances of Gwen Taylor. May was not in fact an actress but an actor who occasionally appeared in drag. Ashley was Eric Idle's wife at the time (they divorced between the show's two series). West, romantically associated with Mick Jagger & Bryan Ferry at various points in her life, increasingly provided the glamour over the two series. *Fatso - The band featured regularly, both as a group and as individuals. Members included Innes himself, as well as John Halsey, Billy Bremner, Brian Hodgson, and Roger Rettig. Halsey played Ringo Starr facsimile Barry Wom in Idle and Innes' Beatles parody, The Rutles, which originated as a sketch on RWT (Innes and Idle portrayed the Lennon and McCartney parallels, Ron Nasty and Dirk McQuickly). He also appeared as one half of the \\"Fabulous Bingo Brothers\\" (the other half being musician Zoot Money), and as the defense lawyer in the \\"Rutland 5‚Äì0\\" sketch. Roger Rettig now resides in Florida, USA. In England, Roger backed Lonnie Donegan and Roy St. John, as well as participating in the band Klondike Pete and the Huskies. Brian Hodgson, regularly tours with legendary guitarist Albert Lee in a band called Hogan's Heroes. Billy Bremner is one of the UK's top session guitarists who now resides in Sweden. He was also a member of Rockpile fronted by Dave Edmunds. Also in the band was Nick Lowe. Billy released a solo single on Stiff Records in 1981 called Loud Music In Cars. *George Harrison - The Christmas special features George Harrison as \\"Pirate Bob\\", dressed in appropriate attire and frequently interrupting the action throughout the show, before being given the chance to sing at the end in normal clothing. After leading the band through an intro to his 1970‚Äì71 hit \\"My Sweet Lord\\", Harrison switches off and starts singing a lively tune about pirates known as \\"The Pirate Song\\", co-written with Eric Idle. Innes's connection with Harrison and the other Beatles, as well as Harrison's to Monty Python and its members, are equally notable. Innes' Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band appeared in The Beatles' Magical Mystery Tour film, and Paul McCartney produced the Bonzos' 1968 single \\"I'm the Urban Spaceman\\", while Harrison founded HandMade Films for the purpose of financing Python's Life of Brian; HandMade later also produced Python alum Terry Gilliam's Time Bandits. In addition, Harrison appeared as a news reporter ‚Äì interviewing Michael Palin ‚Äì in Idle and Innes' 1978 Beatles parody, The Rutles: All You Need is Cash. Idle said of his RWT colleagues (in the same Radio Times interview): \\"Neil Innes is superb. I must be his biggest fan. Henry Woolf played Toulouse-Lautrec in the West End. He's the best small philosopher in London at the moment. And David Battley ‚Äì what can I say? Straight, pale, dead-pan brilliant. Our cameraman, Peter Bartlett, filmed the Queen but says I'm easier to work with.\\"  Memorable sketches  * Santa Doesn't Live Here Any More. Supposedly a play by Arthur Serious, this sketch parodies a typically miserable family Christmas, with David Battley complaining about everything and suggesting \\"a nice game of suicide\\". Eric Idle relates a charming childhood memory that quickly turns nasty, and Neil Innes arrives as a postman, with an unusual present in the shape of a sexy showgirl, prompting Battley's remark \\"they make lovely presents, women\\". This segues into Innes's doleful song, \\"I Don't Believe In Santa Any More\\". * Being Normal. A spoof documentary about one man's completely uneventful life. Despite having had lunatic parents and a miserable childhood, Arthur Sutcliffe (David Battley) remains depressingly ordinary, going to \\"straight pubs\\" and feeling at home in the company of \\"other normals\\". The documentary's narrator decides that \\"the little man from the off-licence\\" (Woolf) is to blame, not just for Sutcliffe's misfortune, but for everything, including Leicester City Football Club's failure to win the FA Cup, racial prejudice and the unequal distribution of wealth. This segues into Innes's song Lie Down and Be Counted. * Expose. What begins as an investigation into the notorious 'Massed Flashers of Reigate' is quickly overtaken by the revelation that the police force are moonlighting as shop assistants and builders, and a commune for policemen (and women) is raided by hippies looking for drugs. The documentary also highlights how few people believe in Sir Keith Joseph, before Eric Idle is informed that he's getting a bad review. Idle rants about the uselessness of television critics for a while, but Henry Woolf informs him that his satirical invective has won him a rave review. Idle changes tack and begins praising TV critics, but the cast rebel against him and talk about putting in for their own series as the credits roll. * The Cretin Club. A man (David Battley) is despondent after he scores zero in an IQ test, but since he managed to get his name right at the top of the paper, the examiner (Eric Idle) gives him two points and membership to the Cretin Club, whose perks include cufflinks, a club tie and an 'I Am A Cretin' T-shirt. (This sketch was expanded upon in The Rutland Dirty Weekend Book.) * Ill Health Food Store. Eric Idle runs a shop selling both unappetising fare such as tins of acne, the 'diarrhoea delight'- and the chance to take a vegetarian home and force-feed him meat. * Twenty-four Hours In Tunbridge Wells. An extremely low-budget spoof of the Gene Kelly / Frank Sinatra film On the Town, shown as part of Rutland Weekend Television's season of Classically Bad American Films. * Ron Badger / Satan's Electrical Shop. The Devil (David Battley) is found in reduced circumstances, running a small electrical shop. He complains that people's souls are no good to him (\\"they just sit there, soulfully...if people sold me their privates, it'd be more interesting\\") but reluctantly decides to buy just one more. The customer (Eric Idle) hasn't taken Satan's economic downturn into account though, and the promise to make love to Helen of Troy turns out to be a seedy one-night stand with \\"Helen of bleeding Edgbaston, more like\\" in a grubby seaside hotel room. * Man Alive ‚Äì Suburban Prisons. A spoof on the BBC current events series has housewives running maximum security prisons from their bungalows. Mrs Harris's prison is the most unpopular, as she has reintroduced hanging. However, Mrs Fletcher's prison is a big hit, because she had Johnny Cash (Neil Innes) perform a concert for the inmates. * The Old Gay Whistle Test. A parody of The Old Grey Whistle Test, featuring Idle as the host, speaking in a permanent whisper (parodying the real show's then-host \\"Whispering\\" Bob Harris). It featured Stan Fitch, \\"the world's first all-dead singer\\", and supposed rock star Mantra Robinson talking about a concert where \\"we did over seven million dollars' worth of damage, so it was rather good\\", even though only five people turned up.  The Rutles  One show introduced The Rutles, a four-piece band fronted by Innes as a man \\"suffering from love song\\" spoofing The Beatles, singing \\"I Must Be In Love\\", a pastiche of some of the early Lennon‚ÄìMcCartney songs. This was followed by the beginnings of a documentary feature about the band, cut short when the camera, mounted on a car, speeds off. This scene was later remade in the spinoff film, All You Need Is Cash, featuring Idle, Innes, Ricky Fataar and John Halsey (who also appeared in many of the musical items in the series) as the \\"Pre-Fab Four\\". Innes wrote the music for the film, most of which was parody of well-known Beatles songs. On RWT, \\"The Rutles\\" are portrayed by: Eric Idle as the Harrison character, Neil Innes as the Lennon character, David Battley as the McCartney character, and John Halsey as the Ringo character. They are introduced as: \\"Dirk\\" (Idle), \\"Nasty\\" (Innes), \\"Stig\\" (Battley), & \\"Barry\\" (Halsey). (\\"Barry\\" is inexplicably changed to \\"Kevin\\" on the RWT soundtrack album.) The original version of \\"I Must Be In Love\\", is performed by Neil Innes & Fatso, and is slightly different than the 1978 All You Need Is Cash version. Also of note, on RWT, \\"The Rutles\\" are quite clearly a product of Rutland, whereas in All You Need Is Cash, they are relocated to Liverpool. Innes would later appear in another sketch, as \\"Ron Lennon\\", performing a short song titled, \\"The Children of Rock-N-Roll\\". This 30 second piece would later be expanded into a full Rutles song, \\"Good Times Roll\\", for the All You Need Is Cash film and album.  Python influence  Aside from the first appearance of the Rutles, the show features some surreal humour in the style associated with Monty Python. One sketch features the Lone Ranger (Idle) transformed into the Lone Accountant, with Innes as Tonto accidentally murdering holdup victims while trying to rescue them (\\"too many gin-and-tonic at lunch... You think it easy to be Indian accountant?\\"). Another scene features Gwen Taylor visiting the doctor to complain of her constantly changing costume and surroundings and being diagnosed with \\"bad continuity.\\" The prescribed treatment is editing out two weeks of her life, after which she says she feels well, and a bit hungry... though her soundtrack is still off. She then becomes a victim of recurring film flashbacks, eventually disappearing back into her childhood. Innes subsequently created and starred in The Innes Book of Records, a pre-MTV show that wove together strange guests and music videos in a bewildering array of musical styles and visual styles. The premise of Rutland Weekend Television is very similar to that of the Canadian-US comedy series SCTV, but both shows were created independently around the same time in 1975 and 1976. Monty Python was aired on both Canadian and US TV in the early 1970s. Other media As well as providing the basis for The Rutles, Rutland Weekend Television also spawned its own LP and book. =AlbumBook= The Rutland Dirty Weekend Book by Eric Idle, 1976 A dense and lavishly illustrated parody of the Television, films and print media of the mid-1970s. The book has an issue of \\"Rutland Stone\\" bound inside. The back page of this issue carries a full-page advertisement for The Rutles' latest album (\\"Finchley Road\\"), a single (\\"Ticket To Rut\\"), and an assortment of Rutles merchandise. The book also contains the \\"Vatican Sex Manual\\" featuring pictures of Eric Idle in various positions in which it is impossible to have sex. =DVD= Despite many requests, none of the episodes has been released on DVD ‚Äì the show has complicated rights issues, belonging in principle both to the BBC and Idle. Innes claimed that Idle has no interest in seeing the series released, as it reminds him of an unhappy time in his life.

The organisation has historically been closely allied to the Movement for Democratic Change, but in 2013, became a political party of its own after rejecting the constitution written by the Government of National unity between MDC-T and ZANU - PF.  History  The National Constitutional Assembly (NCA) was founded in 1997, and officially launched in 1998 at the University of Zimbabwe, by Zimbabwean individual citizens and civic organisations, amongst which were trade unions, opposition parties, student groups, women‚Äôs groups, representatives of the informal sector, and church groups. The NCA was inspired by the popular uprising of the 1990s, and came to see the present constitution as an ideal umbrella cause in pursuing an array of political, social and economical causes. The constitution was seen by the NCA as particularly problematic in that it allowed too much power to be vested in the hands of the president, as well as it being a product of the outgoing British colonial administration, where several clauses have expired because they were only meant to be utilized for a certain number of years.  NCA as an organisation  The aims of the NCA are to help bring about the initiation of an inclusive and broad-based constitution-making process in Zimbabwe ; to foster, protect and deepen a culture of human rights and respect for the rule of law in Zimbabwe and to implement, incorporate and protect human rights. NCA carries out grassroots campaigns, informing people about rights-related issues such as the need for an inclusive, broad-based constitution; facilitates debates; organises meetings, seminars and debate workshops; issues public statements; monitors legal, political and social developments in Zimbabwe; publishes reports on human-rights related topics such as the plight of women in Zimbabwe; and engages in local and international networking. NCA also organises demonstrations and civic education. The campaigns and other activities of the NCA have seemingly resulted in a more widespread awareness of constitutional issues among the Zimbabwean population. The NCA has five branches: The Congress (legislative branch), the Annual Consultative Assembly (executive branch), the National Task Force, the Region, and the constituency. The Annual Consultative Assembly is the supreme governing organ of the NCA. The NCA changed its original structure in 2006, from having an Annual General Meeting (AGM) as its major decision-making entity, to having a Congress. The congress meets every 5 years, and is made up of representatives from the various constituencies of the NCA, chairpersons, secretaries, youth representatives, women‚Äôs representatives and committee members. The Task Force of the NCA is akin to an executive committee or board, and deals with the decision-making process in-between congresses, based on annual consultative assemblies. The institutional members of the NCA are composed of other organisations, such as political parties and woman‚Äôs-, youth- and students‚Äô organisations. NCA also has many individual members. Membership fees have recently been suggested as a source of income ‚Äì one has generally been able to become a member by simply filling out a form. The organisation is believed to have a support base of up to 500.000 individuals, although this number includes MDC structures, as there is no national membership database.http://www.norad.no/en/Tools+and+publications/Publications/Publication+Page?key=153337http://www.idasa.org.za/gbOutputFiles.asp?WriteContent=Y&RID;=2830http://www.africafiles.org/article.asp?ID=23281  References External links * New website * How do we solve Zimbabwe's problems?, interview with former NCA national director, Ernest Mudzengi Category:Organisations based in Zimbabwe ","title":"National Constitutional Assembly"},{"id":"1634914","text":"Kirby's Dream Land 2 is a side-scrolling platforming video game developed by HAL Laboratory and published by Nintendo for the Game Boy handheld video game console. It was released in Japan on March 21, 1995, and in North America on May 1, 1995. It was released in Europe on July 31, 1995. Kirby's Dream Land 2 continues the adventures of Kirby from Kirby's Dream Land and Kirby's Adventure, adding three animal friends to aid Kirby in battle. It can be played on the Super Game Boy, and gives slight changes to the game, such as adding a custom color scheme, a special game border, and a few new sound effects. Kirby's Dream Land 2 was slated to be remade for the Game Boy Color as Kirby's Dream Land 2 DX, but was cancelled along with Metroid II: Return of Samus DX. The original game was re-released on the 3DS Virtual Console in Japan on February 15, 2012, in PAL regions on May 17, 2012, and in North America on August 1, 2013. Kirby's Dream Land 2 is also included in the Kirby 20th Anniversary Wii disc Kirby's Dream Collection. Plot The plot follows Kirby, a resident of Dream Land. The Rainbow Bridges that connect the seven Rainbow Islands have been stolen by an evil force called Dark Matter, who has possessed King Dedede, intent on conquering Dream Land. Kirby sets out to defeat Dark Matter, accompanied by three new animal friends. After traveling through seven different islands, Kirby reaches the possessed King Dedede and defeats him. If the player had previously collected all seven Rainbow Drops from each of the islands, they form into the Rainbow Sword and exorcise Dark Matter from the defeated Dedede. Holding the mystic object, Kirby follows Dark Matter in a final showdown. He defeats Dark Matter and uses the sword to create a new rainbow, thus restoring peace to Dream Land. Gameplay Kirby swimming with Kine in the second stage in Ripple Field Kirby's Dream Land 2, like previous Kirby titles, is a platforming video game. Kirby is able to walk, swim, and fly throughout a variety of levels, using several allies and enemy powers in order to reach the goal at the end of each level. However, a variety of obstacles lie in his path. These obstacles range from pits to enemies. If Kirby touches an enemy, touches a dangerous obstacle, or is hit by an enemy's attack, Kirby will lose one bar of health (out of six total health points). Kirby can recover lost health by eating food. If all of his health is lost, or he falls off the bottom of the screen, the player loses a life. Losing all lives gives the player a game over. Kirby's basic abilities include running, jumping, flight, swimming, and inhaling. Flight involves inhaling air (Up button), followed with the press of the jump button which will make Kirby fly. By continuously pushing the jump button, Kirby can reach any height (unless something prevents him from reaching that height). At any time when Kirby has inhaled air, he can exhale by either landing on the ground or you can also release it yourself. When the air is released, Kirby will exhale a puff of air, which can be used to damage enemies or destroy blocks. Inhaling objects, enemies, and food is the trademark ability of Kirby's. To inhale anything, the player must hold down the B button. Kirby can then indefinitely inhale, and if an enemy, object, or food is in range, Kirby will eat it. When food is inhaled, it is automatically swallowed and will heal Kirby if he has any damage. When Kirby inhales an enemy or object, it remains in his mouth. At this point, Kirby can shoot them out as a star (causing damage to anything in its path), or simply swallow them. When certain enemies are swallowed, Kirby will gain their ability, such as ice breath or the ability to turn into stone. Kirby's Dream Land 2 introduces the animal friends, three new allies that Kirby can ride to aide him in his adventure: Rick the hamster, who runs faster, and doesn't slip on ice; Coo the owl, who can fly quickly even through harsh winds, and allows Kirby to inhale while flying; and Kine the ocean sunfish, who can swim through waters with ease even against currents (although he performs poorly on land), and with whom Kirby can inhale underwater. Whenever Kirby is aided by an animal friend, his current power is altered. For example, if Kirby has the Spark ability, riding on Rick will change it to the Beam attack from Kirby's Adventure while Coo will allow Kirby to shoot down a lightning bolt from the sky and Kine lets Kirby shoot light bulbs at his enemies. Presentation Like Kirby's Dream Land, Kirby's Dream Land 2s visuals are grayscale and two-dimensional. However, when played on the Super Game Boy, there is a special border with Kirby's animal friends, and the graphics are drawn in limited color. For example, each stage has a color theme, such as \\"Grass Land\\" being yellowscale, \\"Big Forest\\" being greenscale, etc. The world map gets more colors (each \\"land\\" is its respective color, and the sky is blue with white clouds. Also, the in-level status bar has its own separate color scheme. Also, the ending sequence has a unique color palette that makes use of as many colors as the Super Game Boy would allow, such as Kirby painting a rainbow. There are some special sound effects added using the Super Nintendo's sound chip as well. On the game start screen, the sound of applause plays; on the stage select screen, gusts of wind blow; and on the final stage, the sound of thunder booming plays. Unlike the original Kirby's Dream Land, Kirby's Dream Land 2 is composed by both Hirokazu Ando and Tadashi Ikegami, both regular composers for HAL Laboratory. Reception Kirby's Dream Land 2 sold more than a million units. On release, Famicom Ts≈´shin scored the Game Boy version of the game a 29 out of 40.NEW GAMES CROSS REVIEW: Êòü„ÅÆ„Ç´„Éº„Éì„Ç£2.

Electronic Gaming Monthly's four reviewers had varying reactions to the game, but gave it a unanimous recommendation based chiefly on the solid graphics and the wide variety of abilities which Kirby can acquire. They scored it a 7.625 out of 10. GamePro likewise praised Kirby's many abilities. Though they complained that the game recycles too much content from the original Kirby's Dream Land, they concluded that \\"While not everything is new in Dream Land 2, everything is definitely fun. Nintendo Power listed it as the tenth best Game Boy/Game Boy Color video game, praising it for adding the ability to gain new powers by eating enemies.

It lies on the R702 regional road. Borris has views of the neighbouring countryside with Mount Leinster and the Blackstairs Mountains to the east, and the Barrow Valley to the west. It is the home to Borris House, the ancestral home of the MacMurrough Kavanaghs. Amenities The town has one of the oldest golf courses in Ireland as well as a 16-arch limestone viaduct (the 16 Bridges) built in 1860 and designed by William le Fanu. It has a mixed national school and vocational school (colloquially known as \\"The Tech\\" or \\"BVS\\"), a Roman Catholic church, seven public houses, three take- aways, and three convenience stores (Cosgraves/Costcutters, O'Sheas/Centra and Borris Service Stn.). The old school closed in 1980 and has been used by different community groups including Scouting Ireland, which has a branch of Scouts, Cubs and Beavers there. It also houses CRISP (Carlow Rural Information Services Project). Recently a branch of Carlow County Library has opened in the old school buildings. Between the Library and CRISP, there is a Tourism Information Point. Borris House has catered for weddings and held poetry readings and concerts (Mary Coughlan, Mundy) and a \\"Christmas at the Castle\\" event in December 2011. It also played host to the National Country Fair in 2012. Borris House also holds a writing festival every summer. History The MacMurrough Kavanagh dynasty, former Irish Kings of Leinster, have been based in the town for some time. The family still live at Borris House in the town centre. Built in Tudor style, the house is open to groups by prior arrangement. Main Gate to Borris House on Borris Main Street The town prospered in the late 1800s as Arthur MacMorrough Kavanagh, the landlord of the time, developed a sawmill and a lace-making industry. He also instigated the building of the 16-arch viaduct, situated at the lower end of the town, which was intended to carry the now defunct Great Southern and Western Railway line between Muine Bheag and Wexford. Borris railway station opened on 20 December 1858, closed for passenger traffic on 2 February 1931 and for goods traffic on 27 January 1947, finally closing altogether on 1 April 1963. Housing developments in the area include Lodge Court, Woodlawn Park, Oak Tree Court, and Station Road. Borris Church O'Sheas Shop and Bar on Main Street Sports and clubs Borris is home to Mount Leinster Rangers GAA Club, which was founded in 1988 with the amalgamation of 3 parish teams: Borris, Ballymurphy and Rathanna. In 2006 the club won its first senior hurling championship, beating St. Mullins in the final, and repeated the achievement again in 2007, beating the same opposition in the final. The club also won its first Leinster Intermediate Championship Title beating Celbridge in the final. Following a semi-final victory over Robert Emmets (London), the club reached their first All-Ireland final. The final was against Middleton Na Fianna from Armagh in Croke Park, with Rangers claiming their first ever All-Ireland Intermediate Hurling Title in game that finished 1-13 to 1-11. 3rd Carlow Borris Scout group was founded in 1983 and has won the national camping competition (Smythe Cup) on 3 occasions.

The factory produced British military rifles, muskets and swords from 1816. It closed in 1988, but some of its work was transferred to other sites.  History  The RSAF had its origins in a short-lived Royal Manufactory of Small Arms established in Lewisham in 1807. (The site in Lewisham was a mill where armour had been made since the fourteenth century; following its purchase by Henry VIII in 1530, it became known as the Royal Armoury Mills and served his armoury in Greenwich.) During the Napoleonic War, the increasing demand for large quantities of reliable weapons prompted the Board of Ordnance to look into building a new factory on a larger site. = Foundation = The factory was to be located at Enfield Lock on a marshy island bordered by the River Lea and the Lee Navigation. The land was acquired in 1812 and the factory completed by 1816.Pam, David, (1998). The Royal Small Arms Factory Enfield & Its Workers. Enfield: Published by the author. . The site had the advantages of water-power to drive the machinery and the River Lea Navigation for the transportation by barge of raw materials and finished weapons to the River Thames, 15 miles away to be loaded onto sailing ships. Neighbouring farmland was acquired to become a restricted area to test ordnance from the Royal Gunpowder Mill. The RSAF was originally all situated on the east side of the Lea, in the county of Essex in Waltham Abbey parish, Sewardstone hamlet. The course of the river was diverted during the life of the factory, and part of the site then fell in Enfield parish. Local boundary changes initiated by SI 1993/1141 after it closed transferred the site entirely from Epping Forest (district) to the London Borough of Enfield. The original ambitious plans by Captain John By included three mills. Later, the engineer John Rennie recommended the construction of a navigable leat. The leat was made, although only one mill with two waterwheels was completed. In 1816 the barrel branch was transferred from Lewisham; and by 1818 the lock and finishing branches had been moved to the site, enabling the closure of the Lewisham factory. A sword-making department was set up in 1823. = The Crimean War = The factory fought off the threat of closure in 1831; and remained quite modest in size until the Crimean War of 1853/1856, which resulted in vastly increased production. By 1856 a machine shop was built on American mass-production lines, using American machinery powered by steam engines. The shop was based on a design by John Anderson and built by the Royal Engineers. The workforce increased to 1000, and by 1860 an average of 1,744 rifles were produced per week. In 1866 another major expansion took place, when the watermill gave way to steampower. The total number of steam engines grew to sixteen; and by 1887 there were 2,400 employees.

The famous Lee‚ÄìEnfield rifle was designed in 1895. = 20th century = The factory expanded again in World War I; and in World War II. Two other Royal Ordnance Factories were set up in World War II to manufacture rifles designed at RSAF Enfield, and hence to increase arms output in areas less vulnerable to bombing: ROF Fazakerley and ROF Maltby. Both of these have long been closed. Decline set in after World War II; and in 1963 half the site was closed. The Royal Small Arms Factory was privatised in 1984 along with a number of Royal Ordnance Factories to become part of Royal Ordnance Plc; and was later bought by British Aerospace (BAe). They closed the site in 1988.  The significance of RSAF Enfield  The factory was set up because of disappointment with the poor quality and high cost of the existing British weapons used in the Napoleonic Wars. At this time in Britain, individual components were made mainly in the Gun Quarter, Birmingham by a number of independent manufacturers and then hand-assembled to produce rifles. These component makers eventually combined to become the Birmingham Small Arms Company. The Enfield factory was intended to improve the quality and to drive down costs.  Weapons designed / built at RSAF Enfield  Almost all the weapons in which the Royal Small Arms Factory had a hand in design or production carry either the word Enfield or the letters EN in their name; US Marine firing the L1A1 rifle *Enfield Pattern 1853 Rifle-Musket which used the Mini√© ball ammunition. *Snider‚ÄìEnfield Rifle: an 1866 breech-loading version of the 1853 Enfield. *Martini‚ÄìHenry Rifle: breech-loading lever activated rifle, manufactured from 1871-1891. *Enfield revolver: standard issue sidearms, two main versions from 1880 to 1957. *Martini‚ÄìEnfield: a conversion of the Martini‚ÄìHenry rifle to .303 calibre, from 1895. *Lee‚ÄìEnfield rifles - using the Lee bolt action.

For weapons manufactured at Enfield before 1853, see British military rifles#Early Enfield rifles The RSAF, Enfield, was famous for its Pattern Room which was a collection, or master set, of every weapon made at RSAF Enfield.(N/A) (1973). \\"Preservation: Royal Small Arms Pattern Room\\". In: After the Battle, 2, (Pages 42 - 43). . After closure this collection was moved to ROF Nottingham; which has since closed. The collection is now held at the Royal Armouries Museum, Leeds.  Closure and reuse of the site  RSAF Interpretation centre Local government boundary changes meant that the majority of the site was now within the London Borough of Enfield. The necessary outline planning permissions were obtained for site redevelopment; making closure of the site attractive to its new owners. Closure was announced on 12 August 1987, shortly after privatisation as Royal Ordnance, and the site closed in 1988; the machinery was auctioned off in November 1988. BAe then formed a joint venture with the property company Trafalgar House to redevelop the site. The majority of the site is now covered by a large housing development called Enfield Island Village. The original machine shop frontage and the older part of the rear structure has been retained and was converted into workshops and retail units by the Enfield Enterprise Agency, making use of European Union (ERDF) funding.

History In 1984 Carfax was founded in Columbia, Missouri, by a computer professional named Ewin Barnett III working together with Robert Daniel Clark, an accountant from Huntingdon, Pennsylvania. The company is now headquartered in Centreville, Virginia, with a data center operation in Columbia, Missouri. Barnett was initially trying to combat odometer fraud. By working closely with the Missouri Automobile Dealers Association, in 1986 he offered the early version Carfax vehicle history report to the dealer market. These reports were developed with a database of just 10,000 records and were distributed via fax machine. By the end of 1993, Carfax obtained title information from nearly all fifty states. In December 1996, the company's website was launched to offer consumers the same vehicle history reports already available to businesses. In the fall of 1999, Carfax became a wholly owned subsidiary of R.L. Polk & Company.Town and Country Auto Sales website In 2013, IHS acquired Polk and Carfax, which added to its Automotive offerings.. IHS Completes Three Strategic Acquisitions. In 2013, Carfax introduced a free service to help vehicle owners keep their cars well maintained ‚Äì myCARFAX. Car owners can track their service history, receive automatic service alerts and get critical information about open safety recalls reported for their car. In March 2016 IHS had a merger of equals with Markit, and in July of that year became IHS Markit. A similar company with the same name operated in New Zealand in 2007 and 2008 when they changed their name to Carjam Online Limited.  Products and services  CARFAX offers several free products and services and charges a fee for more comprehensive reports. =Free products and services= In 2013, CARFAX launched a new free service called myCARFAX. The service provides free access to vehicle service information reported to the company and alerts users to recommended maintenance. The company offers four vehicle research services‚ÄîLemon Check, Record Check, Recall Check, and Problem Car. While these services are helpful, they do not contain all of the information provided in a full CARFAX vehicle history report. The company also provides Car Safety and Reliability Ratings, which provides access to reviews and other data from sources such as the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, J.D. Power and Associates, IntelliChoice and others. =Vehicle history reports= The CARFAX Vehicle History Report is the company's core product. Users purchase either a single report or create an account for building multiple reports for different vehicles, allowing consumers to utilize CARFAX over a period of time as they search for a vehicle. Additionally, buyers can request CARFAX reports for free from auto dealers who offer CARFAX service, and some automakers routinely provide CARFAX reports as part of their pre-owned vehicle programs.Legacy Owners Association, \\"Carfax Expands Relationship with Subaru,\\" July 27, 2007,Ad Hoc News \\"Saturn Selects Carfax for Certified Pre-Owned Program\\" November 16, 2007 =myCARFAX= In early 2012 the company launched a new service which uses service information reported to CARFAX to help vehicle owners with things like oil changes and routine vehicle maintenance. The service was later expanded to include alerts about open safety recalls issued by vehicle manufacturers. Vehicle owners who are interested in having service information included on their CARFAX Vehicle History Report can find local service shops who will report them to CARFAX. = CARFAX Used Car Listings = In April 2014, CARFAX introduced another free service called CARFAX Used Car Listings (UCL). The new service gives used car shoppers the opportunity to search for used cars using make, model, and a vehicle's history. For example, consumers may search for vehicles with \\"no reported accident\\" or \\"service records\\". Information sources CARFAX claims to have access to twenty billion records from more than 100,000 sources, including motor vehicle departments for all 50 U.S. states and all 10 Canadian provinces. The company's information sources include U.S. state title and registration records, auto and salvage auctions, Canadian motor vehicle records, rental and fleet vehicle companies, consumer protection agencies, state inspection stations, extended warranty companies, insurance companies, fire and police departments, manufacturers, inspection companies, service and repair facilities, dealers and import/export companies. CARFAX lists only information that is reported to them and consumers should not take this report to be a complete accident history. Not all accidents are disclosed and CARFAX uses the language \\"no accidents have been reported to CARFAX,\\" the emphasis being on \\"reported\\". Consumers should not rely on CARFAX alone when checking out a used vehicle. Although CARFAX continuously expands its database and resources, some information is not allowed to be provided. Under the 1994 U.S. Drivers Privacy Protection Act, personal information such as names, telephone numbers and addresses of current or previous owners are neither collected nor reported. CARFAX does not have access to every facility and mistakes are sometimes made by those who input data. In the event information is disputed but cannot be verified, CARFAX allows consumers and dealerships to add information to its reports. Class action lawsuit In a 2006 class action lawsuit, the plaintiff claimed that CARFAX violated consumer protection laws by not disclosing the limitations of their service, specifically their inability to check accident records in 23 states in the U.S. while stating that their database contains information from all 50 states. The lawsuit was settled in May 2007 in the Trumbull County Common Pleas Court in Warren, Ohio. CARFAX spokesman Larry Gamache said more than 10 million consumers were affected. The company asserts that it has major accident information from all 50 states and it backs up its claim with a buyback guarantee. The settlement in the West v. CARFAX, Inc lawsuit was overturned, not on the merits of the issue, but on the terms of the settlement which did not offer enough to the affected consumers and because \\"not enough consumers were notified and the judge should not have agreed to the settlement without knowing more about what it would cost CARFAX.

The term can refer to new stories or songs made up, or to folklore that is reworked and modified for modern tastes. The element of misrepresentation is central; artists who draw on traditional stories in their work are not producing fakelore unless they claim that their creations are real folklore. Over the last several decades the term has generally fallen out of favor in folklore studies because it places an emphasis on origin instead of ongoing practice to determine authenticity. The term fakelore was coined in 1950 by American folklorist Richard M. Dorson. Dorson's examples included the fictional cowboy Pecos Bill, who was presented as a folk hero of the American West but was actually invented by the writer Edward S. O'Reilly in 1923. Dorson also regarded Paul Bunyan as fakelore. Although Bunyan originated as a character in traditional tales told by loggers in the Great Lakes region of North America, James Stevens, an ad writer working for the Red River Lumber Company, invented many of the stories about him that are known today. According to Dorson, advertisers and popularizers turned Bunyan into a \\"pseudo folk hero of twentieth-century mass culture\\" who bore little resemblance to the original.Dorson (1977), 214‚Äì226. Folklorism also refers to the invention or adaptation of folklore. Unlike fakelore, however, folklorism is not necessarily misleading; it includes any use of a tradition outside the cultural context in which it was created. The term was first used in the early 1960s by German scholars, who were primarily interested in the use of folklore by the tourism industry. However, professional art based on folklore, TV commercials with fairy tale characters, and even academic studies of folklore are all forms of folklorism. Controversy The term fakelore is often used by those who seek to expose or debunk it, including Dorson himself, who spoke of a \\"battle against fakelore\\". Dorson complained that popularizers had sentimentalized folklore, stereotyping the people who created it as quaint and whimsical ‚Äì whereas the real thing was often \\"repetitive, clumsy, meaningless and obscene\\". He contrasted the genuine Paul Bunyan tales, which had been so full of technical logging terms that outsiders would find parts of them difficult to understand, with the commercialized versions, which sounded more like children's books. The original Paul Bunyan had been shrewd and sometimes ignoble; one story told how he cheated his men out of their pay. Mass culture provided a sanitized Bunyan with a \\"spirit of gargantuan whimsy [that] reflects no actual mood of lumberjacks\\". Daniel G. Hoffman said that Bunyan, a folk hero, had been turned into a mouthpiece for capitalists: \\"This is an example of the way in which a traditional symbol has been used to manipulate the minds of people who had nothing to do with its creation.\\" Others have argued that professionally created art and folklore are constantly influencing each other, and that this mutual influence should be studied rather than condemned. According to Newall, 133, the German folklorist Hermann Bausinger expressed a similar view. For example, Jon Olson, a professor of anthropology, reported that while growing up he heard Paul Bunyan stories that had originated as lumber company advertising.Olson, 235. Dorson had seen the effect of print sources on orally transmitted Paul Bunyan stories as a form of cross-contamination that \\"hopelessly muddied the lore\\". For Olson, however, \\"the point is that I personally was exposed to Paul Bunyan in the genre of a living oral tradition, not of lumberjacks (of which there are precious few remaining), but of the present people of the area.\\" What was fakelore had become folklore again. Examples In addition to Paul Bunyan and Pecos Bill, Dorson identified the American folk hero Joe Magarac as fakelore. Magarac, a fictional steelworker, first appeared in 1931 in a Scribner's Magazine story by the writer Owen Francis. He was a literal man of steel who made rails from molten metal with his bare hands; he refused an opportunity to marry in order to devote himself to working 24 hours a day, worked so hard that the mill had to shut down, and finally, in despair at enforced idleness, melted himself down in the mill's furnace in order to improve the quality of the steel. Francis said he heard this story from Croatian immigrant steelworkers in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; he reported that they told him the word magarac was a compliment, then laughed and talked to each other in their own language, which he did not speak. The word actually means \\"donkey\\" in Croatian, and is an insult. Since no trace of the existence of Joe Magarac stories prior to 1931 has been discovered, Francis's informants may have made the character up as a joke on him. In 1998, Gilley and Burnett reported \\"only tentative signs that the Magarac story has truly made a substantive transformation from 'fake-' into 'folklore, but noted his importance as a local cultural icon. Other American folk heroes that have been called fakelore include Old Stormalong, Febold Feboldson, Big Mose, Tony Beaver, Bowleg Bill, Whiskey Jack, Annie Christmas, Cordwood Pete, Antonine Barada, and Kemp Morgan.American Folklore: An Encyclopedia, ed. Jan Harold Brunvand, Taylor & Francis, 1996, p. 1105 Marshall Fishwick describes these largely literary figures as imitations of Paul Bunyan. Additionally, scholar Michael I. Niman describes the Legend of the Rainbow Warriors ‚Äì a belief that a \\"new tribe\\" will inherit the ways of the Native Americans and save the planet ‚Äì as an example of fakelore.Niman, Michael I. 1997.

It is down the line from London Charing Cross and is situated between and stations. It is in Travelcard Zone 6 and is located next to the Greater London boundary with the Kent district of Sevenoaks. The boundary is the farm bridge at the southern end of the platforms.  Location  The station is north-northeast of the village of Knockholt but closer to several other settlements. The station serves several small communities in the Sevenoaks district in addition to Knockholt; Badgers Mount to the southeast, Well Hill northeast, and Halstead south. Within the Bromley borough Pratts Bottom is only west-southwest; and also Chelsfield (although having its own railway station, is in parts closer to Knockholt station) at about to the north and west. To avoid confusion with Halstead in Essex it was named after the next closest village.  Services  The typical off-peak service from the station is two trains per hour southbound to Sevenoaks and two trains per hour northbound to London Charing Cross, calling at all stations to Hither Green and then running fast to London Bridge. History When the South Eastern Railway (SER) opened their \\"cut off\\" line through Orpington, Sevenoaks to Tonbridge in 1868, there was no station between Chelsfield and Dunton Green. A Knockholt Vestry meeting in March 1871 resolved to request the SER to build a station for Knockholt but this request was initially refused. Eventually, the SER agreed to provide a station if a ¬£3,000 contribution was provided by \\"local parties,\\" (). This was raised and \\"Halstead for Knockholt\\" (the station being much closer to Halstead than Knockholt) was opened in 1876.A History Of Knockholt, pp.128-130, by David Waldron Smithers, . Between 1887 and 1915 a twice daily bus service operated from Knockholt village to the station. In 1899 the SER joined with its arch rival to form the South Eastern and Chatham Railway (SECR). Alfred Smithers, who had moved to Knockholt in 1881, became deputy chairman of the SECR. At the strong suggestion of Smithers, the station name was changed to \\"Knockholt\\" in 1900 to avoid the confusion which had arisen with Halstead Station in Essex (and coincidentally giving Smithers a local station named after his village). Buses The station is served by the route 3 bus, operated by Go Coach which runs Monday-Friday between Orpington and Sevenoaks Town Centres.

Like other true crayfish, A. astacus is restricted to fresh water, living only in unpolluted streams, rivers, and lakes. It is found from France throughout Central Europe, to the Balkan Peninsula, and north as far as parts of the British Isles, Scandinavia and Finland, and Eastern Europe. Males may grow up to 16 cm long, and females up to 12 cm. Ecology Noble crayfish can vary greatly in colour.Peter Scheffel & Bernd Sceiba. Plants and Animals of Central Europe (Pflanzen und Tiere). European crayfish feed on worms, aquatic insects, molluscs, and plants. They are nocturnal, spending the day resting in a burrow. A. astacus become sexually mature after three to four years and a series of moults, and breed in October and November. Fertilised eggs are carried by the female, attached to her pleopods, until the following May, when they hatch and disperse. The main predators of A. astacus, both as juveniles and adults, are mink, eels, perch, pike, otters, and muskrats. Consumption This species was once abundant in Europe, although it was expensive to buy, and is considered to be the finest edible crayfish. It is, however, susceptible to the crayfish plague carried by the invasive North American species signal crayfish (Pacifastacus leniusculus), so is listed as a vulnerable species on the IUCN Red List. Documentation of the consumption of A. astacus dates back to the Middle Ages, when it was popular among the Swedish nobility, spreading to all social classes by the 17th and 18th centuries due to its ready availability. The crayfish are collected from the wild in traps, a practice which is being replaced by more intensive aquaculture of the signal crayfish in man-made ponds. The consumption of crayfish is an important part of traditional Nordic culture, including the crayfish party (; ), a feast to mark the end of summer. Hundreds of smaller or larger lakes were once found in the northern Moldavia, used for growing A. astacus meant for consumption during the extended fasting periods of the Orthodox Christian calendar. The area of the former Dorohoi County was one such area, and this legacy was visible in the county's historical coat of arms, featuring an A. astacus (Rmn. rac). Astacin Astacins are a family of digestive enzymes, discovered in the 1990s, which were first isolated from A. astacus. More than 20 enzymes of this group have since been discovered in animals from Hydra to humans.

Some of Black Library's best known titles include the Gaunt's Ghosts and Eisenhorn series of novels by Dan Abnett and the Gotrek and Felix series by William King and Nathan Long. The authors of these novels, graphic novels, and comics created original storylines and characters that are based on playable armies in the main Warhammer 40,000 game and its many spin-offs (such as Inquisitor or Epic). These works are then promoted with contributions of stories, plot synopses, and rules in the White Dwarf magazine and at the official Games Workshop website. The result is a fusion of tabletop gaming with science fiction and fantasy writing.  History  The publishing company takes its name from the fictional Black Library that appears in the setting of Warhammer 40,000.10th anniversary interview , with Marc Gascoigne The fictional Black Library is where the Eldar race keeps their collected knowledge of Chaos and the Necrons. The Black Library was founded in April 1997 to publish Inferno! magazine, a bi-monthly digest-sized anthology of short stories, comic strips and features from the Warhammer worlds. Black Library began as team at Games Workshop brought together to INFERNO! magazine. Inferno!'s success spawned Warhammer Monthly comic books, and then from September 1999 a lengthy series of fantasy and science fiction novels. Their first art book, Inquis Exterminatus was published in May, 1999. Black Library's catalogue now runs to well over two hundred titles, with a Warhammer and a Warhammer 40,000 novel appearing every month. In October 2003 BL Publishing started a sister imprint, Black Flame, which applied the same pulp styling to novels featuring New Line Cinema characters such as Freddy Krueger and Jason Voorhees, and 2000 AD comics' Judge Dredd and others. In 2006, Black Flame produced the novel for the New Line Cinema's feature film Snakes on a Plane. In the summer of 2005 BL Publishing announced another fiction imprint, Solaris Books, that will publish original science fiction and fantasy. Solaris Books has subsequently been sold to Rebellion who also own Abaddon Books. Background Short stories and other pieces of fiction were created for the White Dwarf magazine, for Warhammer 40,000 rulebooks and gaming guides, for other publications, such as the Citadel Journal, and for each of their official websites. Later, these evolved into larger novels and other works. A series of Warhammer 40,000 comics were first created for the Games Workshop magazine, Warhammer Monthly as short background filler. In 1999, the first miniature and game tie-in was released as a joint project of Warhammer Monthly and its publisher, the Black Library. This model was the bounty hunter Kal Jerico of the \\"Specialist Game\\" Necromunda. Including rules and a certificate of authenticity, the Black Library created many more limited edition miniatures and expanded the small comics into larger collections while adding many new ones. These novels and graphic novels are accompanied by cross-promotional articles that connect the characters from the novels to the Warhammer 40,000 miniatures game. While Warhammer Monthly was discontinued in 2004 (although still listed at the Black Library website), there was a short lived continuation under the title Warhammer Comics. However, with the discontinuation of these magazine projects, the Black Library still continues to produce graphic novels and collections that expand upon the fiction behind the tabletop game. =Gaming with the Black Library= The works produced by the Black Library detail the interactions of the Warhammer 40,000 armies: Chaos Space Marines, Daemonhunters, Dark Eldar, Eldar, Imperial Guard, Necrons, Orks, Space Marines, Tau, Tyranids, and the Witch Hunters. They are collaborated efforts between the authors of the Warhammer 40,000 game rules and the writers of the background. These works expand on the storylines, characters, armies, and organisations discussed in the Codexes. Combined with contributions to White Dwarf magazine of articles, stories, and rules, and miniature lines produced by both Games Workshop and Forge World, they expand upon the fictional world of the original Warhammer 40,000 game and its other companion games. The column \\"Chapter Approved\\" of White Dwarf is a forum for collaborations between authors, model makers, and the rulemakers, allowing for the characters to have their own place amongst Warhammer 40,000 battles. Alongside of the Warhammer 40,000 game was a short-lived game called Warhammer Warriors. The system was created by Rick Priestley and based on the playing style of LostWorlds. Many of the characters released for the miniature game were given rules and a \\"gaming book\\" to be used in playing against others. This series ended before many of the novels were published and production of cross-promotional books was discontinued. =Fiction of the Black Library= Most of the stories take place thousands of years after the fall of the Emperor of Mankind at the hands of his favoured son Horus, once loyal but corrupted by Chaos. Many millennia has passed since then but the Imperium is still at war with the Chaos Space Marines, along with many new enemies. The majority of these stories are written in the perspective of humans, primarily those of the Imperial Guard, the mechanic/scientist-mystics of the Adeptus Mechanicus, the female warriors of the Sisters of Battle, the holy Inquisition, and the superhuman Space Marines, although some have been written from the perspective of corrupt Chaos-worshipping humans, as well as the alien Eldar and Tau races. They span the complete Warhammer 40,000 universe. Novels and short fiction lineThe Inquisition Trilogies= Dan Abnett began a series of trilogies involving the Inquisition, beginning in 2001 with the Eisenhorn trilogy: Xenos, Malleus, and Hereticus. In the omnibus edition, released in 2004, there are two short stories placed between these novels to connect them together. A second trilogy began in 2004, around the time the Eisenhorn omnibus came out, known as the Ravenor trilogy: Ravenor, Ravenor Returned and Ravenor Rogue. The Ravenor omnibus was released in 2009, also with two connecting short stories. Abnett revealed in the foreword to the Ravenor omnibus that he was planning a \\"trilogy of trilogies\\", and the third set, its title confirmed in an interview with Abnett as the Bequin trilogy \\\\- will begin in October 2012 with Pariah: Ravenor Versus Eisenhorn. Plot The Inquisition (The Holy Orders of the Emperor's Inquisition) is an organisation in the fictional Warhammer 40,000 universe. They act as the secret police of the Imperium, hunting down any and all threats to the stability of the God-Emperor's realm. In the first trilogy, the titular character is Inquisitor Gregor Eisenhorn, a member of the Ordo Xenos (a division of the Inquisition devoted to hunting aliens, though they also uphold the Inquisition's creed of prosecuting \\"enemies of the state\\"), as he begins his descent into radicalism and association with daemonhosts and dark sorcery. The second trilogy is focused around Eisenhorn's former student, Inquisitor Gideon Ravenor, also of the Ordo Xenos, as he battles a powerful nemesis and seeks to defeat a conspiracy involving high Imperial officials. The third trilogy will be centred around Alizebeth Bequin, an \\"untouchable\\" (anti-psychic, or psychic blank) who had been a long-time, trusted member of Eisenhorn's inner circle. Warhammer 40,000 gaming Eisenhorn was made as an official model for the Inquisitor spin-off game. Unlike Inquisitors for the main Warhammer 40,000 game, the Inquisitor version of Eisenhorn is equipped with many beyond the normal standard items: he is equipped with a Power Sword, a special \\"rune\\" staff, a \\"duelling\\" pistol, grenades and flak armour. He also has the ability to use telepathy. While the main Warhammer 40,000 games does include two inquisitorial armies (Daemon Hunters and Witch Hunters) official rules for the Alien Hunters of the Ordo Xenos to which Eisenhorn belongs have not been published. Rules for him and Daemonhosts are included in the official Inquisitor rulebook, and generic rules for him and Daemonhosts are included in the Daemonhunters army codex. =Gaunt's Ghosts= Gaunt's Ghosts are currently collected into three \\"sequences\\": The Founding, The Saint, and The Lost. The Founding includes the novels First and Only, Ghostmaker, and Necropolis. The Saint includes the novels Honour Guard, The Guns of Tanith, Straight Silver, and Sabbat Martyr. The Lost includes the novels Traitor General, His Last Command, The Armour of Contempt, and Only in Death,. The planned fourth sequence \\"The Victory\\" includes \\"Blood Pact\\" and \\"Salvation's Reach\\". Plot The Gaunt's Ghosts series follows Colonel- Commissar Ibram Gaunt and the army of Tanith from the creation of the Tanith Regiment of the Imperial Guard and its abandonment of their planet before the destruction of it at the hands of invading Chaos legions. The stories follow the many adventures of the Tanith \\"First and Only\\" regiment as they seek to prove themselves. Things are complicated by dissension against their commander, Gaunt, for not letting them die alongside their brethren at the destruction of their planet. Warhammer 40,000 gaming After the success of Gaunt's Ghosts, lines of Gaunt's Ghosts based miniatures were produced by Games Workshop. Unlike the previous models, these were not limited edition sets. The production covered both the main characters of Abnett's works (like the title character Colonel-Commissar Ibram Gaunt and also created a generic Imperial Guard variant called the Tanith First and Only. Rules were originally published for these miniatures in \\"Chapter Approved\\" column of White Dwarf UK 269/US 268 and later collected in the Chapter Approved edition for 2003. With the creation of the 4th edition Imperial Guard codex, the previous rules for the Tanith First and Only were removed and they were instead a \\"variant\\" army created using \\"doctrine\\" (variations to traditional army rules). While Colonel-Commissar was given specific rules in the Imperial Guard codex, the other special characters, according to the official Games Workshop website, still use the rules presented in Chapter Approved and provide additional modelling types and rules to create more characters based on the Gaunt's Ghost series. =Space Wolves= Space Wolf, by William King, with additions from Sons of Fenris, describes the Space Wolves and Ragnar Blackmane in the Warhammer 40,000 universe. The Space Wolf Omnibus is a collection composed of Space Wolf, Ragnar's Claw, and Grey Hunter. Space Wolf: The Second Omnibus by William King and Lee Lightner contains the novels, Wolfblade, and Sons of Fenris (by Lightner rather than King) and Wolf's Honour. Plot The Space Wolves series follows the history of Ragnar Blackmane, a young warrior who has to prove himself in combat who later becomes a fierce leader of the Space Wolves. Not only does he battle against the enemies of the Imperium, he also battles against their fellow Space Marines, the Dark Angels, which stems from a long time feud about which is the superior army. Warhammer 40,000 gaming Ragnar Blackmane is a special character for the Space Wolves Space Marines army. He is unique in the fact that he has a limited edition promotional model produced by the Black Library and a standard piece produced by Games Workshop. The model produced for the Black Library pits Ragnar Blackmane against the Thousand Sons Chaos Space Marine Madox. Ragnar Blackmane, in the Space Wolves companion codex to the Space Marines army book, is a \\"Wolf Lord\\" ranked Space Marine. He was equipped with a \\"master-crafted\\" bolt pistol, a \\"master-crafted\\" frost blade (a special weapon used by the Space Wolves), grenades, and special clothing/equipment unique to the culture of the Space Wolves (a wolf tooth necklace, a wolf tail, and a wolf pelt). He can be joined with two wolves that accompany him into battle. Alongside of Ragnar Blackmane and the Space Wolves are members of the Imperial Guard army, the legions of the Adeptus Mechanicus, Inquisition, and the Space Marines. Comics and graphic novels lineBloodquest= Bloodquest: Eye of Terror Trilogy, by Gordon Rennie and Colin MacNeil, is a collection of three works titled Bloodquest, Bloodquest: Into the Eye of Terror, and Bloodquest: The Daemon's Mark. The trilogy involves the founding Space Marines chapter, the Blood Angels, as they struggle first against the Orks and then against the armies of Chaos. Plot Captain of the Blood Angels, Leonatos was given a weapon called \\"Encarmine,\\" the \\"Sword of Belarius,\\" as a prize for his prowess as a warrior and for the accomplishments of his men on the battlefield. However, Garshul the Destroyer, an Ork, manages to capture the weapon, causing Leonatos to be dishonoured and then exiled. He wanders with his fellow soldiers as they try to regain their honour by hunting down the sword. This takes them to the world of Eidolon, but they crash land on the wrong side. They are forced to battle the forces of Chaos that control the planet. They must battle against the armies of each Chaos god that control a separate continent in their path so they can finally regain their treasured weapon and their honour so they could be welcomed back once again amongst their brethren. Warhammer 40,000 gaming The GamesDay Golden Daemon Award model of 2001 was a converted \\"Captain Leonatos\\" of Bloodquest, painted by Bobby Wong. Previously, Captain Leonatos was produced as a miniature in 1999 as \\"Blood Angel Captain Leonatos, Commander of the Exile\\". This was in a limited quantity of only 1,000 models sculpted by Mike McVey. Cloten and Lysander, Captain Leonatos's troops, were also produced the same year and titled \\"The Exiles.\\" They came together and were produced in a limited quantity of 500 miniatures sculpted by Mark Bedford. In the Warhammer 40,000 game, Captain Leonatos is a Captain of the Space Marine's army, the Blood Angels. While he, and his men, no longer have \\"canon\\" rules, they can be used as their generic equivalents. Their original rules accompanied the production models. He did not deviate in equipment from that available for a standard Captain, as with his men. Captain Leonatos and his men also paralleled the \\"Eye of Terror\\" Campaign, exploring the \\"Eye\\" before the gaming tournament began. In the Warhammer 40,000 \\"visual combat game\\", Warhammer Warriors, the gaming book Warhammer Warriors #2 was created for Captain Leonatos. He equipped with many Blood Angels based weapons, such as a chainsword, bolt pistol and a flamer, but also has new weapons designed for Warhammer Warriors, like Photon Flares and a Bolt Pistol Hotshot. He deals extra damage and has a strong defense based on his Space Marine power armour. =Daemonifuge= Daemonifuge: Heretic Saint Daemonifuge, originally published in Warhammer Monthly, is a series of Trade Paperbacks about the life of Ephrael Stern, a member of the Adepta Sororitas, and is collected as Daemonifuge: Heretic Saint. The two books of the series are Daemonifuge, by Kev Walker and Jim Campbell, and Daemonifuge: The Lord of Damnation, by Kev Walker, Gordon Rennie, and Karl Richardson. In addition to the original series, a smaller series was released called Daemonifuge: The Screaming Cage. This series was produced in three parts, and reproduces the original series with additional pages added/edited into the original plot. Plot Ephrael Stern was a Seraphim] ranked Sister for the Order of Our Martyred Lady. Mysteriously, she was the sole survivor out of 12,000 that was sent to the planet Parnis in order to battle a daemonic infestation. Inquisitor Silas Hand originally was sent to identify if she was tainted by Chaos and if that was the reason for her survival. While being locked up and awaiting the Inquisitor's arrival, Stern was attacked by possessed individuals. She removed the demons from the individuals, and these actions combined with Silas Hand's investigation's inability to psychically look through her mind and detect traces of daemonic taint upon her lead to no conclusion. Hand was forced to return with her to the planet Parnis in order to figure out her role in the destruction of her Sisters. During the return, their vessel's navigator was possessed by Chaos destroyed their ship the \\"Hammer of Thor.\\" Escaping, both Hand and Stern were able to land upon the surface, but they were the sole survivors. Shortly after landing upon the planet, they were soon confronted the Daemon Q'tlahsi'issho'akshami. Only Stern managed to live through the battle, and she is now hunted by the Ordo Malleus to be brought in for questioning. Only Stern knows what happened to Silas Hand, what happened to the Daemon, and what the forces of Chaos were doing on the planet. Warhammer 40,000 gaming A limited edition of only 1,000 miniatures was released for Daemonifuge. These miniatures were sculpted by Juan Diaz, Mark Harrison & Alex Hedstrom in 2004 and are no longer in production. Portraying Ephrael Stern and Silas Hand on a diorama base and entering into combat against the Daemons of Chaos. In the Warhammer 40,000 game, Ephrael Stern is a Seraphim of the Witch Hunters and Silas Hand is an Inquisitor for the Daemonhunters army.

She could not join a unit with her fellow Sisters or an army containing any Inquisitor besides Silas Hand (with Silas, she counted as a \\"henchman\\". Silas Hand was armed with a bolter (using \\"Psycannon bolts\\", psychically charged weapons used against daemons) and a force field for defense. He could only include Ephrael Stern in his retinue. In the Warhammer 40,000 \\"visual combat game\\", Warhammer Warriors, the gaming book Warhammer Warriors #3 was created for Ephrael Stern. She equipped with many Sisters of Battle-based weapons, such as a powersword, bolter and a flamer, but also has new weapons designed for Warhammer Warriors, like Photon Flares and a Bolt Pistol Hotshot. Ephrael Stern and Silas Hand are also used as part of an introductory article explaining the background of the Witch Hunters army list, called \\"Villainy & Infamy.\\" The article is \\"report\\" produced by an \\"unknown\\" source which describes the history of Silas Hand's investigation from an in-universe perspective. =Lone Wolves= Lone Wolves is a graphic novel by Dan Abnett and Karl Richardson which describes the interactions of Imperial Guard variant and the Space Marines' chapter, the Space Wolves, when fighting the Tyranids. The story is broken into seven parts, \\"The Miracle,\\" \\"Eaters of the Slain\\" Part 1 and 2, \\"Payback\\" Part 1 and 2, and \\"Bloodgeld\\" Part 1 and 2.

Joined by the Space Wolves led by Skold Greypelt, the Slavok 10th are able to stand against constant attacks and perform deeds of heroism. Warhammer 40,000 gaming Sergeant Poul Marlin, Skold Greypelt, an unidentified Space Wolf and a wounded Slovak soldier were produced as a miniature \\"diorama\\" for Warhammer 40,000 in 2003 as \\"Lone Wolves.\\" This was in a limited quantity of only 500 models sculpted by Martin Footitt and Adam Clarke. In the Warhammer 40,000 game, Poul Marlin a sergeant of the Slovok regiment, an Ice World variant of the Imperial Guard army (similar in design and appearance to the established Valhallan Ice Warriors), and Skold Greypelt is a Captain of the Space Marine's army, the Space Wolves. While they, and their men, lack specific additional rules, they follow standard rules for equipment and statistics with the addition of the \\"Xeno hunter: Tyranids\\"/\\"Preferred Enemy: Tyranids\\" trait (Skold and his \\"Lone Wolves\\" are a Space Wolves version of the Ultramarines's special \\"Tyranid War Veterans\\" unit).  Periodicals  From 1997 to 2005, Black Library published Inferno!, a magazine of short stories, artwork, and other features set in the various fictional universes of Games Workshop's fantasy and science fiction games. These initially included Warhammer Fantasy Battle, Warhammer 40,000, and Necromunda, and later added the Mordheim and Gorkamorka settings. From 1998 to 2004, Black Library published the Warhammer Monthly comic book based on the Warhammer Fantasy Battle and Warhammer 40,000 fictional universes. The comics were republished as a series of trade paperback comics. Black Library discontinued the two periodicals because their sales were meagre compared to the novels. In August 2010 Black Library announced that it was releasing a new monthly ezine called Hammer and Bolter. Like Inferno! it contains short stories set in the fictional worlds of Warhammer Fantasy Battle and Warhammer 40,000. The magazine also features interviews with Black Library authors, previews of forthcoming novels, and serialised novels. In the first year of Hammer and Bolter the serialised novel was Phalanx by Ben Counter. In the second year (2011‚Äì12) the serialised novel was Gilead's Curse by Nik Vincent and Dan Abnett.

The band was formed in 1983 by Sa≈°a Lo≈°iƒá, who is the lead singer and songwriter of the group. The band has remained popular with seven albums and more than 1500 concerts worldwide. History In 1981, sixteen-year-old Sa≈°a Lo≈°iƒá, a gymnasium student from Sarajevo, started a band called ≈†evin Orkestar with Srƒëan Kro≈°njar on guitar, Gordan D≈æamonja on bass, and Admir \\"ƒÜera II\\" ƒÜeramida on drums. The following year, the four teenagers changed their name to Plavi Orkestar due to another group called ≈†eve being active in the city at the time. Soon after, Lo≈°iƒá switched schools; moving from the Third Sarajevo Gymnasium to First Sarajevo Gymnasium where he met guitarist Mladen \\"Pava\\" Paviƒçiƒá who already experienced a certain measure of musical prominence having played in a band called Rock Apoteka. In 1981, Paviƒçiƒá appeared at Omladinski festival in Subotica with Super 98 (Rock Apoteka's next incarnation), before switching to pop band Mali Princ, and finally ending up in Pauk where he recorded an album, Mumije la≈æu, released in 1982. Since Pauk was based out of Zavidoviƒái, for teenage Paviƒçiƒá that meant traveling every weekend for band rehearsals, which his parents weren't too keen on and soon persuaded him to quit the group. He then flirted with and filled in with a variety of bands. Though Pava and Lo≈°a hit it off as soon as they met in school, it wasn't until 1983 that Pava joined Lo≈°a's band. The two agreed to do so at a Siluete gig in Sarajevo. As soon as he joined Plavi Orkestar, much more musically experienced Pava arranged for guitarist Kro≈°njar and bassist D≈æamonja to be kicked out of the group, seeing them as not committed and dedicated enough. Before summer 1983, Samir \\"ƒÜera I\\" ƒÜeramida joined on bass as a replacement for D≈æamonja. =Beginning= This is when the group's activity became decidedly more serious and it's generally considered as the band's real beginning. They started appearing as the opening act for big Yugoslav touring bands like Riblja ƒåorba and Leb i Sol, which got them exposure in the country's press. However, the reviews and notices were atrocious, which Lo≈°a took quite hard and for a time even decided to quit music. Still, the enthusiasm among other band members brought him back and he devoted himself to writing pop ballads, most of which were inspired by unrequited love for a girl he was after at the time. During summer 1983, they held a gig at Sarajevo club called Trasa where they got spotted by Laboratorija Zvuka's Bata Vrane≈°eviƒá who noticed their potential, inviting them to Belgrade to record material. In September 1983 as a send-off before going away to serve the army stint, they played another show at Trasa. The next day they were on a train to Belgrade where in Enco Lesiƒá's studio, Druga maca, they recorded three tracks ‚Äî \\"Soldatski bal\\", \\"Goodbye Teens\\", and \\"Suada\\" ‚Äî all of which would become future hits. After this, all four band members left straight to serve in their mandatory Yugoslav People's Army stint. A year later in September 1984, they returned to Sarajevo where their mates from the scene, Zabranjeno Pu≈°enje, were enjoying breakout success with their debut album. Lo≈°a and Pava returned home first, continuing where they left off while waiting for their rhythm section to come back home. However, due to poor gig quality and general malaise, the two got into a row that ended up with Pava quitting the band. Lo≈°a then got in touch with music manager Malkolm Muharem, who previously worked with Elvis J. Kurtovich and His Meteors; the two arranged for the band (though the group strictly speaking didn't even exist at the moment) to record a few more demos in Zagreb with the help of Parni Valjak's Husein Hasanefendiƒá and Rastko Milo≈°ev. While in Zagreb, Lo≈°a managed to get the country's best known record label interested in the group, signing a pre-contract with Jugoton. The event was the catalyst for Pava to return to the band. =Debut album= In early 1985, the band's first album Soldatski bal (Soldier's Ball) was recorded in SIM studio, Zagreb. From this album the band had many hit singles such as \\"Suada\\", \\"Medena curice\\" (Honey Girl), \\"Odlazi nam raja\\" (Our Friends are Leaving), \\"Bolje biti pijan nego star\\" (Being Drunk is Better than Being Old), \\"Goodbye Teens\\", and the title track, \\"Soldatski bal\\". The album's lyrics were based on Lo≈°a's experiences whilst serving in the army. Their second album \\"Smrt Fa≈°izmu\\" (\\"Death to Fascism\\") was another outstanding success for the band, selling over 300,000 copies in Yugoslavia and being certified diamond. This album spawned several hits: \\"Fa, fa fa≈°ista nemoj biti ti (jerbo ƒáu te ja draga ubiti)\\", \\"Puteru Puteru\\", \\"Sava Tiho Teƒçe\\", \\"Zelene su bile oƒçi te\\" and \\"Kad si sam dru≈æe moj\\". In 1989, they returned with the album \\"Sunce na prozoru\\" which was another big hit for the band. It included such hits as \\"Kaja\\", \\"Lovac i ko≈°uta\\" and \\"Proljeƒáe\\". Their 1991 release, Simpatija, would be their last album issued in Yugoslavia prior to its breakup. It included their version of Mamas and Papas hit single \\"California Dreaming\\" (titled \\"Ljubi se Istok i Zapad) which is still a big hit to this day in the post-Yugoslav republics. They were on hiatus until 1998 when they released \\"LongPlay\\" which included the hits \\"Ako su to bile samo la≈æi\\" and \\"Od roƒëendana do roƒëendana\\". After that came the album \\"Infinity\\" released in 1999, which included numerous hit singles like \\"Odlazim\\", \\"Djevojka iz snova\\" and \\"Pijem da je zaboravim\\". \\"Infinity\\" was followed by \\"Sedam\\" in 2012.

The army made a major advance into German-held territory, capturing Krak√≥w, Warsaw and Pozna≈Ñ. The Red Army had built up their strength around a number of key bridgeheads, with two fronts commanded by Marshal Georgy Zhukov and Marshal Ivan Konev. Against them, the German Army Group A, led by Colonel-General Josef Harpe (soon replaced by Colonel-General Ferdinand Sch√∂rner), was outnumbered five to one. Within days, German commandants evacuated the concentration camps, sending the prisoners on their death marches to the west, where ethnic Germans also started fleeing. In a little over two weeks, the Red Army had advanced 300 miles (483 km) from the Vistula to the Oder, only 43 miles (69 km) from Berlin, which was undefended. However, Zhukov called a halt, owing to continued German resistance on his northern flank (Pomerania), and the advance on Berlin had to be delayed until April. Background In the wake of the successful Operation Bagration, the 1st Belorussian Front managed to secure two bridgeheads west of the Vistula river between 27 July and 4 August 1944.Duffy, p. 11 The Soviet forces remained inactive during the failed Warsaw uprising that started on 1 August, though their frontline was not far from the insurgents. The 1st Ukrainian Front captured an additional large bridgehead at Sandomierz (known as the Baranow bridgehead in German accounts), some 200 km south of Warsaw, during the Lvov‚ÄìSandomierz Offensive.Duffy, p. 12 Preceding the offensive, the Red Army had built up large amounts of materiel and manpower in the three bridgeheads. The Red Army greatly outnumbered the opposing Wehrmacht in infantry, artillery, and armour. All this was known to German intelligence. General Reinhard Gehlen, head of Fremde Heere Ost, passed his assessment to Heinz Guderian. Guderian in turn presented the intelligence results to Adolf Hitler, who refused to believe them, dismissing the apparent Soviet strength as \\"the greatest imposture since Genghis Khan\\".Beevor, pp. 6, 7 Guderian had proposed to evacuate the divisions of Army Group North trapped in the Courland Pocket to the Reich via the Baltic Sea to get the necessary manpower for the defence, but Hitler forbade it. In addition, Hitler commanded that one major operational reserve, the troops of Sepp Dietrich's 6th Panzer Army, be moved to Hungary to support Operation Fr√ºhlingserwachen. The offensive was brought forward from 20 January to 12 January because meteorological reports warned of a thaw later in the month, and the tanks needed hard ground for the offensive. It was not done to assist American and British forces during the Battle of the Bulge, as Stalin chose to claim at Yalta. Forces involved Disposition of forces and advance of the Soviet Army =Red Army= Two Fronts of the Red Army were directly involved. The 1st Belorussian Front, holding the sector around Warsaw and southward in the Magnuszew and Pu≈Çawy bridgeheads, was led by Marshal Georgy Zhukov; the 1st Ukrainian Front, occupying the Sandomierz bridgehead, was led by Marshal Ivan Konev. Zhukov and Konev had 163 divisions for the operation with a total of: 2,203,000 infantry, 4,529 tanks, 2,513 assault guns, 13,763 pieces of field artillery (76 mm or more), 14,812 mortars, 4,936 anti-tank guns, 2,198 Katyusha multiple rocket launchers, and 5,000 aircraft.Duffy pp. 24, 25 Deployments * 1st Belorussian Front (Marshal Georgy Zhukov) ** 47th Army (Franz Perkhorovich) ** 1st Polish Army (General Stanislav Poplavsky) ** 3rd Shock Army (Nikolai Simoniak) ** 61st Army (Pavel Alexeyevich Belov) ** 1st Guards Tank Army (Mikhail Katukov) ** 2nd Guards Tank Army (Semyon Bogdanov) ** 5th Shock Army (in Magnuszew bridgehead) (Nikolai Berzarin) ** 8th Guards Army (in Magnuszew bridgehead) (General Vasily Chuikov) ** 69st Army (in Pu≈Çawy bridgehead) (Vladimir Kolpakchi) ** 33rd Army (in Pu≈Çawy bridgehead) (Vyacheslav Tsvetayev) * 1st Ukrainian Front (Marshal Ivan Konev) ** 21st Army (Dmitry Gusev) ** 6th Army (Vladimir Gluzdovsky) ** 3rd Guards Army (Vasily Gordov) ** 13th Army (Nikolai Pukhov) ** 4th Tank Army (Dmitry Lelyushenko) ** 3rd Guards Tank Army (Pavel Rybalko) ** 52nd Army (Konstantin Koroteyev) ** 5th Guards Army (Aleksey Semenovich Zhadov) ** 59th Army (Ivan Korovnikov) ** 60th Army (Pavel Kurochkin) =Wehrmacht= Soviet forces in this sector were opposed by Army Group A, defending a front which stretched from positions east of Warsaw southwards along the Vistula, almost to the confluence of the San. At that point there was a large Soviet bridgehead over the Vistula in the area of Baran√≥w before the front continued south to Jas≈Ço. There were three Armies in the Group; the 9th Army deployed around Warsaw, the 4th Panzer Army opposite the Baranow salient in the Vistula Bend, and the 17th Army to their south.Web map copy of Ziemke p. 26 The force had a total complement of 450,000 soldiers, 4,100 artillery pieces, and 1,150 tanks.Ziemke, p. 23 Army Group A was led by Colonel-General Josef Harpe (who was replaced, after the offensive had begun, by Colonel-General Ferdinand Sch√∂rner on 20 January).Duffy Order of battle Delegation of German officers arriving to negotiate for the capitulation of Festung Breslau * Army Group A (Colonel-General Josef Harpe to 20 January; then Ferdinand Sch√∂rner) ** 9th Army (General Smilo Freiherr von L√ºttwitz to 20 January; then General Theodor Busse) *** LVI Panzer Corps (General Johannes Block) *** XXXXVI Panzer Corps (General Walter Fries) *** VIII Corps (General Walter Hartmann) ** 4th Panzer Army (General Fritz-Hubert Gr√§ser) *** XLII Corps (General Hermann Recknagel) *** XXIV Panzer Corps (General Walther Nehring)Only two divisions of this corps, the 16th and 17th Panzer Divisions, were allocated to Fourth Panzer Army, where they were committed in the attempted defence of Kielce. The remaining two formations, the 19th and 25th Panzer Divisions constituted Army Group A's general reserve, and were committed in support of 9th Army. *** XLVIII Panzer Corps (General Maximilian Reichsfreiherr von Edelsheim) ** 17th Army (General Friedrich Schulz) *** LIX Corps (General Edgar Rohricht) *** XI Corps (General Rudolf von B√ºnau) *** XI SS Panzer Corps (SS-Obergruppenfuhrer Matthias Kleinheisterkamp) German intelligence had estimated that the Soviet forces had a 3:1 numerical superiority to the German forces; there was in fact a 5:1 superiority.Duffy, pp. 51, 59 In the large Baranow/Sandomierz bridgehead, the Fourth Panzer Army was required to defend from 'strongpoints' in some areas, as it lacked the infantry to man a continuous front line.Sims and Schilling, p. 23 In addition, on Hitler's express orders, the two German defence lines (the Grosskampflinie and Hauptkampflinie) were positioned very close to each other, placing the main defences well within striking range of Soviet artillery.Duffy Offensive The offensive commenced in the Baranow bridgehead at 04:35 on 12 January with an intense bombardment by the guns of the 1st Ukrainian Front against the positions of the 4th Panzer Army.Duffy, p. 67 Concentrated against the divisions of XLVIII Panzer Corps, which had been deployed across the face of the bridgehead, the bombardment effectively destroyed their capacity to respond; a battalion commander in the 68th Infantry Division stated that \\"I began the operation with an understrength battalion [...] after the smoke of the Soviet preparation cleared [...] I had only a platoon of combat effective soldiers left\\".Captain Reinhardt Mueller, interviewed in Sims and Schilling, p. 24 The initial barrage was followed by probing attacks and a further heavy bombardment at 10:00. By the time the main armored exploitation force of the 3rd Guards and 4th Tank Armies moved forward four hours later, the Fourth Panzer Army had already lost up to ‚Öî of its artillery and ¬º of its troops.Hastings, p. 280 The Soviet units made rapid progress, moving to cut off the defenders at Kielce. The armored reserves of the 4th Panzer Army's central corps, the XXIV Panzer Corps, were committed, but had suffered serious damage by the time they reached Kielce, and were already being outflanked. The XLVIII Panzer Corps, on the Fourth Panzer Army's southern flank, had by this time been completely destroyed, along with much of Recknagel's XLII Corps in the north. Recknagel himself would be killed by Polish partisans on 23 January. By 14 January, the 1st Ukrainian Front had forced crossings of the Nida river, and began to exploit towards Radomsko and the Warthe. The 4th Panzer Army's last cohesive formation, the XXIV Panzer Corps held on around Kielce until the night of 16 January, before its commander made the decision to withdraw.

See here for an accurate map. The 1st Belorussian Front, to Konev's north, opened its attack on the German 9th Army from the Magnuszew and Pu≈Çawy bridgeheads at 08:30, again commencing with a heavy bombardment.Duffy, p. 72 The 33rd and 69th Armies broke out of the Pu≈Çawy bridgehead to a depth of , while the 5th Shock and 8th Guards Armies broke out of the Magnuszew bridgehead. The 2nd and 1st Guards Tank Armies were committed after them to exploit the breach. The 69th Army's progress from the Pu≈Çawy bridgehead was especially successful, with the defending LVI Panzer Corps disintegrating after its line of retreat was cut off. Though the 9th Army conducted many local counter-attacks, they were all brushed aside; the 69th Army ruptured the last lines of defence and took Radom, while the 2nd Guards Tank Army moved on Sochaczew and the 1st Guards Tank Army was ordered to seize bridgeheads over the Pilica and attack towards ≈Å√≥d≈∫.Duffy, p. 75 In the meantime, the 47th Army had crossed the Vistula and moved towards Warsaw from the north, while the 61st and 1st Polish Armies encircled the city from the south.Duffy, p. 78 The only major German response came on 15 January, when Hitler (against the advice of Guderian) ordered the Panzerkorps Gro√üdeutschland of Dietrich von Saucken from East Prussia to cover the breach made in the sector of the 4th Panzer Army, but the advance of Zhukov's forces forced it to detrain at ≈Å√≥d≈∫ without even reaching its objective. After covering the 9th Army's retreat, it was forced to withdraw southwest toward the Warthe.Duffy, p. 80 =Taking of Krak√≥w; escape of the XXIV Panzer Corps= On 17 January, Konev was given new objectives: to advance towards Breslau using his mechanised forces, and to use the combined-arms forces of the 60th and 59th Armies to open an attack on the southern flank towards the industrial heartland of Upper Silesia through Krak√≥w. Krak√≥w was secured undamaged on 19 January after an encirclement by the 59th and 60th Armies, in conjunction with the 4th Guards Tank Corps, forced the German defenders to withdraw hurriedly.Duffy, p. 88 The second stage of the 1st Ukrainian Front's objective was far more complex, as they were required to encircle and secure the entire industrial region of Upper Silesia, where they were faced by Schulz's 17th Army. Konev ordered that the 59th and 60th Armies advance frontally, while the 21st Army encircled the area from the north. He then ordered Rybalko's 3rd Guards Tank Army, moving on Breslau, to swing southwards along the upper Oder from 20 January, cutting off 17th Army's withdrawal.Duffy, p. 91 In the meantime, the shattered remnants of the 4th Panzer Army were still attempting to reach German lines. By 18 January, Nehring and the XXIV Panzer Corps found that their intended route northwards had been blocked, so pulled back to the west, absorbing the remnants of XLII Corps that had escaped encirclement.Duffy, p. 82 Much of the remainder of XLII Corps was destroyed after being trapped around Przysucha. Screened by heavy fog, the lead elements of XXIV Panzer Corps reached the Warthe on 22 January, and having linked up with Grossdeutschland Panzer Corps of von Saucken, were finally able to cross the Oder, some from their positions at the start of the Soviet offensive. =Withdrawal of 17th Army from Upper Silesia= On 25 January, Schulz requested that he be allowed to withdraw his 100,000 troops from the developing salient around Katowice/Kattowitz. This was refused, and he repeated the request on 26 January. Schoerner eventually permitted Schulz to pull his forces back on the night of 27 January, while Konev ‚Äì who had allowed just enough room for the 17th Army to withdraw without putting up serious resistance ‚Äì secured the area undamaged.Beevor, p. 60 On Konev's northern flank, the 4th Tank Army had spearheaded an advance to the Oder, where it secured a major bridgehead at Steinau. Troops of the 5th Guards Army established a second bridgehead upstream at Ohlau. =Advance of 1st Belorussian Front= In the northern sector of the offensive, Zhukov's 1st Belorussian Front also made rapid progress, as 9th Army was no longer able to offer coherent resistance. Its XXXVI Panzer Corps, which was positioned behind Warsaw, was pushed over the Vistula into the neighbouring Second Army sector.Duffy, p. 103 Warsaw was taken on 17 January, as Army Group A's headquarters issued orders for the city to be abandoned; units of the 2nd Guards and 3rd Shock Armies entering the city were profoundly affected by the devastation wrought by German forces after the Warsaw Uprising.Duffy, p. 104 Hitler, on the other hand, was furious at the abandonment of the 'fortress', arresting Colonel Bogislaw von Bonin, head of the Operations Branch of OKH, and sacking both the 9th Army and XXXVI Panzer Corps commanders; Generals Smilo Freiherr von L√ºttwitz and Walter Fries. The 2nd Guards Tank Army pressed forward to the Oder, while to the south the 8th Guards Army reached ≈Å√≥d≈∫ by 18 January, and took it by 19 January. The 1st Guards Tank Army moved to encircle Pozna≈Ñ by 25 January, and the 8th Guards Army began to fight its way into the city on the following day, though there was protracted and intense fighting in the Siege of Pozna≈Ñ before the city would finally be taken. To the northeast of Zhukov's 1st Belorussian Front, the lead elements of Marshal Rokossovsky's 2nd Belorussian Front taking part in the East Prussian Offensive had reached the Baltic coast of the Vistula delta by 24 January and so succeeded in isolating Army Group Centre in East Prussia.Ziemke p. 31 On January 27, the abandoned Wolf's Lair - Hitler's former headquarters on the Eastern Front, was captured. =Zhukov's advance to the Oder= Tree carving in Bielinek (Bellinchen), Pomerania, immediately east of the Oder. It reads, in Russian, \\"March 1945, Death to the Germans.\\" After encircling Pozna≈Ñ, the 1st Guards Tank Army advanced deep into the fortified region around the Obra River against patchy resistance from a variety of Volkssturm and Wehrmacht units. There was heavier resistance, however, on the approaches to the fortress of K√ºstrin. The German reorganisation of command structure that resulted in the creation of Army Group Vistula was accompanied by the release of a few extra formations for the defense; the V SS Mountain Corps, with two reserve infantry divisions, was deployed along the Obra and the prewar border fortifications known as the Tierschtigel Riegel, while the Panzergrenadier-Division Kurmark was ordered to reinforce it.Le Tissier, p. 32 On 16 January 1945 Colonel Bogislaw von Bonin, the Chief of the Operational Branch of the Army General Staff (Generalstab des Heeres) gave Army Group A permission to retreat from Warsaw, overruling a direct order from Hitler for them to hold fast. Three days later von Bonin was arrested by the Gestapo and imprisoned first at Flossenb√ºrg concentration camp and then Dachau concentration camp. The officer was eventually liberated along with other prisoners in South Tyrol by the US Army in May 1945. The military historian Earl Ziemke described the advance thus: On 25 January, Hitler renamed three army groups. Army Group North became Army Group Courland; Army Group Centre became Army Group North and Army Group A became Army Group Centre.Ziemke p. 32 The 2nd Guards Tank and 5th Shock Armies reached the Oder almost unopposed; a unit of the 5th Shock Army crossed the river ice and took the town of Kienitz as early as 31 January.Hastings, p. 295 Stavka declared the operation complete on 2 February. Zhukov had initially hoped to advance directly on Berlin, as the German defences had largely collapsed. However the exposed northern flank of 1st Belorussian Front in Pomerania, along with a German counter-attack (Operation Solstice) against its spearheads, convinced the Soviet command that it was essential to clear German forces from Pomerania in the East Pomeranian Offensive before the Berlin offensive could proceed. Liberation of Nazi concentration camps In July of 1944, the Soviet 8th Guards liberated Lublin, and after a brief skirmish with German forces outside the city, came upon the Majdanek concentration camp. Although the Soviets invited press from around the world to witness the horrors of the camp, war news overshadowed the event. After being caught off guard at Majdanek, the Nazis realized that the Soviets would end up finding every camp within Eastern Europe (with all of the prisoners and guards still present) if something were not to be done. As a result, by mid January, the SS and Nazi-controlled police units had begun forcing thousands of camp prisoners from Poland, East Prussia, Silesia and Pomerania to walk westward away from the advancing Red Army. The death marches, which took place over hundreds of kilometers in sub-zero conditions without food and medicine, resulted in thousands of concentration camp prisoners and allied POWs dying en route. It is estimated that in March and April 1945 at least 250,000 men and women were marched on foot to the heartland of Germany and Austria sometimes for weeks at a time.The Holocaust Encyclopedia, The largest death marches, winter of 1944-1945. United States Holocaust Memorial Museum 2015.Yad Vashem, Death Marches. The Holocaust Martyrs and Heroes Remembrance Authority 2015. PDF direct download. On 27 January, troops from Konev's First Ukrainian Front (322nd Rifle Division, 60th Army) liberated the Auschwitz concentration camp. Despite attempts by retreating SS units to destroy parts of the camp, the Soviet forces still found graphic evidence of the Holocaust. The Soviets would also liberate camps such as P≈Çasz√≥w, Stutthof, and Ravensbr√ºck. Flight of ethnic Germans In anticipation of the approaching Red Army, the retreating Wehrmacht left parts of the German territory largely abandoned. With widespread unchecked chaos erupting, numerous reports of looting and attacks against ethnic Germans emerged. Nazi propaganda had furthermore demonized the Soviet Army so much that most Germans attempted to run.Rzheshevsky (2002) Millions of ethnic German refugees fled west to escape the inevitable persecutions, seeking relative safety in central or western Germany, or even in the custody of the American and British west of the Rhine.Beevor, pp. 28, 29, 30‚Äì37, 46‚Äì51 Outcome The Vistula‚ÄìOder Offensive was a major success for the Soviet military. Within a matter of days the forces involved had advanced hundreds of kilometers, taking much of Poland and striking deep within the pre-war borders of the Reich. The offensive broke the back of Army Group A, and much of Germany's remaining capacity for military resistance. However, the stubborn resistance of German forces in Silesia and Pomerania, as well as continuing fighting in East Prussia, meant that the final offensive towards Berlin was delayed by two months, by which time the Wehrmacht had once again built up a substantial force on this axis. Aftermath On 31 January, the Soviet offensive was voluntarily halted, though Berlin was undefended and only approximately away from the Soviet bridgeheads across the Oder river. After the war a debate raged, mainly between Vasily Chuikov and Georgy Zhukov whether it was wise to stop the offensive. Chuikov argued Berlin should have been taken then, while Zhukov defended the decision to stop. The operation was followed by a period of several weeks of mopping-up and consolidation on the part of the Red Army, along with ongoing hard fighting in pockets in the north. On 16 April, the Red Army jumped off from lines on the Oder and Neisse Rivers, the opening phase of the Battle of Berlin, which proved to be the culminating offensive of the war on the Eastern Front. The relatively rapid progress of this new offensive toward the German heartland seems to illustrate the cumulative extent of the erosion of the Wehrmacht's capability to defend a broad front. Nevertheless, they remained dangerous opponents for some weeks longer, especially when allowed or forced to concentrate in limited areas.

The Gangs of New York was later adapted for film as Martin Scorsese's Gangs of New York (2002). However, the film adaptation of Gangs of New York was so loose that Gangs was nominated for \\"Best Original Screenplay\\" rather than as a screenplay adapted from another work.* Timothy J. Gilfoyle, \\"Scorsese's Gangs of New York: Why Myth Matters.\\" Journal of Urban History 29.5 (2003): 620-630. Early life Born in Farmington, Missouri, he was raised in a highly religious family which included several generations of devout Methodist preachers. His great-great uncle was Francis Asbury, the first bishop of the Methodist Church to be ordained in the United States. When he was in his early teens, he and his siblings Mary, Emmett and Fred Asbury became disenchanted with the local Southern Methodist church. During World War I, Asbury enlisted as a private in the United States Army. He was later promoted to sergeant and then to second lieutenant. He served in France until his lungs were severely damaged in a gas attack (as a result, he had health problems throughout his life). He received an honorable discharge in January 1919. H. L. Mencken and The American Mercury Asbury achieved first notoriety with a story that H. L. Mencken published in his magazine, The American Mercury in 1926. The story profiled a prostitute from Asbury's hometown of Farmington, Missouri. The prostitute took her Protestant customers to the Catholic cemetery to conduct business, and took her Catholic customers to the Protestant cemetery; some in Farmington considered this woman beyond redemption. The article caused a sensation: The Boston Watch and Ward Society had the magazine banned. Mencken then journeyed to Boston, sold a copy of his magazine on Boston Common, and was arrested. Sales of the recently founded Mercury boomed, and Asbury became a celebrity. Asbury then focused his attention on a series of articles debunking temperance crusader Carrie Nation. The following year he wrote a biography of Francis Asbury. Later career Herbert continued working as a reporter for various newspapers including The Atlanta Georgian, the New York Sun, the New York Herald and the New York Tribune. In 1928, he decided to devote his time exclusively to writing. During this time, he wrote numerous books and magazine articles on true crime. He was also involved in screenwriting and wrote several plays which appeared on Broadway. None was successful. Asbury married Edith Snyder in 1945, a journalist ultimately employed by The New York Times, where she spent most of her career as a reporter.Fox, Margalit. \\"Edith Evans Asbury, 98, Veteran Times Reporter, Is Dead\\", The New York Times, October 30, 2008; accessed October 31, 2008. After his final book The Great Illusion: An Informal History of Prohibition in 1950, he retired from writing. Asbury died on February 24, 1963 at the age of 73 from a chronic lung disease. Recent years The 2002 film Gangs of New York by director Martin Scorsese about the underworld and civil strife / riots among immigrant groups from the 1840s to the Civil War era revitalized interest in Asbury, and many of Asbury's works, mostly chronicling the largely hidden history of the seamier side of American popular culture, have been reissued.See New General Catalog of Old Books and Authors. In 2008, The Library of America selected an excerpt from The Gangs of New York for inclusion in its two-century retrospective of American True Crime. Although his books have long been popular within the true crime genre, commentators such as Luc Sante, Tyler Anbinder and Tracy Melton have suggested that Asbury took journalistic liberties with his material. However, Asbury's books generally feature lengthy bibliographies, noting the newspapers, books, pamphlets, police reports and personal interviews he drew upon for his works. Most are footnoted, citing source material by publication title, date and page.Gilfoyle, \\"Scorsese's Gangs of New York: Why Myth Matters\\" (2003) In 2005, Tracy Melton claimed in his book Hanging Henry Gambrill: The Violent Career of Baltimore's Plug Uglies, 1854‚Äì1860 that the Plug Uglies were actually a Baltimore-based gang. New York City newspapers compared the Dead Rabbits to the Baltimore Plug Uglies following the July 4, 1857 riots, which occurred just a month after Plug Ugly involvement in the Know-Nothing Riot in Washington, D.C.

The company is officially an auxiliary police force permitted to be armed under regulations from the Police Force Act 2004. Established on 31 March 2004, AETOS began operations following the merger of the Auxiliary Police Forces of PSA Corporation Ltd, Singapore Technologies Kinetics Ltd (ST Kinetics), and subsequently Changi International Airport Services Pte Ltd (CIAS).https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abBK6Lgql4U This brought together the country's security units in maritime, key installations protection and aviation under one roof. It also conducts operations with assistance from Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). HistoryOrigins= AETOS was established on 31 March 2004. Since its establishment, it has merged the Auxiliary Police forces of CIAS, PSA Corporation and ST Kinetics as a result of an amalgamation exercise initiated by Temasek Holdings. In 2007, AETOS participated in a security detail alongside PSA Singapore Terminals, Singapore Police Force and the Ministry of Defence at the Brain Container Terminal to simulate a security situation at the terminal.https://www.freightwaves.com/news/nol-takes-part-in-security-drill- aboard-containership In 2009, AETOS first secured the contract for the Marina Bay Countdown Celebration event. On 13 October 2016, AETOS was acquired by Surbana Jurong, a Singaporean government-owned consultancy company focusing on infrastructure and urban development. On 26 January 2018, the company officially inaugurated its present headquarters at 5 Corporation Drive in Singapore, which was attended by numerous VIPs, including Josephine Teo.https://www.aetos.com.sg/Upload/PressRelease/1/AETOS-New-Headquarters- Champions-SITC-Initiatives.pdf =Post-Origin= Due to the difficulty to recruit Malaysian and Singaporean nationals in the rank of Aetos, the company began to recruit Taiwanese nationals willing to work in Singapore in 2016. Some were deployed to work at land checkpoints alongside Singaporeans in 2018. According to reports from Radio Taiwan International, some Taiwanese nationals refuse to continue working due to the stress in their assigned job posts. In June 2017, the Singapore Police Force (SPF) announced the arrest of two Aetos officers stationed at the Woodlands Checkpoint for planning to go to the Middle East and join ISIL. In January 2018, AETOS announced that its Jurong West office has officially opened, which has a new command centre, indoor shooting ranges and a cash processing centre. In September 2018, AETOS has initiated an investigation on an AETOS officer who was reported to be sleeping while on guard duty. In January 2019, AETOS reported that one of its officers stationed at the Woodlands Checkpoint was found dead with a gunshot wound to the head by SPF officers. In September 2019, AETOS signed a teaming agreement with TRD Singapore to provide countermeasure services against UAVs in Singapore.https://www.aetos.com.sg/Newsroom/18/collaborate-CUAS In November 2019, AETOS signed an agreement with COSEM Safety & Security Services to provide integrated security and safety consultancy services.https://www.aetos.com.sg/Newsroom/19/AETOS-and-COSEM-to-Offer- Industry-First--Integrated-Safety-and-Security-Capabilities According to an AETOS news release, it is scheduled to start by Q1 2020.

Under governmental direction, the uniform was modified to inject distinguishing features between them and that of those worn by officers of the Singapore Police Force to foster a more level playing field with other Auxiliary Police Forces in Singapore. The new uniforms were a new corporate colour, tartan blue, and the material was pure polyester to poly viscose. New buttons and badges on the cap and collars incorporating AETOS's logo were used in place of similar logos to the Singapore Police Force. Given its former affiliation with the Singapore Police Force, AETOS officers wore tartan blue uniform similar in design of the police force when the antecedent auxiliary police forces, PSA Police, STK Police and CIAS Police formed in 1947, 1967 and 1981 respectively. Uniforms were kept similar such that the general public would not be able to tell AETOS officers from regular police officers unless under close scrutiny. The primary distinguishing feature was the tartan top. As a result of several uniform reviews both by the police and SIRD, Auxiliary Police Forces must don uniforms with distinctive differences with their regular counterparts. AETOS retained the old metallic cap badges and collar lapels although they were replaced with embroidered versions in the SPF. AETOS officers also don box caps, depending on the security requirements of the clients and the operating environment.

The Eastern Christian denomination consists of 25 congregations within Ukraine, serving over 2,500 members and runs Saint Sophia Ukrainian Lutheran Theological Seminary in Ternopil in Western Ukraine. The ULC is a member of the Confessional Evangelical Lutheran Conference (CELC), a worldwide organization of confessional Lutheran church bodies of the same beliefs. Beliefs and worship The Ukrainian Lutheran Church uses the Julian calendar for the liturgical year and thus observes feast days and liturgical seasons, such as Great Lent, in a fashion similar to Orthodox customs. Posture during worship, such as bowing, is identical to that in other parts of Eastern Christianity. The calendar of saints used by the Ukrainian Lutheran Church includes persons esteemed in Eastern Christianity, such as John Chrysostom and Nestor the Chronicler, as well as those specific to the Lutheran Church, such as Lucas Cranach the Elder and Martin Luther. The ULC teaches that the Bible is the only authoritative source for doctrine. It subscribes to the Lutheran Confessions (the Book of Concord) as accurate presentations of what Scripture teaches. It teaches that Jesus is the center of Scripture and the way to eternal salvation, and that the Holy Spirit uses the gospel in Word and Sacrament (Baptism, Holy Communion and Confession and Absolution) to bring people to faith in Jesus as Saviour and keep them in that faith, strengthening them in their daily life of sanctification. Ukrainian Lutheran parishes are constructed in accordance with Byzantine architecture. The Ukrainian Lutheran Church uses the Luther Rose with an Orthodox Cross in the centre as its seal. History Ukrainian Lutheran Church of the Cross of the Lord, Kremenets, Ukraine Ukrainian Lutheranism originated in the seventeenth century. In 1933 the Ukrainian Lutheran Liturgy was published, the first Liturgy of Byzantine Rite Lutheranism. The ULC traces its roots to early Lutheranism in the 16th century, and more recently, to the Ukrainian Evangelical Church of the Augsburg Confession which was persecuted by the KGB and Soviet government, which held a policy of state atheism, in 1939. From 1939-1945, many Byzantine Lutheran clergy were martyred for their faith. Theodor Yarchuk, a priest who was a major leader in the Ukrainian Lutheran Church of the Augsburg Confession was tortured and killed in Stanislaviv by communist authorities. Many Ukrainian Lutheran laypersons were also sent to the Gulag, where they died. The ULC was reorganized in 1994 by several Lutheran congregations in Ukraine after the fall of the Soviet Union and the loosening of restrictions on religious expression. It grew into existence through active mission work by the Evangelical Lutheran Synod mission organization \\"Thoughts of Faith\\" in the 1980s and 1990s. The ULC is legally seen as the successor to the earlier church body and has been given the right to reclaim some of the church property that had been seized by the Soviet government. The ULC has been officially registered with the government of Ukraine as a Christian denomination since 1996. Affiliations and ecumenical relations The ULC is a member of the Confessional Evangelical Lutheran Conference (CELC), a worldwide organization of confessional Lutheran church bodies of the same beliefs. The Ukrainian Lutheran Church is a member of the Council of Churches of Ukraine, an ecumenical organisation.

There are many challenges to the traditional definition, which have far-reaching implications in the age of globalization. Definition In traditional usage, a pure global public good is a good that has the three following properties:Kaul, Inge, Isabelle Grunberg and Marc A. Stern (eds.) (1999). Global public goods: international cooperation in the 21st century. NY: Oxford University Press, Inc. (PDF available.) * It is non-rivalrous. Consumption of this good by anyone does not reduce the quantity available to other agents. * It is non-excludable. It is impossible to prevent anyone from consuming that good. * It is available more-or-less worldwide. This concept is an extension of American economist Paul Samuelson's classic notion of public goods See also to the economics of globalization. The traditional theoretical concept of public goods does not distinguish with regard to the geographical region in which a good may be produced or consumed. However, the term \\"global public good\\" has been used to mean a public good which is non-rivalrous and non-excludable throughout the whole world, as opposed to a public good which exists in just one national area. Knowledge has been used as a classic example of a global public good.Joseph E. Stiglitz, \\"Knowledge as a Global Public Good.\\" In Kaul, Inge, Isabelle Grunberg and Marc A. Stern (eds.) (1999). Global public goods: international cooperation in the 21st century. NY: Oxford University Press, Inc. In some academic literature, it has become associated with the concept of a common heritage of mankind.Baslar, Kemal (1998). The Concept of the Common Heritage of Mankind in International Law. Martinus Nijhoff Pubs. Challenges to the traditional definition Significant challenges exist to the classical definition of \\"public goods\\", in general, that are also relevant to the definition of \\"global public goods\\". Kaul et al. (2003), suggest that there are actually three types of public goods.Kaul, Inge et al., (eds.) (2003). Providing Global Public Goods: Managing Globalization. New York: Published for the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) by Oxford University Press. First, there are public goods that cannot be made excludable, either because they are inherently indivisible or because the cost of division would be prohibitive. A simple example would be sunlight. Second, there are goods that are inherently public by design. Examples include a nation's judiciary system or basic education system. A third type, they argue, are goods that are public by default, either due to lack of foresight or knowledge in the design. An example of this type would be the ozone layer and damage done to the environment by chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) emissions before anyone understood the potential for damage. Many of the challenges to traditional definitions have to do with how to handle externalities, which pose fundamental economic policy problems when individuals, households, governments or firms do not include, in their total cost accounting, the indirect costs of or the benefits from their economic transactions.Helbling, Thomas (2010). \\"What Are Externalities?\\" Finance & Development, 47(4). Private goods producers, for example, can lower their total costs, and therefore their prices, by externalizing (not including) certain costs, such as the costs of preventing air or water pollution that is a by-product of their production methods. Such a company, then, becomes a corporate free rider, driving up the cost of the \\"public goods\\" of clean air and water, which are often transnational resources. The transnational nature of such resources points to another problem with a traditional definition of global public goods. Remedies to problems such as air and water pollution are typically legal remedies, and such laws often exist only in the context of geographically-bounded governmental systems. In the case of global public goods‚Äîsuch as climate change mitigation, financial stability, security, knowledge production, and global public health‚Äîeither international or supranational legal entities (both public and private) must be created to manage these goods. As different types of global public goods often require different types of legal structures to manage them, this can contribute to a proliferation of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and intergovernmental organizations (IGOs), such as has been the case in the recent past. Thus, society can modify the non-rivalry and non-excludability of a good's benefits such that goods often become private or public as a result of deliberate policy choices. New consideration in the face of these challenges can expand the definition to recognize that, in many cases, goods exist not in their original forms but as social constructs, largely determined by policies and other collective human actions. Implications At a time when processes of globalization are encompassing increasingly more cultural and natural resources, the ways in which global public goods are created, designed, and managed have far-reaching implications. Issues of globalization, today, are precisely those that are beyond the policy endeavors of states, reflecting a mismatch between the scope of the problem and the authority of decision-making bodies attempting to address such issues.Kaul, Inge (2012). \\"Rethinking public goods and global public goods.\\" Pp. 37-54 in √âric Brousseau, Tom Dedeurwaerdere, and Bernd Siebenh√ºner (eds.), Reflexive Governance for Global Public Goods. Cambridge, MS: The MIT Press. Many goods that might be public by default would be best designated at the policy level as common goods (global-level common-pool resources or global commons), with appropriate regulation, until such time as levels of knowledge, foresight and governing structures might become available to designate such resources as either private or public goods. Although not the only example, no better example can be found than the issue of potable water. Water has always been an important and life-sustaining drink to humans and is essential to the survival of all known organisms. Over large parts of the world, humans have inadequate access to potable water and use sources contaminated with disease vectors, pathogens or unacceptable levels of toxins or suspended solids. Drinking or using such water in food preparation leads to widespread waterborne diseases, causing acute and chronic illnesses or death and misery in many countries.WHO and UNICEF Progress on Drinking-water and Sanitation: 2012 Update , WHO, Geneva and UNICEF, New York. While the global water cycle is the subject of advanced scientific study and observation, it is still an incompletely understood process. If availability of water for human consumption is left solely to market forces, those who are most in need of water for subsistence-level survival are also those least likely to be able to purchase it at a market price. Since the water cycle and the natural flows of fresh water resources do not obey the limits of political boundaries, neither can these water resources be managed solely by local- or national-level public authorities. Privatization of such resources can be used as a method of avoiding contentious public policy-making processes, but is likely to produce inequities. The history of the development of water supply and sanitation in Ecuador and resulting water conflicts there are an example.Terry, Matt (2007).\\"Ecuador's Water Crisis: Damming the Water Capital of the World.\\" International Rivers.Hitz, Julia Apland (2010). \\"The Water Conflict in Ecuador.\\" State of the planet: blogs from the Earth Institute, Columbia University. Thoughtful design of transnational or international water management authorities over such global common-pool resources will play a large part in possible solutions to peak water problems. Moreover, there are a number of global public goods‚Äîor global-level common-pool resources‚Äîthat are necessary conditions for continuing global trade and transactions.Brock, Gillian (2009). Global Justice: a Cosmopolitan Account. NY: Oxford University Press. Even if one takes a position that globalization has more negative impacts than positive, the economic interdependence of national-level economies has reached a kind of point of no return in terms of continued global economic stability. Thus, continuing global trade and transactions require global public goods such as widespread peace, international economic stability, functioning supranational trade authorities, stable financial and monetary systems, effective law enforcement, relatively healthy populations of consumers and laborers, etc.  See also  * Public good * Global commons * Inge Kaul  References Further reading * Barrett, Scott (2007).

He led the Stags to five national championships and 33 Washington Catholic Athletic Conference (WCAC) titles. In 2000, he was the third high school coach to be inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame and the first high school only coach to be inducted. Early life Wootten was born in Durham, North Carolina on April 21, 1931, the son of a United States Navy officer Charles Thomas Wootten, Jr. and grandson of photographer Bayard Wootten. He grew up in Silver Spring, Maryland and attended Gonzaga College High School and Montgomery Blair High School, from which he graduated in 1950. Wootten enrolled at Montgomery College and in 1951 began coaching baseball, football, and basketball at St. Joseph‚Äôs Home and School for Boys, an orphanage in Washington, D.C. He transferred to the University of Maryland, College Park in 1953 and became the junior varsity basketball and football coach at St. John's College High School. He graduated from the University of Maryland in 1956 with degrees in physical education and history. Coaching career In 1956, Wootten was hired as a history teacher and the coach of the football and basketball teams at DeMatha Catholic High School in Hyattsville, Maryland. Led by star player John Austin, the basketball team won its first conference title in 1961 and the national high school championship in 1962. In 1965, Wootten made national headlines when his DeMatha team beat Lew Alcindor's Power Memorial Academy and ended its 71-game winning streak. Although his football teams had won three league titles, Wootten decided to focus on basketball after the 1968 season. He continued to teach world history to every DeMatha freshman until reducing his class load in 1980. When he retired in 2002, Wootten's career coaching record stood at 1,274-192. In 46 seasons as the head coach of DeMatha basketball, he won five high school national championships, 22 Washington, D.C. titles, and 33 WCAC championships. Wootten has the second most wins as a head coach in the history of boys high school basketball, behind Robert Hughes.NFHS Record Book Wootten never had a losing record, with his worst performance coming in the 1957-58 season, when DeMatha went 17-11, the only year his team to not have at least 20 wins. He had two perfect seasons, the first coming in 1977-78 (28-0) and the other in 1990-91 (30-0). More than a dozen of Wootten's players went on to play in the NBA, including Adrian Dantley and Danny Ferry. Mike Brey, head coach of Notre Dame Fighting Irish men's basketball, also played under Wootten. UCLA basketball coach John Wooden (1910‚Äì2010) described his admiration for Wootten when he said, \\"I know of no finer coach at any level ‚Äì high school, college or pro. I stand in awe of him.\\" In 2000, Wootten became the third high school coach to be inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, and the first to be admitted solely as a high school coach. His overall record at the time was 1,210 wins and 183 losses. Wootten was one of the founders of the McDonald's All-American Game, whose annual player of the year award is named in his honor. During his coaching career at DeMatha, located just away from his alma mater, he received job offers from North Carolina State,30 for 30: Survive and Advance, Jonathon Hock, ESPN 2013, television. Georgetown, and American, as well as interest from Duke, Wake Forest, and Virginia. Wootten turned down the offers, according to Sports Illustrated, because the Maryland job, which was not forthcoming, was the only college job he wanted. Personal life and family Wootten resided in University Park, Maryland with his wife, Kathy, whom he married in 1964. He had five children, Cathy, Carol, Tricia, Brendan, and Joe. In 1996, Wootten nearly died because of a malfunctioning liver and was quickly rushed to the hospital for a liver transplant. Several years later, aged 75, one of his kidneys failed, and he received a transplant; the donor was his son, Joe. Joe became a basketball coach at Bishop O'Connell High School in Arlington, Virginia. Wootten and his son both led one of the largest camps in the United States , Coach Wootten's Basketball Camp, held in Frostburg, Maryland at Frostburg State University and at Bishop O'Connell High School. Wootten died January 21, 2020, at his home in Maryland, at the age of 88. He was surrounded by his wife Kathy and family. Media Wootten co-authored two biographies with Bill Gilbert: From Orphans to Champions (1979), and A Coach for All Seasons (1997). In 1992, Wootten wrote a manual for coaching, Coaching Basketball Successfully, with co-author Dave Gilbert. As second edition of the book was published in 2003, and a third edition in 2012, co-authored with Joe Wootten. In 2017, the documentary film Morgan Wootten: The Godfather of Basketball was released.

Description Astacus leptodactylus can grow up to in length from the tip of the rostrum to the end of the telson (tail), but is more commonly found at around in length. The sides of the thorax are very rough, usually pale yellow to pale green in colour. A. leptodactylus has two pairs of post- orbital ridges, the second of which may have spines. It also has a prominent tubercle (small nodule) on shoulder of the carapace. The claws of Astacus leptodactylus are long and narrow (hence the common name 'narrow-clawed crayfish'). Their upper surface is rough and the underside is the same colour as the body. A tubercle can be found on the fixed side of the claw. A. leptodactylus can be distinguished most easily from the European or broad- fingered crayfish, Astacus astacus, by the relatively thinner \\"fingers\\" of the claws. Further studies done on the Astacus leptodactylus found that they can be co-infected by two or more different pathogens. A study done by R. Salighehzadeh saw that after collecting 10 narrow-clawed crayfish found that they contained 2 pathogenic isolates simultaneously, the Aeromonas hydrophilia and Fusarium solani. Ecology Astacus leptodactylus is fairly docile, especially the male with large claws, and favours relatively still brackish waters such as lakes and canals. It is listed as a species of Least Concern on the IUCN Red List.

The region is made up of fertile river areas of (matanfada, mala, gamji), with much irrigation and orchards (lambu in Hausa). The majority of fishermen are the followers of Islam and also predominantly farmers. Kanta museum is the main historical centre in Argungu for visitors across the globe. People from around the world travel to Argungu just to witness the occasion. The main purpose of the Argungu fishing festival is for fishing and unity. History The festival began in the year 1934, as a mark of the end of the centuries-old hostility between the Sokoto Caliphate and the Kebbi Kingdom. In 2005, the winning fish weighed 75 kg, and needed four men to hoist it onto the scales. In 2006 the festival banned fishing due to safety concerns relating to the low water levels. The importance of the festival to the economy has led the government to conserve fish stock by prohibiting use of gill nets and cast nets. The Zauro polder project, an irrigation scheme in the Rima River floodplain to the south of Argungu, has been criticized because the reservoir threatens to flood the traditional site of the festival. Competition On the final day of the festival, a competition is held in which thousands of men line up along the river and at the sound of a gunshot, all of them jump into the river and have an hour to catch the largest fish. The winner can take home as much as $7,500 US dollars. Competitors are only allowed to use traditional fishing tools and many prefer to catch fish entirely by hand (a practice also popular elsewhere and known as \\"noodling\\") to demonstrate their prowess. Purpose. The festival has many purpose which include: for fishing, unity, fun and entertainment.

He worked primarily in Italy, at Rome and Naples. Biography He was born at Melide, a village on the Lake Lugano, at that time joint possession of some Swiss cantons of the old Swiss Confederacy, and presently part of Ticino, Switzerland, and died at Naples. He went to Rome in 1563, before the death of Michelangelo, to join his elder brother. He won the confidence of Cardinal Montalto, later Pope Sixtus V, who entrusted him in 1584 with the erection of the Cappella del Presepio (Chapel of the Manger) in Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore, a powerful domical building over a Greek cross. It is a marvellously well-balanced structure, notwithstanding the profusion of detail and overloading of rich ornamentation, which in no way interferes with the main architectural scheme. It is crowned by a dome in the early style of S. Mario at Montepulciano. For the same patron, he constructed the Palazzo Montalto near Santa Maria Maggiore, with its skilful distribution of masses and tied decorative scheme of reliefs and festoons, impressive because of the dexterity with which the artist adapted the plan to the site at his disposal. After the cardinal's accession as Sixtus V, he appointed Fontana Architect Of St. Peter's, bestowing upon him, among other distinctions, the title of Knight of the Golden Spur. He added the lantern to the dome of St. Peter's and proposed the prolongation of the interior in a well-defined nave. Of more importance were the alterations he made in Basilica di San Giovanni in Laterano (c. 1586), where he introduced into the loggia of the north facade an imposing double arcade of wide span and ample sweep, and probably added the two-story portico the Scala Santa. This predilection for arcades as essential features of an architectural scheme was brought out in the fountains designed by Domenico and his brother Giovanni, e.g. the Fontana dell'Acqua Paola, or the Fontana di Termini planned along the same lines. Among secular buildings his strong restrained style, with its suggestion from Jacopo Barozzi da Vignola, is best exemplified in the Lateran Palace (begun in 1586), in which the vigorous application of sound structural principles and a power of co- ordination are undeniable, but also the utter lack of imagination and barren monotony of style. It was characteristic of him to remain satisfied with a single solution to an architectural problem, as shown in the fact that he reapplied the motif of the Lateran Palace in the later part of the Vatican containing the present papal residence, and in the additions to the Quirinal Palace. Fontana also designed the transverse arms separating the courts of the Vatican. Egyptian obelisks Re-erection of the obelisk on Saint Peter's Square in 1586. Fountain in the pedestal of the Lateran obelisk, designed by Fontana In 1586 he erected the 327 ton obelisk in the Square of St. Peter's. This feat of engineering took the concerted effort of 900 men, 75 horses and countless pulleys and meters of rope. He gives a detailed account of it in Della transportatione dell'obelisco Vaticano e delle fabriche di Sisto V (Rome, 1590).New York Public Library digital collections The astronomer Ignazio Danti is known to have assisted Fontana in this work. Fontana also used his knowledge of statics, which aroused universal astonishment at the time, in the erection of three other ancient obelisks on the Piazza del Popolo, Piazza di S. Maria Maggiore, and Piazza di S. Giovanni in Laterano. Other works File:Rzym swiete schody kaplica san Lorenzo.jpgSan Giovanni: north facade.

Soon, however, dissatisfaction with his style, envy, and the charge that he had misappropriated public moneys, caused him to be dismissed from his post, and he was driven him to Naples. There he accepted the appointment of architect to the Viceroy, the count of Miranda. In addition to designing canals, he erected the Palazzo Reale. He died in 1607, and was buried in the church of Sant'Anna dei Lombardi. Domenico's brother Giovanni Fontana was also an architect, and his son Giulio Cesare succeeded him as Royal Architect in Naples.  See also  * History of cranes Works * Domenico Fontana.

Designed by Game Freak and originally intended to be renamed Spectre for North American audiences, their name is a derivative of the verb \\"to haunt\\", and is both the singular and plural name of the species. First appearing in Pok√©mon Red and Blue, they later appeared in subsequent sequels, spin-off titles such as Pok√©mon Snap, merchandise related to the series, and both animated and printed adaptations of the franchise. It is known as the Gas Pok√©mon. In animated appearances, Haunter are voiced in Japanese by Toshiyuki Morikawa and in English localizations by Ted Lewis. Haunter has been well received by the media, with groups such as IGN and GamesRadar praising its abilities and style, the former of which described it as superior to its stronger counterpart, Gengar. Its characterization within the game's setting has similarly met praise and been described as one of the more vivid aspects of the series, though at the same time the same characterization has drawn fire from several fundamentalist Christian groups in various books. Conception and design Developed by Game Freak and published by Nintendo, the Pok√©mon series began in Japan in 1996, and features several species of creatures called \\"Pok√©mon\\" that players, called \\"trainers\\", are encouraged to capture, train, and use to battle other players' Pok√©mon or interact with the game's world. Haunter was one of several different Pok√©mon designs conceived by Game Freak's character development team and finalized by artist Ken Sugimori. Called \\"Ghost\\" in Japanese, Nintendo decided to give the various Pok√©mon species \\"clever and descriptive names\\" related to their appearance or features when translating the game for western audiences as a means to make the characters more relatable to American children. Called \\"Spectre\\" in early drafts of the localization, the final version dubbed the species \\"Haunter\\", derived from the verb \\"to haunt\\". Called the \\"Gas Pok√©mon\\", Haunter appears as a purple, levitating triangular creature, with three spikes extending from each side of its head, angled towards its backside and slightly upward. Its lower back ends in a larger cone-shaped tail, ending in a jagged edge on the sides and of nearly equal length of its body. Its face consists of two white triangular eyes and a wide, pink mouth with jagged teeth that blend into its body. Haunter's body levitates in the air while its sole appendages‚Äîtwo disembodied three-finger hands‚Äîhover in the air in front of it. Within the lore of the series, Haunter are described as hiding in very dark places such as graveyards and abandoned caves, stalking their prey. Despite its appearance and nature, Haunter is seen as a serious physical threat to trainers and their Pok√©mon, who are strongly advised to flee if sighted by one. Haunter is known to gesture unsuspecting trainers and Pok√©mon before licking them with their large tongue; the attack suppresses motor functions, drastically drains the victim's life energy, causes paralysis and rapid shaking, and the victim's death (possibly a reference to nerve agents) Haunter can also turn intangible to pass through solid objects, or camouflage themselves as a floating purple orb. A Gastly can transform, or \\"evolve\\", into Haunter, while Haunter in turn can evolve into a Gengar. In the context of the games, this requires leveling up a Gastly to level twenty-five, and trading a Haunter to another player respectively. Appearances Haunter's appearance as the \\"Black Fog\\" Haunter was introduced in Pok√©mon Red and Blue, where it appears in the Pok√©mon Tower, a memorial for dead Pok√©mon, once the player has obtained the \\"Silph Scope\\" item. It later appeared in all subsequent sequels, able to be captured in all except Pok√©mon Ruby and Sapphire and Pok√©mon Black and White. Within these games, Haunter also appears as a Pok√©mon used by enemy NPC trainers, such as \\"channeler\\" enemies in the Pok√©mon Tower or Ecruteak City Gym Leader Morty in Pok√©mon Gold and Silver. The character has also appeared in related spinoff titles, including Pok√©mon Snap, the Pok√©mon Mystery Dungeon games, the Pok√©mon Ranger games, and Pok√©Park Wii: Pikachu's Adventure. In the anime, Haunter first appeared in The Tower of Terror, where protagonist Ash befriended it, and it followed him to Saffron City to battle gym leader Sabrina. Instead of fighting however, it first fled, and during a rematch resorted to making faces and other antics in front of Sabrina, including blowing itself up with a harmless bomb. The result sends her into a laughing fit, disabling her Pok√©mon and letting Ash win by default. Afterward, it chooses to remain with her as Ash carries on his way. Morty used a Haunter to battle Ash in From Ghost to Ghost. In Fear Factor Phony, a Haunter was living in an abandoned mine with several other Ghost Pok√©mon. The Ghost Pok√©mon were having difficulty with the partying Psychic Pok√©mon living nearby. In the Pok√©mon Adventures manga, Agatha used a single Haunter as a part of her team, and used a swarm of Haunter in her attack on Kanto. Eusine was later seen with a Haunter in Volume 14. A gigantic Haunter called \\"The Black Fog\\" was featured in the fourth chapter of The Electric Tale of Pikachu, using its abilities to steal the souls of humans and Pok√©mon alike. Though Ash attempted to capture it, the Black Fog instead self-destructed. It was later revealed the Black Fog had once become accustomed to being worshiped as a god, and chose to die instead of being captured by a human. Promotion and reception Since it appeared in Pok√©mon Red and Blue, Haunter has appeared on several pieces of merchandise, including figurines and cards for the Pok√©mon Trading Card Game. GamesRadar described Haunter alongside Gastly and Gengar as \\"highly useful\\", further describing its abilities and design as \\"top shelf\\". They later called it one of the series' \\"quintessential Ghost-type Pokemon\\", though expressed surprise for its popularity in light of an existing glitch in Pok√©mon Red and Blue that hampered its fighting abilities. In a podcast, they named it as one of their favorite ghost-type Pok√©mon from the series, attributing its popularity to both its design and its presence in the anime which they felt gave it character as both \\"funny\\" and with a \\"big tongue\\". It was also named by them as one of the series' most disturbing characters, calling it an \\"already badass looking Pokemon\\" and described its ability to \\"[cripple] its victims with fatal convulsions\\" as \\"a whole new realm of fear\\". Game Informer editor Tim Turi listed Haunter among the top 10 ghosts, saying the \\"spooky, toxic mess\\" is a design \\"straight out of left field\\", calling it \\"brutal for such a cute little guy\\". IGN contributor \\"PokemonofthedayChick\\" stated that despite Gengar's higher statistics, \\"Haunter always has been and always will be cooler\\", further describing it as having \\"built quite a loyal following for itself over the years\\". IGN editor Jack DeVries later agreed with the statement, adding \\"the real Ghost Type Pok√©mon that sticks out in gamer memory is Haunter\\". Official Nintendo Magazine described it as one of the top ten ghosts within Nintendo games, stating that its appearance made it look \\"every bit as fearsome\\" as its evolution Gengar and adding that its described behavior made it \\"even more creepy\\". Generazione P√≥kemon described Haunter's traits as one of the more vivid aspects of the games, citing specifically its ability to devour energy from its opponents. Fundamentalist Christian groups however have been critical of the character, calling it \\"demonic\\" and critical of the implications of its character design, primarily its existence as a \\"ghost\\" within the game's setting.

It is a Ghost/Poison type Pok√©mon. Designed by Game Freak, their name is both the singular and plural name of the species. First appearing in Pok√©mon Red and Blue, they later appeared in subsequent sequels, spin-off games, related merchandise, and animated and printed adaptations of the franchise. In animated appearances, Gengar are voiced in Japanese by K≈çichi Sakaguchi and in English localizations by Ted Lewis. Gengar has been well received by the media, noted as popular with older male children and praised for its appearance. Groups such as IGN and Official Nintendo Magazine have praised its abilities and style, with both naming it one of the series' best characters. Gengar is the final evolved form of the three original ghost Pok√©mon and known as the Shadow Pokemon. Design and characteristics Gengar (far left) as seen in artwork for Capsule Monsters Unlike other Pok√©mon in the series, Gengar originally appeared in the manga Capsule Monsters, an early concept by Satoshi Tajiri which evolved into the basis for the modern Pok√©mon franchise. During development of Pocket Monsters games Red and Green, which were localized outside Japan as Pok√©mon Red and Blue, Game Freak illustrator Ken Sugimori adapted the character concept for the games. Called \\"Gengaa\\" in Japanese, Nintendo decided to give the various Pok√©mon species \\"clever and descriptive names\\" related to their appearance or features when translating the game for western audiences as a means to make the characters more relatable to American children. Originally intending to call the species \\"Phantom\\", due to an existing trademark for a character with the same name they adapted its Japanese name for the English language instead. It was given a \\"Mega Evolution\\" in Pok√©mon X and Y. Series producer Junichi Masuda noted that Mega Gengar was difficult to render in 3D due to some of the things it was going to do. Known as the Shadow Pok√©mon, Gengar is a dark-purple Pok√©mon with a roundish body. Gengar is the first of its evolutions to have hands and legs connected to its body. Gengar also has a spike-covered back, and its eyes are a sinister red. Its mouth is usually curled into a wicked grin. Gengar steals the heat from the area around it; its presence cools the temperature of the surrounding area by nearly 10 ¬∞F. Gengar, very mischievous and sometime malicious creatures, live in shadows of rooms, caves, and dark places where shadows form, especially in urban areas such as cities and back alleys but only during the night. They enjoy playing practical jokes, such as pretending to be one's shadow and then behaving erratically. When the victim notices the sudden change in the movement of their shadow and becomes afraid, Gengar takes delight in the victim's fear. Gengar have the ability to lay curses on their foe, and it is said to steal the lives of those who become lost in mountains by overtaking the prey's shadow and silently waiting for an opportunity. Like its predecessor in evolution Haunter, Gengar can lick victims with its tongue and paralyze them; this attack is far more associated with Haunter and Gengar has not been shown doing this in the anime. The Seventh Generation furthers its description by adding that they are lonely and will take the lives of others in order to make friends. = Competitive battling = Mega Gengar Gengar has been a top tier Pokemon since the first generation, owing to its good Speed and Ghost typing,Gengar RB Analysis https://www.smogon.com/dex/rb/pokemon/gengar/ and in the third generation, became immune to Ground moves due to gaining the Levitate ability.Gengar RS Analysis https://www.smogon.com/dex/rs/pokemon/gengar/ However, Gengar could not use Ghost and Poison type moves effectively because of its low Attack stat and the fact that all attacks of both types were calculated using the attack stat as they were classified as physical moves.Gengar GS Analysis https://www.smogon.com/dex/gs/pokemon/gengar/ Generation 4 split up attacks to be physical or special based on attributes instead of type, which made several existing ghost and poison attacks special, therefore run off Gengar's large Special Attack stat, and Generation 6 gave it a very strong Mega Evolution, with very high Speed and Special Attack, which was banned from competitive play. However, it lost its Ground immunity in the seventh generation due to Levitate being replaced by Cursed Body.Gengar SM Analysis https://www.smogon.com/dex/sm/pokemon/gengar/ AppearancesIn video games= Gengar's Pok√©mon series debut was in Pok√©mon Red and Blue, where it is only obtainable by evolving Haunter by trading it. Haunter later appeared in several sequels, including Pok√©mon Gold and Silver, Pok√©mon FireRed and LeafGreen, Pok√©mon Diamond and Pearl, Pok√©mon HeartGold and SoulSilver, Pok√©mon Black and White, Pok√©mon X and Y, and Pokemon Sun and Pokemon Moon. Notable trainers that use Gengar are Agatha of the Kanto Elite Four, Morty, Gym Leader of Ecruteak City Gym, and Fantina, Gym Leader of Hearthome City Gym. Outside of the main series, Gengar has appeared in the Pok√©mon Ranger games. In Pok√©mon Mystery Dungeon, Gengar is the main antagonist, and the leader of Team Meanies, which includes an Ekans and Medicham. Gengar spends much of the game causing trouble, even convincing the village to exile the hero, blaming him or her for the natural disasters. However, it is later revealed that Gengar is the cursed human that the plot mentions. Gengar is an NPC in Pok√©Park Wii: Pikachu's Adventure and its sequel, Pok√©Park 2: Wonders Beyond. In Pok√©mon X and Y, Gengar can become Mega Gengar, with its new unblinking third eye able to peer into other dimensions. Gengar is a playable character in Pokken Tournament. A Gengar-themed mini-CD-ROM was released by Mattel Interactive in 2000. =In anime= In the anime, Gengar made its first appearance in the opening of the first episode, \\"Pok√©mon, I Choose You!\\", where it and a Nidorino battled in a Colosseum on television, a scene that mimicked the intro of Pok√©mon Blue. Ash first saw a Gengar in person in Lavender Town in \\"The Tower of Terror\\" while searching for a Ghost-type Pok√©mon with which to fight Sabrina, the Saffron City gym leader specializing in Psychic-types. Due to a close call, Ash spent some unexpected time with the ghostly trio, Gastly, Haunter, and Gengar. It, along with Haunter, seemed to have a fondness for Japanese stand-up, and unsuccessfully attempted to amuse Ash by acting as a pair of performers. In \\"The Ancient Puzzle of Pok√©mopolis\\", a giant Gengar was awakened where it battled an equally large Alakazam. Drake of the Orange Islands used a Gengar in his battle with Ash in \\"Hello, Pummelo!\\" and \\"Enter The Dragonite.\\" A Gengar appeared under the ownership of Ecruteak City Gym Leader Morty in \\"A Ghost Of A Chance\\", \\"From Ghost to Ghost\\", and \\"For Ho-Oh the Bells Toll!\\". Agatha used a Gengar to battle Ash's Pikachu in \\"The Scheme Team\\"; her Gengar actually defeated the electric mouse Pok√©mon. Ash would later go on to capture his own Gengar in the Sword and Shield Anime Series. =In other media= In the Pok√©mon Adventures manga, Agatha has two Gengar on her team. One of them was used to attack Blue and Koga from the shadows, draining the latter's life force as it possessed his shadow. Another Gengar was seen at the beginning of the FireRed and LeafGreen saga in Volume 23. It was used by a kid from Pallet Town in an attempt to capture a Nidorino, replicating the opening sequence of Pok√©mon Red and Blue. Promotion and reception Pumpkin Carving Gengar and its earlier evolutions were popular Pok√©mon in Pok√©mon Red, Blue, and Yellow. A Gengar- themed limited edition set of chocolate chip-flavoured Eggo Waffles were made in a partnership between Nintendo and Kellogg's. Pok√©mon artist Ken Sugimori noted Gengar as his favourite Pok√©mon due to his simplistic design. The book Pikachu's Global Adventure: The Rise and Fall of Pok√©mon cited Gengar as popular with older male children who tend to be drawn to \\"tough or scary\\" characters. Cindy Jacobs, author of Deliver Us from Evil, claimed that Gengar's ability to \\"curse Pokemon players\\" taught children that \\"cursing through magic\\" was okay. It was described by Time as having a \\"devilishly cute smile, horns to match and a crocodile spine\\". GamesRadar described the species along with its two pre-evolutions as the \\"most famous\\" of Ghost-type Pok√©mon.\\" They further stated that Gengar's design made it \\"extremely desirable.\\" In 2013, ScrewAttack placed Gengar at number 3 in top ten Ghosts in video game history. Official Nintendo Magazine named Gengar one of the ten best Pok√©mon in the game as of 2010, stating that people \\"either love Gengar or hate it.\\" In a later reader-based poll, it placed ninth as one of the best ghost characters in a Nintendo game, which the magazine attributed to its design. ONM also included it in its list of cool non-legendary Pok√©mon. Editor Thomas East noted it as a \\"cult favourite\\" of the ONM staff. IGN called Gengar the best Ghost type Pok√©mon in Red and Blue, and also praised its appearance, citing a resemblance to Nekobus from My Neighbor Totoro. Patricia Hernandez named Gengar her favourite from Pok√©mon Red and Blue. IGN readers named it the 17th best Pok√©mon. Former IGN editor Audrey Drake called it a \\"pimp.\\" Game Informer called it the 32nd best Pok√©mon. Game Revolution also included it in its list of the best Pok√©mon at 15. Patricia Hernandez criticized its Mega form, despite her admiration for Gengar. She felt that it didn't get better, just weirder. She also felt that its rarer alternate colour was worse-looking than its normal form. Its Mega form was ranked third in a poll of Japanese readers by Famitsu among other Mega forms.

It is in the Highland local government area, on the boundary between the counties of Inverness-shire and Ross and Cromarty. The mountain provides exciting and challenging climbing. The traverse of the Forcan Ridge ‚Äî in winter or summer ‚Äî is one of the classic Scottish mountain expeditions. The mountain's name refers to the shape of the summit ridge when seen from Glen Shiel with the twin summits and ridge in between resembling a saddle. The mountain was originally known by its Gaelic name of An D√¨ollaid but this has now been lost through common usage of its English translation and it is now one of the few mountains in highland Scotland with an English name.www.strathspey-herald.co.uk. Gives original name of mountain as An Diollaid. Ascent The usual approach is to park beside the A87 just before the old quarry near Shiel Bridge. A stalker's path leads up westwards to a ridge at about , just below the outlying top of Biod an Fhithich. From here the route turns south and climbs steeper ground to the foot of the Forcan Ridge. From here the route continues westwards up and over Sgurr nan Forcan and so up to the main summit. This section is often regarded one of the best ridge walks in Scotland. There is no technical rock-climbing on the ridge, but a good head for heights, appropriate footwear, and some scrambling ability are required. (In winter a rope may be needed to safeguard the descent from the ridge.) The Saddle has two summits: the westerly one has a trig point, but it is not obvious which one is the true summit. Munro baggers had better climb both. To descend back to the starting point, one can either retrace the ascent route, or drop south and then south east to reach the Bealach Coire Mhalagain, at . From here one can continue to Sgurr na Sgine or follow the line of an old dry-stone dyke northeast to get back to the top of the stalker's path to Glen Shiel. The walker not wishing to combine the ascent of The Saddle with Sgurr na Sgine will find that a rewarding day can be had by continuing westwards over the smaller tops of The Saddle and descending to Shiel Bridge about five kilometres northwest of the starting point above.

It was proposed in 1989 by Sanjay Mehrotra. The method is based on the fact that at each iteration of an interior point algorithm it is necessary to compute the Cholesky decomposition (factorization) of a large matrix to find the search direction. The factorization step is the most computationally expensive step in the algorithm. Therefore, it makes sense to use the same decomposition more than once before recomputing it. At each iteration of the algorithm, Mehrotra's predictor‚Äìcorrector method uses the same Cholesky decomposition to find two different directions: a predictor and a corrector. The idea is to first compute an optimizing search direction based on a first order term (predictor). The step size that can be taken in this direction is used to evaluate how much centrality correction is needed. Then, a corrector term is computed: this contains both a centrality term and a second order term. The complete search direction is the sum of the predictor direction and the corrector direction. Although there is no theoretical complexity bound on it yet, Mehrotra's predictor‚Äìcorrector method is widely used in practice.\\"In 1989, Mehrotra described a practical algorithm for linear programming that remains the basis of most current software; his work appeared in 1992.\\" Its corrector step uses the same Cholesky decomposition found during the predictor step in an effective way, and thus it is only marginally more expensive than a standard interior point algorithm. However, the additional overhead per iteration is usually paid off by a reduction in the number of iterations needed to reach an optimal solution. It also appears to converge very fast when close to the optimum.  Derivation  The derivation of this section follows the outline by Nocedal and Wright. = Predictor step - Affine scaling direction = A linear program can always be formulated in the standard form \\\\begin{align} &\\\\underset{x}{\\\\min}&q;(x) &= c^Tx, &\\\\text{s.t.}&Ax;&=b, &\\\\;& x&\\\\geq0, \\\\end{align} where c\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{n \\\\times 1},\\\\;A\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{m \\\\times n} and b\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{m \\\\times 1} define the problem with m constraints and n equations while x\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{n \\\\times 1} is a vector of variables. The Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions for the problem are \\\\begin{align} A^T\\\\lambda + s &= c,\\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\text{(Lagrange gradient condition)} Ax &= b,\\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\text{(Feasibility condition)} XSe &= 0,\\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\text{(Complementarity condition)} (x,s) &\\\\geq 0, \\\\end{align} where X=\\\\text{diag}(x) and S=\\\\text{diag}(s) whence e=(1,1,\\\\dots,1)^T\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{n \\\\times 1}. These conditions can be reformulated as a mapping F: \\\\mathbb{R}^{2n+m}\\\\rightarrow\\\\mathbb{R}^{2n+m} as follows \\\\begin{align} F(x,\\\\lambda,s) = \\\\begin{bmatrix} A^T\\\\lambda+s-cAx-bXSe\\\\end{bmatrix} &= 0 (x,s)&\\\\geq0 \\\\end{align} The predictor-corrector method then works by using Newton's method to obtain the affine scaling direction. This is achieved by solving the following system of linear equations J(x,\\\\lambda,s) \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\Delta x^\\\\text{aff}\\\\\\\\Delta\\\\lambda^\\\\text{aff} \\\\\\\\Delta s^\\\\text{aff}\\\\end{bmatrix} = -F(x,\\\\lambda,s) where J, defined as J(x,\\\\lambda,s) = \\\\begin{bmatrix} abla_x F & abla_\\\\lambda F & abla_s F\\\\end{bmatrix}, is the Jacobian of F. Thus, the system becomes \\\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & A^T & I  A & 0 & 0  S & 0 & X \\\\end{bmatrix}\\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\Delta x^\\\\text{aff}\\\\\\\\Delta\\\\lambda^\\\\text{aff} \\\\\\\\Delta s^\\\\text{aff}\\\\end{bmatrix} = \\\\begin{bmatrix}-r_c\\\\-r_b\\\\-XSe\\\\end{bmatrix},\\\\;\\\\;\\\\; r_c = A^T\\\\lambda+s-c,\\\\;\\\\;\\\\; r_b = Ax-b = Centering step = The average value of the products x_is_i,\\\\;i=1,2,\\\\dots,n constitute an important measure of the desirability of a certain set (x^k,s^k) (the superscripts denote the value the iteration number, k, of the method). This is called the duality measure and is defined by \\\\mu=\\\\frac{1}{n}\\\\sum_{i=1}^n x_is_i = \\\\frac{x^Ts}{n}. For a value of the centering parameter, \\\\sigma\\\\in[0,1], the centering step can be computed as the solution to \\\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & A^T & I  A & 0 & 0  S & 0 & X \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\Delta x^\\\\text{cen}\\\\\\\\Delta\\\\lambda^\\\\text{cen} \\\\\\\\Delta s^\\\\text{cen}\\\\end{bmatrix} = \\\\begin{bmatrix}-r_c\\\\-r_b\\\\-XSe+\\\\sigma\\\\mu e\\\\end{bmatrix} = Corrector step = Considering the system used to compute the affine scaling direction defined in the above, one can note that taking a full step in the affine scaling direction results in the complementarity condition not being satisfied: \\\\left(x_i+\\\\Delta x_i^\\\\text{aff}\\\\right)\\\\left(s_i+\\\\Delta s_i^\\\\text{aff}\\\\right) = x_is_i + x_i\\\\Delta s_i^\\\\text{aff} + s_i\\\\Delta x_i^\\\\text{aff} + \\\\Delta x_i^\\\\text{aff}\\\\Delta s_i^\\\\text{aff} = \\\\Delta x_i^\\\\text{aff}\\\\Delta s_i^\\\\text{aff} e 0. As such, a system can be defined to compute a step that attempts to correct for this error. This system relies on the previous computation of the affine scaling direction. \\\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & A^T & I  A & 0 & 0  S & 0 & X \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\Delta x^\\\\text{cor}\\\\\\\\Delta\\\\lambda^\\\\text{cor} \\\\\\\\Delta s^\\\\text{cor}\\\\end{bmatrix} = \\\\begin{bmatrix}00\\\\-\\\\Delta X^\\\\text{aff}\\\\Delta S^\\\\text{aff}e\\\\end{bmatrix} = Aggregated system - Center-corrector direction = The predictor, corrector and centering contributions to the system right hand side can be aggregated into a single system. This system will depend on the previous computation of the affine scaling direction, however, the system matrix will be identical to that of the predictor step such that its factorization can be reused. The aggregated system is \\\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & A^T & I  A & 0 & 0  S & 0 & X \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\Delta x\\\\\\\\Delta\\\\lambda \\\\\\\\Delta s\\\\end{bmatrix} = \\\\begin{bmatrix}-r_c\\\\-r_b\\\\-XSe-\\\\Delta X^\\\\text{aff}\\\\Delta S^\\\\text{aff}e+\\\\sigma\\\\mu e\\\\end{bmatrix} The predictor-corrector algorithm then first computes the affine scaling direction. Secondly, it solves the aggregated system to obtain the search direction of the current iteration.  Adaptive selection of centering parameter  The affine scaling direction can be used to define a heuristic to adaptively choose the centering parameter as \\\\sigma = \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\mu_\\\\text{aff}}{\\\\mu}\\\\right)^3, where \\\\begin{align} \\\\mu_\\\\text{aff} &= (x+\\\\alpha^\\\\text{pri}_\\\\text{aff}\\\\Delta x^\\\\text{aff})^T(s+\\\\alpha^\\\\text{dual}_\\\\text{aff}\\\\Delta s^\\\\text{aff})^T/n, \\\\alpha^\\\\text{pri}_\\\\text{aff} &= \\\\min\\\\left(1, \\\\underset{i:\\\\Delta x_i^\\\\text{aff}<0}{\\\\min} -\\\\frac{x_i}{\\\\Delta x_i^\\\\text{aff}}\\\\right), \\\\alpha^\\\\text{dual}_\\\\text{aff} &= \\\\min\\\\left(1, \\\\underset{i:\\\\Delta s_i^\\\\text{aff}<0}{\\\\min} -\\\\frac{s_i}{\\\\Delta s_i^\\\\text{aff}}\\\\right), \\\\end{align} Here, \\\\mu_\\\\text{aff} is the duality measure of the affine step and \\\\mu is the duality measure of the previous iteration.  Step lengths  In practical implementations, a version of line search is performed to obtain the maximal step length that can be taken in the search direction without violating nonnegativity, (x,s) \\\\geq 0.  Adaptation to Quadratic Programming  Although the modifications presented by Mehrotra were intended for interior point algorithms for linear programming, the ideas have been extended and successfully applied to quadratic programming as well.

Created by Roy Thomas and Frank Robbins, the first Union Jack first appeared in Invaders #7 (July 1976). A second incarnation from the same creators appeared in The Invaders #21, and a third incarnation was created by Roger Stern and John Byrne for Captain America Vol. 1 #254 (February 1981). Following The Invaders, Union Jack has been featured as a regular character in ongoing series Knights of Pendragon, New Invaders and Invaders Now, as well two self-titled mini-series. JJ Feild portrayed James Montgomery Falsworth in the Marvel Cinematic Universe film Captain America: The First Avenger as a member of the Howling Commandoes. Publication history1970s publications= Roy Thomas and Frank Robbins featured the original Union Jack, James Montgomery Falsworth, as a retired country squire in The Invaders #7-9 (July‚ÄìOctober 1976); in the story flashbacks show him in action in World War I as part of Freedom's Five and battling the original Baron Blood, later revealed to be his own brother, while in the present day his brief membership of the Invaders ends when he is invalided saving his daughter, Jacqueline Falsworth, from his vampiric brother. Thomas and Robbins concluded the plot-line in The Invaders #11 (December 1976); in the story his newly-empowered daughter takes his place on the team as Spitfire. Thomas and Robbins continued to feature Lord Falsworth in a number of volumes, including #12 (January 1977), which sees him watching his daughter head off on her first mission with the team; #14-15 (March‚ÄìApril 1977), which sees him absconding with her and new hero Dyna-Mite and #18-19 (July‚ÄìAugust 1977), which sees the three parachuting into Nazi Germany on a mission to restore the latter's memory; flashback reveals that Dyna-Mite is Roger Aubrey, the best friend of Lord Falsworth's son, and that the two had been imprisoned by the Nazis while on a peace mission to Berlin. Thomas and Robbins also first featured Lord Falsworth's son and successor Brian in his previous guise as the Destroyer in Invaders #18-19 (July‚ÄìAugust 1977); in the story he explains how he received a variation of the super-soldier formula from a fellow inmate while in a Nazi prison. Thomas and Robbins concluded the plot-line in The Invaders #20-21 (September‚ÄìOctober 1977); in the story Brian takes over his father's role of Union Jack to rescue his sister and the rest of the team while Lord Falsworth helps to steal a plane to get them home, and in Invaders #22 (November 1977); in which they are both safely returned to England. Thomas and Robbins also featured Brian in What If? #4 (August 1977); in the story he and Spitfire save Winston Churchill from a Nazi assassination attempt. Thomas and Robbins continued to feature both Falsworths in the series, with the younger becoming a semi-permanent member of the team with issues #23 (December 1977) & #25 (February 1978); in which he joins them on his first mission, while the older appeared in a supporting role in issue #23 (December 1977), in which he helps Dyna-Mite's search for a cure to his size reduction, and #26 (March 1978); in which he introduces Brian to the restored Aubrey in his role as the new Destroyer. =1980s publications= Roger Stern and John Byrne gave Lord Falsworth a contemporary appearance as an elderly wheelchair-bound country gentleman for Captain America Vol. 1 #253-254 (January‚ÄìFebruary 1981); in the story, which features the first appearances of his second successor Joey Chapman, he tries to put on his old costume to join Captain America's final battle against his vampiric brother, Baron Blood, and dies of natural causes in the epilogue; the story also reveals that Brian Falsworth had died in a car crash in 1953. =1990s publications= Dan Slott and James W. Fry III featured Brian Falsworth in a World War II-era story for Midnight Sons Unlimited #9 (May 1995); in the story he teams up with the Blazing Skull to defend a fundraiser he is hosting from a Nazi attack. =2000s publications= Lord Falsworth appears as a supporting character in Fabian Nicieza and Lewis LaRosa's Citizen V and the V-Battalion: The Everlasting #1 (March 2002); the story begins with a flashback showing him at Brian Falsworth's funeral in 1953 and reveals he assisted the titular fictional secret organization run by his son's lover, Roger Aubrey. =2010s publications= Kyle Higgins, Alec Siegel and Pepe Larraz featured the Brian Falsworth incarnation in the World War II flashback story Crossfire for the 70th Anniversary Issue Captain America #616 (May 2011); in the story Captain America and Union Jack defend a French town under Nazi siege. =2020s publications= Union Jack is a member of the British super team The Union created by Paul Grist and Andrea Di Vito. Fictional character biographyJames Montgomery Falsworth= A peer of the realm as Lord Falsworth, James Montgomery Falsworth is first active as the adventurer and British government operative Union Jack during World War I. During his adventures as a member of Freedom's Five, he encounters the mysterious Baron Blood, a vampire saboteur for the Germans. After the war, Lord Falsworth retires to his ancestral home in England to raise a family.Invaders vol. 1 #7 He is active again as Union Jack during World War II. He becomes a member of the Invaders after the original Human Torch saves his daughter ‚Äî Jacqueline Falsworth ‚Äî from Baron Blood. Jacqueline is revived by a blood transfusion from the Human Torch which grants her the power of super-speed. As a result, she becomes the costumed hero Spitfire (a title she still holds in the 21st Century). After the attack, Lord Falsworth offers up his mansion as the Invaders' base of operations. After Baron Blood's attack on Jacqueline, James discovers the vampire is actually his brother, John. During a battle, Blood crushes Union Jack's legs under a boulder, effectively ending his career as a hero. Before the battle ends, James is able to impale Blood on a silver-veined stalagmite.Invaders vol. 1 #7-9 Soon after, he quits the Invaders.Invaders vol. 1 #11 Although unable to use his legs, James later travels with Spitfire and Dyna-Mite, parachuting into Nazi Germany. There they meet up with James' son, Brian, whom they were searching for. Falsworth and Dyna-Mite were captured by the Nazis, but are then rescued by Brian. Originally thinking his son a traitor, James learns that Brian fights against the Nazis as the costumed hero, the Destroyer. As a result, the two reconcile their differences and James passes the mantle of Union Jack on to Brian, at which point Brian abandons his Destroyer identity.Invaders vol. 1 #18-21 However, the father outlives the son when Brian is killedCaptain America vol. 1 #254, February 1981 in an automobile accident in 1953. Years later, James Montgomery Falsworth contacts Captain America to combat Baron Blood. Falsworth finally sees the end of Baron Blood with the help of Captain America and the third incarnation of Union Jack (Joey Chapman). After this episode, James Montgomery Falsworth passes away from heart failure due to old age.Captain America vol. 1 #253-254 (January‚ÄìFebruary, 1980) He is seen again when Baron Zemo travels back in time, in Baron Zemo: Born Better #3. =Brian Falsworth= Brian Falsworth is the son of James Montgomery Falsworth, born like his father in Falsworth Manor in a village north of London. Initially, Brian and his friend Roger are sympathetic toward Germany and supportive of peace between it and the United Kingdom. Toward the end of the 1930s, the pair go into Germany, but quickly discover the evil nature of the Nazi regime. Brian is thrown in prison, and Roger is given to German scientists.Invaders #19 Brian gains superpowers through the help of a dying German scientist who tried to recreate the Super Soldier Formula that resulted in Captain America. Brian escapes prison and becomes a costumed Nazi-fighter within Germany, calling himself the Destroyer.Invaders #18 Meanwhile, Roger is used for experiments; he is brainwashed and his body reduced in size. Standing one foot tall but with the strength of a full-sized man, he is given the name Dyna-Mite. With his memory gone, the Nazis unleash Dyna-Mite against the Allies, in a plot which involves the Crusaders.Invaders #14-15 In the wake of the foiled attack, Lord Falsworth and Spitfire deduce Dyna-Mite's identity and sneak into Germany to look for Brian. Ultimately, they find out the truth behind Dyna-Mite, and Roger's memory is restored. Brian, reuniting with his family and reconciling with his father, learns of his father's former costumed identity as Union Jack, dons the costume and battles Nazi soldiers and Master Man alongside Captain America.Invaders #15, #18-21 Brian subsequently adopts the Union Jack identity as an adventurer and British government operative in place of his disabled father, joining the Invaders.Invaders #21 Roger, in turn, takes on the mantle of the Destroyer after his normal size is restored.Invaders #26 Later, Brian is hit by magical lightning when fighting Thor disguised as Joseph Stalin, whom Thor was tricked by Hilter into assassinating, and gains the ability to shoot electricity from his fingertips.Invaders #32-33 Following the war, Brian remains active as Union Jack, and is instrumental in founding the V-Battalion alongside Roger Aubrey and other heroes of the era. A car crash on a British road in 1953 abruptly ended Brian Falsworth's career and his life.Citizen V and the V Battalion (vol. 2) #1 (March 2002) In the 2008 limited series Avengers/Invaders, he is part of the World War II-era Invaders. His teammates are lost in time and battle the Avengers. In varying timestreams, Union Jack perishes again and again. =Joseph Chapman= Joseph Chapman's incarnation as the current Union Jack is unique in that he is not a member of the Falsworth line or part of any British aristocratic family. Rather, Joey Chapman, born in Manchester, England, is the working class son of a shipbuilder. Chapman becomes Union Jack when, while visiting Falsworth Manor with his friend, Kenneth Crichton (nephew of Brian Falsworth and later Baron Blood III), he dons the costume to stand in for Kenneth and save the life of James Montgomery Falsworth, Lord Falsworth, who has been targeted by Baron Blood. For a time he fought crime on his own, serving as a hero for the common man as opposed to the aristocratic Captain Britain. Their rivalry was most apparent when they both were chosen as Knights of Pendragon by the Green Knight of Avalon. Captain Britain did not remain a Pendragon for long, but Union Jack stuck with the new team until it broke up when half the team traveled to a parallel world to offer humanitarian aid. During his time with the KoP, Union Jack's physique increased to near Hulk-like proportions and he went through a series of alternate costumes. After the Knights of Pendragon break up and his enhanced musculature returns to normal, he reverts to the classic uniform and returns to fighting crime solo. He also faces a vampire cult led by a vampire who had been created by the original Baron Blood. Chapman later wears an updated, militaristic costume, and joins the modern incarnation of the Invaders, led by Jim Hammond, the original Human Torch. For a time, Chapman became romantically involved with his New Invaders teammate, Spitfire (Kenneth's mother). They have since resolved to be friends, and he remains active in the UK's espionage community. Powers and abilities James Montgomery Falsworth was an athletic man who possessed no superhuman powers. However, he was trained in the field of espionage, a veteran of two world wars, and highly trained in armed and unarmed combat. He wore a bullet-proof costume and carried a 6-inch dagger and a Webley .455 revolver, both of which he used with great skill. Falsworth began using a wheelchair in 1942 and was debilitated by extreme old age at the time of his death. During his initial career as the second Union Jack, Brian Falsworth possessed no superhuman powers. He was a superbly athletic man, but, having been exposed to a variant of the Super Soldier Formula, was enhanced to the peak of human potential, and was highly trained in armed and unarmed combat. Like his father, he wore bulletproof fabric and primarily used a Webley .455 revolver and a 6-inch dagger. After an encounter with Thor later in his career, he gained the ability to discharge bolts of mystic lightning from his fingertips after his body was energized by a lightning strike.Invaders vol. 1 #32-33 Like those who held the title of Union Jack before him, Joey Chapman is an athlete in peak physical condition. In addition, his strength, speed, and stamina are enhanced by the Power of the Pendragon. Chapman usually carries a handgun of some variety (changing it as appropriate to the mission) and a silver-edged dagger used for supernatural foes.

The problem comes from substituting nondesignating constants for variables: in fact, we cannot do this in standard formulations of first-order logic, since there are no nondesignating constants. Classically, ‚àÉx(x=y) is deducible from the open equality axiom y=y by particularization (i.e. (3) above). In free logic, (1) is replaced with :1b. \\\\forall xA \\\\land E!t \\\\rightarrow \\\\exists xA, where E! is an existence predicate (in some but not all formulations of free logic, E!t can be defined as ‚àÉy(y=t)) Similar modifications are made to other theorems with existential import (e.g. the Rule of Particularization becomes (Ar ‚Üí (E!r ‚Üí ‚àÉxAx)). Axiomatizations of free-logic are given by Theodore Hailperin (1957), Jaakko Hintikka (1959),Jaako Hintikka (1959). \\"Existential Presuppositions and Existential Commitments.\\" Journal of Philosophy 56 (3):125-137. Karel Lambert (1967), and Richard L. Mendelsohn (1989). Interpretation Karel Lambert wrote in 1967:\\"Free Logic and the Concept of Existence\\" by Karel Lambert, Notre Dame Journal of Formal Logic, VIII, numbers 1 and 2, April 1967 \\"In fact, one may regard free logic... literally as a theory about singular existence, in the sense that it lays down certain minimum conditions for that concept.\\" The question that concerned the rest of his paper was then a description of the theory, and to inquire whether it gives a necessary and sufficient condition for existence statements. Lambert notes the irony in that Willard Van Orman Quine so vigorously defended a form of logic that only accommodates his famous dictum, \\"To be is to be the value of a variable,\\" when the logic is supplemented with Russellian assumptions of description theory. He criticizes this approach because it puts too much ideology into a logic, which is supposed to be philosophically neutral. Rather, he points out, not only does free logic provide for Quine's criterion‚Äîit even proves it! This is done by brute force, though, since he takes as axioms \\\\exists xFx \\\\rightarrow (\\\\exists x(E!Fx)) and Fy \\\\rightarrow (E!y \\\\rightarrow \\\\exists xFx), which neatly formalizes Quine's dictum. So, Lambert argues, to reject his construction of free logic requires you to reject Quine's philosophy, which requires some argument and also means that whatever logic you develop is always accompanied by the stipulation that you must reject Quine to accept the logic. Likewise, if you reject Quine then you must reject free logic. This amounts to the contribution that free logic makes to ontology. The point of free logic, though, is to have a formalism that implies no particular ontology, but that merely makes an interpretation of Quine both formally possible and simple. An advantage of this is that formalizing theories of singular existence in free logic brings out their implications for easy analysis. Lambert takes the example of the theory proposed by Wesley C. Salmon and George Nahknikian,George Nahknikian and Wesley C. Salmon, \\"'Exists' as a Predicate\\" Philosophical Review, Vol. 66: 1957, pp. 535-542 which is that to exist is to be self-identical.

Known for his novel, Lanthan Batheriyile Luthiniyakal (Litanies of the Dutch Battery) and a host of short stories such as Higuita, Thiruthu, Chulaimedile Shavangal and Vanmarangal Veezhumpol, Madhavan also writes football columns and travel articles. He is a distinguished fellow of Kerala Sahitya Akademi and a recipient of several major awards including Odakkuzhal Award, Kerala Sahitya Akademi Award for Story, Kerala Sahitya Akademi Award for Novel, Muttathu Varkey Award, Mathrubhumi Literary Award and Crossword Book Award.  Biography  N. S. Madhavan, born on September 9, 1948 in the port city of Cochin did his school education at Sree Rama Varma High School and graduated in economics from Maharaja's College, Ernakulam. His post- graduate studies were at the Department of Economics, University of Kerala. During this period he began writing, and in 1970 won the top prize for his first published short story 'Shishu', in a contest organised by the Malayalam literary magazine Mathrubhumi. He joined the Indian Administrative Service in 1975 and started his administrative career as a member of the Bihar cadre. After serving in Bihar in various capacities, he returned to his home state in 1988. Madhavan is married to Sheela Reddy, a book editor of Outlook, an English magazine published in New Delhi. Their daughter, Meenakshi Reddy Madhavan is a well-known blogger and the author of works such as You Are Here, Confessions of a Listmaniac and Cold Feet.  Writing career  Stories = N.S Madhavan In the 1980s, Madhavan went through a decade-long period of writer's block, until the release of his story 'Higuita' in 1990. In this work, Madhavan models his protagonist, Father Geevarghese, on Ren√© Higuita, the 1990 FIFA World Cup goalkeeper for Colombia and his unconventional playing style whereby he would often abandon his goal and try to score goals, occupies the priest's imagination. Likewise, he temporarily abandons his cassock and saves a tribal girl Lucie from the clutches of the trafficker Jabbar. The short story was rated among the best Malayalam stories in the last century. It has since been adapted into a play, Higuita: A Goalie‚Äôs Anxiety at Penalty Kick, by Sasidharan Naduvil. Thiruthu, based on the Babri Masjid demolition, Chulaimedile Shavangal (Corpses of Chulaimed), Vanmarangal Veezhumpol (When the Big Trees Fall), Paryaya Kathakal (Synonymous Stories), Nilavili (The Cry), Muyal Vetta (Hare Hunt) and Nalam Lokam (The Fourth World) are some of his other notable short stories. His stories are known to represent the uncertainties, ambiguities and tragedies of the modern world. = Novel = After thirty-three years as a writer, Madhavan published his debut novel in 2003 as Lanthan Batheriyile Luthiniyakal. The novel is about the life on an imaginary island in the Kochi backwaters, named after a 17th-century battery (bathery in Malayalam) of five cannons installed on its promontory by the Dutch (Lanthans in Malayalam). Jessica, the young narrator of the story, is the scion of a family of carpenters with a long tradition of boat building. Her reminiscences start from the days when she was inside her pregnant mother's womb. The novel presents an intimate picture of life of the Latin Christians of the Kerala coast, descendants of poor, low-caste Hindus who were converted to Christianity by Portuguese colonists in the 16th century. The first edition of the novel was sold out in a month. The novel is set between 1951 and 1967, the first sixteen years of Jessica life, but draws upon history going back to the time of Vasco Da Gama. She was born at a time when people used to run away from cow-pox vaccinators as well as the period when Kerala embraced communism, which the novelist calls the watermelon years ‚Äì an allusion to the verdant green-canopied Kerala with its hidden red watermelons. There are captivating descriptions of Latin catholic residents of the Dutch Battery preparing themselves for months prior to the staging of Karalman Charitham a Chavittu Nadakam or an operatic play about Charlemagne, originally written in Tamil and pidgin Latin by Chinnathambi Annavi in the 16th century. Set against the background of the city of Madhavan's birth, Kochi, the Lanthan Batheriyile Luthiniyakal is a roller coaster ride through micro histories, the nascent days of a newly independent country, the growth and decline of ideas, and the randomness of events affecting human lives. Well-known Malayalam novelist M. Mukundan made the following assessment after reviewing the novel, \\"N.S. Madhavan has rejuvenated Malayalam fiction.\\"M. Mukundan Epic Imagination: Review of Lanthanbatheriyile Luthinayakal, The Little Magazine, New Delhi: Volume IV, Issue 4 2003 He summarises the novel thus: \\"[The book] is all about history and imagination‚Äîthe protogonists of new fiction that is in vogue.\\" Mukundan added, \\"The novel is heavily populated with communists, priests, carpenters, cooks, boatmen, librarians, school teachers, even tailors. At times you will come across history makers from faraway Russia ‚Äì Joseph Stalin, Imre Nagy, Nikita Khrushchev...\\" = Other works = In 2006, Madhavan published has written two plays, Rayum Mayum and Arbhudhavaidyan, published together as a book, Randu Natakangal, in 2006. His novel Lanthanbatheriyile Luthiniyakal was translated into English by Rajesh Rajamohan under the title Litanies of Dutch Battery and published in October 2010 by Penguin Books. The work was the winner of the 2010 Crossword Book Award (Indian language translations) and featured in the Man Asian Literary Prize long list and the 2011 The Hindu Literary Prize short list. Kaya Taran, the 2004 Hindi movie by Sashi Kumar, is based on When Big Trees Fall, a short story by Madhavan about the homicidal attacks on the Sikhs that followed the Assassination of Indira Gandhi, the then Indian Prime Minister. He also edited one book, Malayala Kathakal, composed of 60 short stories by various writers. Awards Madhavan, who topped the field in a literary competition conducted by Mathrubhumi in 1970 for his short story, Shishu, received the Padmarajan Award for his work, Thiruthu in 1993 and a year later, he received the 1994 Odakkuzhal Award for Higuita. Higuita was selected for another award in 1995, the Kerala Sahitya Akademi Award for Story; he would receive another award from Kerala Sahitya Akademi in 2004, Kerala Sahitya Akademi Award for Novel for Lanthan Batheriyile Luthiniyakal. The novel was included in the long list for the 2007 Man Asian Literary Prize, the prize eventually going to the Chinese novel, Wolf Totem. He received one more award for Higuita, the Muttathu Varkey Award in 2009 followed by the Padmaprabha Literary Award, the same year. The English translation of his novel, Litanies of Dutch Battery, was shortlisted for The Hindu Literary Prize in 2011. Kerala Sahitya Akademi honoured him with fellowship in 2013. He received the Padmaprabha Literary Prize in 2015 and two awards in 2018, the Mathrubhumi Literary Award and the Literary Award of the Bahrain Keraleeya Samajam.

Early life Davis was born in South Kensington, London on 9 January 1887, the son of Edwin and Georgina Davis, his father was a merchant and tea importer. He was educated at Westminster School and University College London. While at school, he met Malcolm Campbell, and the duo were involved in a \\"spectacular pile-up\\" with a borrowed penny-farthing bicycle.Wise, David Burgess. \\"Davis: The Grand Old Man of Motor Racing\\", in Northey, Tom, ed. World of Automobiles (London: Orbis, 1974), Volume 5, p.499. In 1906 Davis became an apprentice with the Daimler Company. Training as a draughtsman, he became involved with the design of various products, from the Daimler-Renard Road Train to Daimler's team of cars in the 1907 Kaiserpreis race.Wise, p.499. In 1910, he joined the staff of Automobile Engineer, just then being launched by Iliffe (also publishers of The Autocar) as a technical illustrator and was by 1912 also a writer and sub-editor. At the start of the First World War he joined the Royal Naval Air Service and served in France with armoured car section. Following his demobilisation he became sports editor of The Autocar although he also served in the Second World War in the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers. Racing career While best known as Sports Editor of The Autocar, writing under the pen-name Casque (French for helmet), Davis also competed in many forms of motor racing in the 1920s. He won many awards in the popular trials competitions of the day. As Sports Editor, Davis aided his prewar motorcycling associate, W. O. Bentley, in starting his company. In 1921, Davis was invited by S. F. Edge to join Edge's Brooklands AC racing team, in between magazine deadlines, while in 1922 he was part of Aston Martin's effort to break no less than 32 world and class records at Weybridge. Davis became one of the famous Bentley Boys of the late 1920s. He won the 24 Hours of Le Mans outright in . Partnered with Dr. Benjafield, they covered 1,472.527 miles at an average speed of .Fraichard, Georges Fraichard, The Le Mans Story (The Sportsmans Book Club, 1956), p.25.

Davis piloted a 3-litre Bentley at Le Mans in 1926, crashing in an attempt to take the lead only twenty minutes from the flag. On 7 May 1927, Davis finished second in the Essex Car Club Six Hour race at Brooklands on an Alvis 12/50.Motor Sport, June 1927, p.360; Wise, p.499. At Le Mans that year, Davis became the stuff of racing legend when, at the wheel of the 3-litre Bentley \\"Old Number Seven\\", he skidded into a pileup at White House and saw the chassis twist, but nevertheless went on to win. Davis would enter the 1928 Le Mans, coming ninth at the wheel of a front wheel drive Alvis shared with Urquhart-Dykes. He would also come second at the 1929 Saorstat Cup, Phoenix Park, and at the Brooklands Double-Twelve (24 hours in two shifts, because the track was prohibited from holding racing at night) and . In 1929, Davis finished second overall, and class winner, in the Brooklands Double Twelve on a 4,398 c.c. Bentley.Motor Sport, June 1929, p.63. He finished second again in 1930 on a 5,597 c.c.

On 4 October 1930, Davis was partnered with the Earl of March in an Austin Seven and they won the B.R.D.C. 500-mile race at Brooklands outright,Motor Sport, March 1947, p.60. at an average speed of .Wise, p.499 Also at Brooklands that year, Davis set several Class H records in the Seven, including a flying kilometre of . (For the kilometre, his co-driver was Charles Goodacre.) His efforts for the year earned him a BRDC Gold Star. He also entered a Daimler Double-Six sleeve-valve V12 at Monte Carlo. He had a spectacular accident in a low-chassis Invicta S-type at Brooklands in 1931,Motor Sport, May 1931, p.334. skidding into a telegraph pole. In 1933 he finished ninth at Le Mans in an Aston Martin. At the 1935 Tourist Trophy, Davis' Singer Nine crashed due to a broken steering ball-joint. He hit Norman Black's Nine, which had crashed for the same reason at the same place. Despite the severity of the crash, Davis was unhurt. On 15 April 1937, Davis drove a Frazer-Nash BMW round Brooklands, covering more than in an hour, at an average speed of Motor Sport, May 1937, p.223. The same year, his Wolseley earned \\"a special award for being the best-equipped car to finish\\". Other interests Davis also acquired an 1897 Bolle√© tricar, which he named Beelzebub, and continued to use into the 1960s before selling it to the Indianapolis Speedway Museum. In time, his interest in veteran cars led him to co-found the Veteran Car Club of Great Britain in 1930. He was first Vice-President of the Aston Martin Owners Club in 1935, designing the Aston Martin \\"wings\\" badge. After the war, he did much to promote the revival of motorsport in Britain, both as Vice-President of the Vintage Sports-Car Club and as President of the new 500 Club (later the British Racing and Sports Car Club). He was a committee member of the BRDC.Motor Sport, September 1945, p.247. He also served on the Competitions Committee of the Royal Automobile Club, the governing body of motor sport in the United Kingdom.The Motor Year Book 1957, Temple Press, p.229. While in hospital after his 1931 Brooklands crash, Davis wrote Motor Racing. As well as his serious journalistic books about racing and racers Davis also published more lighthearted books under the Pseudonym Casque (French for helmet!). These were primarily a vehicle for Davis highly accomplished humorous cartoons of racing cars, drivers and their foibles, and the world of motor racing between the wars. His insiders view of racing the fallibity of racing drivers, the incompetence of officials and the unreliability of racing machines makes these both humorous and informative! The two sketchbooks include Brooklands, Le Mans, Alpine trials and the Monte Carlo Rally and TT races, His views on the (un)reliability of racing cars is further demonstrated by his choice of \\"Expensive Noises\\" as the title of his 1950 book in which exploding engines feature heavily. Davis would attend racing events, write, and paint into his 80s. Later life Davis lived his later years in Guildford, never losing his boyish enthusiasm for life. He was a great storyteller and made a modest living writing articles and painting oils. He was an excellent driver and even as his years advanced he trained police drivers at Hendon. He owned a Bug-eyed Sprite, and an 1897 L√©on Boll√©e tricar, called \\"Beelzebub,\\" that he took on the annual London to Brighton Veteran Car Run.Note: Car sold to the Indianapolis Motor Speedway Hall of Fame Museum in 1967. He had completed the London-Brighton course in 1930 in the L√©on Boll√©e in a time of 3hrs 20mins 0secs at an average speed of 17.17 m.p.h.Motor Sport, January 1931, Page 129. He died in a fire in his home in Guildford on his 94th birthday, some say caused by his ever-present smouldering pipe but more likely by an over turned paraffin heater.

In accordance with the final act of the Congress of Vienna, the Duchy of Lucca then came into the possession of the Grand Duchy of Tuscany, which was annexed by the Kingdom of Sardinia (Piedmont) in 1860. The Duchy was formed in 1815 by the Congress of Vienna, out of the former Republic of Lucca and the Principality of Lucca and Piombino, which had been ruled by Elisa Bonaparte. It was created to compensate the House of Bourbon-Parma for the loss of the Duchy of Parma, which had been given to Marie Louise of Austria. In 1817, Maria Luisa of Spain, the former Infanta of Spain and Queen of Etruria, assumed the government of Lucca. She was also the mother of Charles Louis of Parma, the Bourbon heir to Parma. This followed the Treaty of Paris (1815), which confirmed both her sovereign status in Lucca, and her son's status as heir to Parma in succession to Marie Louise. After Maria Luisa's death in 1824, Charles Louis assumed the government of the Duchy. In 1847 Charles succeeded to the Duchy of Parma, and left Lucca, which was annexed by the Grand Duchy of Tuscany. From 1815 to 1818, the flag of Lucca was yellow and red horizontal stripes. From 7 November 1818, to 1847 the flag was white, with Maria Luisa's coat of arms and the yellow‚Äìred flag in the canton.

It was developed after World War II, drawing upon their wartime experience with creating the Republic-Ford JB-2, a copy of the German V-1. The Matador was similar in concept to the V-1, but it included a radio command that allowed in-flight course corrections. This allowed accuracy to be maintained over greatly extended ranges of just under 1000 km. To allow these ranges, the Matador was powered by a small turbojet engine in place of the V-1's much less efficient pulsejet. Matador was armed with the W5 nuclear warhead, essentially an improved version of the Fat Man design that was lighter and had a smaller cross section. A single U.S. Air Force group, 1st Pilotless Bomber Squadron, was armed with the weapon, keeping them on alert with a six-minute launch time. It could be easily retargeted, unlike weapons using inertial guidance systems. Accuracy at maximum range was about , which allowed it to be used against any large target like troop concentrations or armored spearheads. First flown in 1949, Matador entered service in 1952 and left service in 1962. Matador carried several designations during its lifetime, originally known under the War Department's system as SSM-A-1. By the time it was introduced to service, the Air Force had been created, and they referred to them as bombers and assigned it the B-61 designation. It was later re-designated TM-61, for \\"tactical missile\\", and finally MGM-1 when the U.S. Department of Defense introduced the tri-service missile and drone designation system in 1963. History The first flight of Matador, model XSSM-A-1, occurred at the White Sands Missile Range on 20 January 1949. The first two production B-61 Matador missiles arrived at Eglin AFB, Florida, in September 1953, under the control of the 6555th Guided Missile Squadron, for climatic testing, although instrumentation and pre-test check-outs kept the actual cold-weather tests from beginning until November.Connors, S.Sgt. J. J., \\"Guided Missiles: Eglin Tests Matadors In Hangar\\", Playground News, Fort Walton Beach, Florida, 12 November 1953, Volume 8, Number 42, page 1. At the end of 1953 the first squadron was operational, but not deployed until 1954, as the 1st Pilotless Bomber Squadron, Bitburg Air Base, Germany with the B-61A armed with the W5 nuclear warhead. The missile was capable of carrying a 2000-pound conventional warhead, but it is unknown if any of these were actually deployed. By the late 1950s at least, all Matadors carried the nuclear warhead. The last Matadors were removed from active service in 1962, with a total of 1200 missiles produced. At that time, they were deployed in squadrons at Bitburg AB, West Germany, in Tainan, Taiwan, and in various locations in South Korea. The specific maintenance training schools were in at the Glenn L. Martin factory and Lowry AFB, both in Denver Colorado, while the launch training was at Orlando Air Force Base, Florida (later transferred to the U.S. Navy and renamed Naval Training Center Orlando) and Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida. When the Tainan squadrons were inactivated, the airframes were made non-flyable by chopping out the attachment points in the bulkheads of the fuselage sections with axes, and were sold locally as scrap after having the warheads removed. Most of the support vehicles, consisting mainly of 2¬Ω and 5-ton trucks, were disposed of on the local market. Presumably, the other sites similarly disposed of their missiles and equipment. Guidance The missile was piloted via radio link and tracked via a network of ground-based AN/MSQ-1 radar stations. This guidance system, with its line-of-sight communications, limited the guided range to about . As with all radio communications it was also prone to enemy radio jamming. While in theory the missile could be \\"handed off\\" in flight from one guidance station to the next, in practice that was rarely successful, and deployed missiles did not attempt it. In 1954, the USAF started to develop the YTM-61C version which was equipped with the new Shanicle (Short Range Navigation Vehicle) guidance system. It became operational in 1957 and used ground-based microwave emitters to generate hyperbolic grids for range and azimuth, which were used by the missile guidance system to navigate. Now the guided range could be extended to the maximum flight range of the missile, about . Anecdotal evidence indicated that the Shanicle system was very accurate, with stories of one missile flying into the ground in the same crater left by a previous missile during an early exercise in North Africa. These may or may not be true, but in any case the Shanicle system was soon discontinued on operational missiles. By the late 1950s, all were using the MSQ-1 (called \\"MisCue-1\\" by the crews) ground-based guidance system. A unique identifying feature of the TM-61C variant was the raised rear section of the fuselage above the jet exhaust, called the \\"doghouse\\" by those who were assigned to the missile squadrons. This had originally housed the Shanicle electronics, but was retained when those systems were removed. The \\"doghouse\\" had no access panels or doors and was an aerodynamic structural component added to TM-61C and TM-76A to prevent missile \\"shudder\\" and breakup during terminal dive. It contained no functional components. The operational Matadors were zinc chromate green in their final versions, but this doghouse was quite often left natural aluminum, as were the wings and tail group. The MSQ guidance vans required to guide the Matador were removed from Germany after September 1962 when the last Matador operational units were inactivated. Launch crew A Matador missile on its launcher near Hahn Air Base, West Germany. A Matador missile at Gatow, Germany. The Matador launch crew consisted of eleven members. One launch officer, who was usually a 1st lieutenant (O-2) or a junior captain (O-3), one crew chief, usually a technical sergeant (E-6), two warhead techs, two flight control systems techs, two guidance techs, two airframe and engine techs‚Äîone of whom doubled as the crane operator and the other as the launcher tech, and one booster rocket tech. Since the missile was at least theoretically \\"mobile\\", all launch equipment was mounted on trucks and trailers. As a result, in addition to their primary duties, most crew members were trained as and doubled as drivers. All enlisted members other than the crew chief were usually airman second class (E-3) or airman (E-2) on their first enlistment, though there were sometimes staff sergeants (E-5) or even technical sergeants who had already served multiple enlistments. In addition, there were similarly-sized guidance crews on remote sites, and a maintenance staff for the missiles, the guidance equipment, and the vehicles. Because of the number of people required to support the missile, a \\"mobile\\" Matador squadron with five launch crews could grow quite cumbersome. As a result, the squadrons were soon deployed at fixed sites and the idea of a mobile missile was abandoned. An individual Matador missile was shipped from the Martin plant to its unit in seven wooden crates.\\"Pilotless Bomber Shipped in Crates.\\" Popular Mechanics, August 1954, p. 90. A single Matador missile required many vehicles to move it and its associated support equipment. There was a transport vehicle, which was a short wheelbase semi-trailer which carried the missile with the wings removed and attached alongside the fuselage, a launcher, which was a semi-trailer more than long weighing more than 30,000 pounds. There was a target selection van, a warhead van, a 60 kW diesel generator, a tug, a hydraulic unit, a mobile blockhouse, and a truck-mounted hydraulic crane. There were several 2¬Ω and 5 ton trucks (tractor type) to attach to and tow the launchers, transport vehicle, and generator. In some squadrons, each launch team had a large trailer in which it stored weapons, ammunition and supplies. A typical missile launch site had an active, or \\"hot\\" pad on which was kept the missile most ready to launch. This pad was manned by the on-duty launch crew. According to the book, this required 15 minutes to do, but some crews could accomplish it in slightly more than 6 minutes. The site usually had a backup pad, on which was a missile which would require somewhat more effort to get it launched. This pad was manned by the standby crew, and if they were on site, could usually be ready to launch in 20‚Äì30 minutes. If there was a third pad, it may not have a missile on it at all. If one of the off-duty crews could make it to the launch site in time, they would try to get a missile onto the launcher there, and get it ready to go. Since all launch sites were within just a few minutes flying time from the potential enemy, it was unlikely that the third missile would launch, but all crews had multiple practice drills during their periods as duty and standby crews, trying to reduce the time needed to get the missiles away. Often, these drills were accompanied by a flyover of a T-33 aircraft on which was mounted the MSQ-1 guidance system. (F-100 Super Sabres from the 36th and 50th TFWs were normally used for launch simulation exercises in Europe). This aircraft would fly over the launch pad at very low altitude and then simulate the flight profile of the missile under the control of the guidance crews. This gave the guidance crews practice controlling a missile in flight, as well as giving squadron officers some flight time. The Matador flight profile was very simple and predictable, which no doubt contributed to its demise. When the launch officer pressed the two launch switches, the JATO bottle fired, accelerating the missile to 250 miles per hour in the space of two and a half seconds. At this point the JATO bottle fell away and the missile continued on a preset heading and rate of climb until it was acquired by the guidance crews and their equipment. The missile had no altitude or speed control, continuing to fly as fast as possible, climbing as the fuel load was burned off, until it reached its maximum altitude. At a point about six miles (10 km) from the intended target, the guidance crews sent the \\"dump\\" signal, which caused the missile to nose over into what was called the \\"terminal dive\\". This dive was near vertical, continuing until the missile reached the preset detonation altitude as determined by the radio altimeter, at which point the weapon exploded. Should the radio altimeter fail, a backup barometric detonator was used; should that fail, there was an impact detonator. As with all missiles and bombers of the day, accuracy was not good in today's terms. Anything within a mile was considered a hit. Even though the missile was classified as a \\"tactical\\" weapon, in fact it was not technically capable of hitting individual targets, so it was likely targeted at cities near which a military installation such as an airfield existed. Actual targets were classified, and kept from everyone except the actual guidance officer. Variants and design stages * MX-771: Original U.S. Air Force project number. * SSM-A-1: Early proposed designation for operational missile. This designation was dropped before the first operational missiles were completed. * XSSM-A-1: First designation applied to first prototypes for development of the missile airframe. * YSSM-A-1: First designation applied to prototypes for development of the guidance system. * B-61: Operational designation proposed to supersede SSM-A-1 designation. This designation was designed to classify the missile as a pilotless bomber. * XB-61: Redesignation of the XSSM-A-1 * YB-61: Redesignation of the YSSM-A-1 * B-61A: First production version of the Matador. Principal difference from the XB-61 and YB-61 was redesign of the airframe with high wings in place of the previous mid-mounted wings. * TM-61A: Redesignation of the B-61A as the USAF decided to classify the Matador as a tactical missile instead of a pilotless bomber. * TM-61B: Significant redesign of the TM-61A, ultimately being redesignated as its own system, the TM-76 Mace. * TM-61C: Improved TM-61A developed as a stop-gap as the TM-61B was under development. * MGM-1C: Redesignation of the TM-61C in 1963 to meet new aircraft and missile designation standards adopted by the USAF. Only the TM-61C required redesignation as the TM-61A had been fully withdrawn from service and the TM-61B had been redesignated the TM-76 Mace, and ultimately received the MGM-13 designation.

He commissioned the house to be designed preferably without walls. Both Rietveld and Schr√∂der espoused progressive ideals that included \\"a fierce commitment to a new openness about relationships within their own families and to truth in their emotional lives. Bourgeois notions of respectability and propriety, with their emphasis on discipline, hierarchy, and containment would be eliminated through architectural design that countered each of these aspects in a conscious and systematic way.\\" Rietveld worked side by side with Schr√∂der-Schr√§der to create the house. He sketched the first possible design for the building; Schr√∂der- Schrader was not pleased. She envisioned a house that was free from association and could create a connection between the inside and outside. The house is one of the best known examples of De Stijl-architecture and arguably the only true De Stijl building. Mrs. Schr√∂der lived in the house until her death in 1985. The house was restored by Bertus Mulder and now is a museum open for visits, run by the Centraal Museum. It is a listed monument since 1976 and UNESCO World Heritage Site since 2000.  Architecture  The Rietveld Schr√∂der House constitutes both inside and outside a radical break with all architecture before it. The two-story house is situated in Utrecht, at the end of a terrace, but it makes no attempt to relate to its neighbouring buildings (although it shares an exterior wall with the last house in the terrace). It faces a motorway built in the 1960s. Architectural model, ca 1985 Inside there is no static accumulation of rooms, but a dynamic, changeable open zone. The ground floor can still be termed traditional; ranged around a central staircase are kitchen and three sit/bedrooms. Additionally, the house included a garage, which was very strange because Truus did not own a car. The living area upstairs, stated as being an attic to satisfy the fire regulations of the planning authorities, in fact forms a large open zone except for a separate toilet and a bathroom. Rietveld wanted to leave the upper level as it was. Mrs Schr√∂der, however, felt that as living space it should be usable in either form, open or subdivided. This was achieved with a system of sliding and revolving panels. Mrs Schr√∂der used these panels to open up the space of the second floor to allow more of an open area for her and her 3 children, leaving the option of closing or separating the rooms when desired. A sliding wall between the living area and the son's room blocks a cupboard as well as a light switch. Therefore, a circular opening was made within the sliding wall. When entirely partitioned in, the living level comprises three bedrooms, bathroom and living room. In-between this and the open state is a wide variety of possible permutations, each providing its own spatial experience. The \\"invisible corner\\" The facades are a collage of planes and lines whose components are purposely detached from, and seem to glide past, one another. This enabled the provision of several balconies. Like Rietveld's Red and Blue Chair, each component has its own form, position and colour. Colours were chosen as to strengthen the plasticity of the facades; surfaces in white and shades of grey, black window and doorframes, and a number of linear elements in primary colours. There is little distinction between interior and exterior space. The rectilinear lines and planes flow from outside to inside, with the same colour palette and surfaces. Even the windows are hinged so that they can only open 90 degrees to the wall, preserving strict design standards about intersecting planes, and further blurring the delineation of inside and out.  Construction  Initially, Rietveld wanted to construct the house out of concrete. It turned out that it would be too expensive to do that on such a small building. The foundations and the balconies were the only parts of the building that were made out of concrete. The walls were made of brick and plaster. The window frames and doors were made from wood as well as the floors, which were supported by wooden beams. To support the building, steel girders with wire mesh were used.  World Heritage Site  The World Heritage Committee inscribed the Rietveld Schr√∂der House on the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites on 2 December 2000, during the 24th session in Cairns, Australia. The committee decided to apply criterion i and ii, and said about the house:  Legacy  Only few years after construction of this building Polish architect Stanis≈Çaw Brukalski built his own househttps://zabytek.pl/pl/obiekty/warszawa-willa-barbary-i-stanislawa- brukalskich in Warsaw in 1929 supposedly inspired by Rietveld Schr√∂derhuis which he visited. His Polish example of modern house was awarded bronze medal in Paris expo in 1937.  Commemorations  The house was honored in two euro coins issued by the Royal Dutch Mint in 2013.

Selhurst Railway Depot  Selhurst Depot main entrance just opposite Selhurst station Selhurst Depot is located to the east of the Selhurst station and occupies a triangle of land which is bordered on one side by the Victoria Lines and on the other by the London Bridge Lines. It was built on the site of the former Croydon Common Athletic Ground, where Crystal Palace F.C. played Football League match between 1920 and 1924. The depot is operated by the Southern train operating company, and units serviced there include classes 171, 377, 455 plus numerous departmental units and a Class 09 shunter. Within the main office building is located Selhurst traincrew depot, where many drivers and conductors are based. The depot has extensive stabling sidings, the three main groups of which are known as: Chalk, AC (which were so named because that was where the trains of the former AC system were stabled) and North. There is a large maintenance shed, an AC test rig (for dual voltage units equipped with pantographs), a train wash plant, and a cleaning shed. At the north east corner of the site near to Norwood Junction station is the smaller Norwood drivers' depot, and beside it the diesel fuelling point. Selhurst is unusual in that the maximum speed within the depot is 15 mph rather than the usual 5 mph, and signalled train movements are permissive.

Autopoieses was in part about the recontextualization of samples, and the duo released their well-received debut record exploring these ideas in 1999 on Mille Plateaux. Ehlers' tested the solo waters with minimal house released as Auch and Betrieb from 2000 to 2005 on Force Inc. and Klang. In 2000 Ehlers released his first solo album under his own name, the dark and abstract Betrieb. Constructed primarily of manipulated samples of Arnold Sch√∂nberg and Charles Ives, Betrieb is steeped in theory, as evidenced by the Ehlers-penned liner notes. In 2001, Ehlers began recording a series of singles to serve as tributes to some of his aesthetic heroes. These singles, which included \\"Ekkehard Ehlers Plays Cornelius Cardew\\" and \\"Ekkehard Ehlers Plays John Cassavetes\\" were ultimately gathered together on the 2002 album Plays. This release brought Ehlers fame outside of experimental electronic music circles. He followed it with the far more abstract Politik Braucht Keinen Feind in 2003, and then with A Life Without Fear, which incorporated blues in a typically oblique way, in 2006. Since 2000 he started working on ballet scores for the choreographers William Forsythe and later Christoph Winkler and for Ulrich Rasche. Ehlers has curated Music festivals such as \\"under construction\\", \\"Audio Poverty\\" and \\"Lux Aeterna\\" and the Donaueschinger Musiktage 2020. He remixed the Red Hot Chili Peppers' single \\"Californication\\" and collaborated with the band on a couple of their live sets. Two live recordings have been made called Tuesday Night in Berlin and Thursday Night in Berlin. The remixed Californication and the 14 minute improvisation jam Tuesday Night in Berlin can be found on the second version of the Red Hot Chili Peppers' Fortune Faded single. The nearly 30 minute Thursday Night In Berlin has not been released officially although a bootleg has recently leaked onto the Internet.

It is well serviced with ferries passing between Patmos and Leros and on the main route for ferries from Piraeus. Leipsoi is a small group of islets at the northern part of the Dodecanese near to Patmos island and Leros. The larger Leipsi-Arkoi archipelago consists of some 37 islands and islets of which only three are larger than : Leipsoi (), Arkoi (, part of Patmos municipality) and Agreloussa (, part of Patmos municipality). Only Leipsoi, Arkoi and Marathos are inhabited. Leipsoi is a municipality, part of the Kalymnos regional unit, which is part of the South Aegean region. The municipality has an area of . In ancient times, it contained a town named Lepsia. Geography The island contains springs at Fountani, alias Pikri Nero, in the area near Kimissi along with other minor springs also flowing in this region. The Cave of Ontas dominates the settlement. A paved path carved into the hill connects the upper quarters of Kimissi with the lower ones. Economy Local products, namely thyme honey (produced the traditional way), wine, cheese, dairy products (touloumotyri cheese, the local version of mizithra) and grapes. Also loom-woven fabrics, carpets and \\"fookadia\\" (cloth pouches used to strain cheese). Moschato Bay in the north on this island has been spoilt by fish farming. The water in this bay is often very cloudy with fish farm wastage. The less protected beaches are not polluted and easily reached by the road network. Roads have recently been reconstructed using European Union funding. Landmarks Front, left to right: Arkoi, Leipsoi, Leros. Back, left to right: Agathonisi, Farmakonisi and the Turkey coastline. There are several churches and monasteries scattered around the island dedicated to a multitude of saints. These include the church of Aghios Nektarios, built in or about 1980 by father Nikiforos, the parochial priest of Lipsi at the time and a favorite baptistry for the inhabitants of the island. *Panaghia tou Harou: architectural style (purely islander, Byzantine in perception yet austere and unpretentious). Once specialists decide to study this construction more closely, there may be some interesting conclusions drawn relating to the time the church was built (some time between the 7th and 8th century AD. **There is a holy icon of the Virgin in this church, reputed to be of miraculous powers, depicting Mary holding Jesus Crucified. The uniqueness of the concept and the artfulness of the rendition make of this icon one of the brightest moments in hagiography. *Aghios Ioannis Theologos (St. John Evangelist), whose construction was financed by Lipsian emigrants. The church of Kimissis tis Theotokou (Dormition of Mary), dominating the little bay bearing the same name. Also to be found there are reliquaries containing the remains of monks reduced to martyrdom, slain by the Turks during the Ottoman rule. Five of those monks have recently been glorified (canonized) by decree of the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople. *The church of Panaghia (the Virgin) at Kouselio, built on the foundations of an early Christian church. Embedded in the walls of this church - and therefore still to be uncovered - are inscription-bearing marbles of that earlier construction that were later used as building material for the new church. There are also two churches dedicated to St. Nicholas on the hills on either side of the mouth of the port, along with the churches of Aghios Theologos tou Moschatou (17th century), Aghios Spiridion (at Katsadia), Profitis Ilias - a church dedicated to Prophet Elijah and built on top of a hill dominating the port, in accordance with the perennial tradition of churches dedicated to this Prophet to be built in elevated locations.

He is the Gustavus F. and Ann M. Swift Distinguished Service Professor in History, and the former chair of the history department at the University of Chicago. He specializes in modern Korean history and contemporary international relations. In May 2007, Cumings was the first recipient of the Kim Dae Jung Academic Award for Outstanding Achievements and Scholarly Contributions to Democracy, Human Rights and Peace granted by South Korea. The award is named in honor of 2000 Nobel Peace Prize winner and former President of South Korea Kim Dae Jung. The award recognizes Cumings for his \\"outstanding scholarship, and engaged public activity regarding human rights and democratization during the decades of dictatorship in Korea, and after the dictatorship ended in 1987.\\" Cumings' Origins of the Korean War, Vol. 1 (1980) won the John K. Fairbank Prize of the American Historical Association, and his Origins of the Korean War, Vol. 2 (1991) won the Quincy Wright Book Award of the International Studies Association. Biography Cumings was born in Rochester, New York, on September 5, 1943. He was raised in Iowa and Ohio, where his father, Edgar C. Cumings, was a college administrator. He worked summers for five years, three of them at the Republic Steel plant in Cleveland, to put himself through Denison University, with further help from a baseball scholarship. He graduated with a degree in Psychology in 1965, then served in the Peace Corps in Korea in 1967‚Äì68 before taking an M.A. at Indiana University. He then earned a Ph.D. in Political Science from Columbia University in 1975. He taught at Swarthmore College, University of Washington, Northwestern University, and University of Chicago. In 1999 he was elected Fellow, American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He is married to Meredith Jung-En Woo, the president of Sweet Briar College and former Dean of Arts & Sciences at the University of Virginia. They had two sons; additionally, Cumings has a daughter from his first marriage. Intellectual life and scholarship Cumings joined the Committee of Concerned Asian Scholars at Columbia after Mark Selden formed a chapter there, Pdf. and published extensively in its journal, Bulletin of Concerned Asian Scholars, where his writings ranged from the early history of the Korean resistance movement against Japan to the intertwining of US academia with US intelligence agencies. His research focus is on 20th century international history, United States and East Asia relations, East Asian political economy, modern Korean history, and American foreign relations. He is interested in the \\"multiplicity of ways that conceptions, metaphors and discourses are related to political economy and material forms of production\\", and to relations between \\"East and West\\".Washington University, St. Louis, Missouri East Asian Studies, Newsletter Spring 2001 Cumings' scholarship has gone deeper than any other writing in English with respect to the circumstances surrounding the outbreak of the Korean War, and pre-1990 documents which allowed him to draw lines of culpability of various actors for the tragedy of the Korean War. Cumings writes that: '' '' Cumings has not confined himself purely to the study of modern Korea, writing broadly about East Asia, and even US western expansion in book form. He wrote Industrial Behemoth: The Northeast Asian Political Economy in the 20th Century, which seeks to understand the industrialization of Japan, both Koreas, Taiwan, and parts of China, and the ways that scholars and political leaders have viewed that development. Cumings writes in his book North Korea: Another Country: \\"I have no sympathy for the North, which is the author of most of its own troubles\\", but alludes to the \\"significant responsibility that all Americans share for the garrison state that emerged on the ashes of our truly terrible destruction of the North half a century ago.\\" In a talk given at the University of Chicago in 2003, Cumings declared that the United States had \\"occupied\\" South Korea for 58 years. In 1945, he explained, Chinese and Soviet armies were in the North of Korea, Americans in the South. The Soviets withdrew in 1948 and the Chinese in 1958, but U.S. troops remained in South Korea; in the event of war the U.S. commander would control the South Korean army. He disputed the contention that North Korea had cheated on the October 1994 Agreed Framework. Reception In 2003, the University of Chicago awarded Cumings for \\"Excellence in Graduate Teaching.\\" Four years later, he was awarded the Kim Dae Jung Prize for \\"Scholarly Contributions to Democracy, Human Rights, and Peace.\\"https://history.uchicago.edu/directory/bruce-cumings Cumings has been described as \\"the left's leading scholar of Korean history.\\" Anders Lewis, The Historian Who Defends North Korea History News Network December 30, 2003. Reprinted from FrontPage Magazine. Scholars have called his work revisionist. Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies scholar Kathryn Weathersby wrote that Cumings‚Äô two-volume study of the origins of the Korean War was the \\"most important revisionist account,\\" and she reports Cumings' conclusions that \\"the question remains open whether it was in fact the DPRK or the ROK that initiated the military action on 25 June 1950.\\" Soviet Aims in Korea and the Origins of the Korean War Working Paper No 8 Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars November 1993 University of Georgia historian William W. Stueck agreed that Cumings' work was \\"revisionist\\", and did not find it convincing, but said \\"I do not regard revisionism as a pejorative label... That usage simply has to do with the time frame within which the arguments became prominent among American scholars.\\" Cumings, Stueck continued, published more than a generation after the start of the war and his arguments \\"challenged the views that the war was largely international in nature and that the American participation in it was ‚Äì with at least one prominent exception ‚Äì defensive and wise.‚Äù Revisionism and the Korean War Journal of Conflict Studies 22.1 (2002): 17‚Äì27 Historian Allan R. Millet argued that the work's \\"eagerness to cast American officials and policy in the worst possible light, however, often leads him to confuse chronological cause and effect and to leap to judgments that cannot be supported by the documentation he cites or ignores.\\" Allan R. Millet, The War for Korea 1945‚Äì1950: A House Burning (University Press of Kansas, 2005) Cumings himself has rejected the \\"revisionist\\" label.Bruce Cumings replies to Kathryn Weathersby LBO-Talk Archives, July 1995 Matt Gordon in Socialist Review praised Cumings' North Korea: Another Country (2003) as a \\"good read ... for an introduction to this member of 'the axis of evil', especially given the lack of books on the subject which aren't hysterical denunciations from the U.S. right or hymns of praise from Stalinists.\\" Reviewing The Korean War (2010) William Stueck wrote that \\"Cumings displays a limited grasp of sources that have emerged since he published his second volume on the war's origins in 1990\\", and that readers \\"wanting an up-to-date account of the war in all its complexity should look elsewhere \\".

Notably seminal Nordicist works include Madison Grant's book The Passing of the Great Race (1916), Arthur de Gobineau's An Essay on the Inequality of the Human Races (1853), and Houston Stewart Chamberlain's The Foundations of the Nineteenth Century (1899). The ideology became popular in the late-19th and early-20th centuries in Northwestern, Central, and Northern European countries as well as in North America and Australia. The idea of a Nordic phenotype being superior to others was originally embraced as \\"Teutonicism\\" in Germany, \\"Anglo-Saxonism\\" in England and the United States, and \\"Frankisism\\" in Northern France. The notion of the superiority of the \\"Nordic race\\" and of the Northwestern European nations that were associated with this supposed race influenced the United States' Immigration Act of 1924 (which effectively banned or severely limited the immigration of Italians, Jews, and other Southern and Eastern Europeans) and the later Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, and it was also present in other countries outside Northwestern Europe such as Australia, Canada, and South Africa. By the 1930s, the Nazis claimed that the Nordic race was the most superior branch of the \\"Aryan race\\" and constituted a master race (Herrenvolk). Background Meyers Blitz- Lexikon (Leipzig, 1932) shows German war hero Karl von M√ºller as an example of the Nordic type In the mid-19th century, scientific racism developed the theory of Aryanism, holding that Europeans (\\"Aryans\\") were an innately superior branch of humanity , responsible for most of its greatest achievements. Aryanism was derived from the idea that the original speakers of the Indo-European languages constituted a distinctive race or subrace of the larger Caucasian race. Its principal proponent was Arthur de Gobineau in his Essay on the Inequality of the Human Races (1855). Though Gobineau did not equate Nordic people with Aryans, he argued that Germanic people were the best modern representatives of the Aryan race. Adapting the comments of Tacitus and other Roman writers, he argued that \\"pure\\" Northerners regenerated Europe after the Roman Empire declined due to racial \\"dilution\\" of its leadership. By the 1880s a number of linguists and anthropologists argued that the Aryans themselves had originated somewhere in northern Europe. Theodor Poesche proposed that the Aryans originated in the vast Rokitno, or Pinsk Marshes, then in the Russian Empire, now covering much of the southern part of Belarus and the north-west of the Ukraine, but it was Karl Penka who popularised the idea that the Aryans had emerged in Scandinavia and could be identified by the distinctive Nordic characteristics of blond hair and blue eyes. The biologist Thomas Henry Huxley agreed with him, coining the term Xanthochroi to refer to fair-skinned Europeans, as opposed to darker Mediterranean people, whom Huxley called Melanochroi. It was Huxley who also concluded that the Melanochroi (People of the Mediterranean race), who he described as \\"dark whites\\", are of a mixture of the Xanthochroi and Australioids. This distinction was repeated by Charles Morris in his book The Aryan Race (1888), which argued that the original Aryans could be identified by their blond hair and other Nordic features, such as dolichocephaly (long skull). The argument was given extra impetus by the French anthropologist Vacher de Lapouge in his book L‚ÄôAryen, in which he argued that the \\"dolichocephalic-blond\\" people were natural leaders, destined to rule over more brachycephalic (short-skulled) people. The philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche also referred in his writings to \\"blond beasts\\": amoral adventurers who were supposed to be the progenitors of creative cultures. In On the Genealogy of Morals (1887), he wrote, \\"In Latin malus ... could indicate the vulgar man as the dark one, especially as the black-haired one, as the pre-Aryan dweller of the Italian soil which distinguished itself most clearly through his colour from the blonds who became their masters, namely the Aryan conquering race.\\" By the early 20th century the concept of a \\"masterly\\" Nordic race had become familiar enough that the British psychologist William McDougall, writing in 1920, stated: > Among all the disputes and uncertainties of the ethnographers about the > races of Europe, one fact stands out clearly‚Äînamely, that we can distinguish > a race of northerly distribution and origin, characterised physically by > fair colour of hair and skin and eyes, by tall stature and dolichocephaly > (i.e. long shape of head), and mentally by great independence of character, > individual initiative and tenacity of will. Many names have been used to > denote this type, ... . It is also called the Nordic type. Nordicists claimed that Nordics had formed upper tiers of ancient civilisations, even in the Mediterranean civilisations of antiquity, which had declined once this dominant race had been assimilated. Thus they argued that ancient evidence suggested that leading Romans like Nero, Sulla and Cato were blond or red-haired.\\"All these are roads taken by Nordic tribes: by the Phrygians to Troy and Asia Minor; by the Nordic Hellenes to Greece; by the Nordic Italics (Romans) to Italy; by the Nordic Kelts to France and Spain. To these lands these tribes bring their Indo-European languages, and as the ruling class force them on to the subject, mainly Mediterranean, lower orders.\\",. Some Nordicists admitted the Mediterranean race was superior to the Nordic in terms of artistic ability. However, the Nordic race was regarded as superior on the basis that, although Mediterranean peoples were culturally sophisticated, it was the Nordics who were alleged to be the innovators and conquerors, having an adventurous spirit that no other race could match.. The Alpine race was usually regarded as inferior to both the Nordic and Mediterranean races, making up the traditional peasant class of Europe while Nordics occupied the aristocracy and led the world in technology, and Mediterraneans were regarded as more imaginative.According to Madision Grant, \\"The Nordics are, all over the world, a race of soldiers, sailors, adventurers and explorers, but above all, of rulers, organisers and aristocrats in sharp contrast to the essentially peasant character of the Alpines ... The mental characteristics of the Mediterranean race are well known, and this race, while inferior in bodily stamina to both the Nordic and the Alpine, is probably the superior of both, certainly of the Alpines, in intellectual attainments.\\" Grant accepts that Mediterraneans created Semitic and Egyptian cultures, but insisted that Greece was \\"invigorated\\" by Nordics, and that \\"Roman ideals of family life, loyalty and truth, point clearly to a Nordic rather than to a Mediterranean origin\\" Opponents of Nordicism rejected these arguments. The anti-Nordicist writer Giuseppe Sergi argued in his influential book The Mediterranean Race (1901) that there was no evidence that the upper tiers of ancient societies were Nordic, insisting that historical and anthropological evidence contradicted such claims. Sergi argued that Mediterraneans constituted \\"the greatest race in the world\\", with a creative edge absent in the Nordic race. According to him, they were the creators of all the major ancient civilisations, from Mesopotamia to Rome. This argument was later repeated by C. G. Seligman, who wrote that \\"it must, I think, be recognised that the Mediterranean race has actually more achievement to its credit than any other\\". Even Carleton Coon insisted that among Greeks \\"the Nordic element is weak, as it probably has been since the days of Homer ... It is my personal reaction to the living Greeks that their continuity with their ancestors of the ancient world is remarkable, rather than the opposite.\\" In the United States In the United States, the primary spokesman for Nordicism was the eugenicist Madison Grant. His 1916 book, The Passing of the Great Race, or the Racial Basis of European History about Nordicism was highly influential among racial thinking and government policy making. Grant used the theory as justification for immigration policies of the 1920s, arguing that the immigrants from certain areas of Europe, such as Italians and other Southern Europeans and Eastern Europeans, represented a lesser type of European and their numbers in the United States should not be increased. Grant and others urged this as well as the complete restriction of non-Europeans, such as the Chinese and Japanese. Grant argued the Nordic race had been responsible for most of humanity's great achievements (he lists Dante, Raphael, Titian, Michelangelo, and Leonardo da Vinci as examples of Nordics). Admixture was \\"race suicide\\" and unless eugenic policies were enacted, the Nordic race would be supplanted by inferior races. Future president Calvin Coolidge agreed, stating \\"Biological laws tell us that certain divergent people will not mix or blend. The Nordics propagate themselves successfully. With other races, the outcome shows deterioration on both sides.\\" Grant argues that Nordics founded the United States and the English \\"language\\", and formed the ruling classes of ancient Greece and Rome. An analysis performed by Grant alleges that Northwestern Europeans are less criminal than Southern and Eastern Europeans (see also Race and crime). The Immigration Act of 1924 was signed into law by President Coolidge. This was designed to reduce the number of immigrants from Southern Europe, Southeast Europe, Eastern Europe and Russia, exclude Asian immigrants altogether, and favour immigration from Great Britain, Ireland, Germany and Scandinavia, while also permitting immigration from Latin America. The spread of these ideas also affected popular culture. F. Scott Fitzgerald invokes Grant's ideas through a character in part of The Great Gatsby, and Hilaire Belloc jokingly rhapsodized the \\"Nordic man\\" in a poem and essay in which he satirised the stereotypes of Nordics, Alpines and Mediterraneans. Nordicist thought in Germany Hans F. K. G√ºnther (1891‚Äì1968), prominent German racial theorist who helped to popularise Nordicism in his country. In Germany the influence of Nordicism remained powerful. There it was known under the term \\"Nordischer Gedanke\\" (Nordic thought). This phrase was coined by the German eugenicists Erwin Baur, Eugen Fischer and Fritz Lenz. It appeared in their 1921 work Human Heredity, which insisted on the innate superiority of the Nordic race., Volume II, page 273 see: Lutzh√∂ft 1971:15 Adapting the arguments of Arthur Schopenhauer and others to Darwinian theory, they argued that the qualities of initiative and will-power identified by earlier writers had arisen from natural selection, because of the tough landscape in which Nordic peoples evolved. This had ensured that weaker individuals had not survived. This argument was derived from earlier eugenicist and Social Darwinist ideas. According to the authors, the Nordic race arose in the ice age, from: They went on to argue that \\"the original Indo-Germanic civilisation\\" was carried by Nordic migrants down to India, and that the physiognomy of upper caste Indians \\"disclose a Nordic origin\\".Cumming, M. (2013). Human heredity: Principles and issues. .Hagemann, R. (2000). Pionier der genetik und zuchtungsforschung : seine wissenschaftlichen leistungen und ihre ausstrahlung auf genetik, biologie und zuchtungsforschung von heute. R. Kovar. By this time, Germany was well-accustomed to theories of race and racial superiority due to the long presence of the V√∂lkisch movement, the philosophy that Germans constituted a unique people, or volk, linked by common blood. While Volkism was popular mainly among Germany's lower classes and was more a romanticised version of ethnic nationalism, Nordicism attracted German anthropologists and eugenicists. Hans F. K. G√ºnther, one of Fischer's students, first defined \\"Nordic thought\\" in his programmatic book Der Nordische Gedanke unter den Deutschen.Lutzh√∂ft 1971:15 He became the most influential German in this field. His Short Ethnology of the German People (1929) was very widely circulated. In his Rassenkunde des deutschen Volkes (Race-Lore of the German Volk), published 1922, G√ºnther identified five principal European races instead of three, adding the East Baltic race and Dinaric race to Ripley's categories. He used the term Ostic instead of Alpine. He focused on their supposedly distinct mental attributes. G√ºnther criticised the V√∂lkish idea, stating that the Germans were not racially unified, but were actually one of the most racially diverse peoples in Europe. Despite this, many V√∂lkists who merged V√∂lkism and Nordicism embraced G√ºnther's ideas, most notably the Nazis. =Nazi Nordicism= Adolf Hitler was a proponent of the concept of the Aryan race and Aryanism. He viewed the Nordic racial subtype as being at the top of the racial hierarchy within the Aryan race. Adolf Hitler read Human Heredity shortly before he wrote Mein Kampf, and called it scientific proof of the racial basis of civilisation. Its arguments were also repeated by the Nazi ideologist Alfred Rosenberg, in his book The Myth of the Twentieth Century (1930). Nazi racial theories held the Atlanteans to be a race of Nordic supermen, and Alfred Rosenberg wrote of a \\"Nordic-Atlantean\\" master race whose civilisation was lost through inward corruption and betrayal. According to Rosenberg, the Nordic race had evolved in a now-lost landmass off the coast of Europe, perhaps mythical Atlantis, migrated through northern Europe and expanded further south to Iran and India where it founded the Aryan cultures of Zoroastrianism and Hinduism. Like Grant and others, he argued that the entrepreneurial energy of the Nordics had \\"degenerated\\" when they mixed with \\"inferior\\" peoples. With the rise of Hitler, Nordic theory became the norm within German culture. In some cases the \\"Nordic\\" concept became an almost abstract ideal rather than a mere racial category. For example, Hermann Gauch wrote in 1933 (in a book which was banned in the Third Reich) that the fact that \\"birds can be taught to talk better than other animals is explained by the fact that their mouths are Nordic in structure.\\" He further claimed that in humans, \\"the shape of the Nordic gum allows a superior movement of the tongue, which is the reason why Nordic talking and singing are richer.\\" Such views were extreme, but more mainstream Nordic theory was institutionalised. Hans F. K. G√ºnther, who joined the Nazi Party in 1932, was praised as a pioneer in racial thinking, a shining light of Nordic theory. Most official Nazi comments on the Nordic Race were based on G√ºnther's works, and Alfred Rosenberg presented G√ºnther with a medal for his work in anthropology. Robert Ley, the head of the German Labour Front and of the Nazi Party organisation, stated in 1935 concerning racial purity and the Nordic race: > Who of us is racially pure? Even if somebody's appearance is Nordic he might > be a bastard inside. That somebody is blond and blue-eyed does not mean that > he is racially pure. He might even be a degenerate coward. Bastardization > shows in different aspects. We have to be on our guard against racial > arrogance. Racial arrogance would be as devastating as hatred among > classes.Tatsachen ‚Äì Die Leipziger DAF-Tagung 2.-6.Dez. 1935, Published by > the German Labour Front, Printed by Buch- und Tiefdruck GmbH, 1935. Dr. > Robert Ley: Fatherland, Race, Discipline and Love of Life. Original text in > German: \\"Wer von uns ist reinrassisch? Selbst die, die √§u√üerlich nordisch > aussehen, sind vielleicht innerlich Bastarde. Das kann man nicht festlegen. > Weil er blond und blau√§ugig ist, deshalb ist er noch kein reinrassischer > Mensch. Er kann sogar innerlich feig und verkommen sein. Dann offenbart sich > seine Bastardisierung irgendwo anders. Wir m√ºssen uns vor einem Rassend√ºnkel > h√ºten. Rassend√ºnkel w√ºrde genau so verheerend sein wie der Klassenhass. Eugen Fischer and Fritz Lenz were also appointed to senior positions overseeing the policy of Racial Hygiene. Madison Grant's book was the first non-German book to be translated and published by the Nazi Reich press, and Grant proudly displayed to his friends a letter from Hitler claiming that the book was \\"his Bible.\\" The Nazi state used such ideas about the differences between European races as part of their various discriminatory and coercive policies which culminated in the Holocaust. Ironically, in Grant's first edition of his popular book, he classified the Germans as being primarily Nordic, but in his second edition, published after the USA had entered World War I, he had re-classified the now enemy power as being dominated by \\"inferior\\" Alpines. G√ºnther's work agreed with Grant's, and the German anthropologist frequently stated that the Germans are not a fully Nordic people.. Hitler himself was later to downplay the importance of Nordicism in public for this very reason.. The standard tripartite model placed most of the population of Hitler's Germany in the Alpine category, especially after the Anschluss. J. Kaup led a movement opposed to G√ºnther. Kaup took the view that a German nation, all of whose citizens belonged to a \\"German race\\" in a populationist sense, offered a more convenient sociotechnical tool than G√ºnther's concept of an ideal Nordic type to which only a very few Germans could belong. Nazi legislation identifying the ethnic and \\"racial\\" affinities of the Jews reflects the populationist concept of race. Discrimination was not restricted to Jews who belonged to the \\"Oriental-Armenoid\\" race, but was directed against all members of the Jewish ethnic population.The Racial Analysis of Human Populations in Relation to Their Ethnogenesis Andrzej Wiercinski; Tadeusz Bielicki, Current Anthropology, Vol. 3, No. 1. (February 1962), pp. 2+9-46. The German Jewish journalist Kurt Caro (1905‚Äì1979) who emigrated to Paris in 1933 and served in the British Army from 1943, published a book under the pseudonym Manuel Humbert claiming to unmask Hitler's \\"Mein Kampf\\" in which he stated the following racial composition of the Jewish population of Central Europe: 23,8% Lapponid race, 21,5% Nordic race, 20,3% Armenoid race, 18,4% Mediterranean race, 16,0% Oriental race.Hitlers \\"Mein Kampf\\". Dichtung und Wahrheit by Manuel Humbert (Kurt Michael Caro) Paris 1936. page 139. By 1939 Hitler had abandoned Nordicist rhetoric in favour of the idea that the German people as a whole were united by distinct \\"spiritual\\" qualities. Nevertheless, Nazi eugenics policies continued to favour Nordics over Alpines and other racial groups, particularly during the war when decisions were being made about the incorporation of conquered peoples into the Reich.The Lebensborn program sought to extend the Nordic race. In 1942 Hitler stated in private, > I shall have no peace of mind until I have planted a seed of Nordic blood > wherever the population stand in need of regeneration. If at the time of the > migrations, while the great racial currents were exercising their influence, > our people received so varied a share of attributes, these latter blossomed > to their full value only because of the presence of the Nordic racial > nucleus.Trevor-Roper, Hugh, Hitler's Table Talk, 1941‚Äì44, 1973 edition, p. > 475 (12 May 1942) In his \\"table talk\\", Hitler described how the presence of German and English soldiers in the combat areas he served in during World War I had, in his view, improved the quality of the young people he saw there in 1940, in a \\"Nordicizing process, the results of which are today [according to Hitler] incontestable.\\" He also said he observed the same process at work in the area of his mountain home near Berchtesgaden, which he described as having, when he first came there, a mongrel population, the quality of which was much improved by the presence of his SS Bodyguard Regiment, which was responsible for \\"the numbers of strong and healthy children running around the area.\\" Hitler went on to say that \\"[This] shows that elite troops should really be sent wherever the composition of the people is poor, in order to improve it.\\"Schramm, Percy Ernst (1978) \\"The Anatomy of a Dictator\\" in Hitler: The Man and the Military Leader. Detwiler, Donald S., ed. Malabar, Florida: Robert E. Kreiger Publishing Company. p.37. ; originally published as the introduction to Picker, Henry (1963) Hitlers Tischgespr√§che im F√ºhrerhauptquarter (\\"Hitler's Table Talk\\") Indeed, Hitler and Himmler planned to use the SS ‚Äì a racial elite chosen on the basis of \\"pure\\" Nordic qualities ‚Äì as the basis for the racial \\"regeneration\\" of Europe following the final victory of Nazism. Addressing officers of the SS-Leibstandarte \\"Adolf Hitler\\" Himmler stated: > The ultimate aim for those 11 years during which I have been the > Reichsfuehrer SS has been invariably the same: to create an order of good > blood which is able to serve Germany; which unfailingly and without sparing > itself can be made use of because the greatest losses can do no harm to the > vitality of this order, the vitality of these men, because they will always > be replaced; to create an order which will spread the idea of Nordic blood > so far that we will attract all Nordic blood in the world, take away the > blood from our adversaries, absorb it so that never again, looking at it > from the viewpoint of grand policy, Nordic blood, in great quantities and to > an extent worth mentioning, will fight against us. Nordicist thought in Italy In Italy, the influence of Nordicism had a divisive effect in which the influence resulted in Northern Italians who regarded themselves to have Nordic racial heritage considered themselves a civilised people while negatively regarding Southern Italians as non-Nordic and therefore biologically inferior.Gerald R. Gems. Sport and the Shaping of Italian American Identity. Syracuse University Press, 2013. P57. Nordicism was controversial in Italy because of common Nordicist perceptions of Mediterranean people, and especially southern Italians, being racially degenerate. The distinction between a superior northern Italy and a degenerate and an inferior southern Italy was promoted by the Neapolitan Carlo Formichi, the Vice-President of the Italian Academy, who in 1921 said that Italy needed \\"a great revolution ..., a return to the genius of the noble Aryan race, which is after all our race, but that has been overcome by the Semitic civilisation and mentality\\".Graham Bradshaw, Tom Bishop, Alexander C. Y. Huang, and Jonathan Gil Harris. The Shakespearean International Yearbook. Ashgate Publishing, 2011. Pp. 203. At least some of the stereotypes about Southern Italians were created by Cesare Lombroso, an Italian Jewish criminologist and anthropologist of Sephardic descent.Napoleone Colajanni, Ire e spropositi di Cesare Lombroso, Filippo Tropea editore, Catania, 1890Francesca Chirico, Linkiesta 11 novembre 2012, rifGian Antonio Stella, Corriere della Sera, 28 aprile 2009, http://www.corriere.it/cultura/09_aprile_28/stella_lombroso_catalogo_assurdita_8bd638b2-33c2-11de-8558-00144f02aabc.shtmlDuccio Canestrini, dicembre 2009, G. L. Mosse, Il razzismo in Europa, Editori Laterza, Bari 2010, pp. 92‚Äì93 For his controversial theories, Lombroso was expelled from the Italian Society of Anthropology and Ethnology in 1882. The Lombrosian doctrine is currently considered pseudoscientific. =Fascist Nordicism= Benito Mussolini. Mussolini was initially a strong proponent of Mediterraneanism; however with the rise in influence of pro-Nordicist Nazism, Mussolini promoted Aryanism and recognised Italians as having Nordic- Mediterranean heritage. Italian Fascism's stance towards Nordicism changed from being initially hostile to being favourable. Italian Fascism strongly rejected the common Nordicist conception of the Aryan race that idealised \\"pure\\" Aryans as having certain physical traits that were defined as Nordic, such as fair skin, blond hair and light eyes.Aaron Gillette. Racial Theories in Fascist Italy. London, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: Routledge, 2001. Pp. 188. The antipathy by Mussolini and other Italian Fascists to Nordicism was over the existence of what they viewed as the Mediterranean inferiority complex that they claimed had been instilled into Mediterraneans by the propagation of such theories by German and British Nordicists who viewed Mediterranean peoples as racially degenerate and thus in their view inferior. However traditional Nordicist claims of Mediterraneans being degenerate due to having a darker colour of skin than Nordics had long been rebuked in anthropology through the depigmentation theory that claimed that lighter skinned peoples had been dipigmented from a darker skin. This theory has since become a widely accepted view in anthropology.Alan W. Ertl. Toward an Understanding of Europe:A Political Economic Pr√©cis of Continental Integration. Boca Raton, Florida, USA: Universal Publishers, 2008. P. 8. Anthropologist Carleton S. Coon in his work The races of Europe (1939) subscribed to depigmentation theory that claimed that Nordic race's light- coloured skin was the result of depigmentation from their ancestors of the Mediterranean race.Melville Jacobs, Bernhard Joseph Stern. General anthropology. Barnes & Noble, 1963. P. 57. Mussolini refused to allow Italy to return again to this inferiority complex, initially rejecting Nordicism. In the early 1930s, with the rise to power of the Nazi Party in Germany with Hitler's emphasis on a Nordicist conception of the Aryan race, strong tensions arose between the Fascists and the Nazis over racial issues. In 1934, in the aftermath of Austrian Nazis killing Austrian Chancellor Engelbert Dollfuss, an ally of Italy, Mussolini became enraged and responded by angrily denouncing Nazism. Mussolini rebuked Nazism's Nordicism, claiming that the Nazis' emphasizing of a common Nordic \\"Germanic race\\" was absurd, saying \\"a Germanic race does not exist. ... We repeat. Does not exist. Scientists say so. Hitler says so.\\"Aaron Gillette. Racial Theories in Fascist Italy. London, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: Routledge, 2002. P. 45. That Germans were not purely Nordic was indeed acknowledged by Nazi racial theorist Hans F. K. G√ºnther in his book Rassenkunde des deutschen Volkes (1922) (\\"Racial Science of the German People\\"), where G√ºnther recognized Germans as being composed of five Aryan subtype races: Nordic, Mediterranean, Dinaric, Alpine and East Baltic while asserting that the Nordics were the highest in a racial hierarchy of the five subtypes.Anne Maxwell. Picture Imperfect: Photography and Eugenics, 1870‚Äì1940. Eastbourne, England: UK; Portland, Oregon, USA: SUSSEX ACADEMIC PRESS, 2008, 2010. P. 150. By 1936, the tensions between Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany reduced and relations became more amicable. In 1936, Mussolini decided to launch a racial programme in Italy, and was interested in the racial studies being conducted by Giulio Cogni.Aaron Gillette. Racial Theories in Fascist Italy. London, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: Routledge, 2002. P. 60. Cogni was a Nordicist but did not equate Nordic identity with Germanic identity as was commonly done by German Nordicists.Aaron Gillette. Racial Theories in Fascist Italy. London, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: Routledge, 2002. P. 61. Cogni had travelled to Germany where he had become impressed by Nazi racial theory and sought to create his own version of racial theory.Aaron Gillette. Racial Theories in Fascist Italy. London, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: Routledge, 2002. P. 59-60. On 11 September 1936, Cogni sent Mussolini a copy of his newly published book Il Razzismo (1936). Cogni declared the racial affinity of the Mediterranean and Nordic racial subtypes of the Aryan race and claimed that the intermixing of Nordic Aryans and Mediterranean Aryans in Italy produced a superior synthesis of Aryan Italians. Cogni addressed the issue of racial differences between northern and southern Italians, declaring southern Italians were mixed between Aryan and non-Aryan races, that he claimed was most likely due to infiltration by Asiatic peoples in Roman times and later Arab invasions. As such, Cogni viewed Southern Italian Mediterraneans as being polluted with orientalizing tendencies. He would later change his idea and claim that Nordics and Southern Italians were closely related groups both racially and spiritually. His opinion was that they were generally responsible for what is the best in European civilization. Initially Mussolini was not impressed with Cogni's work, however Cogni's ideas entered into the official Fascist racial policy several years later. In 1938 Mussolini was concerned that if Italian Fascism did not recognise Nordic heritage within Italians, that the Mediterranean inferiority complex would return to Italian society. Therefore, in summer 1938, the Fascist government officially recognised Italians as having Nordic heritage and being of Nordic-Mediterranean descent and in a meeting with PNF members, and in June 1938 in a meeting with PNF members, Mussolini identified himself as Nordic and declared that previous policy of focus on Mediterraneanism was to be replaced by a focus on Aryanism. Mussolini in July 1938 declared that Italians had strong Nordic heritage particularly through the heritage of the Germanic tribe of the Lombards who conquered Italy after the collapse of the Roman Empire and claimed that the intermixing of Mediterranean Romans with the Nordic Lombards was the last significant racial mixing that occurred in Italy and that none had occurred since.Christopher Hibbert. Mussolini: The Rise and Fall of Il Duce. Palgrave MacMillan, 2008. P. 86. Post-Nazi re-evaluation and decline of Nordicism Even before the rise of Nazism, Grant's concept of \\"race\\" lost favour in the USA in the polarising political climate after World War I, including the Great Migration and the Great Depression. By the 1930s, criticism of the Nordicist model was growing in Britain and America. The British historian Arnold J. Toynbee in A Study of History (1934) argued that the most dynamic civilisations have arisen from racially mixed cultures. This required the abandonment of Grant's gradations of \\"white\\" in favour of the \\"One-drop rule\\"‚Äîwhich was embraced by white supremacists and black leaders alike. Among the latter were Marcus Garvey, and, in part, W. E. B. Du Bois, at least in his later thought. With the rise of Nazism many critics pointed to the flaws in the theory, repeating the arguments made by Sergi and others that the evidence of ancient Nordic achievement is thin when set against the civilizations of the Mediterranean and elsewhere. The equation of Nordic and Aryan identity was also widely criticized. In 1936 M. W. Fodor, writing in The Nation, claimed that racialized Germanic nationalism arose from an inferiority complex: > No race has suffered so much from an inferiority complex as has the German. > National Socialism was a kind of Cou√© method of converting the inferiority > complex, at least temporarily, into a feeling of superiority. Some Lombard nationalists took it up in Italy, but even after the establishment of Benito Mussolini's fascist government racial theories were not prominent. Mussolini stated, \\"Nothing will ever make me believe that biologically pure races can be shown to exist.\\" After World War II, the categorisation of peoples into \\"superior\\" and \\"inferior\\" groups fell even further out of political and scientific favour, eventually leading to the characterisation of such theories as scientific racism. The tripartite subdivision of \\"Caucasians\\" into Nordic, Alpine and Mediterranean groups persisted among some scientists into the 1960s, notably in Carleton Coon's book The Origin of Races (1962). Already race academics such as A. James Gregor were heavily criticising Nordicism. In 1961 Gregor called it a \\"philosophy of despair\\", on the grounds that its obsession with purity doomed it to ultimate pessimism and isolationism. As late as 1977 the Swedish author Bertil Lundman wrote a book The Races and Peoples of Europe mentioning a \\"Nordid Race\\". The development of the Kurgan theory of Indo-European origins challenged the Nordicist equation of Aryan and Nordic identity, since it placed the earliest Indo-European speakers around central Asia and/or far- eastern Europe (although according to the Kurgan hypothesis some Proto-Indo- Europeans did eventually migrate into Central and Northern Europe and become the ancestors of the Nordic peoples.) The original German term used by Ripley, \\"Theodiscus\\", which is translated into English as Teutonic, has fallen out of favour amongst German-speaking scholars, and is restricted to a somewhat ironical usage similar to the archaic teutsch, if used at all. While the term is still present in English, which has retained it in some contexts as a translation of the traditional Latin Teutonicus (most notably the aforementioned Teutonic Order), it should not be translated into German as \\"Teutonisch\\" except when referring to the historical Teutones.

The term is usually used to describe openings beginning with 1.d4 where White does not play the Queen's Gambit. The most common Queen's Pawn Game openings are: * The London System, 2.Bf4 or 2.Nf3 and 3.Bf4 * The Trompowsky Attack, 1...Nf6 2.Bg5 and the Pseudo-Trompowsky 1...d5 2.Bg5 * The Torre Attack, 2.Nf3 and 3.Bg5 * The Stonewall Attack, 2.e3 * The Colle System, 2.Nf3 and 3.e3, * The King's Fianchetto Opening, 2.Nf3 and 3.g3 * The Barry Attack, 1...Nf6 2.Nf3 g6 3.Nc3 d5 4.Bf4 * The Richter‚ÄìVeresov Attack, 1...d5 2.Nc3 Nf6 3.Bg5 or 1...Nf6 2.Nc3 d5 3.Bg5 * The Blackmar‚ÄìDiemer Gambit, 1...d5 2.e4, and the H√ºbsch Gambit 1...Nf6 2.Nc3 d5 3.e4 In the Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings (ECO), Closed Games (1.d4 d5) are classified under codes D00‚ÄìD05. Openings where Black does not play 1...d5 are called Semi-Closed Games and classified as: * Indian Defences, where Black plays 1...Nf6 (ECO codes A45‚ÄìA79, D70‚ÄìD99, E00‚ÄìE99); for instance the Queen's Indian Defence (ECO E12‚ÄìE19); * other Queen's Pawn Games, where Black plays neither 1...d5 nor 1...Nf6; these include the Dutch Defence (ECO A40‚ÄìA44 and A80‚ÄìA99). History In the 19th century and early 20th century, 1.e4 was by far the most common opening move by White , while the different openings starting with 1.d4 were considered somewhat unusual and therefore classed together as \\"Queen's Pawn Game\\". As the merits of 1.d4 started to be explored, it was the Queen's Gambit which was played most often‚Äîmore popular than all other 1.d4 openings combined. The term \\"Queen's Pawn Game\\" was then narrowed down to any opening with 1.d4 which was not a Queen's Gambit. Eventually, through the efforts of the hypermodernists, the various Indian Defences (such as the King's Indian, Nimzo-Indian, and Queen's Indian) became more popular, and as these openings were named, the term \\"Queen's Pawn Game\\" narrowed further. Continuations 1...Nf6 = This move prevents White from establishing a full pawn centre with 2.e4. The opening usually leads to a form of Indian Defence, but can also lead to versions of the Queen's Gambit if Black plays ...d5 at some point. Since 1...Nf6 is a move that is likely to be made anyway, the move is a flexible response to White's first move. White usually plays 2.c4. Then Black usually plays 2...e6 (typically leading to the Nimzo-Indian, Queen's Indian, or Queen's Gambit Declined), 2...g6 (leading to the King's Indian or Gr√ºnfeld Defence), or 2...c5 (leading to the Benoni Defence or Benko Gambit). Rarer tries include 2...e5 (Budapest Gambit) and 2...d6 (Old Indian Defence). Also White can play 2.Nf3 which like Black's move is not specific as to opening. A third alternative is the Trompowsky Attack with 2.Bg5. = 1...d5 = 1...d5 (Closed Game) also prevents White from playing 2.e4 unless White wants to venture the dubious Blackmar‚ÄìDiemer Gambit. 1...d5 is not any worse than 1...Nf6, but committing the pawn to d5 at once makes it somewhat less flexible since Black can no longer play the Indian Defences, although if Black is aiming for Queen's Gambit positions this may be of minor importance. Also, a move like 2.Bg5 (Hodgson Attack) is considered relatively harmless compared to 1.d4 Nf6 2.Bg5 since there is no knight on f6 for the bishop to harass. White's more common move is 2.c4 leading to the Queen's Gambit when Black usually chooses between 2...e6 (Queen's Gambit Declined), 2...c6 (Slav Defence) or 2...dxc4 (Queen's Gambit Accepted). Also White can play 2.Nf3 which again is not specific as to opening. Then Black may play ...Nf6 (same as above) or ...e6. A Queen's Gambit may arise anyway if White plays c4 soon afterward, but lines like the Colle System and Stonewall Attack are also possible. = 1...e6 = This move allows White to play 2.e4, entering the French Defence. If White wants to continue with a Queen's Pawn Game however, 2.c4 and 2.Nf3 usually transpose to a familiar opening such as the Queen's Gambit Declined, Nimzo-Indian or Queen's Indian. A line that is unique to the 1...e6 move order is the Keres Defence, 1.d4 e6 2.c4 Bb4+. = 1...f5 = 1...f5 is the Dutch Defence. Common White moves are 2.g3, 2.Nf3, and 2.c4. = 1...g6 = 1...g6 is sometimes called the Modern Defence line. White can play 2.e4 to enter the Modern Defence. More commonly, White plays 2.c4. Black may play 2...Nf6 for the King's Indian Defence (same as 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 g6). More commonly, Black plays 2...Bg7. Then White's moves include 3.Nc3, 3.e4, and 3.Nf3. 3.Nc3 often leads to the Modern Defence, Averbakh System, and 3.e4 usually leads to the Modern Defence, Averbakh System. 2...d6 often leads to the Modern Defence, Averbakh System. Also, White can play 2.Nf3. Black may play 2...Nf6 for the King's Indian. More commonly, Black plays 2...Bg7. Common White moves are 3.e4, 3.c4, and 3.g3. = 1...d6 = This move also allows 2.e4 entering the Pirc Defence. If White avoids this, 2.Nf3 or 2.c4 may lead to a King's Indian or Old Indian Defence, or Black may play 2...Bg4, sometimes called the Wade Defence (A41, see 1.d4 d6 2.Nf3 Bg4). 2.c4 e5 is the English Rat. = 1...c6 = This move allows White to play 2.e4, entering the Caro‚ÄìKann Defence. If, however, White wants to continue with a Queen's Pawn Game, 2.c4 and 2.Nf3 usually transpose to a familiar opening such as the Slav Defence, London System, or Dutch Defence. Other continuations * 1...b5 (Polish Defence): The Polish Defence is rather risky and should be played with care. It is better to delay ...b5 until the 2nd move. * 1...c5 (Old Benoni Defence): This is a form of the Benoni Defence seldom used; however, it is not a bad move. If White captures 2.dxc5, then Black plays 2...e5 and has a good game. * 1...e5 (Englund Gambit): Not a good idea; it gives a pawn for questionable compensation. * 1...g5 simply loses a pawn to 2.Bxg5.

It is loosely based on the Affair of the Diamond Necklace, an episode involving fraud and royal scandal that made headlines at the court of Louis XVI in the 1780s. The Novel The novel first appeared in serialised form in La Presse. The story takes place between 1784 and 1785. It is the second in a series of four novels focused on the character of Cagliostro, presented by Dumas as the man pulling all the strings of the affair. Sources The first chapters of the novel, which feature a dinner hosted by the old Marshal of Richelieu, were inspired by a text by Jean-Fran√ßois de La Harpe called The Prophecy of Cazotte.La Proph√©tie de Cazotte In this passage, the Count of Cagliostro predicts for the various guests (Lap√©rouse, the Countess of Barry, Condorcet and Gustav III of Sweden, the count of Haga) the tragic end that awaits them and the execution of Louis XVI. This foreshadowing throws light on the tragic plot, as the reader already knows that the efforts of the protagonists, including the queen, to prove their innocence is doomed to failure. * Mme Campan, Memoirs of the Private Life of Marie Antoinette, Baldwin, 1823. Adaptations The plot of the novel was fully or partially included in adaptations for film and television, which also drew on the historical facts: *Le Collier de la reine, a short, silent film, directed by Etienne Arnaud and Louis Feuillade, released in 1909; *The Queen's Necklace, directed by Tony Lekain and Gaston Ravel, released in 1929; *The Queen's Necklace, directed by Marcel L'Herbier, released in 1946; *The Affair of the Necklace, directed by Charles Shyer, released in 2001, whose plot follows that of the Affair of the Diamond Necklace, but whose elements have been drawn from the novel by Alexandre Dumas.

One of the oldest suburbs in Sydney, Toongabbie is located 30 kilometres west of the Sydney central business district and is part of the Greater Western Sydney region. Toongabbie is split between the local government areas of the City of Parramatta, the City of Blacktown and Cumberland Council. The suburb is often locally referred to as \\"Toonie\\" and \\"Toonga Bay\\". Geography To the north across Old Windsor Road the next suburb is Winston Hills; to the east is Old Toongabbie; to the south-east, the next suburb (and railway station) is Pendle Hill; to the south is Girraween; to the south-west is Prospect; and to the west the next suburb (and railway station) is Seven Hills. History Toongabbie is derived from an Aboriginal word, reported as meaning place by the water or the meeting of the waters. It was named in June 1792 after Governor Arthur Phillip asked the local Aboriginal people what they called the place. =European settlement= Toongabbie Post Office 1901 Toongabbie is noted for being the third mainland settlement (after Sydney and Parramatta) set up after the British colonisation of Australia began in 1788, although the site of the settlement is actually in the separate suburb of Old Toongabbie. Governor Phillip established a government farm and convict station on 640 acres (259 ha) in 1791 to grow food for the colony. It was supplement to the farms already established at Rose Hill. By December 1791 there were 500 men working at clearing the land. After eleven years, the government farm was closed and the land was given as grants to settlers and convicts who had done their time. The Battle of Parramatta, a major battle of the Hawkesbury and Nepean Wars, occurred in March 1797 where resistance leader Pemulwuy led a group of Bidjigal warriors, estimated to be at least 100, in an attack on a government farm at Toongabbie, challenging the British Army to fight.J Henniker Heaton, Australian Dictionary of Dates and Men of the Time, Sydney, 1873 In 1860, the railway was extended to Blacktown but it took 20 years before any arrangements were made for trains to stop at Toongabbie. The first school in Toongabbie - Toongabbie Public School, opened on 3 May 1886. By April 1911, the school closed due to low enrolments. The school reopened February the next year and has stayed open ever since. The first post office in the area was opened after many years of campaigning by local residents in 1887 in a private house on Old Windsor Road and this arrangement continued until the 1960s. The first post master was a Mr Birks and he was paid 25 pounds a year to manage the office and bring the mail bag over from Seven Hills on horseback each day. By 1922 the number of residents and businesses had grown sufficiently to support a second office in a weatherboard cottage in Wentworth Avenue, known as Toongabbie West. A purpose built office was opened in the main shopping area in Portico Parade in 1960 becoming Toongabbie Post Office whilst the old Toongabbie Post Office was renamed Old Toongabbie. The Emu and Prospect Gravel and Road Metal Company Limited opened a private railway line from Toongabbie to Prospect Quarry on 7 April 1902. Following the inability of the Government railway to supply rail wagons, trains stopped running on the line in 1945, however the rails remained in situ until the early 1960s.Sydney's Forgotten Quarry Railways - Oakes, John, pp. 9-27, In 1908, what was probably the second scout group formed in Australia, 1st Toongabbie Scout Group was organised by Errol Knox (later knighted for his services to journalism). The first scout hall was a barn on his parents' property, \\"Montargis\\" in Binalong Road. Later, in 1934, the Group moved to its present location in Bungaree Road on donated land which had also once been part of the Knox landholdings. The first bank branch in Toongabbie, The Commonwealth Bank, opened in 1957 although bank agencies had operated in the area. Toongabbie was connected to electricity in the mid-1920s and to town gas and mains sewerage in the mid-1960s. The biggest increase in population occurred after World War II. A sizable area west of the shopping centre, which had previously been farmland and orchards, was subdivided into a housing development called \\"The Old Roman Estate\\"; several streets in the area have Roman names, including Marcia St, Lavinia St, Portia St, Lucretia Rd and Portico Parade. =Old Toongabbie= To the east of Binalong Road is the small suburb known as Old Toongabbie, which includes the sites of the original colonial settlement. In the 1990s this area was reduced, with the part immediately north of Wentworthville, which is also known unofficially as the locality of Constitution Hill, being reclassified as Wentworthville. In 2006, Constitution Hill officially returned, but only as a small area between Bogalara Road and the Cumberland Highway. =Winston Hills= The more northerly parts, north of Toongabbie Creek, became known as Winston Hills in the late 1960s. Originally this was simply the name of a large housing development in the area, but a major section of what was once Old Toongabbie was officially renamed Winston Hills in the 1970s, a trend that has been echoed in many other areas of the western suburbs. Commercial area Toongabbie's shopping precinct is located in Aurelia Street to the south of the railway line next to the station. The shopping precinct for many years included a small independent suburban cinema, the \\"Rocket Theatre\\", located opposite the railway line, next to the overhead road bridge. It operated from the late 1950s until the early 1970s, when it was demolished and replaced by a row of shops. A small park by the name of Portico Plaza, directly opposite the train station and next to Toongabbie Hotel. A small shopping centre and supermarket, the Piccadilly Centre, was built in the 1960s in the area bounded by the Toongabbie Hotel and the Catholic Church. This operated until 2004 when the Piccadilly shopping centre and surrounding properties were purchased by a developer to eventually build Portico Plaza, a shopping centre with a Woolworths supermarket and over 40 specialty shops. Transport Toongabbie railway station Toongabbie railway station is on the T1 Western Line of the Sydney Trains network. The original unstaffed station opened on 26 April 1880 and was upgraded over the years with additional platforms and loading facilities. In the late 1880s the first rail official was appointed to manage the station, a Miss Amy Arnold. The current station was opened in 1946 and the line was electrified in 1955. The overhead road bridge was opened in 1947 (before that there was a level crossing where the western end of the station platforms are now). To the west, the next station on the line is Seven Hills and to the east Pendle Hill. Toongabbie is also served by private buses with connections to Blacktown via Blacktown Road, Seven Hills via the Prospect Highway, Sydney, and both Parramatta and Westmead via the Great Western Highway. In addition to this, Toongabbie is also served by the North-West T-way. Landmarks Although Toongabbie is relatively densely settled, in recent years programmes of bushland regeneration, and pollution control in local waterways have improved the few and small pockets of vegetation in the suburb. The main waterway is Greystanes or Girraween Creek which flows the length of the suburb from Fox Hills Golf Course in the south to join Blacktown Creek in the north. A one kilometre section of Greystanes Creek has been channelised as part of a flood-mitigation project. Demographics According to the , 14,337 people lived in Toongabbie.

History A 1912 Railway Clearing House map of lines around Wandsworth Common railway station The West End of London and Crystal Palace Railway (WELCR) opened the first station as Wandsworth slightly to the north of the present station on 1 December 1856. From the outset the line was worked by the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway (LB&SCR;), and then only ran to and from Crystal Palace. There were plans to extend it to join with the London and South Western Railway (L&SWR;) main line nearby, thereby providing access to London Waterloo station, but these were rejected by that railway. It was renamed Wandsworth Common on 1 January 1858 before closing later that year on 1 June 1858.Chronology of London Railways by H.V.Borley It was replaced by a station named New Wandsworth which had opened on 29 March 1858 when the (WELCR) extended its line to Pimlico, and it was purchased by the LB&SCR.;Chronology of London Railways by H.V.BorleyLondon's Disused Stations volume 6 by J.E.Connor The station at New Wandsworth was closed when the present Wandsworth Common was opened at its present location by the LB&SCR; on 1 November 1869 as part of works to widen the line, and improve the route between East Croydon and Victoria.Turner, (1978) p.250. Further remodelling of the line was undertaken in 1890 to increase capacity. The lines through the station to Crystal Palace were electrified on 12 May 1911,Southern Region Record by R.H.Clark (page 61) by means of the LB&SCR; 'Elevated Electric' overhead system. Work on electrifying the remaining services through the station had begun in 1913 but was interrupted by the First World War and not completed until 1925. By this time the LB&SCR; was absorbed into the Southern Railway following the 1921 Railways Act. In 1925 the Southern Railway decided to adopt a third rail electrification system and the lines through the station were converted between June 1928 and September 1929.Moodie, (1968) p.25. When sectorisation was introduced in the 1980s, the national rail lines were served by Network SouthEast until the privatisation of the British Railways. Upon privatisation in the 1990s, the national rail lines came under the Connex South Central franchise, which was replaced by the current operator in 2000.

Lea of Rome is known only through the testimony of her beloved friend, the learned Saint Jerome. Jerome, a scholarly monk best known for his Latin translation of the Bible (the Vulgate), is the Church's only source of information on St. Lea, whose biographical details are unknown.LEA Retrieved on 12 Jan 2018 A noblewoman of Rome, born into wealth and privilege, she was a contemporary of Jerome. However, soon after her marriage she was widowed and left very sound financially. Instead of retiring as a wealthy widow, however, she joined a convent of consecrated virgins in the city‚Äîshedding all the money and social standing she possessed. In later years she was named the prioress of the convent. Saint Lea supported the house run by Saint Marcella, working as a menial servant, and later served as the group‚Äôs superior. It appears that she died in 384 while St. Jerome and St. Marcella were reading and working on Psalm 73. In a letter relaying her death to others within the city of Rome, St. Jerome writes to St. Marcella that St. Lea, a woman of austerity, obedience and remarkable penances had died. He described her as ‚Äúblessed,‚Äù emphasizing the woman‚Äôs virtues as being worthy of heaven. Jerome provides no biography for Lea, for he assumes that Marcella knows Lea, and concentrates instead upon her virtues. Jerome draws a parallel with parable of Lazarus and Dives: He then compares her with a consul who had lived in wealth and would find himself in agony in the afterlife and exhorts Marcella to serve Jesus rather than the world. Jerome ends his letter by urging Marcella to remember the lesson of St. Lea's life: Jerome's use of the adjective \\"blessed\\" is taken as sufficient evidence for Lea's veneration by the Roman Catholic Church, where her feast day is March 22. The name Lea is likely a derivation of Leah coming from a Hebrew word meaning \\"weary\\"; or from a Chaldean name meaning \\"mistress\\" or \\"ruler\\" in Akkadian. In Genesis 29, Leah is seen as being Jacob's first wife and the mother of seven of his children. Book of Saints ‚Äì Lea * Monks of Ramsgate.ea Book of Saints, 1921..

Fran√ßois Jules Pictet-De la Rive, (March 1830) Biography He was born in Geneva. He graduated B. Sc. at Geneva in 1829, and pursued his studies for a short time at Paris, where under the influence of Georges Cuvier, de Blainville and others, he worked at natural history and comparative anatomy. On his return to Geneva in 1830 he assisted A. P. de Candolle by giving demonstrations in comparative anatomy. Five years later, when de Candolle retired, Pictet was appointed professor of zoology and comparative anatomy. Endnotes: *Obituary by W. S. Dallas, Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc. (1873), vol. xxix. In 1846 his duties were restricted to certain branches of zoology, including geology and palaeontology, and these he continued to teach until 1859, when he retired to devote his energies to the museum of natural history and to special palaeontological work. He was rector of the Academy from 1847 to 1850, and again from 1866 to 1868. He was for many years a member of the \\"Grand Conseil\\", the parliament of the Canton of Geneva, serving as its president in 1863 and 1864. Aipichthys minor (Pictet 1850) His earlier published work related chiefly to entomology, and included Recherches pour servir √† l'histoire et √† l'anatomie des Phryganides (1834) and two parts of Histoire naturelle, g√©n√©rale et particuli√®re, des insectes n√©vropt√®res (1842‚Äì1845). He directed his attention to the fossils of his native country, more especially to those of the Cretaceous and Jurassic strata, and in 1854 he commenced the publication of his great work, Mat√©riaux pour la pal√©ontologie suisse, ou Recueil de monographies sur les fossiles du Jura et des Alpes..., a series of quarto memoirs, of which six were published (1854‚Äì1873). In this work Pictet was aided by Eug√®ne Renevier, Gustave Campiche, Alois Humbert, Charles Louis Perceval de Loriol, Auguste Jaccard and Philippe de La Harpe. Pictet also brought out M√©langes pal√©ontologiques (1863‚Äì1868). He died at Geneva in 1872. A species of Malagasy snake, Elapotinus picteti, is named in his honor.Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (\\"Pictet\\", p. 207). Successive creation He was the author of Trait√© √©l√©mentaire de pal√©ontologie (4 vols. 1844-1846). In the first edition Pictet, while adopting the hypothesis of successive creations of species, admitted that some may have originated through the modification of pre-existing forms. In his second edition (1853‚Äì1857) he enters further into the probable transformation of some species, and discusses the independence of certain faunas, which did not appear to have originated from the types which locally preceded them. Pictet was an advocate of progressive creationism, the belief that species were created in successive stages.Joseph, John E. (2012). Saussure. Oxford University Press. p. 58. He acknowledged from the fossil record that some species had evolved from earlier ancestors but denied that entire groups of species had evolved through gradual transformation. He reviewed Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species in a lengthy review. Darwin noted that \\"Of all the opposed reviews I think this the only quite fair one, & I never expected to see one.\\" Darwin predicted that Pictet would eventually support his theory but this was not the case. He never abandoned his view of successive species creation. ReferencesFurther reading *David L. Hull. (1973).

The procedure characterizes isolates of microbial species using the DNA sequences of internal fragments of multiple housekeeping genes. Approximately 450-500 bp internal fragments of each gene are used, as these can be accurately sequenced on both strands using an automated DNA sequencer. For each housekeeping gene, the different sequences present within a bacterial species are assigned as distinct alleles and, for each isolate, the alleles at each of the loci define the allelic profile or sequence type (ST). The first MLST scheme to be developed was for Neisseria meningitidis, the causative agent of meningococcal meningitis and septicaemia. Since its introduction for the research of evolutionary history, MLST has been used not only for human pathogens but also for plant pathogens. Principle MLST directly measures the DNA sequence variations in a set of housekeeping genes and characterizes strains by their unique allelic profiles. The principle of MLST is simple: the technique involves PCR amplification followed by DNA sequencing. Nucleotide differences between strains can be checked at a variable number of genes depending on the degree of discrimination desired. The workflow of MLST involves: 1) data collection, 2) data analysis and 3) multilocus sequence analysis. In the data collection step, definitive identification of variation is obtained by nucleotide sequence determination of gene fragments. In the data analysis step, all unique sequences are assigned allele numbers and combined into an allelic profile and assigned a sequence type (ST). If new alleles and STs are found, they are stored in the database after verification. In the final analysis step of MLST, the relatedness of isolates are made by comparing allelic profiles. Researchers do epidemiological and phylogenetical studies by comparing STs of different clonal complexes. A huge set of data is produced during the sequencing and identification process so bioinformatic techniques are used to arrange, manage, analyze and merge all of the biological data. To strike the balance between the acceptable identification power, time and cost for the strain typing, about seven to eight house-keeping genes are commonly used in the laboratories. Quoting Staphylococcus aureus as an example, seven housekeeping genes are used in MLST typing. These genes include carbamate kinase (arcC), shikimate dehydrogenase (aroE), glycerol kinase (glpF), guanylate kinase (gmk), phosphate acetyltransferase (pta), triosephosphate isomerase (tpi) and acetyl coenzyme A acetyltransferase (yqiL) as specified by the MLST website. However, it is not uncommon for up to ten housekeeping genes to be used. For Vibrio vulnificus, the housekeeping genes used are glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (glp), DNA gyrase, subunit B (gyrB), malate-lactate dehydrogenase (mdh), methionyl-tRNA synthetase (metG), phosphoribosylaminoimidazole synthetase (purM), threonine dehyrogenase (dtdS), diaminopimelate decarboxylase (lysA), transhydrogenase alpha subunit (pntA), dihydroorotase (pyrC) and tryptophanase (tnaA). Thus both the number and type of housekeeping genes interrogated by MLST may differ from species to species. For each of these housekeeping genes, the different sequences are assigned as alleles and the alleles at the loci provide an allelic profile. A series of profiles can then be the identification marker for strain typing. Sequences that differ at even a single nucleotide are assigned as different alleles and no weighting is given to take into account the number of nucleotide differences between alleles, as we cannot distinguish whether differences at multiple nucleotide sites are a result of multiple point mutations or a single recombinational exchange. The large number of potential alleles at each of the loci provides the ability to distinguish billions of different allelic profiles, and a strain with the most common allele at each locus would only be expected to occur by chance approximately once in 10,000 isolates. Despite MLST providing high discriminatory power, the accumulation of nucleotide changes in housekeeping genes is a relatively slow process and the allelic profile of a bacterial isolate is sufficiently stable over time for the method to be ideal for global epidemiology. The relatedness of isolates is displayed as a dendrogram constructed using the matrix of pairwise differences between their allelic profiles, eBURST or a minimum spanning tree (MST). The dendrogram is only a convenient way of displaying those isolates that have identical or very similar allelic profiles that can be assumed to be derived from a common ancestor; the relationships between isolates that differ at more than three out of seven loci are likely to be unreliable and should not be taken to infer their phylogeny. The MST connects all samples in such a way that the summed distance of all branches of the tree is minimal. Alternatively, the relatedness of isolates can also be analysed with MultiLocus Sequence Analysis (MLSA). This does not use the assigned alleles, but instead concatenates the sequences of the gene fragments of the housekeeping genes and uses this concatenated sequence to determine phylogenetic relationships. In contrast to MLST, this analysis does assign a higher similarity between sequences differing only a single nucleotide and a lower similarity between sequences with multiple nucleotide differences. As a result, this analysis is more suitable for organisms with a clonal evolution and less suitable for organisms in which recombinational events occur very often. It can also be used to determine phylogenetic relationships between closely related species. The terms MLST and MLSA are very often considered interchangeable. This is however not correct as each analysis method has its distinctive features and uses. Care should be taken to use the correct term.  Comparison with other techniques  Earlier serological typing approaches had been established for differentiating bacterial isolates, but immunological typing has drawbacks such as reliance on few antigenic loci and unpredictable reactivities of antibodies with different antigenic variants. Several molecular typing schemes have been proposed to determine the relatedness of pathogens such as pulsed- field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), ribotyping, and PCR-based fingerprinting. But these DNA banding-based subtyping methods do not provide meaningful evolutionary analyses. Despite PFGE being considered by many researchers as the ‚Äúgold standard‚Äù, many strains are not typable by this technique due to the degradation of the DNA during the process (gel smears). The approach of MLST is distinct from Multi locus enzyme electrophoresis (MLEE), which is based on different electrophoretic mobilities (EM) of multiple core metabolic enzymes. The alleles at each locus define the EM of their products, as different amino acid sequences between enzymes result in different mobilities and distinct bands when run on a gel. The relatedness of isolates can then be visualized with a dendrogram generated from the matrix of pairwise differences between the electrophoretic types. This method has a lower resolution than MLST for several reasons, all arising from the fact that enzymatic phenotype diversity is merely a proxy for DNA sequence diversity. First, enzymes may have different amino acid sequences without having sufficiently different EM to give distinct bands. Second, \\"silent mutations\\" may alter the DNA sequence of a gene without altering the encoded amino acids. Thirdly, the phenotype of the enzyme can easily be altered in response to environmental conditions and badly affect the reproducibility of MLEE results - common modifications of enzymes are phosphorylation, cofactor binding and cleavage of transport sequences. This also limits comparability of MLEE data obtained by different laboratories, whereas MLST provides portable and comparable DNA sequence data and has great potential for automation and standardization. MLST should not be confused with DNA barcoding. The latter is a taxonomic method that uses short genetic markers to recognize particular species of eukaryotes. It is based on the fact that mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) or some parts of the ribosomal DNA cistron have relatively fast mutation rates, which give significant variation in sequences between species. mtDNA methods are only possible in eukaryotes (as prokaryotes lack mitochondria), whereas MLST, although initially developed for prokaryotes, is now finding application in eukaryotes and in principle could be applied to any kingdom. Advantages and applications MLST is highly unambiguous and portable. Materials required for ST determination can be exchanged between laboratories. Primer sequences and protocols can be accessed electronically. It is reproducible and scalable. MLST is automated, combines advances in high throughput sequencing and bioinformatics with established population genetics techniques. MLST data can be used to investigate evolutionary relationships among bacteria. MLST provides good discriminatory power to differentiate isolates. The application of MLST is huge, and provides a resource for the scientific, public health, and veterinary communities as well as the food industry. The following are examples of MLST applications. =Campylobacter= Campylobacter is the common causative agent for bacterial infectious intestinal diseases, usually arising from undercooked poultry or unpasteurised milk. However, its epidemiology is poorly understood since outbreaks are rarely detected, so that the sources and transmission routes of outbreak are not easily traced. In addition, Campylobacter genomes are genetically diverse and unstable with frequent inter- and intragenomic recombination, together with phase variation, which complicates the interpretation of data from many typing methods. Until recently, with the application of MLST technique, Campylobacter typing has achieved a great success and added onto the MLST database. As at 1 May 2008, the Campylobacter MLST database contains 3516 isolates and about 30 publications that use or mention MLST in research on Campylobacter (http://pubmlst.org/campylobacter/). =Neisseria meningitidis= MLST has provided a more richly textured picture of bacteria within human populations and on strain variants that may be pathogenic to human, plants and animals. MLST technique was first used by Maiden et al. (1) to characterize Neisseria meningitidis using six loci. The application of MLST has clearly resolved the major meningococcal lineages known to be responsible for invasive disease around the world. To improve the level of discriminatory power between the major invasive lineages, seven loci are now being used and have been accepted by many laboratories as the method of choice for characterizing meningococcal isolates. It is a well known fact that recombinational exchanges commonly occur in N. meningitidis, leading to rapid diversification of meningococcal clones. MLST has successfully provided a reliable method for characterization of clones within other bacterial species in which the rates of clonal diversification are generally lower. =Staphylococcus aureus= S. aureus causes a number of diseases. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) has generated growing concerns over its resistance to almost all antibiotics except vancomycin. However, most serious S. aureus infections in the community, and many in hospitals, are caused by methicillin-susceptible isolates (MSSA) and there have been few attempts to identify the hypervirulent MSSA clones associated with serious disease. MLST was therefore developed to provide an unambiguous method of characterizing MRSA clones and for the identification of the MSSA clones associated with serious disease. =Streptococcus pyogenes= S. pyogenes causes diseases ranging from pharyngitis to life-threatening impetigo including necrotizing fasciitis. An MLST scheme for S. pyogenes has been developed. At present, the database (mlst.net) contains the allelic profiles of isolates that represent the worldwide diversity of the organism and isolates from serious invasive disease. =Candida albicans= C. albicans is a fungal pathogen of humans and is responsible for hospital-acquired bloodstream infections. MLST technique has used to characterize C. albicans isolates. Combination of the alleles at the different loci results in unique diploid sequence types that can be used to discriminate strains. MLST has been shown successfully applied to study the epidemiology of C. albicans in the hospital as well as the diversity of C. albicans isolates obtained from diverse ecological niches including human and animal hosts. =Cronobacter= The genus Cronobacter is composed of 7 species. Before 2007, the single species name Enterobacter sakazakii was applied to these organisms. The Cronobacter MLST was initially applied to distinguish between C. sakazakii and C. malonaticus because 16S rDNA sequencing is not always accurate enough, and biotyping is too subjective. The Cronobacter MLST scheme uses 7 alleles; atpD, fusA, glnS, gltB, gyrB, infB and ppsA giving a concatenated sequence of 3036 bp for phylogenetic analysis (MLSA) and comparative genomics. MLST has also been used in the formal recognition of new Cronobacter species. The method has revealed a strong association between one genetic lineage, sequence type 4 (ST4), and cases of neonatal meningitis., The Cronobacter MLST site is at http://www.pubMLST.org/cronobacter. Limitations MLST appears best in population genetic study but it is expensive. Due to the sequence conservation in housekeeping genes, MLST sometimes lacks the discriminatory power to differentiate bacterial strains, which limits its use in epidemiological investigations. To improve the discriminatory power of MLST, a multi- virulence-locus sequence typing (MVLST) approach has been developed using Listeria monocytogenes . MVLST broadens the benefits of MLST but targets virulence genes, which may be more polymorphic than housekeeping genes. Population genetics is not the only relevant factor in an epidemic. Virulence factors are also important in causing disease, and population genetic studies struggle to monitor these. This is because the genes involved are often highly recombining and mobile between strains in comparison with the population genetic framework. Thus, for example in Escherichia coli, identifying strains carrying toxin genes is more important than having a population genetics-based evaluation of prevalent strains. The advent of second-generation sequencing technologies has made it possible to obtain sequence information across the entire bacterial genome at relatively modest cost and effort, and MLST can now be assigned from whole-genome sequence information, rather than sequencing each locus separately as was the practice when MLST was first developed. Whole-genome sequencing provides richer information for differentiating bacterial strains (MLST uses approximately 0.1% of the genomic sequence to assign type while disregarding the rest of the bacterial genome). For example, whole-genome sequencing of numerous isolates has revealed the single MLST lineage ST258 of Klebsiella pneumoniae comprises two distinct genetic clades, providing additional information about the evolution and spread of these multi-drug resistant organisms, and disproving the previous hypothesis of a single clonal origin for ST258. Databases MLST databases contain the reference allele sequences and sequence types for each organism, and also isolate epidemiological data. The websites contain interrogation and analysis software which allow users to query their allele sequences and sequence types. MLST is widely used as a tool for researchers and public healthcare workers. The majority of MLST databases are hosted at 2 web servers currently located at Imperial College, London (mlst.net) and in Oxford University (pubmlst.org). The databases hosted at each site are different and hold the organism specific reference allele sequences and lists of STs for individual organisms. To assist the gathering and formatting of the utilized sequences a simple and free plug-in for Firefox has been developed (link).

It was rumored to have been called Liberty Lunch in the 1940s as an eatery, perhaps reflecting the World War II Liberty Bonds and patriotic sentiment. Description It was a former lumberyard in the 1920s and 30s owned by the now defunct Calcasieu Lumber Company and had been long abandoned. In the early years of Austin, the space was a wagon yard for the adjacent general store and livery stable. There were no signs that a restaurant had ever been in the tiny building that once served as the lumberyard front office. In the early to mid '70s, a local comedy troupe started the famous and still operating Esther's Follies at this location performing weekend comedy shows and serving food and beer. The Liberty Lunch/ lumberyard property was then and continues to be owned and leased by the City of Austin. Over the next few years, Esther's Follies grew in popularity and the group began presenting live music on a tiny stage under the shadows of the former lumberyard shed and extended its schedule to 3‚Äì4 days a week. In the late 1970s the group moved to 6th Street to provide year-round options for their productions. Liberty Lunch, as a former lumberyard was an unroofed space between a large city owned warehouse on the west and an historic building, The Schneider Store, on the eastern corner of the 400 block of West 2nd Street. As such, The Lunch as locals called it, was a spring and summer only operation whose weather permitting opening each spring was a highly anticipated and attended event. The comedy club owners sold the lease to Charlie Tesar who continued operations there as a seasonal live music venue. The most popular acts were the regular Tuesday night reggae band, The Lotions;Thursday night's Beto and the Fairlanes and a rotation of bands on weekends including both of the afore mentioned groups plus The Uranium Savages and Extreme Heat. Cover was typically $3‚Äì5, beer 75 cents and crowds often 700-900 people who danced on dirt floor of the lumberyard drive through in front of a primitive stage. The club was a local favorite and invited guests to \\"Dance and Dine Under The Stars\\". Shortly after taking ownership, Tesar hired Mark Pratz to assume booking bands and management of the club. In 1981, during the demolition of the Armadillo World Headquarters, the steel beams of the old armory were purchased at auction and brought over to the Liberty Lunch site and the first of several roof structures was built. Initially it was a see through greenhouse type roof that lasted briefly until it was replaced with a more substantial and all weather permitting solid structure. The roof had four giant shoebox removable type skylight lids that let the sky and stars in and the heat and smoke out. The dirt floor was replaced with concrete and a large wooden dance floor and improved stage was built. In the 1990s the club got another makeover with a solid front wall, stage rebuild, safety equipment and a side wall with roll up garage doors opening onto a still open air 2000 square foot side garden for fresh air, open seating and smoking. Despite the changes, Liberty Lunch grew in popularity and recognition throughout the next two decades booking high quality acts and providing Austinites and visitors a place to see their music idols up close. During its existence in the late 1970s, 80s and 90s it featured a wide variety of music, including reggae and ska, punk, indie, country and rock. For over 20 years the club played host to thousands of local, regional and touring acts including: Bad Religion, Dick Dale, The Brian Setzer Orchestra, The Neville Brothers, The Uranium Savages, Burning Spear, The Mighty Diamonds, Mutabaruka, The Gladiators, Timbuk3, Dwight Yoakam, The Descendants, Dinosaur Junior, The Skunks, The 13th Floor Elevators with Roky Erickson and Tommy Hall, Living Color, Billy Bragg, Jessie Winchester, Ricky Nelson, Poco, Shake Russell and Dana Cooper, Uncle Tupelo, Son Volt, Wilco, The Replacements, Soul Asylum, The Tragically Hip, Fishbone, Ed Hall, The Wild Seeds,The True Believers, The Violent Femmes, Green Day, Beck, Alanis Morissette, Nirvana, The Foo Fighters, k.d. lang, The Smashing Pumpkins, John Sebastian, Social Distortion, No Doubt, Suicidal Tendencies, NoFX, Robyn Hitchcock, Asleep At The Wheel, Dolly Parton, Hootie and The Blowfish, Hot Tuna, Spirit, New Riders of The Purple Sage, Love Tractor, The Long Ryders, The Flaming Lips, Black Flag, Wendy O.

VDQS wines were subject to restrictions on yield and vine variety, among others. There were relatively few VDQS as they typically moved on to AOC status after a number of years. VDQS therefore represented a small part of overall French wine production. In 2005, VDQS wines made up 0.9% of volume amounting from 409,472 hectoliters of production.INAO statistics of vineyard surfaces and production volumes for the 2005-2006 campaign, accessed on May 26, 2008 42.3% of the VDQS wines produced in that year were white, with the remaining 57.7% being either red or ros√©.

Typically, VDQS was a stepping stone to full AOC status, and unlike VdP covered local rather than regional areas. When Algeria was still a French colony, a number of Algerian crus were granted VDQS status. At the time of Algerian independence in 1962, they numbered 12. The frequency with which new VDQS were created varied over the years. Between 1984 and 1994 not a single new VDQS was added. As a result of an ongoing crisis in the French wine industry, Bernard Pomel was tasked with making proposals on how to remedy the situation. The so-called Pomel report, which was presented to the French Minister of Agriculture on March 23, 2006, among other things proposed a simplification of the French wine classification system. This included eliminating the VDQS category.French Wine Crisis: the Pomel Report Wine Business Insider, April 4, 2006, p. 6-7 After political deliberations that somewhat delayed the initial timelines for the reform, the French parliament made the proposal into law in December 2007. The final wines labelled VDQS were those of the 2010 vintage, and by December 31, 2011, VDQS was removed entirely from the classification system.End of VDQS delayed Truewines News Service Existing VDQS areas had until then to either qualify for full AOC status or to become Vin de pays. Almost all VDQS areas opted to achieve AOC status, initiating relevant procedures in 2008-2009.

Vin de pays (, \\"country wine\\") is a French wine classification that is above the vin de table classification, but below the appellation d'origine contr√¥l√©e classification, as well as the former vin d√©limit√© de qualit√© sup√©rieure classification. Legislation on the Vin de pays terminology was created in 1973 and passed in 1979,winepros.com.au. allowing producers to distinguish wines that were made using grape varieties or procedures other than those required by the AOC rules, without having to use the simple and commercially non-viable table wine classification. Unlike table wines, which are only indicated as being from France, Vin de pays carries a geographic designation of origin, the producers have to submit the wine for analysis and tasting, and the wines have to be made from certain varieties or blends. Regulations regarding varieties and labelling practices are typically more lenient than the regulations for AOC wines. In 2009, the Vin de pays classification was replaced by the new Indication G√©ographique Prot√©g√©e (IGP, \\"Protected Geographical Region\\") designation.  Taxonomy  There are three tiers of Vin de Pays: regional, departmental and local. There are seven regional Vins de Pays, which cover large areas of France. The most voluminous contributor to this category of wines is Vin de Pays d'Oc, from the Languedoc- Roussillon area in Mediterranean France. The second largest volume of Vin de Pays wines is produced as Vin de Pays de la Loire, a designation that applies to wines from the whole Loire Valley and Chablis. The others are: Vin de Pays du Comt√© Tolosan (south-west), Vin de Pays de M√©diterran√©e (south-east, Provence and Corsica) and Vin de Pays des Comt√©s Rhodaniens (Rhone valley). Vin de Pays Terres du Midi, approved in mid-2018 for certain blended wines produced in Languedoc and Roussillon. Two further regional Vin de Pays designations, Vin de Pays de l'Atlantique (Bordeaux and Charentes (Cognac)) and Vin de Pays Vignobles de France (all of wine-making France) were approved by French authorities in 2007, but (together with Vin de Pays de Gaules for the Beaujolais region) remain disputedFrance's three new regional Vins de Pays attacked, Jancisrobinson.com, August 24, 2007 and as of July 2009, they remained unpublished in the Official Journal of the European UnionList of names of geographical units smaller than the Member State as referred to in Article 51(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 (table wines with geographical indication), list reflecting the situation as of July 31, 2009, published August 8, 2009 due to actions taken by other French wine producers. The Vin de Pays Vignobles de France has now been replaced by a table wine designation Vin de France, launched in August 2009. Each regional Vin de Pays is divided into several departmental Vins de Pays, of which there are about 50. The names are derived from the French departments in question and the limits exactly the same as the department's borders. For example, Vin de Pays du Gard is one of the Vins de Pays produced within Vins de Pays d'Oc using grapes from the Gard department and the Vin de Pays de Charente-maritime is produced in the Cognac area. Approximately one third of the French departments don't produce Vin de Pays, for example C√¥te d'Or in Burgundy and Gironde in Bordeaux, or because the climate is not suited to produce wine at all, like the Bretagne, Normandy and Nord-Pas de Calais regions. The local, or zone-defined Vins de pays are numerous, and may take their name from some historical or geographical phenomenon, such as Vin de Pays des Marches de Bretagne or Vin de Pays des Coteaux de l'Ardeche, or even a more locally specific variant. The boundaries of a zone may reflect a consistent terroir, rather than an administrative convenience, and could potentially in the long run achieve the status of an AOC.morethanorganic.com AOC Classifications  Production rules  The conditions to respect to be allowed to use the classification Vin de pays are the following: * The yield must be less than 90 hectoliters per hectare for white wines, and less than 85 hl for red and ros√© wines. * Only wine producers with a total yield of less than 100 hl/ha can qualify. * The minimum alcoholic strength depends on the region and is 10% in Le Midi, 9.5% in South-west France area and the Centre East area, and 9% for the Loire Valley and the East area. * The allowed amounts of sulfur dioxide allowed in the wines are 125 mg/l for red wines and 150 mg/l for white and ros√© wines. For wines with sugar content of at least 5 g/l, the quantity of sulfur dioxide is slightly higher: 150 mg/l for red wines and 175 mg/l for white and ros√© wines. * The acidity in terms of pH values is also regulated, with some Vin de Pays areas having stricter rules than others. * The wines must be kept and produced separately from other wines (e.g., production for table wines) and are subject to quality monitoring by an official regional committee.  Economic effects  In terms of volume, Vins de Pays d'Oc and Vin de Pays du Val de Loire (previously known as Vins de Pays du Jardin de France) are responsible for the majority of French exports. Originally, Vin de Pays designation was commonly viewed as inferior to an AOC Appellation, often being ascribed to thin and simple wines. However, since the late 1980s, an increase in demand for varietal wines has led some French producers and cooperatives to produce more Vin de Pays, especially Vin de Pays d'Oc, to make varietal wines with some form of designation, while turning away from the highly restrictive AOC classification which often requires very specific blends of grape varieties. This can be seen as a response to the increasing sales success of varietal New World wines from Australia, New Zealand, the United States, South Africa and Chile. As well as varietal wines (such as Cabernet Sauvignon or Merlot), Vin de Pays is being used to produce non-traditional blends which do not meet the requirements of AOC or VDQS regulations. Some of these wines are considered much better, and command higher prices, than AOC or VDQS wines from the same region, or even the same winemakers.

Originally, the term was used almost pejoratively to label bands such as Bush, Candlebox and Collective Soul that emulated the original sound of grunge. In the late 1990s, post-grunge morphed into a more clearly defined style that married the sound and aesthetic of grunge with a less intense and abrasive tone, rising to prominence that lasted in the 2000s. Bands such as , Live, Bush, Puddle of Mudd, Staind, Nickelback, Theory of a Deadman, Default, Creed and Matchbox Twenty all achieved mainstream success. Characteristics During the 1990s, a post-grunge sound emerged that emulated the attitudes and music of grunge, particularly its thick, distorted guitars, but with a less intense and less abrasive tone. Unlike a lot of early grunge bands, post-grunge bands often worked through major record labels and incorporated influences from a variety of musical genres including: jangle pop, , ska revival, alternative metal and classic rock. Post-grunge music tends to be in mid-tempo and is noted for having \\"a polished, radio-ready production\\". Grierson of About.com wrote that musically, post-grunge bands \\"split the difference between plaintive ballads and aggressive rockers, resulting in songs that combine the two extremes into a sad-eyed, propulsive middle ground\\". Post-grunge tends to feature the \\"...same kind of melody as...bubblegum pop\\" and pop song structures. Sometimes music features both an electric guitar and an acoustic guitar playing simultaneously. Post-grunge tends to have production quality that is much higher and cleaner than grunge. Post-grunge band Nickelback in 2008 A \\"major rift\\" between grunge and is in the lyrical substance of the music; grunge expressed emotion through loose metaphors or third-person narratives, while post-grunge was known for being direct and blunt. While describing lyrics that are common in , Sasha Geffen of Consequence of Sound wrote that \\"plunged directly into the Geffen wrote that most post-grunge songs that achieved mainstream success \\"call after a prospective or past companion in the first person\\". Post-grunge lyrics also tend to be about topics such as relationships, romance and drug addiction. According to Geffen, \\"grunge's frontmen posed with their addictions; songwriters sought redemption for them\\". Geffen states that post-grunge songs \\"fit the mold of songs made for...teenage and pre-teen girls\\" who were \\"longing for a distant someone\\", and the songs \\"wore signs of femininity\\" that she posits may be why the \\"...post-grunge moment pissed off so many angry dudes.\\" According to Geffen, artists such as Alanis Morissette, No Doubt and Sarah McLachlan all \\"crystallized the songwriting strategy that would form the emotional core of the post-grunge moment\\". As a pejorative label British band Bush (pictured) were described by Matt Diehl of Rolling Stone as \\"the most successful and shameless mimics of Nirvana's music\\". Originally, post-grunge was a label that was meant to be almost pejorative, suggesting that grunge bands labelled as were simply musically derivative, or a cynical response to an \\"authentic\\" rock movement. When grunge became a mainstream genre because of bands such as Nirvana and Pearl Jam, record labels started signing bands that sounded similar to these bands' sonic identities. Bands labeled as that emerged when grunge was mainstream such as Bush, Candlebox and Collective Soul are all noted for emulating the sound of bands that launched grunge into the mainstream. According to Tim Grierson of About.com, the almost pejorative use of the \\"post-grunge\\" label to describe these bands was \\"suggesting that rather than being a musical movement in their own right, they were just a calculated, cynical response to a legitimate stylistic shift in rock music\\". During the late 1990s, post-grunge morphed, becoming a derivative of grunge that combined characteristics of grunge with a more commercially accessible tone. During this time, post-grunge bands such as Creed and Nickelback emerged. Grierson wrote: Grierson also wrote, \\"Post-grunge was a profitable musical style, but bands like Nirvana and Pearl Jam were beloved partly because of their perceived integrity in avoiding the mainstream. Post-grunge, by comparison, seemed to exist in order to court that very audience.\\" In the late 2000s and 2010s, the derogatory term \\"butt rock\\" gained traction when applied in relation to many post-grunge artists whose popularity peaked simultaneously with that of the genre itself, such as Nickelback, Creed, Puddle of Mudd, and Hinder. While origins of the term are debatable, it usually implies criticism of raspy vocals overuse and, less often, overly clich√©d or negative lyrics.https://melmagazine.com/en-us/story/what-was-butt- rockhttps://www.overthinkingit.com/2015/09/24/definition-of-butt-rock HistoryEarly‚Äìmid-1990s= Candlebox in 2008 Even at the height of their popularity, after the release of Nevermind (1991) brought grunge to international attention, Nirvana experienced increasing problems, partly caused by Kurt Cobain's drug addiction and growing dissatisfaction with commercial success. In late 1992, Cobain was photographed in a T-shirt with 'Grunge is Dead' printed on its front and the genre's decline started to be widely discussed. The death of Cobain in 1994, as well as Pearl Jam's touring problems, marked a decline for grunge that year. Problems of addiction for Layne Staley of Alice in Chains led to the band cancelling scheduled dates in 1995. When grunge was mainstream, major record labels began signing and promoting bands emulating the genre. In spite of the fact that bands such as Bush and Candlebox have been categorized as grunge, both bands have also been categorized as post-grunge. Even the classic rock band Rush gave a contribution to the nascent post-grunge with the 1993 studio album Counterparts and the subsequent releases Test for Echo (1996) and Vapor Trails (2002).Sunday Soundtrack: Nick Leonardi, RUSH ‚Äì Counterparts, prog-sphere.com, 7 May 2017 Live, one of the first post-grunge bands, performing in 2013.

Carl Williott of Stereogum called Bush's album Sixteen Stone \\"a harbinger of pop dominance\\". Live's album Throwing Copper was certified 8x platinum by the RIAA, and the band's album Secret Samadhi was certified 2x platinum by the RIAA. Both Throwing Copper and Secret Samadhi peaked at number 1 on the Billboard 200. Post-grunge band Foo Fighters performing live in 2007 In 1995, former Nirvana drummer Dave Grohl's newer band Foo Fighters helped to popularize post-grunge and define its parameters, becoming one of the most commercially successful rock bands in the United States, aided by considerable airplay on MTV. Like grunge bands such as Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, and Alice in Chains, the post-grunge band Candlebox was from Seattle, but post-grunge was marked by a broadening of the geographical base of grunge, with bands categorized as post-grunge such as York, Pennsylvania's Live, Atlanta, Georgia's Collective Soul, Australia's Silverchair and England's Bush, who all paved the way for later post-grunge bands.Bogdanov, V.; Woodstra, C.; Erlewine, S.

He had been in a standoff with the Red Lake Police Department for some days in Red Lake.Davey, Monica. \\"Tribe Buries 3 on a Long Road to Healing\\", March 26, 2005, The New York Times, 26 March 2005 His grandfather, Daryl \\"Dash\\" Lussier Sr. (September 3, 1946 - March 21, 2005), a sergeant in the tribal police force since 1965, had tried to intervene but was unable to bring about a peaceful end. On March 5, 1999, when Jeff was ten, his mother was in a car accident, in which a tractor-trailer crashed into the car that her cousin was driving. The women had been drinking. The cousin died in the accident and Joanne suffered severe brain damage. In 2000, she and her husband separated; they completed the divorce in May 2004. Their custody arrangements covered only the children they had together and not Jeff.Hanners, David. \\"Web postings show many sides to Weise\\", Duluth News- Tribune, 26 March 2005, p. 1A. Following his mother's accident, Jeff was placed in the custody and care of his paternal grandmother, on the Red Lake reservation. The boy had to leave Minneapolis, where he had lived for nearly eleven years. Two of his paternal aunts said they were also involved in his care; Marisa Helms, \\"Shooting fuels debate over safety of Prozac for teens\\" , Minnesota Public Radio, 25 March 2005, accessed 18 December 2012 one lived with her child at their mother's during this period. Jeff's grandmother and her husband were separated. He shared a house with his companion and their son. According to the family, Jeff became close to both of his grandparents. By 2003, his mother had moved to an assisted-living facility; she had recovered enough from her accident to work part-time, and had regained speech. Weise chose to stay with his grandmother rather than rejoin his mother and move again.  Schools  Due to his disrupted family life, Weise attended numerous schools as a boy: Pearson Elementary School in Shakopee, Minnesota from kindergarten to fourth grade, Bluff Creek Elementary School in Chanhassen, Minnesota for fifth grade, and Red Lake Middle School for sixth through eighth grades. In 2002, Weise was forced to repeat the eighth grade because of failing grades and truancy; he enrolled in a special education program at the school called the Learning Center. Beginning in middle school, Weise was frequently taunted and bullied by other students. = High school = Weise became close to his paternal grandfather, Daryl \\"Dash\\" Lussier Sr., and his younger companion, Michele Sigana, who had given him his own room with them. The family said Weise had a good relationship with both. In September 2003, Weise enrolled at Red Lake Senior High School in Red Lake. Teachers and fellow students remembered him as withdrawn, and he reportedly had a history of troublesome behavior. At times he was referred to be homeschooled. His grandmother said he had not been in school for five weeks before the shooting. His social studies teacher Wanda Baxter recalled, \\"[Weise] was a good listener like any other ordinary student. He was quiet but never a troublemaker.\\" Another teacher described Weise as \\"a pretty bright kid, but ... lazy when it came to school.\\" According to reports, Weise was teased by fellow students because of his physical appearance: he was six feet tall and 250 pounds; he dressed in all-black clothing with a full-length coat. He usually did not respond to their taunts. Weise said, \\"Because of my size and appearance people don't give me as much trouble as they would if I looked weak.\\"Langman, Peter. Why Kids Kill: Inside the Minds of School Shooters, Palgrave Macmillan, 2009. p. 122. Several students remember Weise as being non-violent. In addition, a family member said that students were aware of the suicide of Weise's father and his mother's being confined to a nursing home while he attended the high school. A close friend of Weise described him as \\"the only one I talked to about my problems. He was trustworthy, and he was always capable of understanding what I was going through\\". Other girls also said they could talk to him. Chris Maag, \\"The Devil in Red Lake\\" , TIME Magazine, 27 March 2005, accessed 19 December 2012 Although Weise was sometimes described as a loner, several students said he had numerous friends. He had a notebook in which he drew what a close friend described as \\"dark stuff\\". Later Weise was found to have posted numerous online comments expressing his frustration with living in Red Lake, and feelings that his life was beyond his control. He described the reservation \\"as a place where people 'choose alcohol over friendship', where women neglect 'their own flesh and blood' for relationships with men, where he could not escape 'the grave I'm continually digging for myself'\\". His depression led him to attempt suicide in May 2004, when he cut his wrist. He changed his mind, deciding \\"this was not the path,\\" and posted his thoughts on the website Above Top Secret: > I had went through a lot of things in my life that had driven me to a darker > path than most choose to take. I split the flesh on my wrist with a box > opener, painting the floor of my bedroom with blood I shouldn't have spilt. > After sitting there for what seemed like hours (which apparently was only > minutes), I had the revelation that this was not the path. It was my > dicision to seek medical treatment, as on the other hand I could have chose > to sit there until enough blood drained from my downward lascerations on my > wrists to die. After he attempted suicide again the following month in June 2004, his aunts arranged with the Red Lake Medical Center for him to be hospitalized at a facility away from the reservation.Connolly, Ceci and Hedgpeth, Dana. \\"Shooter Described as Deeply Disturbed,\\" The Washington Post, 24 March 2005, p. A12 His continuing treatment included counseling and a prescription for Prozac, an anti-depressant. One source said that his doctor had increased his dosage in 2005 a week before the shooting, to 60 mg a day of Prozac. His grandmother said he had not seen the doctor since February 21. His aunts Shauna and Tammy Lussier were concerned about the increase in his dosage. Weise's murders and suicide reopened the public debate about Prozac use among children and adolescents. In October 2004, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had issued a warning about its use because of its association with more thoughts and acts of suicide and violence. But, it was at the time the only antidepressant approved for use with children.  The shootings  On March 21, 2005, Weise killed nine people before killing himself in a murder‚Äìsuicide. With a .22 caliber pistol that he had acquired up to a year before the shooting, Weise first killed his grandfather, 58-year-old Daryl Lussier Sr. while he was asleep in bed and his grandfather's girlfriend, 32-year-old Michelle Sigana while she was coming back upstairs from the basement with laundry.MARY ELLEN O'TOOLE, JEFFREY WEISE AND THE SHOOTING AT RED LAKE MINNESOTA HIGH SCHOOL: A BEHAVIORAL PERSPECTIVE, in SCHOOL SHOOTINGS, 178, (Bockler, Seeger, Sitzer and Heitmeyer 2013). He then took his grandfather's police-issued firearms and drove his grandfather's police cruiser to the school. At the school, Weise shot and killed unarmed security guard Derrick Brun, 28, before going inside the school. Once inside, Weise fired randomly down a hallway and in a classroom, killing teacher Neva Wynkoop-Rogers, 62, and students Dewayne Lewis, 15; Chase Lussier, 15; Chanelle Rosebear, 15; Thurlene Stillday, 15, and Alicia White, 14. After engaging in a brief shootout with the police and being injured three times in the lower back, right leg, and right arm, Weise then retreated to another classroom and committed suicide using a shotgun. The extended Lussier family had been involved for years in trying to help him, and arranged for Weise to have care and psychiatric treatment for depression. Dr. Leslie Lundt, a psychiatrist, has commented that a parent's suicide put individuals at high risk for psychological problems, as does alcohol abuse in the family. Jodi Rave, Teen suicides series, Part 1: \\"Family still struggling to understand teenager's rampage in Minnesota\\" , The Missoulian, 10 July 2005, accessed 23 December 2012  Online activities  According to reports, Weise spent great amounts of time online on blogging sites. One such blog included a Neo-Nazi Internet forum of the Libertarian National Socialist Green Party. The posts revealed an admiration for the ideas of Adolf Hitler, and interests in persuading other Native Americans as to the merits of those ideas. On one occasion, he fought with a pupil whom he referred to as a \\"Communist\\". He also alleged that the school was warned that someone was going to \\"shoot up\\" the school on April 20, the birthday of Adolf Hitler and the anniversary of the Columbine High School massacre, and that the school authorities \\"pinned\\" the threat on him. Weise also created violent Flash animations and posted them on the Internet (including the website Newgrounds). He uploaded these animations under the alias \\"Regret\\". One animation entitled Target Practice depicts an individual who shoots three people with an assault rifle, blows up a police car with a grenade, then shoots a Ku Klux Klan member. It ends when the character uses a handgun to shoot himself in the head. The animation is accompanied by the sounds of gunfire.  Compensation  After the murders and Weise's suicide, in April 2005, the Red Lake Band of Chippewa distributed 15 grants to families of victims and people affected by the shootings from a memorial fund that received $200,000 in donations from across the country. They gave $5,000 as a victims-aid grant to Weise's relatives, to help pay for the youth's funeral and burial. Although some people objected, a tribal leader said Weise's relatives had a double burden. \\"Tribe Gives Victims Aid to Shooter's Family, Citing a 'Double Burden'\\" , The Nation, 15 April 2005 (also in Los Angeles Times), accessed 18 December 2012  References  External links  * Jeffrey James Weise obituary, Red Lake New News (March 25, 2005) * Sarah Left, \\"A neo-nazi 'angel of death'\\", The Guardian, 25 March 2005 * Peter Langman, PhD., School Shooters.info, his website to provide discussion, links to resources and data from 10 years of research * Peter Langman, \\"Jeffrey Weise: Family Tree\\", School Shooters * Peter Langman, \\"Biographical timeline of Jeffrey James Weise\\", School Shooters * David Hanners and Beth Silva (March 24, 2005). \\"Troubling Internet postings clash with family's view of a happy Weise\\", Saint Paul Pioneer Press * \\"Jeffrey Weise\\", Yahoo!

HistoryThe Danson Estates before Danson House= The earliest reference to the Danson Estates can be found in an Archbishop's survey of 1284, in which seven of the Archbishop's tenants are cited as owning 17 acres of land at \\"Densynton\\". The Manor of Bexley was acquired by Henry VIII, and remained a part of the royal estates until James I sold it to John Spielman in an attempt to raise funds for the crown. On 1 March 1622 the Manor was bought by William Camden, who immediately granted it to Oxford University to fund a chair in History. In 1695 the estates were sold into private hands for the first time as an owner-occupied property. In 1699 John Styleman, a director of the British East India Company, took up residence at Danson, the estates having been acquired on his behalf by his brother Francis two years earlier. Styleman began to develop the estates as a country seat, but left Danson shortly after the death of his wife Arabella at the property in 1717. In 1723 Styleman leased the property for 99 years to John Selwyn MP, a royal courtier, who improved and enlarged the estates a great deal before his death in 1751. The estate at this point included a mansion with five bedrooms, four living rooms, a nursery, kitchen and brewhouse, as well as an icehouse, elaborate water features, and an ornamental Chinese-style house. =1753‚Äì1800= This painting, by Claude-Joseph Vernet, was commissioned for Danson House. The Walters Art Museum, Baltimore John Styleman had died in 1734, his will stipulating that half the proceeds from the lease should go to his widow, Mary Styleman, and the other half to charities providing almhouses for 12 poor families in Bexley. On 10 July 1753 Selwyn's widow, also Mary, sub-let the property to Sir John Boyd, sugar merchant and vice-chairman of the British East India Company, and son of the St Kitts planter and slaveholder Augustus Boyd. By 1759 Boyd had taken over the lease and bought out the rest of the land added to the estates by Selwyn. However, he still had to pay ¬£100 annuity to the charity established by Styleman's will, which owned half of the freehold. His offer of a permanent annuity in return for the charity's half of the freehold required an Act of Parliament, and as a result the Styleman Act was passed in 1762, and John Boyd thus became the sole owner of the entire estates, paving the way for extensive enlargement of the property and the construction of Danson House as it stands today. Originally called Danson Hill, the Palladian villa was designed by leading architect Sir Robert Taylor (architect of the Bank of England), and constructed to the north of the older mansion. Work began on the house in 1763, and Boyd moved into the house around 1768 with his new wife Catherine. By the time of Boyd's death in 1800 it stood in the centre of over 600 acres (2.4 km¬≤) of pleasure grounds and agricultural estate ‚Äì over 200 acres (0.8 km¬≤) of which today form Danson Park, the second largest public park in the London Borough of Bexley. Internal furnishings and decorations, including ornate chimney-pieces, were designed by William Chambers, a friend of Boyd's, and murals and paintings were produced for the house by artists such as Richard Wilson and Richard Corbould. The landscape was designed and laid out from 1761 to 1763, by either Capability Brown or his assistant Nathaniel Richmond. At its centre is a large and picturesque 12-acre (49,000 m¬≤) lake to the south of the house, on the site of the previous mansion, described by Edward Hasted in his History and Topographical Survey of the County of Kent of 1797 as \\"a most magnificent sheet of water so contrived as to seem a beautiful serpentine river, flowing through the grounds\\". A small house with a spire, named Chapel House, was constructed to the south of Danson House, which has now been separated from the rest of the park by a motorway, but can still be seen today near the roundabout at Blendon. =1800‚Äìpresent= The back of Danson House After Sir John died in January 1800 (being buried in St Mary's churchyard, Lewisham), his son demolished the imposing wings containing kitchens and stables, and built the present stable block (design attributed to George Dance the Younger). He sold the estate in 1807 to John Johnston, a retired army captain of the 62nd Regiment of Foot and Freeman of the City of London. In 1829, it passed to Johnston's son Hugh. Hugh's daughter Sarah painted a number of watercolours of the interior in the 1860s with intricate detail, which were later of key use in the restoration of the interior. Hugh Johnston sold Danson to railway engineer Alfred Bean in 1862. Bean was the driving force behind the Bexleyheath Railway Company, and chairman of Bexley Local Board, and envisaged transforming the 582-acre (2.4 km¬≤) estate into a residential suburb. Outlying areas were sold off for residential development according to Bean's will, but the house and 224 acres of the estate remained in Bean's family after his death in 1890, until the death of his widow in 1921, when it was auctioned, and eventually acquired by Bexley Urban District Council for ¬£16,000 in 1924. The park was opened to the public in 1925 by Princess Mary, while the house was used for civil defence purposes during World War Two. Over time football pitches, tennis courts and a bowling green have been added, along with an open-air swimming pool in 1936 and the Boathouse and Cafe, open to the public in 1964. The park is now used extensively by the community. When the house was acquired by English Heritage in 1995, it was in a dangerously dilapidated condition, having been uninhabited since 1923, and was described by English Heritage as \\"the most significant building at risk in London\\". It was painstakingly restored in a ten-year ¬£4.5m project by Purcell Miller Tritton architects. Bexley Heritage Trust, a local heritage charity, was involved in partnership with English Heritage from 2000 and completed the interior furnishing and fitting-out of the house prior to its reopening by HM The Queen in Spring 2005. The Danson Park grounds were also restored, funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund, in 2006. In 2016, the borough cancelled its grant to the Bexley Heritage Trust for the upkeep of the property, and the charity therefore withdrew to focus on Hall Place, and the house fell under direct management from the borough. The council has subsequently made Danson House the register office for Bexley Borough. The basement was used as a kitchen during the 19th century The house is now owned by English Heritage on a 999-year lease from 1997, and will eventually be managed by a trust. It is open to the public on selected viewing days. The estate's stable block is now a public house, the Danson Stables. The house was used as a filming location for the 2017 historical TV drama Taboo, starring Tom Hardy.

It was founded in 1981 in Apopka, Florida, by Mark Miller (lead vocals, rhythm guitar), Gregg \\"Hobie\\" Hubbard (keyboards, vocals), Bobby Randall (lead guitar, vocals), Joe \\"Curly\\" Smyth (drums), and Jim Scholten (bass guitar). The five musicians were originally members of country singer Don King's road band, but chose to stay together after King retired in 1981. After competing on the television competition series Star Search and winning that show's grand prize, they signed to Capitol Records in 1984. The band recorded for Capitol between then and 1991, and for Curb Records between then and 2005, except for a short time in 2003 when they were signed to Lyric Street Records. Duncan Cameron, formerly of the Amazing Rhythm Aces, replaced Randall in 1991, and Shayne Hill replaced him in 2004. Sawyer Brown has released eighteen studio albums and has charted over fifty times on the Hot Country Songs charts, including three No. 1 singles: \\"Step That Step\\" (1985), \\" Some Girls Do\\" (1992), and \\"Thank God for You\\" (1993). The band's sound is largely defined by country pop and rock music influences, with cover versions of songs by George Jones, Michael Johnson, and Dave Dudley also among their hit singles. Artists with whom they have collaborated include Randy Scruggs, Joe Bonsall, and Mac McAnally. History The group's members were originally part of country pop singer Don King's road band. When King stopped touring in 1981, the group decided to stay together. The band played up to five sets a night, six days a week (for a time at Knight's Corral, on Nolensville Rd., in Nashville, as \\"Bobby, Mark, and Sandgap\\"), until they auditioned for the TV show Star Search in 1983. They won the grand prize of $100,000 and a recording contract. The band originally chose the name Savanna. When another band with a similar name emerged, the group decided to change its own moniker. They met at their manager's office in Nashville and began looking through area telephone books for inspiration. They blindly landed on the name of a nearby thoroughfare, Sawyer Brown Road, and derived the new band name \\"Sawyer Brown\\". Sawyer Brown, 1987 The band signed with Capitol Records and scored a Top 20 hit with their first single, \\"Leona\\", in 1984. That success was quickly followed by their first No. 1 hit, \\"Step That Step\\". The band had their ups and downs on the charts throughout the 1980s, landing only sporadic Top 10 hits. However, by 1990 they had accumulated enough hits for a Greatest Hits package, and were successful on the touring circuit. Originally, Sawyer Brown was known for a primarily country pop sound dominated largely by novelty tunes; by 1991, however, the band began to express a more serious side to its music by adding ballads to its repertoire. That year, the band also dropped its affiliation with Capitol, and Curb Records assumed promotion and distribution of all subsequent albums and singles (except for 2003, when Sawyer Brown temporarily switched to Lyric Street Records). Bobby Randall also left the band in 1991, and was replaced by Duncan Cameron. Cameron subsequently departed in 2004, with Shayne Hill assuming the role of lead guitarist. In 1991, after the release of their album Buick, guitarist Bobby Randall left the group to remain close to his family and host a short-lived TV talent show, Be A Star. Duncan Cameron, formerly of The Amazing Rhythm Aces, was chosen as his replacement just as Sawyer Brown was about to become country music's \\"it\\" band. The band then switched labels, moving to Curb Records and releasing the albums The Dirt Road, Caf√© On The Corner, and Outskirts Of Town, which saw hit after hit for the band in the early to mid-1990s. Part of the band's new-found success was due to singer- songwriter Mac McAnally, who wrote several songs for the group. The McAnally- penned songs, mostly ballads, helped to re-define Sawyer Brown, who up until this point had been reviled by many critics for being a flamboyant \\"bubble gum\\" pop act that emphasized style over substance. \\"The Walk\\", the final single off the Buick album, is said to be the turning point for the group. Following \\"The Walk\\", the band scored a number of Top 5 and Top 10 hits, including 2 more Billboard No. 1s with 1992's \\"Some Girls Do\\", and 1993's \\"Thank God for You\\", which Mark Miller co-wrote with Mac McAnally. By 1995, Sawyer Brown had enough hits for a second Greatest Hits package. The album, titled Greatest Hits 1990 to 1995, included two new singles, \\"This Time\\" and \\"I Don't Believe in Goodbye\\", which themselves became Top 5 hits. In the latter half of the 1990s, the group seemed to gradually fall out of favor with country radio, despite a crossover hit in 1999 with \\"Drive Me Wild\\". They parted ways with Curb in 2003 and signed with Lyric Street Records. One single was released on Lyric Street before Sawyer Brown left that label as well. 2004 saw the group returning to Curb Records, just as Duncan Cameron decided to leave the group to pursue a lifelong dream of flying for Southwest Airlines. Guitarist Shayne Hill replaced Duncan's post as guitarist, although both Cameron and Hill are in the credits on Mission Temple Fireworks Stand. The album's title track, featuring Robert Randolph, peaked at No. 55\\\\. The second single off that album, \\"They Don't Understand\\", was a minor Top 40 hit on the country charts, and Top 20 on the Christian single charts. Sawyer Brown has released twenty studio albums, of which three have been certified gold in the United States for sales of 500,000 copies. More than fifty of their singles have entered the U.S. Billboard Hot Country Songs charts, including three Number One singles. Sawyer Brown also received a Horizon Award from the Country Music Association in 1985, as well as a Vocal Group of the Year award in 1997 from the Academy of Country Music and five Vocal Band of The Year Awards from the TNN Music City News Country Awards. Sawyer Brown wrote \\"The Nebraska Song\\" in honor of Brook Berringer, a Nebraska Cornhuskers quarterback who died in a plane crash on April 18, 1996. (The song was actually written before his death.) The song appears on the group's album Six Days on the Road. Mark Miller also served as a pallbearer at Berringer's funeral. In 1998, the band appeared at the Unforgiven: In Your House Pay Per View and performed a lip synced version of \\"Some Girls Do\\" with Jeff Jarrett. In the early 2000s, Mark Miller formed Christian music label Beach Street Records. One of the first acts he began producing for the label was Casting Crowns.

Optical interfaces to biological neural networks can be created with optogenetics, but is not the same as an optical neural networks. In biological neural networks there exist a lot of different mechanisms for dynamically changing the state of the neurons, these include short-term and long-term synaptic plasticity. Synaptic plasticity is among the electrophysiological phenomena used to control the efficiency of synaptic transmission, long-term for learning and memory, and short-term for short transient changes in synaptic transmission efficiency. Implementing this with optical components is difficult, and ideally requires advanced photonic materials. Properties that might be desirable in photonic materials for optical neural networks include the ability to change their efficiency of transmitting light, based on the intensity of incoming light.  Implementations  In 2007 there was one model of Optical Neural Network: the Programmable Optical Array/Analogic Computer (POAC). It had been implemented in the year 2000 and reported based on modified Joint Fourier Transform Correlator (JTC) and Bacteriorhodopsin (BR) as a holographic optical memory.

A white solid, it is rare in nature but has attracted attention as an artificial sweetener. It is often found in dairy products, and is very similar in texture to sucrose (table sugar) and is 92% as sweet, but with only 38% of the calories. Tagatose is generally recognized as safe (GRAS) by the FAO/WHO and has been since 2001. Since it is metabolized differently from sucrose, tagatose has a minimal effect on blood glucose and insulin levels. Tagatose is also approved as a tooth-friendly ingredient for dental products. Production Tagatose is a natural sweetener present in only small amounts in fruits, cacao, and dairy products. Starting with lactose, which is hydrolyzed to glucose and galactose, tagatose can then be produced commercially from the resulting galactose. The galactose is isomerized under alkaline conditions to D-tagatose by calcium hydroxide. Development as a sweetener D-Tagatose was proposed as a sweetener by G. Levin, after unsuccessful attempts to market L-glucose for that application. He patented an inexpensive method to make tagatose in 1988.. The low food calorie contents is due to its resemblance to L-fructose. Safety and function Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved tagatose as a food additive in October 2003 and designated it as generally recognized as safe (GRAS). Korea Food & Drug Administration (KFDA) approved tagatose as health functional food for antihyperglycemic effect. European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) approved tagatose as novel food and novel food ingredient. New Zealand, and Australia have also approved tagatose for human consumption. CharacteristicsFunctional characteristics=Low glycemic index Tagatose has very similar sweetness to sugar while its glycemic index (GI 3) is very low. GI is a measure of the effects of carbohydrates in food on blood sugar levels. It estimates how much each gram of available carbohydrate (total carbohydrate minus fiber) in a food raises a person's blood glucose level following consumption of the food, relative to consumption of glucose. Glucose has a glycemic index of 100, by definition, and other foods have lower glycemic index. Sucrose has a GI of 68, fructose is 24, and tagatose has very low GI compared with other sweeteners. High blood glucose levels or repeated glycemic \\"spikes\\" following a meal may promote type 2 diabetes by increasing systemic glycative stress other oxidative stress to the vasculature and also by the direct increase in insulin levels,Temelkova- Kurktschiev TS, Koehler C, Henkel E, Leonhardt W, Fuecker K, Hanefeld M., Postchallenge plasma glucose and glycemic spikes are more strongly associated with atherosclerosis than fasting glucose or HbA1c level., Diabetes Care. 2000 Dec;23(12):1830-4. while individuals who followed a low-GI diet over many years were at a significantly lower risk for developing both type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, and age-related macular degeneration than others.Chiu CJ, Liu S, Willett WC, Wolever TM, Brand-Miller JC, Barclay AW, Taylor A., Informing Food Choices and Health Outcomes by Use of The Dietary Glycemic Index., Nutr Rev., 2011 ;69(4): 231-42. Antihyperglycemic effect KFDA approved the safety and function of tagatose for controlling postprandial blood glucose level. Tagatose reduces blood glucose level in the liver by promoting glucokinase activity which promotes transfer of glucose to glycogen. It also inhibits digestive enzymes and degradation of carbohydrates in small intestine which result in inhibition of carbohydrate absorption in the body. Clinical studies have shown that tagatose significantly reduces blood glucose levels among healthy, prediabetic, impaired fasting glucose, and impaired glucose tolerance subjects. Antihyperglycemic function is important for those with both type 1 diabetes mellitus and type 2 diabetes mellitus especially because diabetes is continuously growing and spreading to the younger generation. US$92 billion was spent for diabetes medication in 2008 in the US, and US$50 billion is paid in China per year.WHO report, 13Nov 2009 =Physical characteristics= Tagatose is a white crystalline powder with a molecular formula of C6H12O6 with a molecular weight of 180.16g/mol. Active maillard reaction of tagatose enhances flavor and brown coloring performance and is usually used for baking, cooking and with high-intensity sweeteners to mask their bitter aftertaste. Marketing In 1996, MD/Arla Foods acquired the rights to production from Spherix, the American license holder. In the following years, no products were brought to market by MD/Arla Foods, so Spherix brought them before a US Court of Arbitration for showing insufficient interest in bringing the product to market. The companies settled, with MD/Arla Foods agreeing to pay longer-term royalties to Spherix and Spherix agreeing to not take further action. In March 2006, SweetGredients (a joint venture company of Arla Foods and Nordzucker AG) decided to shelve the tagatose project. SweetGredients was the only worldwide producer of tagatose. While progress had been made in creating a market for this innovative sweetener, it had not been possible to identify a large enough potential to justify continued investments, and SweetGredients decided to close down the manufacturing of tagatose in Nordstemmen, Germany. In 2006, the Belgian company Nutrilab NV took over the Arla (SweetGredients) stocks and project, and set up an 800-tons-per-year production site in Italy with an enzymatic process from whey for D-tagatose with the brand name Nutrilatose. This process was said to be considerably cheaper than the chemical process previously used by Arla. In 2007 Damhert N.V., the mother company of Nutrilab, released the tagatose-based sweetener Tagatesse under its own brand name, along with some other products (jams and some chocolate-based products) using tagatose (2013) Tagatose Damhurt Nutrition web page, Retrieved 28 February 2013 in the Benelux and France. Damhert's marketing strategy was to gradually build up the market for tagatose by introducing it to small and medium-sized companies. In 2013, 30% of the profits of Damhert were reported to come from tagatose, and they were preparing to scale up their production capacity to 2,500 tons per year.Goodwin, Diana (20 February 2013) The sweet taste of success Flanders Today, Retrieved 27 February 2013 It was also reported in February 2013 that PepsiCo and Yoplait were interested in using tagatose. Damhert were considering in the longer term building a 10,000-tons-per-annum tagatose plant in Belgium but needed to find the capital to build such a plant.Grommen, Stefan (5 February 2013) Pepsi en Yoplait reikhalzen naar Limburgse zoetstof (Pepsi and Yoplait would like to use Limburg sweetener) (In Dutch) Het Laatste Nieuws, Retrieved 28 February 2013 One of the major producers for D-tagatose is CJ Cheiljedang, Inc. located in South Korea, under the brand name \\"Baeksul Tagatose\\".

He was educated at a Jesuit school, studied law at Paris, and became one of the editors of the Revue de Bruxelles. In 1839 he was elected to the Belgian lower chamber, where he gained a great reputation for oratory. He was a member of parliament from 1839 to 1866. As such he took historic initiatives to promote the Dutch language that had lost ground in political life since the Belgian Revolution of 1830 (against the Union with Holland as the United Kingdom of the Netherlands) even though the majority of the population spoke Dutch. De Decker was at the origin of a 'Petition in favour of the Flemish language' in 1840 and of the setting up of a 'Committee on Flemish Grievances' in 1855. In 1855 he became Minister of the Interior and the tenth Prime Minister of Belgium. As such he was the first leader of the government since the revolution of 1830 who dared to address the parliament in Dutch (Flemish). He attempted, by combining the moderate elements of the Catholic and Liberal parties, the impossible task of resolving the educational and other questions then dividing Belgium. In 1866 he retired from politics and went into business, with disastrous results. He became involved in financial speculations which lost him his good name as well as the greater part of his fortune; and, though he was never proved to have been more than the victim of clever operators, when in 1871 he was appointed by the Catholic cabinet governor of Limburg, the outcry was so great that he resigned the appointment and retired definitively into private life. He died in 1891.

She worked in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and was known for her use of a large-format instant Polaroid camera. Early life and education Dorfman was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on April 26, 1937, and was raised in Roxbury and Newton. She was the eldest of three daughters of Arthur and Elaine (Kovitz). Her father worked at a grocery chain as a produce buyer; her mother was a housewife. Her family was of Jewish descent. She studied at Tufts University, where she majored in French literature. During her junior year, she went on exchange to Europe, where she worked in Brussels for Expo 58 and lived in Paris, living in the same student accommodation as Susan Sontag. Dorfman graduated in 1959 and subsequently moved to New York City, where she was employed as a secretary by Grove Press, a leading Beat publisher.Dorfman explains her background in her Housebook The Camera When she returned to Boston, she pursued a master's degree in elementary education at Boston College.  Career  After earning her master's degree, Dorfman spent a year teaching fifth grade at a school in Concord. Calling herself the \\"Paterson Society\\", Dorfman began arranging readings for many Beat authors who had become friends, maintaining an active correspondence with them as they traveled the world. In 1963, she began working for the Educational Development Corporation whose photographer, George Cope, introduced her to photography in June 1965. She made her first sale two months later, in August 1965, for $25 of a photograph of Charles Olson which was used on the cover of his book The Human Universe. Due to economic limitations, she did not buy her own camera until 1967, when she sent a check for $150 to Philip Whalen who was then in Kyoto, Japan, and he in turn enlisted Gary Snyder, who could speak Japanese, to purchase the camera and mail it to her. In May 1968, she moved into the Flagg Street house which would become the basis of her Housebook. Portrait of Bob Dylan and Allen Ginsberg, 1975 Dorfman's principal published work, originally published in 1974, was Elsa's Housebook ‚Äì A Woman's Photojournal,Elsa Dorfman's Housebook a photographic record of family and friends who visited her in Cambridge when she lived there during the late 1960s and early 1970s. Many well known people, especially literary figures associated with the Beat generation, are prominent in the book, including Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Allen Ginsberg, Peter Orlovsky, Gary Snyder, Gregory Corso, and Robert Creeley, in addition to people who would become notable in other fields, such as radical feminist Andrea Dworkin, and civil rights lawyer Harvey Silverglate (who would become Dorfman's husband). She also photographed staples of the Boston rock scene such as Jonathan Richman, frontman of The Modern Lovers, and Steven Tyler of Aerosmith. In 1995, she collaborated with graphic artist Marc A. Sawyer to illustrate the booklet 40 Ways to Fight the Fight Against AIDS. She photographed people, both with and without AIDS, each engaged in one of forty activities that might help AIDS victims in their daily life. The photographs were exhibited 1995 at the Lotus Development Corporation in Cambridge, in Provincetown and New York City. The artist donated the costs of producing the photographs for this project.Hoffmann, K. (1999). Elsa Dorfman: Portraits of Our Time. Woman's Art Journal Vol. 20, No. 2, 1999, 28.

She was known for her use of the Polaroid 20 by 24 inch camera (one of only six in existence),According to her web site FAQ, Frequently Asked Questions about Elsa Dorfman's Portrait Photography on the Polaroid 20x24 Camera from which she created large prints. She photographed famous writers, poets, and musicians including Bob Dylan and Allen Ginsberg. Due to bankruptcy, the Polaroid Corporation entirely ceased production of its unique instant film products in 2008. Dorfman stocked up with a year's supply of her camera's last available 20 by 24 instant film. Dorfman's life and work were the subject of the 2016 documentary film The B-Side: Elsa Dorfman's Portrait Photography, directed by Errol Morris. Her portraits are held in the collections of the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, the National Portrait Gallery in Washington, D.C., the Harvard Art Museums, the Portland Museum of Art in Maine and others. Personal life In 1967, Dorfman met Harvey Silverglate, who was representing the defense in a drug trial. Dorfman thought the case could be the subject of a book and talked it over with him, after which Silverglate asked to take a portrait of him and his brother to give to their mother. They married nearly a decade later in 1976. Together, they had one son, Isaac. Dorfman died on May 30, 2020 at her home in Cambridge.

He has written two trilogies, Chronicles of the Raven and Legends of the Raven, and a related novella, Light Stealer. His latest project is a new series titled The Ascendants of Estorea. The first book, Cry of the Newborn, was published in October 2005. The sequel, A Shout for the Dead was published in January 2007, which was late due to publication delays.  Biography  James Barclay was born on 15 March 1965, shortly after midday. For 18 years he lived in Felixstowe, Suffolk with his parents (Thea and Keith), two sisters (Nancy and Virginia) and an older brother (Mike). Barclay's love for writing spawned from a love for reading. His brother introduced him to the genres of Sci-Fi and Fantasy, and he began to play role playing games enthusiastically. From reading many books from the genre, Barclay began to write from the age of 11. The first story which he wrote (at the age of 13) was called \\"Troja: Dawn\\". Barclay claims \\"it was and is utterly awful\\". After this came his second effort at the age of 15, titled \\"What Price, Civilization?\\". At the age of 18, Barclay moved to Sheffield City Polytechnic to study Electronics Control and Design Engineering. After two weeks he changed from Science to Arts, taking up Communication Studies. His first published work came at this time in a local journal. By the end of his course, Barclay had decided to become an actor, and moved to London to do a post graduate course in Performing Arts. Since leaving the course, he has been a part in a small number of student films, and several works of amateur dramatics. The first full manuscript which Barclay wrote had its roots in the earlier sci-fi/fantasy fusion genre. It was entitled \\"The All-God's gift\\" and was not published. After multiple jobs from the age of 23, including a parcel delivery driver (where he lasted just nine weeks) he left Insight Investment in March 2004 to write full-time. Barclay never stopped writing and submitting, and in May 1998 he achieved success when he found out he was going to be published. The first book of seven about The Raven, Dawnthief, was published in the UK in 1999. Since then he has gone on to write a number of books regarding the raven, and also his new duology The Ascendants of Estorea. Barclay is currently married to his wife Clare, and they both live in Teddington. He has two boys Oscar and Ollie.  Bibliography The Raven= The Chronicles of the Raven is primarily set on Balaia and revolves around a group of mercenaries who call themselves The Raven. The trilogy consists of three novels: * Dawnthief * Noonshade * Nightchild The events of Legends of the Raven continue on from the events of Chronicles of the Raven and consists of another three novels: * Elfsorrow * Shadowheart * Demonstorm The story is picked back up 10 years after the end of Demonstorm many of the previous characters are brought back *Ravensoul His two trilogies are both published by Victor Gollancz Ltd. Light Stealer is set in the same world as the above trilogies, but set several hundred years previously. The events revolve around a famous mage named Septern who is mentioned many times in the trilogies. Light Stealer is published by PS Publishing. Barclay has stated on numerous occasions that he is unlikely to write any more books regarding The Raven, however he has stated on his online forum that he is interested in writing an encyclopaedia on the world of The Raven. But in 2008 he released Ravensoul which brings back many of the previous characters for one final battle. On 18 July Barclay announced he is writing a seventh Raven book titled Ravensoul, quoted in the news section of his site \\"Ravensoul is about how honour and love transcend the boundary of life and death; and how greed and the lust for power can put at risk the lives, and deaths, of everyone.\\" An origin story of the company of The Raven entitled \\"Or so Legend Has It\\" can be found in \\"Legends\\", a 2013 collection of short stories in honour of David Gemmell. =The Ascendants= The Ascendants of Estorea, departs from the world of Balaia. The titles of the two books are: * Cry of the Newborn * Shout for the Dead =Elves= Set on Calaius, the southern continent of Balaia, this trilogy tells the story of the elves' history and the creation of the spell Dawnthief by Septern: * Once Walked With Gods, set 3,000 years before the events of The Raven. * Rise of the TaiGethen * Beyond the Mists of Katura Online presence Barclay runs an official website (below) which contains his biography, a bibliography, latest extract, and also an online blog. He also participates and encourages discussion regarding his books on his online forum, which to date (March 2007) has just over 300 members. The forum has recently been changed and updated. It is a growing community, and its members have referred to themselves as \\"Ravenites\\" and \\"Forumites\\" and James acknowledged these members as \\"Forumites\\" in the dedications for his book, Cry of the Newborn.

Its current range is restricted to the Gir National Park and environs in the Indian state of Gujarat. Historically, it inhabited much of Western Asia and the Middle East up to northern India. On the IUCN Red List, it is listed under its former scientific name Panthera leo persica as Endangered because of its small population size and area of occupancy. The first scientific description of the Asiatic lion was published in 1826 by the Austrian zoologist Johann N. Meyer who named it Felis leo persicus. Until the 19th century, it occurred in Saudi Arabia eastern Turkey, Iran, Mesopotamia, and from east of the Indus River to Bengal and Narmada River in Central India. Since the turn of the 20th century, it is restricted to the Gir Forest National Park and surrounding areas. This lion population has steadily increased since 2010. In May 2015, the 14th Asiatic Lion Census was conducted over an area of about ; the lion population was estimated at 523 individuals, comprising 109 adult males, 201 adult females and 213 cubs. In August 2017, surveyors counted 650 wild lions. The 15th Asiatic Lion Census could not be conducted in 2020, as scheduled, because of the COVID-19 pandemic. In June 2020, an estimation exercise counted 674 Asiatic lions in the Gir forest region, an increase of 29 per cent over the 2015 census figure. The lion is one of five pantherine cats inhabiting India, along with the Bengal tiger (P. tigris tigris), Indian leopard (P. pardus fusca), snow leopard (P. uncia) and clouded leopard (Neofelis nebulosa). It was also known as the \\"Indian lion\\" and the \\"Persian lion\\".  Taxonomy  Felis leo persicus was the scientific name proposed by Johann N. Meyer in 1826 who described an Asiatic lion skin from Persia. Following his, other naturalists and zoologists also described lion specimens from other parts of Asia that used to be considered synonyms of P. l. persica: *Felis leo bengalensis proposed by Edward Turner Bennett in 1829 was a lion kept in the menagerie of the Tower of London. Bennett's essay contains a drawing titled 'Bengal lion'. *Felis leo goojratensis proposed by Walter Smee in 1833 was based on two skins of maneless lions from Gujarat that Smee exhibited in a meeting of the Zoological Society of London. *Leo asiaticus was proposed by Sir William Jardine, 7th Baronet in 1834 for a lion from India. *Felis leo indicus proposed by Henri Marie Ducrotay de Blainville in 1843 was based on an Asiatic lion skull. In 2017, the Asiatic lion was subsumed to P. l. leo due to close morphological and molecular genetic similarities with Barbary lion specimens.  Evolution  Fossil remains of Panthera spelaea excavated in the Cromer Stage indicate that it represented a genetically isolated and highly distinct lineage, not closely related to Asiatic lions. Fossil lion remains were found in Pleistocene deposits in West Bengal. A fossil carnassial excavated in the Batadomba Cave indicates that Panthera leo sinhaleyus inhabited Sri Lanka during the late Pleistocene, and is thought to have become extinct around 39,000 years ago. Deraniyagala described this lion in 1939 that was distinct from today's lion. = Lion phylogeography = Results of a phylogeographic analysis based on mtDNA sequences of lions from across the global range, including now extinct populations like Barbary lions, indicates that Sub-Saharan African lions are phylogenetically basal to all modern lions. These findings support an African origin of modern lion evolution with a probable centre in East and Southern Africa. It is likely that lions migrated from there to West Africa, eastern North Africa and via the periphery of the Arabian Peninsula into Turkey, southern Europe and northern India during the last 20,000 years. The Sahara, tropical rainforest and the Great Rift Valley are natural barriers to lion dispersal. An older study of Genetic markers of 357 samples from captive and wild lions from Africa and India, not including extinct populations, were examined during a study on lion evolution. Results indicate four lineages of lion populations: one in Central and North Africa to Asia, one in Kenya, one in Southern Africa, and one in Southern and East Africa. It suggested that the first wave of lion expansion to have occurred about 118,000 years ago from East Africa into West Asia, and the second wave in the late Pleistocene or early Holocene periods from Southern Africa towards East Africa. The Asiatic lion is genetically closer to North and West African lions than to the group comprising East and Southern African lions. The two groups probably diverged about 186,000‚Äì128,000 years ago. It is thought that the Asiatic lion remained connected to North and Central African lions until gene flow was interrupted due to extinction of lions in Western Eurasia and the Middle East during the Holocene. Asiatic lions are genetically less diverse than lions in Africa, which may be the result of a founder effect in the recent history of the remnant population in the Gir Forest.  Characteristics  The Asiatic lion's fur ranges in colour from ruddy-tawny, heavily speckled with black, to sandy or buffish grey, sometimes with a silvery sheen in certain lights. Males have only moderate mane growth at the top of the head, so that their ears are always visible. The mane is scanty on the cheeks and throat where it is only long. About half of Asiatic lions' skulls from the Gir forest have divided infraorbital foramina, whereas African lions have only one foramen on either side. The sagittal crest is more strongly developed, and the post-orbital area is shorter than in African lion. Skull length in adult males ranges from , and in females from . It differs from the African lion by a larger tail tuft and less inflated auditory bullae. The most striking morphological character of the Asiatic lion is a longitudinal fold of skin running along its belly. Shoulder height of males is , and of females . Head-and-body measurements of two lions in Gir Forest were each, with tail-lengths of and total lengths of , respectively. The Gir lion is similar in size to the Central African lion, and smaller than large African lions. Adult males weigh , while females weigh . = Manes = Asiatic (above) and southern African (below) lions. Note the larger tail tuft, sparser mane on the head and prominent fold of skin on the abdomen of the former Colour and development of manes in male lions varies between regions, among populations and with age of lions. In general, the Asiatic lion differs from the African lion by a less developed mane. The manes of most lions in ancient Greece and Asia Minor were also less developed and did not extend to below the belly, sides or ulnas. Lions with such smaller manes were also known in the Syrian region, Arabian peninsula and Egypt. In contrast, a stone relief at Nineveh in the Mesopotamian Plain depicts a lion with underbelly hair. Therefore, it was suspected that the Mesopotamian lion may have been a distinct subspecies, for which the scientific name Panthera leo mesopotamica was proposed. = Exceptionally sized lions = The confirmed record total length of a male Indian lion is , including the tail. Emperor Jahangir allegedly speared a lion in the 1620s that measured and weighed . In 1841, Austen Henry Layard accompanied hunters in Khuzestan, Iran, and sighted a lion which \\"had done much damage in the plain of Ram Hormuz,\\" before one of his companions killed it. He described it as being \\"unusually large and of very dark brown colour\\", with some parts of its body being almost black. In 1935, a British Admiral claimed to have sighted a maneless lion feeding on a goat near Quetta. He wrote \\"It was a large lion, very stocky, light tawny in colour, and I may say that no one of us three had the slightest doubt of what we had seen until, on our arrival at Quetta, many officers expressed doubts as to its identity, or to the possibility of there being a lion in the district.\\"  Distribution and habitat  Habitat in Gir Forest In Saurashtra's Gir Forest, an area of was declared as a sanctuary for Asiatic lion conservation in 1965. This sanctuary and the surrounding areas are the only habitats supporting the Asiatic lion. After 1965, a national park was established covering an area of where human activity is not allowed. In the surrounding sanctuary only Maldharis have the right to take their livestock for grazing. Lions inhabit remnant forest habitats in the two hill systems of Gir and Girnar that comprise Gujarat's largest tracts of tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests, thorny forest and savanna, and provide valuable habitat for a diverse flora and fauna. Five protected areas currently exist to protect the Asiatic lion: Gir Sanctuary, Gir National Park, Pania Sanctuary, Mitiyala Sanctuary, and Girnar Sanctuary. The first three protected areas form the Gir Conservation Area, a large forest block that represents the core habitat of the lion population. The other two sanctuaries Mitiyala and Girnar protect satellite areas within dispersal distance of the Gir Conservation Area. An additional sanctuary is being established in the nearby Barda Wildlife Sanctuary to serve as an alternative home for lions. The drier eastern part is vegetated with acacia thorn savanna and receives about annual rainfall; rainfall in the west is higher at about per year. The lion population recovered from the brink of extinction to 411 individuals by 2010. In that year, approximately 105 lions lived outside the Gir forest, representing a quarter of the entire lion population. Dispersing sub-adults established new territories outside their natal prides, and as a result the satellite lion population has been increasing since 1995. By 2015, the total population had grown to an estimated 523 individuals, inhabiting an area of in the Saurashtra region. The Asiatic Lion Census conducted in 2017 revealed about 650 individuals. In November 2019, a lioness and a sub-adult were seen in villages about from Chotila Village in Surendranagar district. This location is about from Gir Forest, making the district the fifth in Gujarat to have wild lions. Apparently on a hunting mission, they had killed a bovine at a farm in the village of Rampura Chobara, causing local villagers to fear for themselves and their livestock. = Former range = The Asiatic lion used to occur in Arabia, Palestine, Mesopotamia and Baluchistan. In South Caucasia, it was known since the Holocene and became extinct in the 10th century. Until the middle of the 19th century, it survived in regions adjoining Mesopotamia and Syria, and was still sighted in the upper reaches of the Euphrates River in the early 1870s. By the late 19th century, the Asiatic lion had become extinct in Saudi Arabia and Turkey. The last known lion in Iraq was killed on the lower Tigris in 1918. Historical records in Iran indicate that it ranged from the Khuzestan Plain to the Fars Province at elevations below in steppe vegetation and pistachio- almond woodlands. It was widespread in the country, but in the 1870s, it was sighted only on the western slopes of the Zagros Mountains, and in the forest regions south of Shiraz. It served as the national emblem and appeared on the country's flag. Some of the country's last lions were sighted in 1941 between Shiraz and Jahrom in the Fars Province, and in 1942, a lion was spotted about northwest of Dezful. In 1944, the corpse of a lioness was found on the banks of the Karun River in Iran's Khuzestan Province. In India, the Asiatic lion occurred in Sind, Bahawalpur, Punjab, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Haryana, Bihar and eastward as far as Palamau and Rewa, Madhya Pradesh in the early 19th century. It once ranged to Bengal in the east and up to the Narmada River in the south. Because of the lion's restricted distribution in India, Reginald Innes Pocock assumed that it arrived from Europe, southwestern Asia through Balochistan only recently, before humans started limiting its dispersal in the country. The advent and increasing availability of firearms led to its local extinction over large areas. Heavy hunting by British colonial officers and Indian rulers caused a steady and marked decline of lion numbers in the country. Lions were exterminated in Palamau by 1814, in Baroda, Hariana and Ahmedabad district in the 1830s, in Kot Diji and Damoh in the 1840s. During the Indian Rebellion of 1857, a British officer shot 300 lions. The last lions of Gwalior and Rewah were shot in the 1860s. One lion was killed near Allahabad in 1866. The last lion of Mount Abu in Rajasthan was spotted in 1872. By the late 1870s, lions were extinct in Rajasthan. By 1880, no lion survived in Guna, Deesa and Palanpur districts, and only about a dozen lions were left in Junagadh district. By the turn of the century, the Gir Forest held the only Asiatic lion population in India, which was protected by the Nawab of Junagarh in his private hunting grounds.  Ecology and behaviour  Male Asiatic lions are solitary or associate with up to three males forming a loose pride. Pairs of males rest, hunt and feed together, and display marking behaviour at the same sites. Females associate with up to 12 females forming a stronger pride together with their cubs. They share large carcasses among each other, but seldom with males. Female and male lions usually associate only for a few days when mating, but rarely live and feed together. Results of a radio telemetry study indicate that annual home ranges of male lions vary from in dry and wet seasons. Home ranges of females are smaller, varying between . During hot and dry seasons, they favour densely vegetated and shady riverine habitats, where prey species also congregate. Coalitions of males defend home ranges containing one or more female prides. Together, they hold a territory for a longer time than single lions. Males in coalitions of three to four individuals exhibit a pronounced hierarchy with one male dominating the others. = Feeding ecology = In general, lions prefer large prey species within a weight range of irrespective of their availability. Domestic cattle have historically been a major component of the Asiatic lions' diet in the Gir Forest. Inside the Gir Forest National Park, lions predominantly kill chital, sambar, nilgai, cattle, buffalo and less frequently also wild boar. They most commonly kill chital, which weighs only around . They prey on sambar deer when the latter descend from the hills during summer. Outside the protected area where wild prey species do not occur, lions prey on buffalo and cattle, rarely also on camel. They generally kill most prey less than away from water bodies, charge prey from close range and drag carcasses into dense cover. However, there is evidence of lion predation on mugger crocodiles on the banks of the Kamleshwar Dam (built on Hiran River) during dry, hot months. In 1974, the Forest Department estimated the wild ungulate population at 9,650 individuals. In the following decades, the wild ungulate population has grown consistently to 31,490 in 1990 and 64,850 in 2010, including 52,490 chital, 4,440 wild boar, 4,000 sambar, 2,890 nilgai, 740 chinkara, and 290 four-horned antelope. In contrast, populations of domestic buffalo and cattle declined following resettlement, largely due to direct removal of resident livestock from the Gir Conservation Area. The population of 24,250 domestic livestock in the 1970s declined to 12,500 by the mid-1980s, but increased to 23,440 animals in 2010. Following changes in both predator and prey communities, Asiatic lions shifted their predation patterns. Today, very few livestock kills occur within the sanctuary, and instead most occur in peripheral villages. Depredation records indicate that in and around the Gir Forest, lions killed on average 2,023 livestock annually between 2005 and 2009, and an additional 696 individuals in satellite areas. Dominant males consume about 47% more from kills than their coalition partners. Aggression between partners increases when coalitions are large, but kills are small. = Reproduction = Asiatic lions mate foremost between October and November.Annual Report 1972: Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust, page 42; Mating lasts three to six days. During these days, they usually do not hunt, but only drink water. Gestation lasts about 110 days. Litters comprise one to four cubs. The average interval between births is 24 months, unless cubs die due to infanticide by adult males or because of diseases and injuries. Cubs become independent at the age of about two years. Subadult males leave their natal pride latest at the age of three years and become nomads until they establish their own territory. Dominant males mate more frequently than their coalition partners. During a study carried out between December 2012 and December 2016, three females were observed switching mating partners in favour of the dominant male. Monitoring of more than 70 mating events showed that females mated with males of several rivaling prides that shared their home ranges, and that these males were tolerant toward the same cubs. Only new males that entered the female territories killed unfamiliar cubs. Young females mated foremost with males within their home ranges. Older females selected males at the periphery of their home ranges.  Threats  Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan hunting lions in the area of Burhanpur, present-day Madhya Pradesh, from 1630 The Asiatic lion currently exists as a single subpopulation, and is thus vulnerable to extinction from unpredictable events, such as an epidemic or large forest fire. There are indications of poaching incidents in recent years. There are reports that organized gangs have switched attention from tigers to these lions. There have also been a number of drowning incidents after lions fell into wells. Nearly 25 lions in the vicinity of Gir Forest were found dead in October 2018. Four of them had died because of canine distemper virus, the same virus that had killed several Serengeti lions earlier. Prior to the resettlement of Maldharis, the Gir forest was heavily degraded and used by livestock, which competed with and restricted the population sizes of native ungulates. Various studies reveal tremendous habitat recovery and increases in wild ungulate populations following the Maldhari resettlement during the last four decades. = Conflicts with humans = Since the mid 1990s, the Asiatic lion population has increased to an extent that by 2015 about a third resided outside the protected area. Hence, conflict between local residents and wildlife also increased. Local people protect their crops from nilgai, wild pigs and other herbivores by using electrical fences that are powered with high voltage. Some consider the presence of predators a benefit, as latter keep the herbivore population in check. But some people also fear the lions and killed several in retaliation for attacks on livestock. In July 2012, a lion dragged a man from the veranda of his house and killed him about from the Gir Forest National Park. This was the second attack by a lion in this area, six months after a 25-year-old man was attacked and killed in Dhodadar.  Conservation  Panthera leo persica was included on CITES Appendix I, and is fully protected in India. = Reintroduction = Proposed reintroduction sites in India. Pink spots indicate former populations, blue spots indicate proposed sites.  India  In the 1950s, biologists advised the Indian government to re- establish at least one wild population in the Asiatic lion's former range to ensure the population's reproductive health and to prevent it from being affected by an outbreak of an epidemic. In 1956, the Indian Board for Wildlife accepted a proposal by the Government of Uttar Pradesh to establish a new sanctuary for the envisaged reintroduction, Chandra Prabha Wildlife Sanctuary, covering in eastern Uttar Pradesh, where climate, terrain and vegetation is similar to the conditions in the Gir Forest. In 1957, one male and two female wild-caught Asiatic lions were set free in the sanctuary. This population comprised 11 animals in 1965, which all disappeared thereafter. The Asiatic Lion Reintroduction Project to find an alternative habitat for reintroducing Asiatic lions was pursued in the early 1990s. Biologists from the Wildlife Institute of India assessed several potential translocation sites for their suitability regarding existing prey population and habitat conditions. The Palpur-Kuno Wildlife Sanctuary in northern Madhya Pradesh was ranked as the most promising location, followed by Sita Mata Wildlife Sanctuary and Darrah National Park.Walker, S. (1994). Executive summary of the Asiatic lion PHVA. First draft report. Zoo‚Äôs Print: 2‚Äì22. Until 2000, 1,100 families from 16 villages had been resettled from the Palpur-Kuno Wildlife Sanctuary, and another 500 families from eight villages envisaged to be resettled. With this resettlement scheme the protected area was expanded by . Gujarat state officials resisted the relocation, since it would make the Gir Sanctuary lose its status as the world's only home of the Asiatic lion. Gujarat raised a number of objections to the proposal, and thus the matter went before the Indian Supreme Court. In April 2013, the Indian Supreme Court ordered the Gujarat state to send some of their Gir lions to Madhya Pradesh to establish a second population there.Anand, U. (2013). Supreme Court gives Madhya Pradesh lions' share from Gujarat's Gir. The Indian Express Ltd., 17 April 2013. The court had given wildlife authorities six months to complete the transfer. The number of lions and which ones to be transported will be decided at a later date. As of now, the plan to shift lions to Kuno is in jeopardy, with Madhya Pradesh having apparently given up on acquiring lions from Gujarat.  Iran  In 1977, Iran attempted to restore its lion population by transporting Gir lions to Arzhan National Park, but the project met resistance from the local population, and thus it was not implemented. However, this did not stop Iran from seeking to bring back the lion. In February 2019, Tehran Zoological Garden obtained a male Asiatic lion from Bristol Zoo in the United Kingdom, followed in June by a female from Dublin Zoo. They are supposed to reproduce. = In captivity = Until the late 1990s, captive Asiatic lions in Indian zoos were haphazardly interbred with African lions confiscated from circuses, leading to genetic pollution in the captive Asiatic lion stock. Once discovered, this led to the complete shutdown of the European and American endangered species breeding programs for Asiatic lions, as its founder animals were captive-bred Asiatic lions originally imported from India and were ascertained to be intraspecific hybrids of African and Asian lions. In North American zoos, several Indian-African lion crosses were inadvertently bred, and researchers noted that \\"the fecundity, reproductive success, and spermatozoal development improved dramatically.\\" DNA fingerprinting studies of Asiatic lions have helped in identifying individuals with high genetic variability, which can be used for conservation breeding programs. In 2006, the Central Zoo Authority of India stopped breeding Indian-African cross lions stating that \\"hybrid lions have no conservation value and it is not worth to spend resources on them\\". Now only pure native Asiatic lions are bred in India. In 1972 the Sakkarbaug Zoo sold a pair of young pure-stock lions to the Fauna Preservation Society; which decided they would be accommodated at the Jersey Wildlife Trust where it was hoped to begin a captive breeding programme.Annual Report 1972: Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust; pp 39-42; The Asiatic lion International Studbook was initiated in 1977, followed in 1983 by the North American Species Survival Plan (SSP). The North American population of captive Asiatic lions was composed of descendants of five founder lions, three of which were pure Asian and two were African or African- Asian hybrids. The lions kept in the framework of the SSP consisted of animals with high inbreeding coefficients. In the early 1990s, three European zoos imported pure Asiatic lions from India: London Zoo obtained two pairs; the Z√ºrich Zoologischer Garten one pair; and the Helsinki Zoo one male and two females. In 1994, the European Endangered Species Programme (EEP) for Asiatic lions was initiated. The European Association of Zoos and Aquaria (EAZA) published the first European Studbook in 1999. By 2005, there were 80 Asiatic lions kept in the EEP ‚Äî the only captive population outside of India. As of 2009, more than 100 Asiatic lions were kept within the EEP. The SSP had not resumed; pure-bred Asiatic lions are needed to form a new founder population for breeding in American zoos.  In culture  A painting showing a lion hunt in India, ca. 1810 The famous original sandstone sculpted Lion Capital of Ashoka preserved at Sarnath Museum, which was originally erected around 250 BC atop an Ashoka Pillar at Sarnath. The angle from which this picture has been taken, minus the inverted bell-shaped lotus flower, has been adopted as the National emblem of India, showing the horse on the left and the bull on the right of the Ashoka Chakra in the circular base on which the four lions are standing back to back. On the far side is an elephant and a lion instead. The wheel Ashoka Chakra from its base has been placed onto the center of the National Flag of India. = South and East Asia = * The Sanskrit word for 'lion' is '‡§∏‡§ø‡§Ç‡§π' (si·πÉha), which also signifies the Leo of the Zodiac.Apte, V.

The Mahabharata () contains literature on the lion, such as a comparison to the tiger. * Since ancient times, lion statues adorned palaces and temples and other important buildings in India, and in Buddhist culture, the lion was depicted as the protector of Dharma. In Hinduism lions are associated with Gods and Goddesses. Narasimha (Narasingh or Narasinga ‚Äì man-lion) is described as an incarnation (avatar) of Vishnu within the Puranic texts of Hinduism and is worshiped as \\"Lion God\\". Thus, Asiatic lions are considered sacred by all Hindus in India. A lion-faced dakini also appears in Hinduism and Tibetan Buddhism. The Hindu deity is known as Narasimha and the Tibetan Buddhist form is known as Si·πÉhamukhƒÅ in Sanskrit and Senge Dongma (Wyl. seng ge gdong ma) in Tibetan. The lion is found on numerous flags and coats of arms all across Asia and Europe, and also appears on the Emblem of India and on the flag of Sri Lanka. SinghƒÅsana, meaning seat of a lion, is the traditional Sanskrit name for the throne of a Hindu kingdom in India and Sinhalese kingdom in Sri Lanka since antiquity. * The surnames Singh, Singha and Sinha are related to the Prakrit word si·πÅgha and Sanskrit word si·πÉh·∏• which refer to lions, tigers and leopards.Turner, R. L. (1962‚Äì1966). A comparative dictionary of Indo-Aryan languages. London: Oxford University Press. Includes three supplements, published 1969‚Äì1985. These are common Hindu and Sikh surnames dating back over 2000 years to ancient India. They originally were only used by Rajputs, a Hindu kshatriya or military caste in India since the seventh century. After the birth of the Khalsa brotherhood in 1699, the Sikhs adopted the name \\"Singh\\" at the direction of Guru Gobind Singh. As this name was associated with higher classes and royalty, this action was to combat the prevalent caste system and discrimination by last name. Along with millions of Hindu Rajputs today, it is also used by up to 10 million Sikhs worldwide.McCleod, W. H. (1989). The Sikhs: History, Religion, and Society. Columbia University Press, New YorkSingh, K. (1963). A History of the Sikhs. Volume I. Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey The Sinhalese people are the majority ethnic group of Sri Lanka. The name 'Sinhala' translates to \\"lion's blood\\" or \\"lion people\\" and refers to the myths regarding the descent of the legendary founder of the Sinhalese people 2500 years ago, Prince Vijaya, who is said to have migrated from Singhapur (Simhapura or Singur).The Wisdom Library: The Mahavamsa. The Great Chronicle of Sri Lanka. Chapter 34 ‚àí The Eleven Kings The words \\"singha\\" or \\"singham\\" meaning \\"courageous lion\\" are used as an ending of many surnames, such as \\"Weerasingha\\" used by the Sinhala people, and \\"Veerasingham\\" used by the Tamil people. The name Sinhala comes from the belief that Vijaya's paternal grandfather was a lion. An alternative theory places Singhapur in modern Sihor, which happens to be close to the Gir Sanctuary. * The lion is the symbol of Mahavira, the 24th and last Tirthankara in Jainism. * In the Burmese and Sinhalese animal and planetary zodiac, the lion is the third animal zodiac of the Burmese and the sixth animal zodiac of the Sinhalese people of Sri Lanka.Upham, E. (1829). The History and Doctrine of Budhism: Popularly Illustrated: with Notices of the Kappooism, Or Demon Worship, and of the Bali, Or Planetary Incantations, of Ceylon. London: R. Ackermann. * The lion is the basis of the lion dances that form part of the traditional Chinese New Year celebrations, and of similar customs in other Asian countries. Chinese guardian lions and their Eastern, Southeastern and Southern Asian counterparts depicted in Chinese art were modeled on the basis of lions found in Indian temples. Buddhist monks, or possibly traders, possibly brought descriptions of sculpted lions guarding the entry to temples in China. Chinese sculptors then used the description to model \\"Fo-Lions\\" (Fo () is a character for the Buddha) temple statues after native dogs (possibly the Tibetan Mastiff) by adding a shaggy mane. Depictions of these \\"Fo-lions\\" have been found in Chinese religious art as early as 208 BC. The Tibetan Snow Lion (Tibetan: ‡ΩÇ‡ΩÑ‡Ω¶‡ºã‡Ω¶‡Ω∫‡ΩÑ‡ºã‡ΩÇ‡Ω∫‡ºã; Wylie: gangs seng ge) is a mythical animal of Tibet. It symbolizes fearlessness, unconditional cheerfulness, the eastern quadrant and the element of Earth. It is said to range over mountains, and is commonly pictured as being white with a turquoise mane. Two Snow Lions appear on the flag of Tibet. Many East Asian languages borrowed from the Sanskrit word for lion. * Cambodia has a native martial art called L-bukkatao (, Pounding a lion). * The island nation of Singapore (Singapura) derives its name from the Malay words (lion) and (city), which in turn is from the Sanskrit () and () . According to the Malay Annals, this name was given by a 13th-century Sumatran Malay prince named Sang Nila Utama, who, on alighting the island after a thunderstorm, spotted an auspicious beast on shore that his chief minister identified as an Asiatic lion. Recent studies of Singapore indicate lions have never lived there, unlike the tiger. Therefore, the animal seen by Sang Nila Utama would more likely have been a tiger, though it would be odd for them not to recognize one.

For example, Surat al-Muddaththir of the Quran criticizes people who were averse to the Islamic Prophet Muhammad's teachings, such as that the rich have an obligation to donate wealth to the poor, comparing their attitude to itself, with the response of prey to a qaswarah (, meaning \\"lion\\", \\"beast of prey\\", or \\"hunter\\"). Other Arabic words for 'lion' include asad () and saba ø (), and they can be used as names of places, or titles of people. An Arabic toponym for the Levantine City of Beersheba () can mean \\"Spring of the Lion.\\" Men with a reputation for bravery like Ali ibn Abi Talib and Hamzah ibn Abdul-Muttalib, who were loyal kinsmen of Muhammad, were given titles like Asad AllƒÅh (). * Depictions of the Mesopotamian lion show that it was an important symbol of Ancient Iraq. It is depicted in Ninevan reliefs. The lion of Babylon is a statue at the Ishtar Gate in Babylon The lion has an important association with the figure Gilgamesh, as demonstrated in his epic. The Iraqi national football team is nicknamed \\"Lions of Mesopotamia.\\" * The symbol of the lion is closely tied to the Persian people. Achaemenid kings were known to carry the symbol of the lion on their thrones and garments. The name 'Shir' (also pronounced 'Sher') () is a part of the names of many places in Iran and Central Asia, like those of city of Shiraz and the Sherabad River, and had been adopted into other languages, like Hindi. The Shir-va-Khorshid (, \\"Lion and Sun\\") is one of the most prominent symbols of Iran, dating back to the Safavid dynasty, and having been used on the flag of Iran, until 1979. In Persian and in Indian literature, the lion is rivaled by the tiger.

Content After noting a report by the Security Council Commission established in Resolution 446 (1979), the Council accepted and commended its work while criticising Israel for not cooperating with it. It expressed concern at Israeli settlement policy in the Arab territories and recalled resolutions 237 (1967), 252 (1968), 267 (1969), 271 (1969) and 298 (1971). It further called upon the State and people of Israel to dismantle such settlements. The resolution continued by condemning Israel for prohibiting the travel of the Mayor of Hebron, Fahd Qawasma, to the Security Council, requesting it allow him travel to the United Nations Headquarters. It then ends by asking the Commission to continue investigating the situation in the occupied territories with regard to depleted natural resources, while monitoring the implementation of the current resolution, asking it to report back to the Council by 1 September 1980. The resolution calls on all states ‚Äònot to provide Israel with any assistance to be used specifically in connection with settlements in the occupied territories‚Äô. U.S. support U.S. Ambassador to the UN Donald McHenry stated in the Security Council immediately after the vote that the U.S. considered the resolution recommendatory and not binding. On March 3, 1980 President Carter clarified the US's position saying dismantling Israeli settlements is \\"neither proper nor practical\\" and that \\"Jerusalem should be undivided\\" with its status determined in peace negotiations. He further said the US approved the vote with the understanding that all references to Jerusalem were to be removed.

The film remains primarily remembered for a 10-minute depiction of hell realised by director Harry Lachman, himself an established post-impressionist painter. This was Fox Film Corporation's last film before the company merged with Twentieth Century Pictures to form 20th Century Fox. Plot Jim Carter, a former stoker, takes over a fairground show, run by 'Pop' McWade, which depicts scenes from Dante's Inferno. He marries Pop's niece Betty and they have a son, Alexander. Meanwhile, the show becomes a great success, with Carter making it larger and more lurid. An inspector declares the fair unsafe but Carter bribes him into silence. There is a partial collapse at the fair which injures Pop. Recovering in hospital, he admonishes Carter and we see a lengthy vision of the Inferno. Undeterred, Carter establishes a new venture with an unsafe floating casino, only for disaster to strike again at sea. Cast * Spencer Tracy as Jim Carter * Claire Trevor as Betty McWade * Henry B.

ProductionDevelopment= The film uses a conventional story of greed and dishonesty to project an image of the Inferno conjured up in Dante's 14th-century epic poem. Director Lachman had established a substantial reputation as a painter before embarking on a Hollywood career and he summoned his artistic vision to realise Dante's work in cinematographic form, drawing on the engravings of Gustave Dor√©. The film's reputation pivots on the 10 minute vision of the Inferno and reception has been mixed. Leslie Halliwell described it as \\"one of the most unexpected, imaginative and striking pieces of cinema in Hollywood's history,\\" while Variety held that it was, \\"a pushover for vigorous exploitation.\\" =Release= The 1935 film was produced by Fox Film Corporation just before the May 31, 1935 merger that created Twentieth Century-Fox, and so it was released as a Twentieth Century-Fox film.

Boeheim has guided the Orange to ten Big East regular season championships, five Big East Tournament championships, and 34 NCAA Tournament appearances, including five Final Four appearances and three appearances in the national title game. In those games, the Orange lost to Indiana in 1987 on a last-second jump shot by Keith Smart, and to Kentucky in 1996, before defeating Kansas in 2003 with All-American Carmelo Anthony. Boeheim served as an assistant coach for the United States men's national basketball team at the 1990 FIBA World Championship, the 2006 FIBA World Championship, the 2008 Summer Olympics, the 2010 FIBA World Championship, the 2012 Summer Olympics, and the 2016 Summer Olympics. In addition, Boeheim has served as the chairman of the USA Basketball 2009‚Äì12 Men's Junior National Committee, as well as the 2007‚Äì08 President of the National Association of Basketball Coaches (NABC), where he currently serves on the board of directors. Boeheim was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame in September 2005. As a result of the Syracuse athletics scandal, in 2015 the NCAA vacated 101 of his wins. Boeheim originally announced that he would retire in March 2018. However, following the departure of his long-time assistant coach and expected successor Mike Hopkins, Boeheim extended his contract with Syracuse beyond 2017 for an unknown period. After suffering from cancer in 2001, Boeheim and his wife founded the Jim and Juli Boeheim Foundation, which is devoted to child welfare, cancer treatment, and prevention. CareerPlaying= Boeheim was born in 1944 in Lyons, New York, a small town about 57 miles west of Syracuse. He graduated from Lyons Central High School. Boeheim enrolled in Syracuse University as a student in 1962, and graduated with a bachelor's degree in social science. During his freshman year, Boeheim was a walk-on with the freshman basketball team. By his senior year, he was the varsity team captain and a teammate of All-American Dave Bing, his freshman roommate. The pair led coach Fred Lewis's Orange to a 22‚Äì6 overall win-loss record that earned the team's second-ever NCAA Tournament tournament berth. While at Syracuse, he joined the Delta Upsilon fraternity. After graduating from Syracuse, Boeheim played professionally with the Scranton Miners of the Eastern Professional Basketball League, during which he won two championships and was a second-team all-star (SU Athletics). =Coaching= In 1969, Boeheim decided to coach basketball and was hired as a graduate assistant at Syracuse under Roy Danforth. Soon thereafter he was promoted to a full-time assistant coach and was a member of the coaching staff that helped guide the Orange to the 1975 NCAA Tournament, where Syracuse University made its first Final Four appearance. In 1976, Danforth left to become the head basketball coach and athletic director at Tulane University. A coaching search then led to nought, and Boeheim was promoted to head coach. Apart from his brief stint in the pros, Boeheim has spent his entire adult life at Syracuse, as either a student, player, assistant coach or head coach, a rarity in modern-day major collegiate athletics. In 2018, CBSSports.com writer Matt Norlander emphasized this in a piece where he speculated on potential successors for Boeheim, stating: > Boeheim does not have a parallel in major college athletics. There has never > been a Division I coach in men's basketball, women's basketball or football > who has spent more than 40 years at their alma mater and never coached > anywhere else. Boeheim's the only one. There is no coaching figure more > synonymous and literally affiliated with only one school. Norlander also noted that Boeheim entered the 2018‚Äì19 season with nearly as many wins on his official coaching record, and more when counting wins vacated by the NCAA, than all other permanent Syracuse head coaches combined, and in his various roles at Syracuse had been involved in over half of all men's basketball games in school history. In 1986 Boeheim was offered the head coaching job at Ohio State but turned it down to stay at Syracuse. During a Syracuse vs. Georgetown game in the early 1980s, Hoyas star Patrick Ewing was nearly struck by an orange, and at times had endured racial taunts from the SU student section. Boeheim borrowed a microphone and threatened to forfeit the game if fans continued to throw objects at Ewing.Patrick Ewing . Georgetown Basketball History Project] In 42 years as head coach at Syracuse, Boeheim has guided the Orange to postseason berths, either in the NCAA or NIT tournaments, in every year in which the Orange have been eligible. The only times the Orange missed the postseason was in 1993 when NCAA sanctions barred them from postseason play despite a 20‚Äì9 record and in 2015 when Syracuse University self-imposed a one-year postseason ban related to the 2015 NCAA sanctions against the University's sports programs. During his tenure, the Orange have never had a losing season, have appeared in three NCAA national championship games (1987, 1996, and 2003) and won the national title in 2003. Boeheim has been named Big East coach of the year four times, and has been named as District II Coach of the Year by the National Association of Basketball Coaches ten times. In 2004, Boeheim received two additional awards. The first was during the spring when he was awarded the Clair Bee Award in recognition of his contributions to the sport of basketball. During the fall of the same year Boeheim was presented with Syracuse University's Arents Award, the University's highest alumni honor. Boeheim's coaching style at Syracuse is unusual in that, whereas many highly-successful coaches prefer the man-to-man defense, he demonstrates a preference for the match-up 2‚Äì3 zone. Boeheim, 267x267px In an exhibition game on November 7, 2005 against Division II school Saint Rose from Albany, New York, Boeheim was ejected for the first time in his career after arguing a call late in the first half in the Orange's 86‚Äì73 victory. He was also ejected from Cameron Indoor Stadium on February 22, 2014 against Duke after arguing a player control foul call. Boeheim has also been a coach for USA national teams. In 2001, during his seventh year as a USA basketball coach, Boeheim helped lead the Young Men's Team to a gold medal at the World Championship in Japan. During the fall of that year he was named USA Basketball 2001 National Coach of the Year. He was an assistant coach under Mike Krzyzewski for the US national team in the 1990 FIBA World Championship and 2006 FIBA World Championship, winning the bronze medal both times. He returned as an assistant coach under Mike Krzyzewski for the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China, and again at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, England, where the United States won the gold medal both times. In the 2012‚Äì13 season, Boeheim led Syracuse to their first Final Four appearance since their 2003 NCAA National Championship. The Orange lost to the University of Michigan 61‚Äì56. In the 2013‚Äì2014 season, he led the Orange to the NCAA Tournament and lost in the third-round game versus the Dayton Flyers. After self imposing a ban from the NCAA Tournament for the 2014-2015 season he again lead Syracuse to a surprise Final Four berth in the 2015-2016 season. https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/syracuse-men-in-final-four/ This included a 15 point comeback versus Number 1 seed University of Virginiahttps://www.ncaa.com/news/basketball-men/article/2016-03-27/march- madness-inside-syracuses-stunning-comeback-vs-virginia. The team lost to UNC 83-66. The Syracuse basketball program has been investigated for major NCAA violations on two separate occasions during Boeheim's tenure. =NCAA violations and punishment= On March 6, 2015, the NCAA suspended Boeheim for the first nine games of 2015‚Äì16 ACC conference play and took away 12 scholarships over a four-year period, as a result of a multi-year investigation into the university's athletic programs. The program was forced to vacate a total of 101 wins from the 2004‚Äì2005, 2005‚Äì2006, 2006‚Äì2007, 2010‚Äì2011, and 2011‚Äì2012 seasons, which included any game during those years where one or more players deemed to have been ineligible played. This constitutes the third-most wins ever permanently vacated by one program, behind the 113 wins vacated by Michigan and 123 wins by Louisville. However, the NCAA confirmed that sanctions did not include the removal of any trophies or banners. Therefore, Syracuse displays banners for all of its NCAA appearances and conference titles from those years. After two separate appeals, Boeheim's nine-game suspension was upheld, though he was permitted to begin the suspension prior to ACC conference play as dictated in the original penalty. Additionally, the permanent vacation and erasure of 101 wins was upheld.Syracuse Orange Appeal of Sanctions Rewarded , accessed December 26, 2015NCAA Upholds 9 Game Suspension for Jim Boeheim , accessed December 26, 2015 However, the number of scholarships lost by Syracuse was reduced to 8 over a four-year period, down from 12 over the same period. =Retirement= Boeheim had previously stated that he would retire in April 2018. However, in 2017 when his son committed to play at Syracuse starting in 2018 he extended his contract to beyond the 2017‚Äì18 season. Records and accomplishments 2013 NCAA Tournament =Head coaching record= ‚Ä† \\\\- From 1975 to 1982, the Eastern College Athletic Conference (ECAC) organized annual regional end-of- season men's basketball tournaments for independent Division I ECAC member colleges and universities in the Northeastern United States. The winner of each regional tournament was declared the ECAC regional champion for the season and received an automatic bid in the NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament. The NCAA vacated 15 wins from the 2004‚Äì05 season, 23 wins from the 2005‚Äì06 season, 22 wins from the 2006‚Äì07 season, 7 wins from the 2010‚Äì11 season, and 34 wins from the 2011‚Äì12 season as a result of the Syracuse athletics scandal. Boeheim was suspended for nine games during the 2015‚Äì16 season, during which Syracuse went 4‚Äì5 overall, and 0‚Äì3 in conference. So while the team's record was 23‚Äì14 overall, 9‚Äì9 in conference, Boeheim is credited with 19‚Äì9 overall, 9‚Äì6 in conference. Boeheim's official NCAA record excludes the aforementioned 101 vacated wins as well as the games during his nine-game suspension in 2015‚Äì2016, however Syracuse claims all of its NCAA appearances and conference titles from those years. =Accomplishments= Boeheim's notable accomplishments during his career include: * Led Syracuse University to a national championship (2003) * Led Syracuse University to 3 national championship game appearances : (1987, 1996, 2003) * Led Syracuse University to 5 Final Four appearances : (1987, 1996, 2003, 2013, 2016) * Led Syracuse University to 7 Elite Eight appearances : (1987, 1989, 1996, 2003, 2012, 2013, 2016) * Led Syracuse University to 19 Sweet Sixteen appearances : (1977, 1979, 1980, 1984, 1987, 1989, 1990, 1994, 1996, 1998, 2000, 2003, 2004, 2009, 2010, 2012, 2013, 2016, 2018) * Led Syracuse University to 33 NCAA Tournament appearances : (1977, 1978, 1979, 1980, 1983, 1984, 1985, 1986, 1987, 1988, 1989, 1990, 1991, 1992, 1994, 1995, 1996, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2016, 2018) * Led Syracuse University to ten Big East regular season championships : (1980, 1986, 1987, 1990, 1991, 1998*, 2000, 2003, 2010, 2012) :*two division champions were crowned as a regular champions. * Led Syracuse University to five Big East tournament championships : (1981, 1988, 1992, 2005, 2006) * Leads all Big East coaches (past and present) in wins (366) * Ranks sixth among active Division I coaches (min. 10 years) in winning percentage (.750) * In 43 seasons at Syracuse, has compiled 34 20-win seasons, good for second most on the all-time list * Became only the 14th coach ever to reach 750 wins (2007) * Four-time Big East Coach of the Year (1984, 1991, 2000, 2010) * USA Basketball's National Coach of the Year (2001) * Under Boeheim, the Orange have only missed the NCAA Tournament two years in a row twice * In recognition of Boeheim's numerous accomplishments as SU's head coach, the University named the Carrier Dome court \\"Jim Boeheim Court\\" on February 24, 2002. * Basketball Hall of Fame (2005) as a coach * Joined Mike Krzyzewski and Jim Calhoun as the third active coach with 800 wins. * Coached the Orange to a six overtime win against the UConn Huskies, 127‚Äì117, the longest game in the history of Big East Conference play. * Named 2010 Naismith Coach of the Year (along with the same honor from the AP, Sporting News and many others) after leading Syracuse to an unexpected 30‚Äì5 record. * On December 17, 2012, Boeheim became the third coach in NCAA men's basketball history to reach 900 wins, along with Bob Knight and Mike Krzyzewski. 101 of those wins were vacated in 2015 after an NCAA investigation.

Boeheim has appeared in numerous commercials throughout Central New York and also had a spot in a nationwide Nike Jordan ad featuring former Syracuse great Carmelo Anthony. Boeheim likes to listen to the music of Bruce Springsteen. In an interview, he said that he had no interest in pursuing any other career other than coaching Little League after he retires from coaching basketball. Boeheim had prostate cancer in 2001 and subsequently became a major fund-raiser for Coaches vs. Cancer, a non-profit collaboration between the NABC and the American Cancer Society, through which he has helped raise more than US$4.5 million for ACS's Central New York chapter since 2000. In 2009, Boeheim and his wife, Juli, founded the Jim and Juli Boeheim Foundation to expand their charitable mission to organizations around Central New York concerned with child welfare, as well as cancer treatment and prevention.

His son Jimmy plays forward for Cornell , Jamie is a forward for the University of Rochester, and Buddy is a guard, playing for his father at Syracuse. Around 11:22 p.m. on Feb 20, 2019, Boeheim was driving his car on Interstate 690 in Syracuse when he struck and killed a 51-year-old man who was standing near the side of the road. The accident was reportedly a result of a disabled car being in the middle of the road in bad weather. When Boeheim maneuvered around the other car, he struck the man, who had been a passenger in the disabled car. Field, speed, and sobriety tests were administered by police. It was additionally found that the disabled vehicle did not have lights on and had non-operational rear marker lights, and that the passengers of the disabled car, including the man who was struck and killed, were wearing dark clothing. Boeheim was cleared of any wrongdoing in the incident.

The series covers the great lengths people have gone to make money, sometimes illegally, from casinos. It premiered in Pakistan on January 19, 2006 and was renamed Decoding Casinos in India on May 9, 2006. In the Spring of 2007, it aired on The History Channel and The Discovery Channel in Canada. Many episodes have to do with cheats who illegally take money from the casino using sleight-of-hand tricks or some sort of gizmo. Namely, these scams include pastposting and card marking. Other episodes include famous examples of legal money-making techniques such as card counting. Some episodes are about legal strategies like winning at the craps table by throwing at certain angles using a certain grip with certain numbers at the top, or taking advantage of a worn-out ball bearing and a thus tilted roulette wheel. The series was inspired by the two-hour History Channel documovie entitled Breaking Vegas: The True Story of the MIT Blackjack Team, written and directed by Bruce David Klein and produced by Atlas Media Corp. The episode \\"Professor Blackjack\\" is about MIT professor Edward O. Thorp's (portrayed by Jonathan Dickson) computer-based research on the Kelly criterion that was applied in real Vegas casinos in the form of computer aided card- counting schemes with very successful results. Manny Kimmell, a known mob associate, provided the venture capital for Dr. Thorp's real life experiment and his contribution is described in the same episode.

He was a governor of the South Sea Company from 1711 to 1712, and a Director of the East India Company from 1713 to 1743. His published works which show him as \\"such a strong supporter of the doctrine of free trade as to rank as one of the most important forerunners of Adam Smith\\",1911 Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, Volume 7 Decker, Sir Matthew proposed amongst other measures, to abolish customs duties and replace them with a tax upon houses, to abolish the duty on tea replacing it with a licence duty on households wishing to consume it, and to repeal import duties and bounties in general. At his house in Richmond he amassed a large collection of art, including many Dutch paintings, which later formed the core of the collection of the Fitzwilliam Museum, founded by his grandson. He was a pioneer in the growing of exotic fruits in England, including pineapple and lemon, in his heated greenhouses at Richmond. Origins Decker was born in 1679 in Amsterdam, the son of Dirck Decker of the City of Amsterdam, by his wife Katherina. Dirck was born in 1642/4 probably at Bloemendaal, near Haarlem, a son of Cornelius Decker, a linen bleacher at Bloemendaal. The portrait at the FitzWilliam of Dirck on horseback in sand dunes with the Grote Kerk, Haarlem in the background may also be a view of Cornelius's bleaching- grounds.Seymour Slive, Jacob Van Ruisdael: A Complete Catalogue of His Paintings, Drawings, and ..., p.60 The herald Sir John Vanburgh in his 1716 confirmation of arms to Sir Matthew stated that Dirck was a \\"son of Cornelius Decker of Haerlem in the Province of Holland, and other his ancestors who were natives of Flanders (and retired from thence into Holland on account of their religion, during the Cruel Persecution of the Duke of Alva Governour of the Spanish Netherlands, in ye time of Queen Elizabeth)\\". Career He was educated in Amsterdam and received his commercial education there under burgomaster Velters.George McGilvary, All for Union, Empire and Homeland: The Labours of ‚ÄúHonest John‚Äù Drummond By 1702, aged 23, he had moved to the City of London where he established himself as a merchant specialising in linen.McGilvary He was remarkably successful in his business life, gaining great wealth and honours. By 1710 he had become a major player in Anglo-Dutch commerce and had become the London correspondent for several Dutch banks, most notably Pels of Amsterdam. He was one of the original directors of the South Sea Company from 1711 to 1712, and subscribed ¬£49,271 for shares. However after that year his interest turned instead to East India Company, of which he became a director 1713, remaining until 1743. On 20 July 1716 he was created a baronet, \\"of the City of London\\", by King George I. In 1719 he was one of the original backers of the Royal Academy of Music, establishing a London opera company which commissioned numerous works from Handel, Bononcini and others.Thomas McGeary. The Politics of Opera in Handel's Britain. Cambridge University Press, 2013. p.254 He had worked for James Brydges (later 1st Duke of Chandos) when the latter was in the Low Countries serving as Paymaster of the Forces during the War of the Spanish Succession and in 1719 with his help was returned unopposed as a Member of Parliament for Bishop's Castle in Shropshire at a by-election on 17 December 1719. Chandos was a client of his for whom he bought paintings and tapestries in the Netherlands. In 1720 Decker was Assistant of the Royal African Company and became Deputy Governor of the East India Company, until 1721. He told Chandos in 1721 that he had had enough of Parliament, and did not stand in the 1722 general election. Following the disaster of the South Sea Bubble, in the management of which company he had had no involvement for several years, in December 1720 Decker delivered a \\"gererous speech\\" in the Court of Directors of the East India Company in support of Walpole's proposed scheme for restoring public credit, namely of \\"ingrafting\\" 9 million South Sea stock into the Bank of England and a similar amount into the East India Company, of which he was then a director. Decker's speech was reported contemporaneously as follows:John Oldmixon, The History of England: During the Reigns of King William and Queen Mary, London, 1735, p.706 :Sir Matthew Decker spoke with a true publick spirit, to the great reproach of such as set their hearts entirely on revenge, to the destruction of the South Sea directors, and seem'd careless in the consideration of the main point, the restoring credit. At first truly, (said Sir Matthew) I did not like this proposal but when I saw the ruin that was spread over our country, when I considered the distresses of the poor people when the nation and the parliament called upon us to support the public credit, I thought it would become no man to vote against it. I would, I declare, part with all my property in the Company, and I think I have as much as any body here: Nay, with all I have, to a bare necessary subsistence, to deliver the Kingdom from the miseries that have befallen it\\". Decker was Governor of the East India Company from 1725 to 1726 and was its chairman in 1725. He was selected to be Sheriff of Surrey in 1729. Also in 1729 he was Deputy Governor of the East India Company again, Governor from 1730 to 1733 and Chairman from 1730 to 1732. Residence in Richmond His mansion house and estate stood on the site of today's \\"Pembroke Villas\\" 5 pairs of large semi-detached Victorian villas on the north-western side of Richmond Green,https://www.richmond.gov.uk/richmond_green_old_palace_lane_to_the_old_deer_park_gates adjacent to the site of Richmond Palace, demolished during the Commonwealth. The house was first built by Sir Charles Hedges (died 1714), Secretary of State to Queen Anne, from whom Decker acquired it. It later became the property of Decker's grandson Richard FitzWilliam, 7th Viscount FitzWilliam (1745-1816) who named it \\"FitzWilliam House\\" and there formed his famous art collection and by his will founded the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge. The latter's heir was his cousin George Herbert, 11th Earl of Pembroke (1759-1827), who renamed the house \\"Pembroke House\\". It was demolished in 1840. John Macky in his Journey through England (1722 to 1723), described the Decker estate at Richmond as follows: :The longest, largest, and highest Hedge of Holly I ever saw, is in this garden, with several other Hedges of Ever-Greens, Visto‚Äôs cut through Woods, Grotto‚Äôs with Fountains, a fine Canal running up from the River. His Duckery, which is an oval Pond brick‚Äôd round, and his pretty Summer-House by it to drink a Bottle, his Stove-Houses, which are always kept in an equal heat for his Citrons, and other Indian Plants, with Gardeners brought from foreign Countries to manage them, are very curious and entertaining. The house is also very large a-la-modern, and neatly furnished after the Dutch way. =Pineapple pioneer= 1720 painting of Sir Matthew Decker's prized English-ripened pineapple, by Theodorus Netscher (1661-1728), FitzWilliam Museum A 1720 painting of Sir Matthew Decker's prize English-ripened pineapple, by Theodorus Netscher (1661-1728), survives in the FitzWilliam Museum, on which is inscribed in Latin: To the perpetual memory of Matthew Decker, Baronet, and Theodore Netscher, Gentleman. This pineapple, deemed worthy of the royal table, grew at Richmond at the cost of the former, and still seems to grow by the art of the latter. H(enry) Watkins (Decker's brother-in-law) set up this inscription, A.D. 1720.

Publications Decker's fame as a writer on trade rests on two tracts. The first, Serious considerations on the several high duties which the Nation in general, as well as Trade in particular, labours under, with a proposal for preventing the removal of goods, discharging the trader from any search, and raising all the Publick Supplies by one single Tax (1743; name affixed to 7th edition, 1756), proposed to do away with customs duties and substitute a tax upon houses. He also suggested taking the duty off tea and putting instead a licence duty on households wishing to consume it. The second, an Essay on the Causes of the Decline of the Foreign Trade, consequently of the value of the lands in Britain, and on the means to restore both (1744), has been attributed to W. Richardson, but internal evidence is strongly in favor of Decker's authorship. He advocates the licence plan in an extended form; urges the repeal of import duties and the abolition of bounties, and, in general, shows himself such a strong supporter of the doctrine of free trade as to rank as one of the most important thinkers in the early development of economic science. Death and legacy Decker died on 18 March 1749, without a surviving male heir and the baronetcy became extinct. He was buried at the Church of St Mary Magdalene, Richmond, where survives his monument (above a vault) against the external wall of the church, in the form of a broad-based obelisk (on which is affixed a baroque escutcheon displaying a relief of the arms of Decker impaling Watkins) topped by an urn, atop an antique Roman sarcophagus standing on a chest tomb base. A modern inscription on a tablet of stone superimposed on the base of the monument is as follows:Possibly a restoration (perhaps placed here by the FitzWilliam Museum?) :\\"In the vault beneath were interred the remains of Sir Matthew Decker Bart. on the 25th of March 1749 and of his relict Lady Decker on the 12th of May 1759. Also of Catherine their daughter and wife of Richard 6th Viscount FitzWilliam of Mount Merrion in the County of Dublin in the Kingdom of Ireland. She died on the 8th of March 1786. The remains of Richard Viscount FitzWilliam son of the above-named Richard and Catherine were also interred here. He died on the 4th of February 1816 in the 71st year of his age and by his will founded and endowed the museum at Cambridge that bears his name\\" His fortune and estates passed to his surviving daughter Catherine, and then to her son Richard FitzWilliam, 7th Viscount FitzWilliam.

The party emerged in 1968, as Pushpa Lal organized a separate party congress in Gorakhpur, India. After the 1962 convention of the radical communist sector, which constituted the separate Communist Party of Nepal, Pushpa Lal was supposed to have shared the leadership of the party together with Tulsi Lal Amatya. However, the cooperation between the two had broken down. A large section of the party cadres followed Pushpa Lal in forming a new party. Thus, for a few years Pushpa Lal's party was the major communist group in Nepal. The party was politically close to the Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPI(M)). Pushpa Lal's party upheld the line of 'People's Democracy'.Parajulee, Ramjee P. The Democratic Transition in Nepal. Rowman & Littlefield, 2000. p. 57 The party headquarters were established in Varanasi, India. Pushpa Lal called for unity in action together with the Nepali Congress against the royal regime. The organ of Pushpa Lal's party was Naya Janvad. In 1971 a young party leader from Bhaktapur, Narayan Man Bijukchhe (alias Rohit), broke away from Pushpa Lal's party after the decision of the party to support the Indian intervention in East Pakistan. Bijukchhe also criticized the line of seeking cooperation with Nepali Congress and the failure of the party to condemn the Soviet Union as imperialist. Rohit would form the Nepal Workers Peasants Organisation in 1975. In 1976, a prominent student leader of Pushpa Lal's party, Madan Kumar Bhandari, broke away and formed the Mukti Morcha Samuha. These splits contributed to diminishing influence of Pushpa Lal's party. Pushpa Lal Shestra died in 1978. His funeral became a mass manifestation of the political opposition. His widow, Sahana Pradhan, took over the leadership of the party. Under Pradhan's leadership the party steered along a moderate course, endorsing Pushpa Lal's policy of cooperation with the Nepali Congress. The party worked alongside the Congress Party in the agitations against the Panchayat system in 1979, in the campaign for multiparty democracy ahead of the plebiscite of 1980 and mass protests against the royal government in 1985. In 1987 the party merged with Communist Party of Nepal (Manmohan) and formed the Communist Party of Nepal (Marxist).

The Joseph Cross is a steel framework construction with a height of 38 metres and a weight of 125 tons, which was built between 20 April 1896 and 9 August 1896. The Joseph Cross was closed for visitors from 1987 to 1990, before being refurbished and reopened.  History  In the 17th century there was a timber-framed observation tower on the Auerberg that was demolished in 1768 due to disrepair and weather damage. In 1832, Count Joseph of Stolberg- Stolberg commissioned the Berlin architect, Karl Friedrich Schinkel, to design a new tower, which a carpenter from Stolberg carried out. The topping out ceremony of Schinkel's wooden tower, built in the form of a double cross, was celebrated on 24 September 1833. On 21 June 1834, the tower was officially opened and named the \\"Joseph Cross\\" after its client.The \\"s\\" in the German name \\"Josephskreuz\\" is a link letter, not a possessive. Hence the translation \\"Joseph Cross\\", not \\"Joseph's Cross\\". The tower had no steps and could only be climbed by a ladder. In 1850 the cross-arms had to be renewed. In June 1880, the building was destroyed by lightning during a thunderstorm. Construction of a new Joseph Cross, designed by Otto Bei√üw√§nger, began on 20 April 1896. The tower took its shape of a double-cross from the original by Schinkel, but was, however, designed along the lines of Paris' Eiffel Tower as a steel-framed structure, even components such as the arches between the legs being copied. The cost of 50,000 marks was born by the House of Stolberg and the Harz Club. On 9 August 1896 the new Joseph Cross was inaugurated. In the 20th Century, the cross rapidly fell into ruin until it was closed to visitors in 1987 due its state of disrepair. In 1989 renovation was started and it was reopened on 28 August 1990.

She became a member of the tour in 1955 and won 82 LPGA Tour career events including 13 major championships. She is a member of the World Golf Hall of Fame. Early life Wright was born in San Diego, California, where she attended Herbert Hoover High School. Her first important title was the 1952 U.S. Girls' Junior. She attended Stanford University and played for its golf team, but left before graduation. She lost in the final of the 1954 U.S. Women's Amateur, won the 1954 World Amateur Championship, and turned professional later in 1954. Joins LPGA Tour Wright in 1960 Wright joined the LPGA Tour in 1955. She won 82 events on the LPGA Tour, which puts her second on the all-time win list behind Kathy Whitworth, who won 88 times. Thirteen of her victories were in major championships, which places her second to Patty Berg, who won fifteen majors. Wright topped the LPGA money list for four consecutive seasons from 1961‚Äì1964 and made the top ten on the list thirteen times in total between 1956 and 1969. Wright won at least one LPGA title for 14 straight seasons, from 1956 to 1969. At the inaugural Tall City Open in 1964, Wright shot a 62 in the third and final round. It was the lowest score in LPGA Tour history at that time, at a course (Hogan Park in Midland, Texas) on which the men's record, at the time, was 66. Wright's Tall City Open win is also tied for the largest final round comeback (10 shots) in LPGA history. Wright was coached by Harry Pressler. Ben Hogan said Wright's swing was the best he had ever seen. She retired from full-time golf at age 34 in 1969, because of problems with her feet, but did compete occasionally after that. She won 13 majors between 1958 and 1966, and she is the only player in LPGA Tour history to hold all four major titles at the same time. She lived in Port St. Lucie, Florida, and played recreational golf occasionally. She was a breast cancer survivor. Death Wright died on February 17, 2020, three days after turning 85, from a heart attack. At the time, she had been hospitalized following a fall a few weeks prior. Legacy In 2000, Wright was ranked as the ninth greatest golfer of all time, and the top woman golfer, by Golf Digest magazine. In a major 2009 survey of experts, published by Golf Magazine, Wright was chosen as the eighth best player of all time, and the top woman player of all time.Golf Digest, September 2009.

Radio transmitter amplifiers in most telecommunications systems are required to be \\"linear\\", in that they must accurately reproduce the signal present at their input. An amplifier that compresses its input or has a non-linear input/output relationship causes the output signal to splatter onto adjacent radio frequencies. This causes interference on other radio channels. There are many different ways of specifying the linearity of a power amplifier, including P1dB, Inter- modulation Distortion (IMD), AM-to-PM, spectral regrowth and Noise Power Ratio (NPR). For a truly linear system, these measures are in a sense all equivalent. That is, a power amplifier with low inter-modulation distortion will also have low spectral regrowth and low AM-to-PM distortion. Likewise there are two equivalent ways of conceptualizing how predistortion amplifiers work: correcting gain and phase distortions, or cancelling inter-modulation products. Usually one of the two conceptualizations is preferred when designing predistortion circuitry; however the end result is generally the same. A predistorter designed to correct gain and phase non-linearities will also improve IMD, while one which targets inter-modulation products will also reduce gain and phase perturbations. When combined with the target amplifier, the linearizer produces an overall system that is more linear and reduces the amplifier's distortion. In essence, \\"inverse distortion\\" is introduced into the input of the amplifier, thereby cancelling any non-linearity the amplifier might have. Predistortion is a cost-saving and power efficiency technique. Radio power amplifiers tend to become more non-linear as their output power increases towards their maximum rated output. Predistortion is a way to get more usable power from the amplifier, without having to build a larger, less efficient and more expensive amplifier. Another important consideration in design of RF power amplifiers is the memory effect or amplifier nonlinear dynamics. Predistortion can be implemented in an analog as well as digital manner known as digital pre-distortion.

They have released about 100 single and EP vinyl records between 1993 and 1999 and more than 80 since 2004. Fred Berkhout (Freddy B) created Mokum Records in 1993 as a joke response to another record label, Rotterdam Records. The label was originally part of the record store Boudisque Records,CNRRecodsUK.co.uk News 16-01-04. Accessed: November 26, 2006 but was later merged with Roadrunner Records - part of The Island Def Jam Music Group - who closed the label in 1998 because vinyl cost more than it yielded and decided to stop releasing with the medium. The label was revived by Freddy B in 2004 due to the re-emergence of the hardcore scene in the early 2000s, especially with gabber's resurgence in popularity in 2002. (catalog releases starting at 100 reflect this). Mokum Records achieved chart success all over the world in 1995 with Technohead and their No. 1 hit \\"I Wanna Be a Hippy\\", the No. 1 hit \\"Have You Ever Been Mellow\\" by the Party Animals, and Technohead's \\"Happy Birthday\\", which followed in 1996. The Party Animals would also go on to have two more consecutive #1 hits with \\"Hava Naquila\\" and \\"Aquarius\\", making them the first ever Dutch act to have their first three singles top the Dutch charts. As well as this success, they are also renowned for their series of compilation albums called \\"Fucking Hardcore.\\" The series started in 1995 at the height of the label's popularity and finished with \\"Fucking Hardcore No. 8\\" in 1998; however, the series was revived in 2016. The label was home to many successful producers and DJs such as Chosen Few, Flamman & Abraxas, Tellurian, The Prophet, Speedfreak, DJ Dano, Scott Brown and Liza N Eliaz. Overview Mokum is noted for adopting anti-Fascist statements or notices on its record sleeves in response to Neo-Nazi activity on the early Dutch rave scene. All Mokum releases carry the slogan \\"UNITED GABBERS AGAINST RACISM & FASCISM\\" and several artists have released tracks that vocally speak out against racism. The record company is named after Mokum which is the Yiddish name for the center borough of Amsterdam and was originally used by the Jewish community and was later added to the local Amsterdam dialect. In 1996, DJ Dano launched a sublabel to Mokum called \\"Fukem.\\" Fukem was strictly for material that had faster tempos and harder material than material that would be released on the main label. Along with DJ Dano, artists that released under Fukem included Aggroman, Narcanosis, Deadly Buda & the Superstars of Death, and even Technohead had one release on the sublabel with \\"Cocaine\\", a collaboration with Elvis Jackson. The sublabel was short-lived, having only six official releases, and became inactive in 1997. On 2 December 2016, Mokum, in collaboration with Overdrive Records, announced on their Facebook page that they were reviving their \\"Fucking Hardcore\\" series after an 18-year hiatus with #9 being released on vinyl in 2017, a first for the series. Another first for the series came in 2018 when \\"Fucking Hardcore #10\\" and \\"Fucking Hardcore #11\\" were released digitally on available music sites, which had never been done previous.

A session musician for many years, Wright frequently acted as arranger and \\"fixer\\" for recording sessions. He was a prolific jazz and orchestra composer. He led many bands, from small ensembles to night club bands to orchestras. He worked with Latin American and Jamaican bands, including Kenny Graham's Afro-Cubists and Mike McKenzie (jazz musician)'s Quartet. He played with the Carl Barriteau orchestra, the Decca Records house band under Phil Green, and occasionally the Glenn Miller band. Wright was voted the 1980 BBC Jazz Society Musician of the Year. During his career, he worked with St√©phane Grappelli, Lonnie Donegan, Johnny Duncan, Digby Fairweather, Ella Fitzgerald, Ken Snakehips Johnson, Billy Eckstine, Fapy Lafertin, Russ Conway, Bir√©li Lagr√®ne, Humphrey Lyttelton, Nigel Kennedy, and George Shearing. Although best known as a guitarist, his favourite instrument was piano, the only musical instrument he would play at home. Travellin' Blues by Johnny Duncan and the Bluegrass Boys feature Wright's piano playing.  Early life  Wright was born in Deptford, London, and grew up in Brockley with frequent forays to the Old Kent Road and the Elephant and Castle. His father was Joseph William Wright, a wireless telegraphist for the General Post Office who served with the Royal Engineers in World War One. His mother was Selina Elizabeth Stewart, who was born in Hampstead. Wright's paternal family came from Polstead and Boxstead in Suffolk, although they moved to Deptford by 1881. Wright's first instrument was the piano. His older brother, Alex Wright, was a semi-professional guitarist before the war and Denny Wright, ten years younger, was soon trying to play his brother's guitar. He began playing professionally before World War II while at school. He nearly always used his thumb on the top E string and could only play as fast as he could sing. He often sang along as he played a solo, as on Donegan's No 4 UK hit \\"Don't You Rock Me Daddy-O\\" recorded in 1957.  Career  Wright spent the first part of World War II playing in jazz clubs in the West End of London, doing session work and performing in bands on radio shows. He worked with Grappelli for the first time in London around 1941. At school Wright served with the Auxiliary Fire Service in Brockley. He was classified medically unfit to serve due to a childhood injury in a road accident in 1930 that cost him his spleen and half of his liver. He joined Entertainments National Service Association (ENSA), entertained the troops, and at the end of the war was stationed in 's-Hertogenbosch, Netherlands. In 1945 he started the first bebop club in London. At the Fullado in New Compton Street he played piano and guitar. In the late 1940s he toured Italy and the Middle East with the Francisco Cavez orchestra and performed in King Farouk's palace. Throughout the 1950s Wright provided guitar accompaniments for Lonnie Donegan, Johnny Duncan, Humphrey Lyttelton, and Marie Bryant, as well as appearing on Guitar Club on the BBC. In 1952, he accompanied Tex Ritter for a season at the Texas Western Spectacle at the Haringey Arena. With Digby Fairweather, Roy Williams, Johnny Van Derrick, Jack Fallon, Tony Crombie, and Jack Fallon, Wright accompanied Joel David on Old Bones and added a guitar solo to Joel David's song \\"Be My Valentine Tonight\\". The Denny Wright Trio with violinist Bob Clarke took skiffle and jazz to the Soviet Union in 1957 for the 6th World Festival of Youth and Students. From 1940 until the early 1980s, Wright worked as a session musician, playing guitar for Mary Hopkin, Dusty Springfield and Tom Jones. His improvisational style came to the forefront in his work with Donegan. Drawing on jazz, blues, and Django Reinhardt, Wright played acoustic archtop and electric guitar. With Bill Bramwell, Les Bennetts, and Jimmy Currie, he helped inspire the next generation of British guitarists working with blues in a rock context. George Harrison tried to play Wright's solo from \\"Last Train to San Fernanado\\". In the 1960s, in addition to session for Mary Hopkin and Jones, he and Keith Cooper produced Tribute to the Hot Club as The Cooper-Wright Quintet. Wright also worked extensively with folk singer Steve Benbow and the record company Rediffusion. During the 1970s, he and record producer Anton Kwiatkowski worked on albums for EMI's Music for Pleasure label. He accompanied Grappelli at the Cambridge Folk Festival and for some years after. In 1978, he formed the band Velvet with Ike Isaacs, Len Skeat, and Digby Fairweather. After Velvet, he formed a band with Don Harper before reforming the Hot Club of London with Johnny van Derrick (violin), Gerry Higgins (double bass), and his prot√©g√© Robert Seaman (guitar). Wright played with the Hot Club of London across the UK, as well as at jazz festivals in Eindhoven, London, and Cork. His last performance was at The Grapes in Shepherd Market, Mayfair in late 1991 with van Derrick. Wright gave private lessons and at London comprehensive schools, and he lectured at the Royal College of Music on the life of a session musician.  Personal life  Wright married Barbara, a lyricist and actress, in 1961. Their son, St. John, was born while Wright was on stage in Leeds with Donegan in 1963. Barbara died on 16 February 1989 after an eight-year battle with breast cancer. They were married for 27 years. Wright died on 8 February 1992 in London after a nine- year battle with bladder cancer.  Awards and honors  In 1980, Wright was voted BBC Jazz Society Musician of the Year.

The freeway has previously been congested in holiday months due to missing section of the Mornington Peninsula Freeway (now known as Peninsula Link), which since the opening of Peninsula Link through traffic has reduced immensely on the Frankston Freeway.https://roadprojects.vic.gov.au/projects/mordialloc-freeway The Frankston Freeway is now mostly used by local traffic (as through traffic now exit EastLink onto Peninsula Link and vice versa). The freeway is a major express link - in and out of the largest city near the Mornington Peninsula, which is Frankston. It saves bumper-to-bumper congestion (seeing as traffic would have to come from alternate major highways with numerous traffic lights / intersections / roundabouts), with traffic coming from Melbourne wanting to enter Frankston and its surroundings. The freeway connects with three other urban freeways: EastLink (Tollway), Mornington Peninsula Freeway (northern section) and Peninsula Link.  History  In the early 1960s the Frankston Freeway was known as the ‚ÄòFrankston By-pass Road‚Äô,Country Roads Board Victoria. Fiftieth Annual Report: for the year ended 30 June 1963.

Burwood, Victoria: Brown, Prior, Anderson, 1973. p. 6 With the route numbering conversion of the freeway, it was initially going to be changed to M11 after the completion of EastLink in 2008, although plans fell through and the route was retained as State Route 11). However, with the completion of the Peninsula Link in early 2013, it was replaced with M3, with the Peninsula Link and Mornington Peninsula Freeway signed as M11.  Route  The Frankston Freeway was designed to accommodate Mornington Peninsula Freeway from the northern section, and it has had a missing Frankston Bypass for decades (Vicroads having decided that traffic on the route was not heavy enough to merit a Frankston Bypass, the middle section of the freeway), and at this stage the Frankston Freeway serves as the missing link between the two Mornington Peninsula Freeways. The Frankston Freeway begins in Carrum Downs south until Cranbourne-Frankston Road, as the incomplete section of the actual Mornington Peninsula Freeway, which bypasses Frankston, swings off to the south east. The newly completed Eastlink toll road is continuous with the Carrum Downs end of the Frankston Freeway, providing a freeway standard road north through the Eastern suburbs of Melbourne to the Eastern end of the Eastern Freeway, and beyond. This has now caused immense gridlock around Carrum Downs with motorists using local roads to avoid all the traffic lights the Peninsula Link has created. The freeway is generally parallel to Nepean Highway along the route including the Mornington Peninsula Freeway and Moorooduc Highway. Exits and interchanges The entire freeway is in the City of Frankston local government area.

Kokang (; ) is a region in Myanmar (Burma). It is located in the northern part of Shan State, with the Salween River to its west, and sharing a border with China's Yunnan Province to the east. Its total land area is around . The capital is Laukkai. Kokang is mostly populated by Kokang Chinese, a Han Chinese group living in Myanmar. Kokang had been historically part of China for several centuries and is still claimed by the Republic of China to this day, but was largely left alone by successive governments due to its remote location. The region formed a de facto buffer zone between Yunnan province and the Shan States. The Yang clan, originally Ming loyalists from Nanjing, consolidated the area into a single polity. In 1840, the Yunnan governor granted the Yang clan the hereditary rights as a vassal of the Qing dynasty. After the British conquest of Upper Burma in 1885, Kokang was initially placed in China under the 1894 Sino-British boundary convention. It was ceded to British Burma in a supplementary agreement signed in February 1897. From the 1960s to 1989, the area was controlled by the Communist Party of Burma, and after the party's armed wing disbanded in 1989 it became a special region of Myanmar under the control of the Myanmar Nationalities Democratic Alliance Army (MNDAA). Armed conflicts between the MNDAA and the Tatmadaw have resulted in the 2009 Kokang incident and the 2015 Kokang offensive. Demographics In 2009, the population was reported to be around 150,000. Of these, around 100,000 people held Burmese nationality, the remainder being from China. Of the Burmese nationality, 90% are ethnic Han-Chinese, with others being Shan, Palaung, Hmong, Wa, Lisu, Bai and Bamar. The large majority of ethnic Burmans are those dispatched to the region by the central government as military and administrative personnel and their families, primary school teachers, skilled workers, medical workers and other public service personnel. Because of the effective disappearance of the narcotics trade, many have lost their source of income and many local people have left the region. History Map including part of the Kokang area (1954) =Chiefdom of Kokang= Yang Xiancai () founded the state Xingdahu () in 1739 in and around Ta Shwe Htan. The name was changed to Kokang by his successors. In 1840, the Yunnan governor granted the Yang clan the hereditary rights as a vassal of the Qing dynasty. After the British conquest of Upper Burma in 1885, Kokang was initially placed in China under the 1894 Sino-British boundary convention. It was ceded to British Burma in a supplementary agreement signed in February 1897. =Recent history= After the collapse of the Communist Party of Burma in 1989, Kokang was assigned as the autonomous First Special Region of the northern Shan State of Burma. Peng Jiasheng ruled Kokang since 1989 except he was ousted temporarily by rival Yang Mao-liang in 1992. He regain his power in the same year with the help of juntas but he was ousted again by juntas and replaced with his deputy Bai Xuoqian in 2009. In 2003, a comprehensive ban on the cultivation of the opium poppy came into effect. Due to the attendant food shortage, among other things, 2003 also saw a large-scale outbreak of malaria in mountain villages with authorities reporting some 279 deaths.

In the following year, it was merged with the Transpadane Republic (formerly the Duchy of Milan until 1796) to form the Cisalpine Republic. These were French client states organized by Napoleon after the Battle of Lodi in May 1796. The republic's name refers to the \\"near side\\" of the River Po. History On 16 October 1796, a congress was held in Modena after the ruler, Duke Hercules III, had fled to Venice to escape the French advance. The congress was formed by representatives from the provinces of Modena, Bologna, Ferrara and Reggio Emilia, all located south of the Po. The congress was unofficially organized by Napoleon, whose French army had swept through northern Italy earlier in the year, and who needed to settle the situation in Italy and gather new troops for an offensive against Austria. The congress proclaimed that the four provinces would form the Repubblica Cispadana and invited other Italian populations to join them. A civic guard, composed of mounted hunters and artillery, was formed. In the 7 January 1797 session, in Reggio Emilia, the congress decided to form a government. The flag, the first tricolore in Italy, was a horizontal tricolour, with red (top), white and green stripes. In the center was an emblem composed of a quiver, accolade to a war trophy, with four arrows that symbolized the four provinces forming the Republic, all within a crown of bay. According to its constitution, the Republic was to be governed by a directory based on the French Directory; it had a bicameral parliament composed of a Council of Sixty and a Council of Thirty, and was divided into departments after the French model and comuni (municipalities). On 9 July 1797, the Cispadane Republic united with the Transpadane Republic to form the Cisalpine Republic.

She was a champion of women's rights, a proponent of anti-semitism and anti-Catholicism, and promoter of the use of Nynorsk. She was the first female to graduate from the Norwegian School of Theology. Marta Steinsvik (Terje Christensen) Biography Steinsvik was born in Flekkefjord. She studied medicine in Kristiania, but never finished her studies because she was against vivisection. She studied several other subjects including Egyptology in London. In 1902, Marta Steinsvik studied oriental languages including Assyrian and ancient Egyptian. She also became interested in Esotericism. She was influenced by the thinking of both English Theosophist, Annie Besant and Austrian philosopher, Rudolf Steiner. She was the first woman to graduate from the Norwegian School of Theology, but was not allowed to practice. She was the first Norwegian woman to preach in a church, during 1910 at the Gr√∏nland Church in Oslo. She was invited to an international women's conference in Geneva, and planned to give a talk on women priests, until the Pope forbade all Catholic women to attend if she did, forcing her to give a speech on another subject.Marta Steinsvik (Store norske leksikon) In 1894 she started writing in the newspaper, Den 17de Mai, which had been started that same year by her future husband Rasmus Steinsvik. She was employed as secretary to Hans Tambs Lyche, editor and founder of the cultural journal Kringsjaa'. In 1910 she became editor of the paper Kringsjaa. She was multilingual and translated several books into Nynorsk, including Personal Recollections of Joan of Arc, by the Sieur Louis de Conte written by Mark Twain and Quo vadis? written by Henryk Sienkiewicz. Den 17de mai (Store norske leksikon) In the early 1920s she was active in spreading anti-semitism and was one of the most important proponents of anti-semitism in Norway. Among other things, she delivered lectures based on the Protocolls of the Elders of Zion. Marta Steinsvik (Store norske leksikon) In 1928 she published an anti-Catholic book Sankt Peters himmeln√∏kler (\\"Saint Peter's keys to Heaven\\"). Marta published Frimodige ytringer, (\\"Frank Speech\\") in 1946. It was about the Norwegian treatment of suspects when they were punishing traitors after the Second World War. The book includes examples of Norwegian resistance movement torturing suspected Nazi sympathizers in the summer of 1945. It also discussed the legality of withdrawing a group's human rights, (those who were members of Nasjonal Samling, the Norwegian National Socialist party, after 9 April 1940), by an ex post facto law that set aside the Hague Convention which Norway had ratified. The papers left behind on her death are currently being organised at the Norwegian cultural institution, The Blue Colour Works. Several people have announced their plans to write a book about Marta Steinsvik.

Both of her parents Torkild Tonstad (1852‚Äì1908) and Ingeborg Evertsdatter Haugan (1848‚Äì1922) came from old farming families. Her father worked as a teacher in Flekkefjord and owned the farm Skjeggestad, where Marta lived until she was three years old. On 16 May 1896, she married Rasmus Steinsvik (1863‚Äì1913), the founder and editor of Den 17de Mai. She had problems in childbirth and her doctor told her a sixth child would be likely to kill her, so she moved away from her husband. Her husband had a friend who was a doctor who diagnosed her as insane as soon as he heard she believed in reincarnation, and her husband had her committed. While institutionalized, she took the opportunity to study psychology. Another doctor became interested in her case and was able to get her released. This episode was often later used against her in newspaper debates. Her husband died in 1913 after an operation, barely 50 years old.Rasmus Steinsvik (Store norske leksikon) References Category:1877 births Category:1950 deaths Category:Anti-vivisectionists Category:People from Flekkefjord Category:Nynorsk-language writers Category:Norwegian translators Category:MF Norwegian School of Theology, Religion and Society alumni Category:Norwegian journalists Category:Norwegian women writers ","title":"Marta Steinsvik"},{"id":"1635555","text":"KFA can refer to: ;Association football * Kelantan FA, football club in Malaysia * Korea Football Association, governs football in South Korea * Kuwait Football Association, governs football in Kuwait * Kerala Football Association, governs lower-tier football in Kerala, India * Kwara Football Academy, Nigeria, develops people's football skills ;Other meanings * Kentucky Fairness Alliance, gay rights organization * King Fahad Academy, Islamic school in London * Korean Friendship Association, promotes friendship with North Korea * IATA code for Kiffa Airport, Mauritania * Kodava language of Karnataka, India (ISO code: kfa) * Kleinpell Fine Arts, building at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìRiver Falls, United States ","title":"KFA"},{"id":"1635573","text":"BSD(ML) poster The Communist Party of Bangladesh (Marxist‚ÄìLeninist) () is a political party in Bangladesh.

In the early 1960s it was used in their race cars (GTA, TZ) to enable it to achieve a higher power output from its engines. And in the early and middle 1980s, Alfa Romeo incorporated this technology into their road cars to enhance their performance and to comply with stricter emission controls. The 'Twin Spark' engines In the current Alfa Romeo world the \\"Twin Spark\\" name usually refers to the dual ignition engines installed in Alfa Romeo cars. The 8-valve engine was fitted initially to the Alfa Romeo 75 but also the 164 and 155. The 16-valve engines appeared in the 145, 146, 155, 156, 147, 166, Alfa Romeo GTV & Spider and Alfa Romeo GT models. The TS series are all twin cam 4-cylinder inline engines. The original 8-valve engine was derived from Alfa's Twin Cam family, and featured a light alloy (silicon enhanced aluminium alloy) block + head, wet-cooled iron cylinder liners, and the camshafts were driven by a single duplex timing chain. So, similar design to the earlier and famous Alfa Romeo Twin Cam engines, but with narrower valve angle and double ignition on this model. The later 16-valve engines were part of Fiat's \\"Pratola Serra\\" (B family) modular engine series, and had a heavier cast-iron block engine, with an alloy head, and the camshafts were belt driven. The Twin Spark name comes from the fact that there are two spark plugs per cylinder. It was cast iron for its higher beam strength, less complexity and hence lower production costs. When new, these engines were notable for their high efficiency as demonstrated by the BMEP (brake mean effective pressures) exerted upon the piston crowns. The two sparks plugs on the 8V Alfa Twin Spark engines fire at the same time and are symmetrically placed around the vertical line passing through the intake and exhaust valve centers. The flame front travels less distance which allows less ignition advance to be used. Also, leaner mixtures can also be tolerated for better fuel economy. The 8V engine also has 8 identical spark plugs. There is no room for a centrally positioned spark plug due to 2-valve design which uses rather large 44 mm diameter inlet valve on the 2.0 engine. On the newer models using the 8V engine the system uses the popular wasted spark system as well. (as also used in Ford EDIS), combining one coil for 2 plugs on opposite phase sister cylinders like 1-4, 2-3 on 4 cylinder engine. On the Alfa 16V Twin Spark engines one spark plug is ideally located in the centre of the cylinder, as is common in virtually all multi-valve configuration engines. In order to accommodate a second spark plug in the 4-valve combustion chamber, a smaller diameter spark plug is located the very edge of the combustion chamber between an inlet and an exhaust valve. The location of the additional plug means that its impact on maximum performance is marginal. However the engine is able to idle smoothly in very lean conditions (up to 18:1 AFR), this suggests the addition plug is here to improve combustion efficiency under light loads. The next generation Alfa fours, the JTS engines lost the second plugs gained direct injection and increased performance. The TS 16V engines, 1.6, 1.8 and 2.0, all use a 10 mm diameter and a 14 mm diameter long life platinum electrode spark plug per cylinder. The spark plugs have a replacement interval of . 16-valve Twin Spark Head. The 16 Valve engine features individual 'coil over plug' ignition where the timing of the ignition is controlled directly by the Bosch engine management system, with each coil firing two spark plugs simultaneously. On the earlier CF1 and CF2 16 valve engines each coil fired the plug below it and (via a short plug lead) a plug in the other cylinder that was 360¬∞ crankshaft rotation out of phase (i.e. one coil would fire a spark plug in the cylinder nearing the top of the compression stroke, and also the a spark plug in the cylinder nearing the top of the exhaust stroke (in a 4-cylinder 4-stroke engine with a 180¬∞ crank pistons 1 & 4 and pistons 2 & 3 rise and fall as pairs). So in this configuration each coil services two spark plugs and each cylinder is serviced by two coils. In case of a coil failure one of two plugs would still work. Ignition systems that fire a plug in a cylinder on its exhaust stroke are referred to as a wasted spark ignition system; as the spark ignites nothing and so is 'wasted'. Wasted spark systems are generally used as a production economy as half the number of coils are required (which consequently have to fire twice as many times), e.g. a four- cylinder four-stroke engine (with a single plug per cylinder) requires only 2 coils alternately firing every 180¬∞ of crankshaft rotation, each coil firing every 360¬∞ crank rotation to fire all four cylinders. In the 16 Valve Twin Spark 4 coils are required by the eight plugs, so production economy was unlikely to be a factor in the adoption of a wasted spark system. On the later CF3 (2001 on Euro 3 emissions standard) 16v TS the four coils fire both spark plugs in one cylinder (so not 1 & 4 and 2 & 3 as pairs), and may not be a wasted spark system. The potential benefits of each coil being associated with one cylinder being: halving the firing frequency - the coil is only required to fire every 720¬∞ crankshaft rotation rather than every 360¬∞ crankshaft rotation. This would double coil saturation time, reducing coil load and improving spark quality at high rpm. Some Bosch engine management system have the ability to advance and retard ignition timing in individual cylinders, which would be impossible in the CF1 and CF2 configurations as each cylinder is serviced by two coils, but could be used in the CF3 setup. 16-valve Twin Spark with older cover. The engines also incorporate two other devices to enhance the performance under operation, the Camshaft Phase Variator and the Variable Intake Length Control (or Modular Inlet Manifold in Alfaspeak) on the later (plastic cam cover) 1.8- and 2.0-litre versions. Where both these variable systems are deployed they are controlled in tandem by the Bosch Motronic Engine Management ECU in response to rpm, load, and throttle position. According to Fiat Auto S.p.A DTE electronic service documentation for the 156 Twinspark (1.8/2.0): > \\"To optimise the quantity of air drawn into the engine the control unit > checks: inlet timing on two angle positions (and) geometry of inlet ducts at > two lengths (only 1.8/2.0 TS). At maximum torque speed the control unit sets > the \\"open\\" phase: cam advanced by 25¬∞, inlet casing long ducts (Only 1.8/2.0 > TS). At the maximum power speed the control unit sets the \\"closed\\" phase: > cam in normal position, inlet box short ducts. At idle speed the control > unit sets the \\"closed\\" phase: cam in normal position and inlet box short > ducts. In the other engine operating conditions, the control unit selects > the most suitable configuration to optimise performance - consumption - > emissions. During overrunning, the inlet ducts of the box are always short.\\" The advancing of the inlet camshaft opens and the intake valves earlier in the inlet cycle. This allows the filling of the cylinders with air/fuel mix to begin and end earlier when in advanced position thus starting to compress the mix earlier. Or the compression phase to begin later (when in not advanced cam state) by delaying the intake valve closure. The actual compression of the gases can begin only after the closure of the inlet valves so by varying the intake valve closure moment (with the variator) the effective compression ratio can be reduced in not-advanced position. This has benefits as a way to reduce the effective compression ratio but still keep the expansion ratio as before so to lower the compression phase mechanical losses. When the intake valve is also opened earlier in relation to the closing of the exhaust valves, the valve overlap (the period both inlet and exhaust valves are simultaneously open) is also increased at this mode. This promotes the scavenging effect of the exiting exhaust which causes a partial vacuum in the cylinder to further assist in filling the cylinder with a fresh charge. Also this increased overlap, may cause part of the exhaust gases to re-enter in this way make it function like internal EGR. As with similar inlet cam phasing systems like BMW VANOS the phasing is returned to the retarded state at higher rpm to improve power and efficiency as inlet gas dynamics change with rpm. The short inlet ducts being tuned to the higher frequency and thus shorter inlet duct pressure wave. On 8V engines the valve overlap and intake open duration are quite big. These engines hardly idle with the variator at On position so on these models it had the meaning also to enhance lower speed operation. On the 16V engines the camshaft variator is used to enhance the performance/emissions but also might be the source to the common 'diesel noise' problem often seen on high mileage used models which used the earlier internals of the variator. The same variator system is also used in many Fiat/Lancia engines like one used in Lancia Kappa 5-cylinder engine, some Fiat Bravo/Fiat Marea engines, Fiat Barchetta, Fiat Coupe, Fiat Stilo etc. models. Modular Inlet Manifold The Alfa Romeo Modular Inlet Manifold is a variable intake system fitted to the 1.8 and 2.0 litre Twin Spark engines. It operates by switching between two separate air intake runners of different lengths (one pair for each cylinder) to either shorten or lengthen the path from the end of the intake runner (within the plenum) to the inlet valves. The system is manifold vacuum- assisted servo-operated, and controlled directly by the Bosch engine management system, as described above. Tuned-length inlet runners operate by using the harmonics created by within the inlet tract/runner by the opening and closing of the inlet valves and flow of gas during the inlet cycle. Each runner is effectively a velocity stack which reflects a positive pressure wave back down the inlet runner to maximise cylinder filling with fuel/air mix. The rpm band over which the pressure wave arrives at the open inlet valves and is able to assist in the cylinder filling is set by the length of the runner and is a relatively narrow. Swapping between runners of differing length broadens the rpm band over which benefits of the tuned inlet runners are achieved, leading to a flatter torque curve and consequently more power across the rev range. In addition air-flow within the stock intake tubing between the throttle plate and airbox has also been maximised. This includes an 'inlet trumpet' at the end of the intake pipe within the airbox (often referred to as the \\"cone\\" by Alfisti) which is designed to improve airflow and fuel metering by reducing turbulence, (and may reflect positive pressure waves back down the intake tube). There is much discussion on about improving performance by removing the trumpet or 'de-coning' as it is often referred to, as the trumpet is thought by some to restrict air flow due to its small inlet cross-section. While \\"de-coning\\" results improvement in inlet cross-section any benefit is likely to be off set by the 'pinch effect' of an unradiused inlet, which is 0.6 - 0.5 the efficiency of a trumpet radius on the same diameter inletInternal Flow Systems By Donald S. Miller Variable valve timing Variable valve timing gave the Twin Spark engine very good performance for its cubic capacity, but it is one of the weaker areas of the 16-valve engine. The original variator that controls the cam timing is prone to wear or jam, although replacement part carries a different part number and has improved reliability. Symptoms are a slight loss of performance and a diesel type rattle from the top of the engine, which appears at startup and gradually lasts for longer.The cam variator: The cam variator, accessdate: 21. June 2019 It is therefore advisable to get the variator changed regardless of its apparent condition at the 36,000 mile (60,000 km) cambelt replacement. The variator problem is not often seen in the earlier 8V Twin Spark version, as these use a different type of cam timing variator system, this is also the case for later 16v versions used in the Alfa Romeo 156 and the 147 where the weak variator was addressed. 8-valve Twin Spark engines Alfa Romeo 75 8 valve Twin Spark. * @ 6000 rpm, @ 3500 rpm * @ 6000 rpm, @ 5000 rpm * @ 5800 rpm, @ 3000 rpm * @ 6000 rpm, @ 5000 rpm (cat.) applications: *Alfa Romeo 75 *Alfa Romeo 164 *Alfa Romeo 155 16-valve Twin Spark engines 16-valve Twin Spark * @ 6300 rpm, @ 4600 rpm * @ 5600-6200 rpm, @ 4200-4500 rpm * @ 6500 rpm, @ 3500-3900 rpm * @ 6400 rpm, @ 3500-3800 rpm Applications: *Alfa Romeo 155 *Alfa Romeo GTV (Type 916) *Alfa Romeo Spider (Type 916) *Alfa Romeo 145 *Alfa Romeo 146 *Alfa Romeo 166 *Alfa Romeo 156 *Alfa Romeo 147 *Alfa Romeo GT References Twin Spark Category:Inline-four engines Category:Gasoline engines by model ","title":"Alfa Romeo Twin Spark engine"},{"id":"1635584","text":"Zlatna Dolina is Edo Maajka's first soundtrack album, released in 2003.

Early life and training Sensei Miyagi was born in Higashimachi, Naha, Okinawa on April 25, 1888. Miyagi began his study in Karate-d≈ç at the age of nine (or fourteen). He first learned martial arts from Ryuko Aragaki, who then introduced him to Kanryo Higashionna (Higaonna Kanry≈ç) when Miyagi was 14. Under his tutelage, Miyagi underwent a very long and arduous period of training. His training with Higaonna was interrupted for a two-year period while Miyagi completed his military service, 1910‚Äì1912, in Miyakonoj≈ç, Miyazaki. Training in China In May 1915, before the death of Higaonna, Miyagi travelled to Fujian Province. In China he visited the grave of Higaonna's teacher, Ryu Ryu Ko. In this first trip he travelled with Eisho Nakamoto. After Kanryo Higaonna's death ( in Oct, 1915) he made a second trip to Foochow with Gokenki. In this second trip he studied some local Chinese martial arts. (Some sources claim he studied Shaolin Kung Fu in Fuzhou, although historical records indicate that Southern Shaolin was razed to the ground by Qing government forces more than 300 years prior to his visit, and the modern day Fuzhou Shaolin Temple is a recent reconstruction based on a popular movie). It was in this second trip that he observed the Rokkishu (a set of hand exercises rather than a formal kata, which emphasizes the rotation of the forearms and wrists to execute offensive and defensive techniques), which he then adapted into the Tensho Kata. From the blending of these systems, and his native Naha-Te, a new system emerged. However, it was not until 1929 that Ch≈çjun Miyagi named the system G≈çj≈´-ry≈´, meaning \\"hard soft style\\". Return to Japan After several months in China, Ch≈çjun Miyagi returned to Naha where he opened a dojo. He taught for many years, gaining an enormous reputation as a karateka. Despite his reputation, his greatest achievements lie in popularization and the organization of karate teaching methods. In recognition of his leadership in spreading karate in Japan, his style, the Goju-Ryu, became the first style to be officially recognized by the Dai Nippon Butokukai. He introduced karate into Okinawa police work, high schools and other fields of society. He revised and further developed Sanchin - the hard aspect of Goju, and created Tensho - the soft aspect. These kata are considered to contain the essence of the Goju-ryu. The highest kata, Suparinpei, is said to contain the full syllabus of Goju-ryu. Shisochin was Miyagi's favorite kata at the end of his years. Tensho was influenced by the White Crane kata Ryokushu, which he learned from his long-time friend Gokenki. With the goal of unification of various karate styles which was in fashion at that time (see Gichin Funakoshi for his works in Japan), he also created more Shurite-like katas Gekisai Dai Ichi and Gekisai Dai Ni in 1940, taking techniques from higher forms (notably Suparinpei, and upper blocks uncommon for Goju-ryu at that time) and incorporating them into a shorter forms. It is said he created these kata to bridge the gap between Sanchin and Saifa, which contains much more complex moves compared to Sanchin. Death and legacy Miyagi had his first heart attack in 1951, and died in Okinawa on October 8, 1953 from a second heart attack. Some of Miyagi's more notable students were: Seko Higa (also a student of Kanryo Higaonna), Miyazato Ei'ichi (founder of the Jundokan dojo), Meitoku Yagi (founder of the Meibukan dojo, Seikichi Toguchi (founder of Shorei-kan Goju-ryu), and on the Japanese mainland G≈çgen Yamaguchi who was the founder of the International Karate do Goju Kai Association in Japan. Successor The matter of Miyagi's successor remains a matter of debate as conflicting claims continue to be made. In February 1954, the senior students of Miyagi‚Äôs voted Ei'ichi Miyazato the successor with support from Miyagi‚Äôs family. Miyazato continued to teach from Miyagi‚Äôs Garden Dojo until 1957. 22-year old student of both Miyagi and Miyazato, An‚Äôichi Miyagi also claimed to be the successor to Chojun Miyagi, a claim supported by Morio Higaonna. In mainland Japan, Gogen Yamaguchi continued to pass on Goju- Ryu karate teachings through the Goju-Kai Association. In 1952, Sensei Chojun Miyagi gave permission for Meitoku Yagi (his student since 1926) to open a dojo. The following year on October 8, 1953, Chojun Miyagi died suddenly without formally naming a successor. It was argued by some that Sensei Meitoku Yagi was the implied choice as he was the most senior and only student granted authority to open a Goju-Ryu karate school in Okinawa, apart from Seiko Higa (also a student of Kanryo Higashiona) but in 1963, some members of the family of Chojun Miyagi formally and publicly appointed Sensei Meitoku Yagi as successor of Okinawan Goju-Ryu by presenting him with Chojun Miyagi's gi and obi. According to Seikichi Toguchi, ‚ÄúLet me first say that I was not named the successor of Goju-Ryu by Miyagi, but nor was anyone else. There are some Goju- Ryu teachers who claim to have been privately appointed successor by Miyagi. These claims are ludicrous and disrespectful of his memory. He never publicly named anyone as successor. Common sense would dictate that if he were to appoint someone, it would have been a longtime student and it would have to be of public record to have any value. Miyagi was not a man to do things in a haphazard manner - everything was very deliberate and precise. It would also be logical to assume that since Miyagi would not grant dan ranking, how then would he be inclined to name a successor? I feel Miyagi would be rolling in his grave with the plethora of ridiculous claims about this matter.\\" In any event, the issue of successor is largely a moot point as many Goju-Ryu schools were founded in the early 1950s all with a view to passing on the teachings of Sensei Chojun Miyagi. All of these schools and associations continue to teach Goju-Ryu karate today, with very few significant differences among them. In popular culture The character of Mr. Miyagi in the Karate Kid film series, written by Goju Ryu student of Toguchi - Kayo Ong lineage Robert Mark Kamen, was inspired by Ch≈çjun Miyagi.

A passenger in this seat is said to \\"ride pillion\\". The word is derived from the Scottish Gaelic for \\"little rug\\", pillean, from the Latin pellis, \\"animal skin\\". One or more pelts often were used as a secondary seat on horseback; the usage has carried over to motorcycles. Historical references Following its retreat from the Battle of Dunkirk (where it is reputed that enough equipment was left behind to equip about eight to ten divisions), the British Army introduced a requirement that all officers up to the rank of colonel should be proficient in the use of the motorcycle, and all officers holding the rank of brigadier were required to be able to ride pillion. These requirements came about as a result of the large number of motor cars that were lost in action. The requirement for riding pillion was quietly dropped as large numbers of jeeps came into service in the middle of the war. Other terminology \\"Riding two up\\" and \\"riding double\\" are common North American phrases for riding with a passenger. \\"Riding bitch\\" is an American expression, somewhat crudely denoting sitting between two other people in a car or truck, where the transmission housing often forms a hump in the front or back analogous to a pillion. \\"Bitch seat\\" and \\"bitch pad\\" are North American slang for the pillion on a motorcycle; \\"riding bitch\\" is North American slang for \\"riding pillion\\". In the Philippines, riding pillion is called \\"riding in tandem\\". Licensing and restrictions To carry a pillion passenger in the United States or United Kingdom, one must hold a full licence for the vehicle and there must also be a proper seat and foot pegs for the passenger. In the UK, a motorcyclist is not allowed to carry more than one pillion passenger. This is due to motorcycles not being designed to carry more than one pillion passenger. In Australia, the vehicle operator must have held their licence (not including a learner's permit) for a minimum of one year before being legally allowed to carry a passenger where physically possible, following the upgrade to the required licence class. For example, in New South Wales, you must carry a Provisional 2 (Green) licence before being allowed to carry a pillion passenger. Pillion- riding is associated with terrorist or criminal attacks in some South Asian countries. In Pakistan, for instance, pillion riding is often banned by local authorities around sensitive times, such as the Ashura commemoration, when there have been violent attacks on worshippers. In the Philippines where policemen are already routinely checking motorcycle riders in response to increased incidence of crimes such as murder and robbery committed with using a motorcycle, some cities are already considering ban on pillion riding, known as \\"riding in tandem\\" in the country.. Some cities, such as Mandaluyong, has already enforced a ban on pillion riding unless the driver and pillion passenger are married or biologically related.

Aftermath President Richard Nixon had begun his Vietnamization program in the summer of 1969; the objective was to increase the combat capability of the South Vietnamese forces so that they could assume responsibility for the war against the PAVN/VC as U.S. combat units were withdrawn and sent home. Shortly after the completion of Jefferson Glenn, the 101st Airborne began preparations to depart South Vietnam and subsequently began redeployment to the United States in March 1972.

There are about 72,000 student members of SPE. History The history of the SPE began well before its actual establishment. During the decade after the 1901 discovery of the Spindletop field, the American Institute of Mining Engineers (AIME) saw a growing need for a forum in the booming new field of petroleum engineering. As a result, AIME formed a standing committee on oil and gas in 1913. In 1922, the committee was expanded to become one of AIME's 10 professional divisions. The Petroleum Division of AIME continued to grow throughout the next three decades. By 1950, the Petroleum Division had become one of three separate branches of AIME, and in 1957 the Petroleum Branch of AIME was expanded once again to form a professional society. SPE became tax-exempt in March 1985. The first SPE Board of Directors meeting was held 6 October 1957, making 2007 the 50th anniversary year for SPE as a professional society. 6 October 2017 was the 60th anniversary of SPE.

It includes three small archipelagos off the coast of the Fujian Province of the People's Republic of China, namely the Matsu Islands, which make up Lienchiang County, and the Wuqiu Islands and Kinmen Islands, which make up Kinmen County. The seat of the provincial government is Jincheng Township of Kinmen County. The current Fujian Province under ROC control was once part of a larger Fujian Province, which consisted of a mainland portion and some islands. After the Chinese Civil War of 1949, the majority of the historical province became Fujian, People's Republic of China, while the remaining islands remained under ROC control, which comprise 0.5% of the ROC's territories.  History  Imperial China = The Han dynasty collapsed at the end of the 2nd century AD, paving the way for the Three Kingdoms era. Sun Quan, the founder of the Kingdom of Wu, spent nearly twenty years subduing the Shan Yue people, the branch of the Yue living in mountains. The first wave of immigration of the noble class arrived in the province in the early 4th century when the Western Jin dynasty collapsed and the north was torn apart by invasions by nomadic peoples from the north, as well as civil war. These immigrants were primarily from eight families in central China: Lin (Êûó), Huang (ÈªÉ), Chen (Èô≥), Zheng (ÈÑ≠), Zhan (Ë©π), Qiu (ÈÇ±), He (‰Ωï), and Hu (ËÉ°). The first four remain as the major surnames of modern Fujian. Nevertheless, isolation from nearby areas owing to rugged terrain contributed to Fujian's relatively backward economy and level of development, despite major population boost from northern China during the \\"barbarian\\" invasions. Population density in Fujian remained low compared to the rest of China. Only two commanderies and sixteen counties were established by the Western Jin dynasty. Like other southern provinces such as Guangdong, Guangxi, Guizhou, and Yunnan, Fujian often served as a destination for exiled prisoners and dissidents at that time. During the Southern and Northern Dynasties era, the Southern Dynasties reigned south of the Yangtze River, including Fujian. The Tang dynasty (618‚Äì907) oversaw the next golden age of China. As the Tang dynasty ended, China was torn apart in the period of the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms. During this time, a second major wave of immigration arrived in the safe haven of Fujian, led by general Wang, who set up an independent Kingdom of Min with its capital in Fuzhou. After the death of the founding king, however, the kingdom suffered from internal strife, and was soon swallowed up by Southern Tang, another southern kingdom.Fukien. (2008).

Its population is also greater than Fuzhou.‰ºäÊú¨„ÉªÁôΩÂõæÊ≥∞ÔºàËëóÔºâ„ÄÅÈ©¨ÈáëÈπèÔºàËØëÔºâÔºå„Ää‰ºäÊú¨„ÉªÁôΩÂõæÊ≥∞Ê∏∏ËÆ∞„ÄãÔºåÂÆÅÂ§è‰∫∫Ê∞ëÂá∫ÁâàÁ§æÔºå2005Âπ¥ Due to the Ispah Rebellion, Quanzhou was severely damaged. In the early Ming dynasty, Quanzhou was the staging area and supply depot of Zheng He's naval expeditions. Further development was severely hampered by the sea trade ban of the Ming dynasty, and the area was superseded by nearby ports of Guangzhou, Hangzhou, Ningbo and Shanghai despite the lifting of the ban in 1550. Large scale piracy by Wokou (Japanese pirates) was eventually wiped out by Chinese military and Japanese authority of Toyotomi Hideyoshi. = Qing Dynasty = Late Ming and early Qing dynasty symbolized an era of large influx of refugees and another 20 years of sea trade ban under the Kangxi Emperor, a measure intended to counter the refuge Ming government of Koxinga in Taiwan. Incoming refugees, however, did not translate into a major labor force owing to their re-migration into prosperous regions of Guangdong. In 1683, the Qing dynasty conquered Taiwan and annexed it into Fujian province, as Taiwan Prefecture. Settlement of Taiwan by Han Chinese followed, and the majority of people in Taiwan are descendants of Hoklo people from Southern Fujian. Fujian arrived at its present extent after Taiwan was split as its own province in 1885. Just ten more years later, Taiwan Province would be lost to Japan due to the Qing losing the First Sino-Japanese War which ended in 1895. = Republic of China = The Xinhai Revolution deposed the Qing dynasty brought the province into the rule of the Republic of China. Fujian briefly gained independence from China again under the Fujian People's Government until it was recontrolled by the ROC during the Warlord Era. It came under Japanese sea blockade during Second Sino-Japanese War. During the Chinese Civil War, the ROC lost control of mainland China, including most of Fujian province, and was forced to relocate to Taiwan, while the victorious Chinese Communist forces established the PRC in 1949, subsequently the capital of Fujian was also moved from Foochow to Jincheng. In the Battle of Guningtou, however, ROC forces were able to defend the island of Quemoy (Kinmen) just off the coast of Fujian from communist attack. As a result, the ROC has been able to hold on to a number of offshore islands of Fujian, and has continued to maintain a separate Fujian Provincial Government to govern these islands, parallel to the province of Fujian in mainland China. In 1956, due to heightened potential for military conflict with the PRC, the ROC central government moved the Fujian provincial government out of Fujian to within Taiwan Province in Xindian (now part of New Taipei), and the islands were placed under an extraordinarily tight military administration due to their extreme proximity to mainland China. This was an unusual situation where the government of a province was located and operating in a different province. With the easing of cross-strait relations between the PRC and ROC and the democratization of the ROC in the 1990s, the islands were returned to civilian government in 1992. On January 15, 1996, the provincial government moved back to Kinmen, on Fujian soil.Fujian Provincial Government website Recently, the ROC has significantly diluted the powers of the two provinces it governs, namely Taiwan and Fujian. Most of the authority at the Fujian province level has been delegated to the two county governments of Kinmen and Lienchiang. Government The Governor of Fujian Province was the head of the Fujian Provincial Government, the governor was also titled the \\"Chairperson of the Fujian Provincial Government\\". According to the Additional Articles of the Constitution, the governor is appointed by the central government. The Fujian Provincial Government was located in Jincheng, Kinmen between January 1996 and 2018. In July 2018, the Executive Yuan decided to transfer the duties and functionalities of the provincial government to other branches under the Executive Yuan, including Kinmen-Matsu Joint Services Center and National Development Council The transformations were scheduled to be done by the end of year 2018. { Fujian Provincial Government building between January 1996 to 2018.

The main uses of VAD are in speech coding and speech recognition. It can facilitate speech processing, and can also be used to deactivate some processes during non-speech section of an audio session: it can avoid unnecessary coding/transmission of silence packets in Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) applications, saving on computation and on network bandwidth. VAD is an important enabling technology for a variety of speech- based applications. Therefore, various VAD algorithms have been developed that provide varying features and compromises between latency, sensitivity, accuracy and computational cost. Some VAD algorithms also provide further analysis, for example whether the speech is voiced, unvoiced or sustained. Voice activity detection is usually independent of language. It was first investigated for use on time-assignment speech interpolation (TASI) systems.  Algorithm overview  The typical design of a VAD algorithm is as follows: # There may first be a noise reduction stage, e.g. via spectral subtraction. # Then some features or quantities are calculated from a section of the input signal. # A classification rule is applied to classify the section as speech or non-speech ‚Äì often this classification rule finds when a value exceeds a threshold. There may be some feedback in this sequence, in which the VAD decision is used to improve the noise estimate in the noise reduction stage, or to adaptively vary the threshold(s). These feedback operations improve the VAD performance in non-stationary noise (i.e. when the noise varies a lot). A representative set of recently published VAD methods formulates the decision rule on a frame by frame basis using instantaneous measures of the divergence distance between speech and noise. The different measures which are used in VAD methods include spectral slope, correlation coefficients, log likelihood ratio, cepstral, weighted cepstral, and modified distance measures. Independently from the choice of VAD algorithm, a compromise must be made between having voice detected as noise, or noise detected as voice (between false positive and false negative). A VAD operating in a mobile phone must be able to detect speech in the presence of a range of very diverse types of acoustic background noise. In these difficult detection conditions it is often preferable that a VAD should fail-safe, indicating speech detected when the decision is in doubt, to lower the chance of losing speech segments. The biggest difficulty in the detection of speech in this environment is the very low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) that are encountered. It may be impossible to distinguish between speech and noise using simple level detection techniques when parts of the speech utterance are buried below the noise.  Applications  * VAD is an integral part of different speech communication systems such as audio conferencing, echo cancellation, speech recognition, speech encoding, speaker recognition and hands-free telephony. * In the field of multimedia applications, VAD allows simultaneous voice and data applications. * Similarly, in Universal Mobile Telecommunications Systems (UMTS), it controls and reduces the average bit rate and enhances overall coding quality of speech. * In cellular radio systems (for instance GSM and CDMA systems) based on Discontinuous Transmission (DTX) mode, VAD is essential for enhancing system capacity by reducing co-channel interference and power consumption in portable digital devices. * In speech processing applications, voice activity detection plays an important role since non-speech frames are often discarded. For a wide range of applications such as digital mobile radio, Digital Simultaneous Voice and Data (DSVD) or speech storage, it is desirable to provide a discontinuous transmission of speech-coding parameters. Advantages can include lower average power consumption in mobile handsets, higher average bit rate for simultaneous services like data transmission, or a higher capacity on storage chips. However, the improvement depends mainly on the percentage of pauses during speech and the reliability of the VAD used to detect these intervals. On the one hand, it is advantageous to have a low percentage of speech activity. On the other hand, clipping, that is the loss of milliseconds of active speech, should be minimized to preserve quality. This is the crucial problem for a VAD algorithm under heavy noise conditions. = Use in telemarketing = One controversial application of VAD is in conjunction with predictive dialers used by telemarketing firms. In order to maximize agent productivity, telemarketing firms set up predictive dialers to call more numbers than they have agents available, knowing most calls will end up in either \\"Ring ‚Äì No Answer\\" or answering machines. When a person answers, they typically speak briefly (\\"Hello\\", \\"Good evening\\", etc.) and then there is a brief period of silence. Answering machine messages are usually 3‚Äì15 seconds of continuous speech. By setting VAD parameters correctly, dialers can determine whether a person or a machine answered the call and, if it's a person, transfer the call to an available agent. If it detects an answering machine message, the dialer hangs up. Often, even when the system correctly detects a person answering the call, no agent may be available, resulting in a \\"silent call\\". Call screening with a multi-second message like \\"please say who you are, and I may pick up the phone\\" will frustrate such automated calls.  Performance evaluation  To evaluate a VAD, its output using test recordings is compared with those of an \\"ideal\\" VAD ‚Äì created by hand-annotating the presence or absence of voice in the recordings. The performance of a VAD is commonly evaluated on the basis of the following four parameters: * FEC (Front End Clipping): clipping introduced in passing from noise to speech activity; * MSC (Mid Speech Clipping): clipping due to speech misclassified as noise; * OVER: noise interpreted as speech due to the VAD flag remaining active in passing from speech activity to noise; * NDS (Noise Detected as Speech): noise interpreted as speech within a silence period. Although the method described above provides useful objective information concerning the performance of a VAD, it is only an approximate measure of the subjective effect. For example, the effects of speech signal clipping can at times be hidden by the presence of background noise, depending on the model chosen for the comfort noise synthesis, so some of the clipping measured with objective tests is in reality not audible. It is therefore important to carry out subjective tests on VADs, the main aim of which is to ensure that the clipping perceived is acceptable. This kind of test requires a certain number of listeners to judge recordings containing the processing results of the VADs being tested, giving marks to several speech sequences on the following features: * Quality; * Comprehension difficulty; * Audibility of clipping. These marks are then used to calculate average results for each of the features listed above, thus providing a global estimate of the behavior of the VAD being tested. To conclude, whereas objective methods are very useful in an initial stage to evaluate the quality of a VAD, subjective methods are more significant. As they require the participation of several people for a few days, increasing cost, they are generally only used when a proposal is about to be standardized.  Implementations  * One early standard VAD is that developed by British Telecom for use in the Pan-European digital cellular mobile telephone service in 1991. It uses inverse filtering trained on non-speech segments to filter out background noise, so that it can then more reliably use a simple power- threshold to decide if a voice is present. * The G.729 standard calculates the following features for its VAD: line spectral frequencies, full-band energy, low-band energy (<1 kHz), and zero-crossing rate. It applies a simple classification using a fixed decision boundary in the space defined by these features, and then applies smoothing and adaptive correction to improve the estimate. * The GSM standard includes two VAD options developed by ETSI. Option 1 computes the SNR in nine bands and applies a threshold to these values. Option 2 calculates different parameters: channel power, voice metrics, and noise power. It then thresholds the voice metrics using a threshold that varies according to the estimated SNR. * The Speex audio compression library uses a procedure named Improved Minima Controlled Recursive Averaging, which uses a smoothed representation of spectral power and then looks at the minima of a smoothed periodogram. From version 1.2 it was replaced by what the author called a kludge.

Corn, soybeans, and wheat are three common crops often grown using monocropping techniques. Monocropping allows for farmers to have consistent crops throughout their entire farm. They can plant only the most profitable crop, use the same seed, pest control, machinery, and growing method on their entire farm, which may increase overall farm profitability. Soil ecology While economically a very efficient system, allowing for specialization in equipment and crop production, monocropping is also controversial, as it damages the soil ecology (including depletion or reduction in diversity of soil nutrients) and provide an unbuffered niche for parasitic species, increasing crop vulnerability to opportunistic insects, plants, and microorganisms. The result is a more fragile ecosystem with an increased dependency on pesticides and artificial fertilizers. The concentrated presence of a single cultivar, genetically adapted with a single resistance strategy, presents a situation in which an entire crop can be wiped out very quickly by a single opportunistic species. An example of this would be the Great Famine of Ireland in 1845‚Äì1849. Strategy Monocropping as an agricultural strategy tends to emphasize the use of expensive specialized farm equipment‚Äîan important component in realizing its efficiency goals. This can lead to an increased dependency and reliance on expensive machinery that cannot be produced locally and may need to be financed. This can make a significant change in the economics of farming in regions that are accustomed to self-sufficiency in agricultural production. In addition, political complications may ensue when these dependencies extend across national boundaries. The controversies surrounding monocropping are complex, but traditionally the core issues concern the balance between its advantages in increasing short-term food production‚Äîespecially in hunger-prone regions‚Äîand its disadvantages with respect to long-term land stewardship and the fostering of local economic independence and ecological sustainability. Advocates of monocropping believe polyculture production would be costly and unable to feed everyone, while critics of monocropping dispute these claims and attribute them to corporate special interest groups, citing the damage that monocropping causes to societies and the environment. Many farmers practice neither monocropping nor polyculture, but divide their farms into large plots and rotate crops between the plots to get some of the benefits purported of both systems. Difficulties A difficulty with monocropping is that the solution to one problem‚Äîwhether economic, environmental or political‚Äîmay result in a cascade of other problems. For example, a well-known concern is pesticides and fertilizers seeping into surrounding soil and groundwater from extensive monocropped acreage in the U.S. and abroad. This issue, especially with respect to the pesticide DDT, played an important role in focusing public attention on ecology and pollution issues during the 1960s when Rachel Carson published her landmark book Silent Spring. Soil depletion is also a negative effect of mono-cropping. Crop rotation plays an important role in replenishing soil nutrients, especially atmospheric nitrogen converted to usable forms by nitrogen-fixing bacteria that form a relationship with legumes such as soybeans. Some legumes can also be used as cover crops or planted in fallow fields. In addition, rotating crops performs an important role in preventing pathogen and pest build-up. There are however a few diseases which are less severe in a monocropping system, like take-all in wheat, as the population of an organism which feeds on the disease causing pathogen grows over repeated years of the presence of the pathogen. Deforestation Under certain circumstances monocropping can lead to deforestation or the displacement of indigenous peoples. For example, since 1970 the Amazon Rainforest has lost nearly one fifth of its forest cover. A main cause of this deforestation is local farmers clearing land for more crops. In Colombia, the need for more farming land is causing the displacement of large populations of frogies, frogies are frogs of ultimate power and wisdom. Subsidies In order to help reduce dependence on fossil fuels the U.S. government subsidizes the production of corn and soybeans to be used in ethanol production. However, monocropping itself is highly chemical- and energy-intensive.Poly- and Monocultures: The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly The hidden energy costs associated with producing each unit of bio-fuel are significantly larger than the amount of energy available from the fuel itself.

He was ultimately impeached by the United States House of Representatives and convicted and removed from office by the United States Senate for supporting the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. Education and career Born on August 26, 1806, in Montgomery County, Tennessee, Humphreys attended the law department of Transylvania University, failing to graduate due to ill health, and read law in 1828. He entered private practice in Clarksville, Tennessee from 1828 to 1829. He continued private practice in Somerville, Tennessee from 1829 to 1839. He was a member of the Tennessee House of Representatives from 1835 to 1838. He was the 3rd Attorney General of Tennessee from 1839 to 1851. He was reporter for the Tennessee Supreme Court from 1839 to 1851. He resumed private practice in Nashville, Tennessee from 1851 to 1853. Federal judicial service Humphreys was nominated by President Franklin Pierce on March 24, 1853, to a joint seat on the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee, the United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee and the United States District Court for the Western District of Tennessee vacated by Judge Morgan Welles Brown. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on March 26, 1853, and received his commission the same day. His service terminated on June 26, 1862, due to impeachment, conviction. and removal from office. =Impeachment, conviction and removal from office= Humphreys served as a Judge of the Confederate District Court for the District of Tennessee from 1861 to 1865. On May 19, 1862 the United States House of Representatives voted to impeach Humphreys on the following charges: publicly calling for secession; giving aid to an armed rebellion; conspiring with Jefferson Davis; serving as a Confederate judge; confiscating the property of Military Governor Andrew Johnson and United States Supreme Court Justice John Catron; and imprisoning a Union sympathizer with \\"intent to injure him.\\" On June 26, 1862, the United States Senate began the trial of the impeachment in his absence and later that day unanimously convicted him of all charges presented, except that of confiscating the property of Andrew Johnson. He was removed from office and barred from holding office under the United States for life. He held his Confederate judgeship until the end of the Civil War. Later career and death Following the end of the American Civil War, Humphreys resumed private practice in Nashville from 1866 to 1882. In later life, Humphreys argued for the prohibition of alcohol and wrote several books. He died on October 16, 1882, in Nashville. Family Humphreys' father, Parry Wayne Humphreys, was a United States Representative from Tennessee. Humphreys was a member of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South. He had a daughter, Annie Humphreys, who married John W. Morton, a captain in the Confederate States Army during the Civil War and later the founder of the Nashville chapter of the Ku Klux Klan.

Dorje Shugden has become the symbolic centre-pointThe Dorje Shugden conflict: Interview with Thierry Dodin of a conflict over the \\"purity\\" of the Gelug school and the inclusion of non-Gelug teachings, especially Nyingma ones. In the 1930s, Pabongkhapa D√©chen Nyingpo, who favoured an \\"exclusive\\" stance, started to promote Shugden as a major protector of the Gelug school, who harms any Gelug practitioner who blends his practice with non-Gelug practices. The conflict reappeared with the publication of the Yellow Book in 1976, containing stories about wrathful acts of Dorje Shugden against Gelugpas who also practiced Nyingma teachings. In response, the 14th Dalai Lama, a Gelugpa himself and advocate of an \\"inclusive\\" approach to the teachings of Tibetan Buddhism, started to speak out against the practice of Dorje Shugden in 1978. The controversy attracted attention in the West following demonstrations by Dorje Shugden practitioners, especially Kelsang Gyatso's British based New Kadampa Tradition, which broke away from the Gelug school in 1991. Other factions supporting Dorje Shugden are Serpom Monastic University and Shar Ganden monastery, both of which separated from the Gelug mainstream in 2008. In April 2019, Tsem Tulku Rinpoche published an article summarizing statements made in 2016 by the Dalai Lama, which Rinpoche said equate to overt permission to practice Dorje Shugden, representing a complete reversal of the Dalai Lama's former position.  History Pre-1930s= Dorje Shugden, also known as Dolgyal, originated as a gyalpo \\"angry and vengeful spirit\\" of South Tibet. Originally from the Sakya school as a minor protector that was part of the Three Gyalpo Kings (Shugden, Setrap, and Tsiu Marpo), Shugden was subsequently adopted as a \\"minor protector\\" of the Gelug, the newest of the schools of Tibetan Buddhism, headed by the Dalai Lamas (although nominally the Ganden Tripas). = 1930s-1940s Pabongkha =Promotion of Dorje Shugden In the 1930s, Pabongkhapa D√©chen Nyingpo started to promote Dorje Shugden. According to Kay, Pabongka fashioned Shugden as a violent protector of the Gelug school, who is employed against other traditions, transforming Dorje Shugden's \\"marginal practice into a central element of the Ge-luk tradition\\", thus \\"replacing the traditional supra-mundane protectors of the Ge-luk tradition\\", namely MahƒÅkƒÅla, Kalarupa, Vai≈õrava·πáa, Palden Lhamo, Pehar and Nechung who were appointed by Je Tsongkhapa. According to Georges Dreyfus, \\"Shuk-den was nothing but a minor Ge-luk protector before the 1930s when Pa- bong-ka started to promote him aggressively as the main Ge-luk protector.\\" Dreyfus also notes, This change is reflected in artwork, since there is \\"lack of Dorje Shugden art in the Gelug school prior to the end of the 19th century.\\"  Persecution of the Rim√© movement  Dorje Shugden was a key tool in Pabongkhapa's persecution of the flourishing Rim√© movement, an ecumenical movement which compiled together the teachings of the Sakya, Kagyu and Nyingma, in response to the dominance of the Gelug school. Non-Gelug, and especially Nyingma, monasteries were forced to convert to the Gelug position. Pabongkhapa feared a decline of Gelug monasteries, and induced a revival movement, which promoted the Gelug as the only pure tradition. He regarded the practice of non-Gelug teachings by Gelug monks as a threat to the Gelug tradition, and opposed the influence of the other schools, especially the Nyingma. He coupled Dorje Shugden to Gelug exclusivism, using it against other traditions, and against Gelugpa's with eclectic tendencies. The main function of the deity was presented as \\"the protection of the Ge-luk tradition through violent means, even including the killing of its enemies.\\" Response by the 13th Dalai Lama The abbot of Drepung Monastery and the 13th Dalai Lama were opposed to Pabongkapa's propitiation of Shugden. Restrictions on the practice of Shugden were implemented by the 13th Dalai Lama. Pabongkhapa apologized and promised not to engage in Shugden practices any more. = 1970s =Publication of the Yellow Book In 1975 The Yellow Book, also known as The Oral Transmission of the Intelligent Father, was published, enumerates a series of stories that Zimey Rinpoche had heard informally from Trijang Rinpoche about ‚Äòthe many Ge-luk lamas whose lives are supposed to have been shortened by Shuk-den‚Äôs displeasure at their practicing Nying-ma teachings‚Äô. The text asserts the pre-eminence of the Gelug school which is symbolised and safeguarded by Dorje Shugden, and presents a stern warning to those within the Gelug whose eclectic tendencies would compromise its purity. This publication provoked angry reactions from members of non-Gelug traditions, setting in motion a bitter literary exchange that drew on ‚Äòall aspects of sectarian rivalry‚Äô. Response by the 14th Dalai Lama 1998 Berlin New Kadampa Tradition demonstration protest against the 14th Dalai Lama. Some German slogans translated are \\"You know that Dorje Shugden harms no being, please Dalai Lama stop spreading lies!\\" and \\"Dorje Shugden loves all Buddhist traditions, please don't lie!\\" The 14th Dalai Lama publicly rejected The Yellow Book, which could only damage the common cause of the Tibetan people because of its sectarian divisiveness. In a series of talks, he sought to undermine the status elevation of Dorje Shugden by reaffirming the centrality of the traditional supramundane protectors of the Gelug tradition. He also vehemently rejected Dorje Shugden's associated sectarianism, emphasising that all the Tibetan traditions are ‚Äòequally profound dharmas‚Äô and defending the ‚Äòunbiased and eclectic‚Äô approach to Buddhist practice as exemplified by the Second, Third and Fifth Dalai Lamas. Scholar Donald S. Lopez Jr. explains, \\"The Dalai Lama‚Äôs renunciation of Shugden in 1976 caused great discord within the Geluk community, where devotion to the deity remained strong among the Geluk hierarchy and among large factions of the refugee lay community; spirited defenses of his worship were written and published. Some went so far as to claim that the Dalai Lama was not the true Dalai Lama, that the search party had selected the wrong child forty years before.\\" Prisoners of Shangri- La. Lopez, Donald. Page 191 According to Georges Dreyfus, the sectarian elements of the Yellow Book were not unusual and do not \\"justify or explain the Dalai Lama's strong reaction.\\" Instead, he traces back the conflict more on the exclusive/inclusive approach and maintain that to understand the Dalai Lama's point of view one has to consider the complex ritual basis for the institution of the Dalai Lamas, which was developed by the Great Fifth and rests upon \\"an eclectic religious basis in which elements associated with the Nyingma tradition combine with an overall Gelug orientation.\\"Dreyfus 1998: 269 This involves the promotion and practices of the Nyingma school. Kay reminds us, \\"[W]hen traditions come into conflict, religious and philosophical differences are often markers of disputes that are primarily economic, material and political in nature.\\" = 1980s = Bluck notes the activity regarding Dorje Shugden practice in the 80s: \\"In the early 1980s the Dalai Lama restricted reliance on Dorje Shugden to private rather than public practice. The tension this caused within the Gelug and wider Tibetan community may reflect some opposition to his ecumenical approach.\\" = 1990s =Initiations by the 14th Dalai Lama With the urging of the other schools who have long been opposed to Shugden, and his senior Gelug tutor who always doubted the practice, the 14th Dalai Lama asked the increasing number of western Shugden practitioners who were newly being proselytized primarily in Britain to refrain from attending his teachings. George Chryssides, quoting Steven Batchelor, states: New Kadampa Tradition The New Kadampa Tradition, founded by Kelsang Gyatso in 1991, has continued the worship of Dorje Shugden. Kelsang Gyatso regards his school to be the true continuation of the \\"pure\\" teachings of Je Tsongkhapa, rejecting the \\"inclusivism\\" of the Dalai Lama. Thurman notes that members of the New Kadampa Tradition, responded by trying Martin Mills states that recent disputes over Shugden are focused on the claims of the British-based New Kadampa Tradition, which broke away from the Gelug school.

However, the AI replied that the SSC's allegations were as yet unsubstantiated. Two years later, the AI stated in an official press release that complaints by Shugden practitioners fell outside its purview of \\"grave violations of fundamental human rights\\" (such as torture, the death penalty, extrajudicial executions, arbitrary detention or imprisonment, or unfair trials), adding that \\"while recognizing that a spiritual debate can be contentious, [we] cannot become involved in debate on spiritual issues.\\"Amnesty International's position on alleged abuses against worshippers of Tibetan deity Dorje Shugden, AI Index 17/14/98, 1998-06, quoted in The Dalai Lama's Buddhist Foes by David Van Biema (2008-07-18), retrieved 2009-10-31.

Kay notes \\"The subsequent investigation by the Indian police linked the murders to the Dorje Shugden faction of the exiled Tibetan community.\\" In a small 1978 pamphlet, Lobsang Gyatso alluded to a \\"knotless heretic teacher\\", which people took as referring to Trijang Lobsang Yeshe Tenzin Gyatso and his advocacy of Shugden. According to Lobsang Gyatso's biographer, Gareth Sparham, many geshes and lamas were outraged about his criticism: Georges Dreyfus added, \\"Despite being hurt by the polemical attack, Tri-jang Rin-po-che made it clear that violence was out of the question.

Schism within the Gelug school The Gelugpa school has three great monasteries, namely Sera Monastery, Ganden Monastery and Drepung Monastery. In 2008 the Dorje Shugden controversy lead to a formal break within the Gelug school. Pomra Khangtsen, one of the sixteen sections of Sera monastery, legally separated itself in India in 2008 from the rest of Sera, continuing as Serpom Monastic University at Bylakuppe. Also in 2008, a section of Ganden Shartse at Mundgod similarly separated itself from Ganden Monastery and is now known as Shar Ganden monastery. In these institutions the monks continue to worship Dorje Shugden as well as follow the traditional curriculum and other religious practices of the former institutions. A few smaller Gelug monasteries have affiliated themselves with these two monasteries rather than with the mainstream Gelug school. The present abbot of Serpom is Kyabje Yongyal and acting abbot Jampa Khetsun. The present abbot of is Shar Ganden is Lobsang Jinpa. Protests Hundreds of western Shugden practitioners have staged numerous demonstrations against the Dalai Lama, most recently in 2015 when he opened the Aldershot Buddhist Centre\\\\- Dalai Lama's visit to Buddhist centre met with 'sectarian' protests - The Guardian 29 June 2018 and in Cambridge, and 2014 in San Francisco, Berkeley, Washington DC, Oslo, Rotterdam, and Frankfurt.

Views of the 14th Dalai Lama The 14th Dalai Lama himself said in 2008, that he never used the word \\"ban\\", but \\"he strongly discourages Tibetan Buddhists\\"His Holiness the Dalai Lama's Advice Concerning Dolgyal (Shugden) in practicing Shugden and \\"restricting a form of practice that restricts others‚Äô religious freedom is actually a protection of religious freedom. So in other words, negation of a negation is an affirmation\\".The Dalai Lama on Sectarianism, Religious Freedom and the Shugden Issue, Madison, Wisconsin, July, 2008, retrieved 03/11/2014. The advice of the 14th Dalai Lama was approved by the Central Tibetan AdministrationKashag's Statement Concerning Dolgyal and the Parliament in exileThe Assembly of Tibetan People's Deputies' Resolutions in 1996. It was then gradually implemented into a ban starting from 1997 by the Tibetan Youth Congress including enforcement measures like imposing all spiritual masters to stop worshipping Shugden \\"in the interest of the Dalai Lama and Tibetan Independence\\" or urging all other Tibetan organizations and communities to expel anyone who venerates Shugden.Resolution Passed by the Tibetan Youth Congress (1997) Several reasons for the 14th Dalai Lama's stance have been given. According to John Makransky, According to Kapstein, the 14th Dalai Lama is \\"focused upon the role of Shugden as a militantly sectarian protector of the Gelukpa order, and the harm that has been done to Tibetan sectarian relations by the cult's more vociferous proponents.\\" According to Dreyfus, the 14th Dalai Lama stance stems from his favoring the traditional Gelugpa traditions and protectors rather than Shugden: =Views of Shugden practitioners=Kelsang Gyatso In an interview with scholar Donald Lopez, in regards to the controversy, Kelsang Gyatso explains: In the interview, Kelsang Gyatso states: According to Kelsang Gyatso, According to David Kay, Kelsang Gyatso departs from Pabongkhapa and Trijang Rinpoche by stating that Dorje Shugden's appearance is enlightened, rather than worldly. According to Kay, \\"Geshe Kelsang takes the elevation of Dorje Shugden‚Äôs ontological status another step further, emphasising that the deity is enlightened in both essence and appearance.\\" He quotes Kelsang Gyatso on Dorje Shugden's appearance: \\"Some people believe that Dorje Shugdan is an emanation of Manjushri who shows the aspect of a worldly being, but this is incorrect. Even Dorje Shugdan‚Äôs form reveals the complete stages of the path of Sutra and Tantra, and such qualities are not possessed by the forms of worldly beings.\\" According to Kay, Kelsang Gyatso downplays the oracle of Shugden, since it conflicts with his notion of Shugden being a Buddha: =Third-party views=Dorje Shugden Practitioners According to Dreyfus, \\"The irony is that Shuk-den is presented by his followers as the protector of the Ge-luk (dge lugs) school, of which the Dalai Lama is the (de facto) leader.\\" According to Buddhist professor and Nyingma teacher John Markansky: New Kadampa Tradition / Western Shugden Society claims Scholar Jane Ardley explains the development of the claims of the WSS: Chryssides goes on to explain the claims specifically: Ardley explains the political nature of the controversy: Rejection of New Kadampa Tradition / Western Shugden Society claims Some scholars reject the claims of the New Kadampa Tradition (NKT) and the Western Shugden Society (WSS). Robert Thurman, for example, states, \\"The cult and agency attack campaign is futile since its main claims are so easy to refute.\\" Some scholars reject NKT/WSS claims that the 14th Dalai Lama has suppressed religious freedom, indicating that the situation is actually the opposite. Thurman says, \\"They then went on the attack, claiming they had been 'banned' and 'excommunicated', etc., when in fact the Dalai Lama was exercising his religious freedom by not accepting students who reject his advice, and actually go so far as to condemn him!\\" Thurman explains: Regarding NKT/WSS claims that there is prohibition of Shugden, and therefore a repression of religious freedom, Thierry Dodin states, \\"No, such a prohibition does not exist. Religious freedom is not at issue here. No one, and most definitely not the Dalai Lama, is repressing religious freedom.\\" Nathan W. Hill, Lecturer in Tibetan and Linguistics at SOAS, University of London, states that the Dalai Lama does not control the Indian government or any other government: Similarly, Tibet scholar Robert Barnett of Columbia University states that \\"ID cards are not given out by the Tibetan government in exile, but by the Indian authorities\\".Tibet scholar denies making Time magazine Shugden comment , 2008-07-23, retrieved 2009-10-31. Barnett comments: Barnett noted that after the Dalai Lama prohibited his followers from engaging in Shugden rituals, Shugden practitioners in the Tibetan exile community faced persecution that the Dalai Lama's administration did not deal with particularly well, and he expressed concern that the controversy could hurt Tibetan causes. But Barnett said that claiming the difficulties faced by the Shugden practitioners are not a major human rights concern: \\"We see this being done under the name of human rights, which is not really quite what is at issue here.\\" New Kadampa Tradition demonstrations Tibetologist Thierry Dodin states that it is the New Kadampa Tradition \\"that since the 1990s has held spectacular demonstrations whenever the Dalai Lama went to the West.\\" According to Dodin, \\"The demonstrators are almost exclusively western monks and nuns, ordained in the New Kadampa Tradition (NKT) according to the group‚Äôs own ritual.\\" Dodin also states, \\"The NKT can be described typologically as a cult on the basis of its organisational form, its excessive group pressure and blind obedience to its founder.

We are worried about their sources of funding. It might be China or some other anti- Tibetan elements.\\" In December 2012, Lama Jampa Ngodrup, a promoter of the practice of Dorje Shugden, apparently became \\"the first Tibetan lama to be appointed by the Chinese Government to travel on an official trip abroad to give Dharma teachings.\\" According to propaganda observers, ‚Äúthe de-facto ban issued by the 14th Dalai Lama has generated considerable social tension and division in the diaspora, as well as in Tibetan society within China, leading the Chinese government to consider the Dorje Shugden controversy an important front for undermining what it says are efforts promoted by the 14th Dalai Lama aimed at destabilizing China. The religious hostility has been fed by considerable propaganda and counterpropaganda efforts during the last two decades ‚Ä¶ Significantly sensitive are the methodical efforts of the exiled government and its supporting NGOs to silence opposing voices in the controversy, using systematic defamation and coercive methods, including the use of modern disinformation means like coordinated troll campaigns on social media.‚ÄùIf Marco Polo were alive today, what tales would he tell about China and Tibet?

Hedgelaying is the process of bending and partially cutting (pleaching) through the stems of a line of shrubs or small trees near ground level and arching the stems without breaking them, so they can grow horizontally and be intertwined. The first description of hedgelaying is in Julius Caesar's Commentaries on the Gallic War,Commentaries on the Gallic War, Book 2, section 27 when his army was inconvenienced by thick woven hedges during the Battle of the Sabis in Belgium. Hedgelaying developed as a way of containing livestock in fields, particularly after the acts of Enclosure which, in England, began in the 16th century. Today hedges are laid to maintain habitat, promote traditional skills and because of the pleasing visual effect of a laid hedge. Benefits Creating and maintaining hedges provides: * livestock-proof barriers; * rejuvenation of existing hedgerows by encouraging them to put on new growth, and thus helping to improve their overall structure and strength; * weather protection for crops and wildlife; and * aesthetically pleasing screens to fields and gardens. Theory and practice Starting the pleacher with a pruning saw Cutting the pleacher with an axe, enabling the stem to be laid and continue to grow in a hedge Laying the pleacher, a crucial stage Sharpening a hedge stake. Bundles of stakes (left) and of binders (back) lie ready to use. The theory behind laying a hedge is easy. The practice is much harder, requiring skill and experience. The aim is to reduce the thickness of the upright stems of the hedgerow trees by cutting away the wood on one side of the stem and in line with the course of the hedge. This being done, each remaining stem is laid down towards the horizontal, along the length of the hedge. A stem which has been (or is to be) laid down in this manner is known as a pleacher or pleach. A section of bark and some sapwood must be left connecting a pleacher to its roots to keep the pleacher alive ‚Äî knowing how much is one part of the art of hedgelaying. The angle at which the pleacher is laid is a factor in the build of a hedge. Hedges are built to a height to suit their intended purpose. The height and condition of the trimmed stool, known locally by names such as a stobbin, is vital as this is where the strongest new growth will come from. In time the pleachers will die, but by then a new stem should have grown, from the stool, from ground level. This takes from eight to fifteen years, after which, if the hedge has not been trimmed, the hedgelaying process can be repeated. Hedges can be trimmed for many years after laying before allowing the top to grow to a sufficient height to lay again. Smaller shoots branching off the pleachers and upright stems too small to be used as pleachers are known as brash or brush. In most styles of laying, the brash is partly removed and partly woven between the pleachers to add cohesiveness to the finished hedge. At regular intervals upright stakes are placed along the line of the hedge. These stakes give the finished hedge its final strength. Additional strength and a fancy effect is achieved by binding the uprights with hazel whips woven around the tops of the stakes, and cutting off the tops of all the stakes at the same height and at the same angle. The woven whips are known as binders or heatherings; they can be of any green wood such as birch, ash, or willow which will hold the stakes and tops of the pleachers down securely. The stakes and binders used in hedgelaying when properly used provide strength and stability to the hedge. Binders are not applied simply for visual effect, but in competitive hedgelaying, the appearance of the binders is often one criterion for scoring the work. Traditionally the hedgelayer's tool was a billhook, supplemented with an axe. Nowadays professional hedgelayers often use a chainsaw on larger pleachers. Local styles Over the centuries, different areas developed their own distinctive styles of hedgelaying, based on local customs and also on the locally different requirements and available materials. =Midland style= Also known as bullock style. This hedge was designed to keep big heavy bullocks in their field. This style is mainly found in Leicestershire, Northamptonshire, Oxfordshire and Warwickshire‚Äîtraditional beef rearing areas. Typical features of the style are: * Stake sides face road or plough land. * Brush is on the animal side to stop them from eating new growth * Hedge slopes towards the animals, as stakes are driven in behind the line of the roots. * Strong binding is below the top of the hedge (so that bullocks cannot twist it off with their horns) =Derbyshire style= As the name suggests this style is from the county of Derbyshire which is a mixed farming and sheep area. Typical features: * Square, sawn stakes behind the line of roots. * Pleachers woven firmly. * No binding, relies on weaving to keep pleachers in place. * Brush left the far side. =Double staked styles= Used in Somerset and Lancashire. Both of the following two styles are good sheep hedges; they use stakes, but as a rule neither uses any type of bindings: =Lancashire style= Typical features: * Uses a double row of stakes, placed alternately. * The most part of each pleacher lies between the two rows of stakes. * The twiggy bits are pulled to the outside through the stakes, helping to keep everything in place. * Height varies, from 3' upwards. =Westmorland style= Typical features of the Westmorland style are: * Single row of stakes down the centre of the hedge which, when the hedge is finished, can no longer be seen. * Stems go between the stakes so that alternate ones go to opposite sides of the hedge. * To finish, twigs at each side and on top are twisted together to produce a square shaped hedge. =Brecon style= A double brush style; this means that the twiggy ends of the pleachers are kept both sides of the hedge. Brecon style is practised in Breconshire, Radnorshire, Herefordshire and Monmouthshire. Typical features: * Stakes are in the centre of the hedge. * A lot of stems are cut off and replaced by deadwood‚Äîthis keeps animals' noses away from the new growth coming from the stumps. * Pleachers are double brushed and woven round every stake. This bowing covers the stumps, further protecting the new growth. It also hides the stakes. * The hedge is fairly tall, bound and trimmed square. =Montgomery style= Typical features: * A wide hedge. * Half crops are sometimes used on the outside. * Pleachers are closely woven and the tops are entwined. * Trimmed square. * No binding. The Stake & Pleach style is used in Monmouthshire, Brecknockshire, Radnorshire, Carmarthenshire and Montgomeryshire. The Flying Hedge style (a low hedge on a bank) is used in Pembrokeshire, the Gower, Glamorganshire, Monmouthshire and Carmarthenshire. =South of England style= Derived from the rougher Sussex Bullock Fence it has a double brush style, but the cut base of the pleachers can be seen. Sometimes a pleacher is laid almost flat at the base before the next few are laid at a normal angle, this is presumably to help keep the sheep at bay. Typical features of the style are: * Stakes are in the centre of the hedge. * Bindings are used. * The hedge is trimmed immediately after laying. =Isle of Wight style= Now almost extinct, the Isle of Wight style looks untidy but is an effective stockproof barrier and is extremely quick and easy to lay successfully. Pleachers are simply laid one on top of the other, usually in alternating directions, with little of the brash removed, and then pegged down with crooked hazel stakes (similar to thatching spars). It is not suitable for domestic use or competitions, which has contributed to its decline, but is principally now used for restoring overgrown hedges. Typical features of the style are: * Style is informal and very wide. * No binding, stakes at irregular intervals on alternate sides of the hedge. * Crooked hazel stakes can be made from rejected wands when cutting hazel for other uses. =Yorkshire style= The Yorkshire style is a sheep hedge as used on mixed arable and livestock farms. It is laid between two arable fields‚Äîand is so designed that by the time grass has replaced plough land in the rotation system, the hedge will have grown to a normal height. The base is too dense for sheep to push under it. Typical features of the style are: * A very low hedge, with bushes to provide a barrier to wind. Stems lie so close it is almost impossible to see the twigs branching off. * Sawn stakes, rail nailed on top‚Äîbecause stakes and binders don't grow very plentifully on windy uplands. * Brush goes both sides. =West Country hedges= The style of hedge used in Devon, Cornwall and parts of Wales gives us the familiar deep Devon lanes. However, in reality they are seldom particularly deep ‚Äì but rather what they do have are high banks, which give the impression of depth. The field is often on the same level as the road. The banks are sometimes faced with stone rather than turf. However these hedges are not walls which have stone all the way through, but are rather an earth bank faced with stone. Devon style Devon hedge atop earth banks faced with stone In Devon, hedgelaying is usually referred to as steeping. The pleachers are known as steepers. They are held in place by crooks (forked sticks driven into the centre of the hedgebank). The two sides of the hedge are steeped separately (as long as the hedge is big enough) leaving a gap through the centre of the hedge. When steeping is finished any eroded soil is cast up on top of the hedge to retain a good height of bank. In this context, the word hedge derives from an earlier one meaning bank ‚Äì i.e. the division between strips in the medieval farming system. The association comes from the time when after the 18th century enclosures each man had to dig a ditch as his boundary and pile the soil spoil on his side of the ditch. He then had to plant bushes in order to keep his animals on his own land. This 'digging down and stocking up' was very hard work and as a result when creating internal boundaries, the ditch was often left out but the result was still called a hedge. Typical features of the style are: * Steepers tight to the top of the bank. * Steepers secured by crooks. * Steepers along the crown (top of the face) of the bank. Cornish style Cornish hedges atop high banks beside a lane The shrubs are laid along the top of an earth bank faced with stones. Frequently the stones are set in herringbone style. Not all Cornish hedges have shrubs on top of the bank. =Motorway style= A modern style described first in the TCV Hedging Handbook as \\"motorway style\\" has been developed. This style dispenses with heathering and, with a post and rail fence on the field side behind it, does not need to be stockproof. Often stakes are dispensed with as well, almost all the brush trimmed off, the pleachers cut short and then laid low into the post and rail fence. Modern hedges also tend to leave more trees as standards within the hedge. There is also emerging interest in reviving older methods of using live stakes (crop and pleach style). Outside the British Isles Typical field boundary of red beech hedging (Fagus sylvatica) in the North Eifel in Germany =Netherlands= In parts of the Netherlands hedgelaying is practised, with styles distinct to that country. With all Dutch styles no stakes or bindings are used. One of every three or four standards is left tall and are laid back over the hedge. This dies off and forms a temporary way of holding the hedge in place for a year or two until it becomes re- established.https://www.flickr.com/photos/dave-perry/sets/72157603336893186/ Dave Perry's photographs of a hedgelaying competition in Boxmeer, 2006 The Netherlands is the only country outside the UK and Ireland to have competitive hedgelaying. = Germany = In the exposed uplands of the Eifel mountains, a particular type of hedgelaying has been employed since the 17th century that makes use of the characteristics of red beech to shield domestic housing and also to protect fields from damage by cattle and wind erosion and drying. This area around the town of Monschau is known as the Monschau Hedge Land and has become a recognised cultural landscape. =Australia= The skill is re- emerging in Australia, particularly in Tasmania. In more temperate parts of Australia the English settlers in the nineteenth century planted hedges of English hawthorn. They also took with them the skill of hedgelaying. Although hedgelaying then died out, many hedges survived, and there is now new interest in their conservation. =British emigrants= Since the influx of the British settling on mainland Europe, the occasional hedgelayer has taken the skill of hedge-laying with them. Although mostly similar to the practical and swiftly worked Isle of Wight style, occasional examples of a laid hedge can be seen on the continent. However regular management is rare, and very few hedgerows are managed in a way sympathetic to the hedgelayer.

It consists of seven members‚Äîthe chief justice and six justices. Five members are chosen from five districts around the state to foster geographic diversity and two are selected at-large. The justices are appointed by the governor to set terms that do not exceed six years. Immediately after appointment, the initial term is three years or less, because the justices must appear on the ballot in the next general election that occurs more than one year after their appointment. Afterward they serve six-year terms and remain in office if retained in the general election near the end of each term. Citizens vote on whether they want to retain each justice in office, or not.Florida's Legal & Judicial System Guide to Florida Law Chief justices are elected by the members of the Court to two-year terms that end in every even- numbered year. Chief justices can succeed themselves in office if re-elected by the other justices. The chief justice also can appoint judges to temporary duty on the Court if one or more of the justices are unable to hear a case for any reason. These temporary justices are called \\"associate justices\\" and usually are chosen on a rotating basis from presiding judges of Florida's district courts of appeal. They usually sit only for a single case. Unlike the U.S. Supreme Court, the term \\"associate justice\\" is never used to describe the sitting Florida justices. The Court is the final arbiter of Florida law, and its decisions are binding authority for all other Florida state courts and for federal courts when they apply Florida law. In most instances, the only appeal from the Florida Supreme Court is to the U.S. Supreme Court on questions of federal law. Established upon statehood in 1845, the court is headquartered across Duval Street from the state capitol in Tallahassee. Throughout the court's history it has undergone many reorganizations as Florida's population has grown. As of October 2020, the chief justice and justices of the Supreme Court each receive a salary of $227,218. History After Florida's entrance into the union in 1845, and the ratification of the state's first Constitution, the Supreme Court of the State of Florida was born. It is the successor to the Florida Territorial Court of Appeals and the court system that existed under Spain prior to the acquisition of Florida through the Adams-Onis Treaty. Though the constitution created a Supreme Court, it vested it with no judges and little power. Florida Circuit Court judges served in the capacity of Supreme Court justices until 1851 when an 1848 constitutional amendment took effect granting the state legislature power to choose three justices.The Florida Supreme Court ‚Äì About the Court Supreme Court of Florida In 1853, another constitutional amendment was adopted that provided for the popular election of justices to serve six-year terms. Following the Civil War and the adoption of the 1868 Constitution, justices were appointed by the governor and confirmed by the State Senate. In 1885, the state returned to elected justices. In 1940, the court's membership was finally increased to its current size of seven members, and a 1926 constitutional amendment provided that the chief justice should be elected by the justices of the Court. A two- year term for the chief justice was established by the Rules of Court adopted by the Supreme Court, with each term beginning on July 1 of even-numbered years and ending on June 30 in the next even-numbered year. In the early 1970s, more than half the justices resigned over various corruption probes.Judges, with Hat in Hand; by the Editorial Board, 19 January 2015, New York Times In 1975, Florida Supreme Court justice David L. McCain tampered with a lower court decision on behalf of campaign supporters. Faced with impeachment proceedings, he resigned. In 1976, the state returned to appointed justices when the current merit retention system was put in place. In 2004, the court had a backlog of 1,544 cases. In 2011, there was a backlog of 881 cases. PowersJurisdiction= The front exterior of the Florida Supreme Court Building in Tallahassee, Florida, in 2011. The jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of Florida is laid out in Article V of the Florida Constitution. The Court follows the common law and since its first case, Stewart v. Preston (1846), has published its opinions, first in official law reports called the Florida Reports and more recently in the Southern Series edited by West Publishing. The Supreme Court of Florida has appellate jurisdiction that is discretionary (cases the Court may choose to hear if it wishes) in most cases and mandatory (cases the court must hear) in a few cases. In some matters, the Court has original jurisdiction, meaning that the case can begin and end in the Supreme Court absent a basis for further appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States. The Court also has some forms of exclusive jurisdiction, meaning that it is the only court or government body that can decide the issue.The Operation and Jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of Florida Nova Law Review. Nova Southeastern University. Mandatory jurisdiction The Florida Constitution, Article V, (3)(b)(1), establishes mandatory jurisdiction for the following: * Cases in which the death penalty is imposed (but solely to review findings of lower courts on the law, not on the facts). In such instances, the Florida Supreme Court directly reviews Florida Circuit Court decisions, skipping the intermediate Florida District Courts of Appeal (DCAs). * Decisions by the DCAs declaring invalid a state statute or constitutional provision. * The Florida Constitution, Article V, (3)(b)(2), permits the Florida Legislature to provide for mandatory jurisdiction in the following two circumstances (the legislature has so provided): ** For final judgments on proceedings for validation of bonds or certificates of indebtedness. Here again, the Florida Supreme Court directly reviews circuit court decisions. ** For review of action of statewide agencies relating to rates or service of electric, gas, and telephone utilities. Discretionary jurisdiction The Florida Constitution, Article V, (3)(b)(3‚Äì5), provides discretionary jurisdiction for a much larger set of circumstances, including: * DCA decisions expressly declaring a state statute or constitutional provision to be valid (as opposed to invalid, which as stated above places the appellate court decision under mandatory jurisdiction) * DCA decisions that expressly affects a class of constitutional/state officers * DCA decisions that expressly and directly conflict with the decision of another DCA or of the Florida Supreme Court (including decisions that the DCA certifies to be in conflict with an opinion of another DCA) * DCA decisions that the DCA certifies, or orders or judgments of trial courts certified by a DCA in which appeal is pending, to be of \\"great public importance\\", or to have a great effect on the proper administration of justice throughout the state, and certified to require immediate resolution by the Supreme Court * Questions of law certified by the Supreme Court of the United States or a United States court of appeals as determinative of a cause before them, for which there is no controlling precedent by the Florida Supreme Court. Original nonexclusive jurisdiction The Florida Constitution further grants the Supreme Court original nonexclusive jurisdiction over certain matters. \\"Original\\" means that the case can begin and end in the state Supreme Court absent a basis for further appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. \\"Nonexclusive\\" means that these matters do not absolutely have to begin in the Supreme Court, but also could originate in a lower court. The bulk of matters falling within this category often are called the \\"extraordinary writs\\" and include habeas corpus, mandamus, quo warranto, and the writ of prohibition. Exclusive jurisdiction Finally, the Supreme Court has exclusive jurisdiction over some other matters. \\"Exclusive\\" means that the Florida Supreme Court is the only court or governmental body that can resolve the issue. This category includes regulation of the Florida Bar, regulation of admissions to the Bar, creating and amending the Florida Rules of Court, and determining whether the governor is incapacitated and thus unable to fulfill the duties of office. It also includes two forms of jurisdiction to issue advisory opinions. The Court can provide an advisory opinion upon a request by the governor to address uncertainties about legal issues involving the executive branch's powers. It also can issue advisory opinions to the Florida Attorney General about citizens' initiatives to amend the state Constitution. However, for this last type of advisory opinion, the Court only determines whether the citizens' initiative meets two legal requirements: its ballot summary fairly advises the voters of its effect; and it only contains a single subject. A negative advisory opinion removes non-conforming initiatives from the ballot. =Duties= The Supreme Court also has the duty to review legislative redistricting after each decennial Census. After the Florida Legislature enacts a joint resolution reapportioning the State House and Senate, the plan is presented to the Supreme Court on a petition filed by the Florida Attorney General. The Supreme Court's review of an apportionment plan created by the Legislature is guided by several standards specified in the Constitution, including new ones added to the Constitution by the voters in 2010 that prohibit gerrymandering. If the Legislature fails to initially pass a reapportionment plan or fails to enact a remedial plan after its primary plan is rejected by the Supreme Court, then the Court has the duty to apportion the State. The Supreme Court also has the authority to impose discipline on state judges for ethical breaches, which can range from a public televised reprimand to removal from office. OrganizationComposition= Florida Supreme Court with bunting in 2019. The Court is composed of the chief justice and six justices, who all serve six-year staggered terms. The justices elect the chief justice from amongst themselves. Justices must be an elector (a qualified, registered voter) of the state and must have been a member in good standing of the Florida Bar for at least ten years. The Court must have at least one justice who resided in each of Florida's five lower appellate districts on the date of their appointment. Amendment 6 passed in 2018 raised the mandatory retirement age for justices to 75, effective July 1, 2019. =Operation= At least five justices must be present for the Court to carry out its official functions, and at least four justices must agree on decisions issued by the Court. The chief justice can assign judges of the lower courts to serve as temporary justices (called \\"associate justices\\" under Florida Rules of Court) if the need arises. Under the Court's Internal Operations Procedures Manual, the appointment of associate justices rotates among the chief judges of the district courts of appeal in their numerical order, from one to five, and then starts over again. The intent behind this procedure is to eliminate any concern that temporary associate justices are appointed because of their personal views on legal issues. The Court holds two terms each year, with the first commencing on the first day of January and the second beginning on the first day of July. =Appointment, retention and impeachment= A relatively complex appointment process (a modified form of the \\"Missouri Plan\\") is set forth in the Florida Constitution, which requires the creation of a Judicial Nominating Commission composed of persons appointed to staggered four-year terms, representing various interests. The commission must submit to the governor of Florida between three and six names for each vacancy on the court, from which the governor selects the new justice. The governor's selection is final and requires no further approval by any governmental body. Up until 1971 when merit selection was implemented, judges were chosen by direct election of the people. In 1974, Justice Ben Overton became the first Supreme Court justice chosen by merit selection. Justices must meet three requirements to qualify for appointment to the Court: they must be an elector (a qualified, registered voter) of the state, they must reside in the territorial jurisdiction of the state when they assume office, and they must be under 75 years of age. After appointment, the new justice must face statewide voters in the next general election that is more than one year after the date of initial appointment. In this \\"merit retention\\" election, voters decide only if the new justice will remain in office. If not retained in office, the governor appoints a replacement through the same Judicial Nominating Commission process. After this first merit retention election, justices face the voters in the same type of merit retention election every six years thereafter until they leave or reach retirement age.Public Information ‚Äì Florida's State Court System Supreme Court of Florida Following a constitutional amendment passed by referendum in November 2018, mandatory retirement for Florida Supreme Court justices occurs upon reaching age 75.Crime_Victims_Rights,_Judicial_Retirement_Age,_and_Judicial_Interpretation_of_Laws_and_Rules_Amendment_(2018) The Florida Constitution states, \\"No justice or judge shall serve after attaining the age of seventy-five years except upon temporary assignment.\\"Article 5, Section 8, Florida Constitution They thus must retire on the date of their 75th birthdays if still in office at that time.Florida Supreme Court official website Justices may be removed by one of two methods. They can be disciplined upon the recommendation of the Judicial Qualifications Commission, at which time the Court may remove a justice or impose a lesser penalty such as a fine or reprimand; and justices may be impeached by a two- thirds vote of the Florida House of Representatives and convicted by a two- thirds vote of the Senate.Methods of Judicial Selection ‚Äì Removal of Judges American Judicature Society =Justices= Florida Supreme Court justices in 2019 under Chief Justice Charles Canady. Notable cases and precedentState and local cases= Close-up view of satellite trucks parked at the Florida State Capitol near the Florida Supreme Court during the 2000 presidential election vote dispute In 1999, a dissenting opinion by Justice Leander J. Shaw Jr. sparked a worldwide debate over the use of Old Sparky, Florida's electric chair, which helped lead to events that caused the Florida Legislature to adopt lethal injection as the state's method of execution only a few months later. In 2004, the Court struck down another piece of legislation from the Florida Legislature that was designed to reverse a lower court decision in the Terri Schiavo case. In 2006, the Court struck down a law passed by the Florida Legislature that had created the first statewide education voucher program in the United States. That same year in Engle v. Liggett Group, it also ordered decertification of a class action lawsuit against big tobacco companies that effectively reversed the largest punitive damage jury award, $145 billion, in U.S. history. In 2013, Governor Rick Scott signed the Timely Justice Act (HB 7101) which overhauled the processes for capital punishment. The United States Supreme Court struck down part of this law in January 2016 in Hurst v. Florida, declaring that a judge determining the aggravating facts to be used in considering a death sentence with only a non-binding recommendation from the jury based on a majority vote was insufficient and violated the Sixth Amendment guarantee of a jury trial. The Florida Legislature passed a new statute to comply with the judgement in March 2016, changing the sentencing method to require a 10-juror supermajority for a sentence of death with a life sentence as the alternative. This new sentencing scheme was struck down by the Florida Supreme Court in a ruling 5‚Äì2 in October 2016, which held that a death sentence must be issued by a unanimous jury. The United States Supreme Court later left this decision undisturbed. Governor Scott in early 2017 signed a new law requiring a unanimous jury. =2000 presidential election= In the 2000 presidential election controversy, the Supreme Court of the United States overturned the Florida Supreme Court after it had ordered a statewide recount.

He is the co- founder of the Madonna House Apostolate, and later ordained a priest in the Melkite Greek Catholic Church. Life and career Eddie Doherty was born in Chicago in 1890 to Police Lieutenant Edward Doherty and Ellen Rodgers. He was the eldest of ten children in the Irish Catholic family. At the age of 13 he entered a Servite monastery in Wisconsin. After two years he left the seminary, returned to Chicago, and went to work at the City Press.Hollingsworth, Gerelyn, \\"On this day: Eddie Doherty\\", National Catholic Reporter, May 4, 2011 Starting as a newspaper copy boy, Doherty worked at various other Chicago newspapers, including the Examiner, the Record-Herald, the Tribune, the Herald, and the American. It was at the American that he began writing columns. He married his childhood sweetheart, Marie Ryan, on December 15, 1914. His wife died in the 1918 flu epidemic, leaving him with a baby son. In his sorrow, Doherty left the Church. The following summer he married his second wife, Mildred Frisby, on July 16, 1919. Doherty had a second son, Jack Jim. Back at the Tribune, he helped establish the Joseph Medill School of Journalism. Eddie Doherty and his wife and two children moved west, and started working for the Chicago Tribune's Hollywood bureau. He \\"made his reputation initially covering such scandals as the Wallace Reid case and the Fatty Arbuckle trial\\". The News' trucks and billboards proclaimed him \\"The Star Reporter of America\\"; The Mirror \\"billed him as America's Highest Paid Reporter\\". In 1939, Mildred died in a freak accident (from a fall) while out for a walk alone.Doherty, Eddie.

This time, however, Doherty found peace for his grieving in returning to the Catholic Church. In 1940, Doherty met Baroness Catherine de Hueck at her Friendship House mission while doing a story on Harlem. Their friendship turned to romance, and they wed on June 25, 1943. In 1944, Doherty's screenplay for the World War II film The Sullivans was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Story. Meanwhile, the staff at Friendship House did not take well to Catherine's marriage to Doherty, and complained that Catherine no longer lived in celibacy as they were required to do. This and other differences eventually led to Eddie and Catherine moving to Combermere, Ontario, Canada and starting a new apostolate called Madonna House in 1947. Here they founded their own newspaper, Restoration, which has remained in continuous circulation. In 1969, Doherty obtained permission to transfer from the Latin Church to the Byzantine Rite Melkite Greek Catholic Church (which allows married men to become priests), and on August 15, 1969, Doherty was ordained a Catholic priest at the age of seventy-eight by Archbishop Joseph Raya. In 1975, after a period of ill-health and surgery, Doherty slipped into a coma. He died the next day, on May 4, 1975.

He was widely known for his book Custer Died for Your Sins: An Indian Manifesto (1969), which helped attract national attention to Native American issues in the same year as the Alcatraz-Red Power Movement. From 1964 to 1967, he had served as executive director of the National Congress of American Indians, increasing tribal membership from 19 to 156. Beginning in 1977, he was a board member of the National Museum of the American Indian, which now has buildings in both New York City and Washington, DC. Deloria began his academic career in 1970 at Western Washington State College at Bellingham, Washington. He became Professor of Political Science at the University of Arizona (1978‚Äì1990), where he established the first master's degree program in American Indian Studies in the United States. In 1990, Deloria taught at the University of Colorado Boulder until 2000, when he returned to Arizona and taught at the College of Law. Background and education Vine Deloria Jr. was born in 1933, in Martin, South Dakota, near the Oglala Lakota Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. He was the son of Barbara Sloat (n√©e Eastburn) and Vine Victor Deloria Sr. (1901‚Äì1990). His father studied English and Christian theology and became an Episcopal archdeacon and missionary on the Standing Rock Indian Reservation.Wishart, 60 His father transferred his and his children's tribal membership from the Yankton Sioux to Standing Rock. Vine Sr.'s sister Ella Deloria (1881‚Äì1971) was an anthropologist.Wishart, 59 Vine Jr.'s paternal grandfather was Tipi Sapa (Black Lodge), also known as the Rev. Philip Joseph Deloria, an Episcopal priest and a leader of the Yankton band of the Dakota Nation. His paternal grandmother was Mary Sully, daughter of Alfred Sully, a general in the American Civil War and Indian Wars and his French-Yankton wife; and granddaughter of painter Thomas Sully. Deloria was first educated at reservation schools, then graduated from Kent School in 1951. He graduated from Iowa State University in 1958 with a degree in general science.Johnson, Kirk. \\"Vine Deloria Jr., Champion of Indian Rights, Dies at 72.\\" New York Times. November 15, 2005 (retrieved Aug 26, 2009) Deloria served in the Marines from 1954 through 1956.Lorenz, Melissa. Vine Deloria Jr., EMuseum @ Minnesota State University, Mankato. 2008 (Archived copy retrieved April 19, 2015) Originally planning to be a minister like his father, Deloria in 1963 earned a theology degree from the Lutheran School of Theology at Chicago, then located in Rock Island, Illinois. In the late 1960s, he returned to graduate study and earned a J.D. degree from University of Colorado Law School in 1970. Activism In 1964, Deloria was elected executive director of the National Congress of American Indians. During his three-year term, the organization went from bankruptcy to solvency, and membership went from 19 to 156 tribes.Wilkinson, 107 Through the years, he was involved with many Native American organizations. Beginning in 1977, he was a board member of the National Museum of the American Indian, which established its first center at the former United States Custom House in New York City. While teaching at Western Washington State College at Bellingham, Washington, Deloria advocated for the treaty fishing rights of local Native American tribes. He worked on the legal case that led to the historic Boldt Decision of the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington. Judge Boldt's ruling in United States v. Washington (1974) validated Indian fishing rights in the state as continuing past the tribes' cession of millions of acres of land to the United States in the 1850s. Thereafter Native Americans had the right to half the catch in fishing in the state. Writing In 1969, Deloria published his first of more than twenty books, entitled Custer Died for Your Sins: An Indian Manifesto. This book became one of Deloria's most famous works. In it, he addressed stereotypes of Indians and challenged white audiences to take a new look at the history of United States western expansion, noting its abuses of Native Americans.Wilkinson, 108. The book was released the year that students of the Alcatraz-Red Power Movement occupied Alcatraz Island to seek construction of an Indian cultural center, as well as attention in gaining justice on Indian issues, including recognition of tribal sovereignty. Other groups also gained momentum, with organizations such as the American Indian Movement staging events to attract media and public attention for education. The book helped draw attention to the Native American struggle. Focused on the Native American goal of sovereignty without political and social assimilation, the book stood as a hallmark of Native American Self-Determination at the time. The American Anthropological Association sponsored a panel in response to Custer Died for Your Sins. The book was reissued in 1988 with a new preface by the author, noting, \\"The Indian world has changed so substantially since the first publication of this book that some things contained in it seem new again.\\" Deloria wrote and edited many subsequent books and 200 articles, focusing on issues as they related to Native Americans, such as education and religion. In 1995, Deloria argued in his book Red Earth, White Lies that the Bering Strait Land Bridge never existed, and that the ancestors of the Native Americans had not migrated to the Americas over such a land bridge, as has been the predominant theory among archaeologists and anthropologists. Rather, he asserted that the Native Americans may have originated in the Americas, or reached them through transoceanic travel, as some of their creation stories suggested. Deloria's position on the age of certain geological formations, the length of time Native Americans have been in the Americas, their possible coexistence with dinosaurs, etc. were influential in the development of American Indian defenses against scientific racism. Deloria controversially rejected many of the most common scientific explanations, not only of the origins of indigenous peoples in the Americas, but other aspects of history that contradict Native American accounts.Jenkins, Philip Dream Catchers: How Mainstream America Discovered Native Spirituality, OUP USA (November 24, 2005) . p. 233.O'Leary, Denyse. By Design or by Chance in the Universe: The Growing Controversy on the Origins of Life, Augsburg Fortress (August 3, 2004) p. 155 Deloria argued that mainstream scientists are virtually incapable of independent thinking and are hobbled by their reverence for orthodoxy. He wrote that scientists characteristically persecute those who dare to advance unorthodox views, and that science is thus essentially a religion. Deloria was criticized for his embrace of American Indian traditional histories by anthropologist Bernard Ortiz de Montellano and English professor H. David Brumble, who say such views are not supported by the scientific and physical evidence, and contribute to problems of pseudoscience.Bernard Ortiz de Montellano. \\"Post-Modern Multiculturalism and Scientific Illiteracy\\", APS (American Physical Society) News, January 1998, Vol 7, No. 1 Deloria often cited American Indian creation accounts and oral traditions in support of his views relating to science. He also cited the views of Hindu creationist Michael Cremo.Deloria's critics on this issue include: Bruce Thornton, Plagues of the Mind: The New Epidemic of False Knowledge, ISI Books, 1999.; H. David Brumble, \\"Vine Deloria Jr., Creationism, and Ethnic Pseudoscience\\", American Literary History 1998 10(2):335‚Äì346; George Johnson, \\"Indian Tribes' Creationists Thwart Archeologists\\", New York Times, October 22, 1996; John C. Whittaker. \\"Red Earth, White Lies: Native Americas and the Myth of Scientific Fact\\", book review in The Skeptical Inquirer, Jan‚ÄìFeb 1997 Nicholas Peroff wrote that \\"Deloria has rarely missed a chance to argue that the realities of precontact American Indian experience and tradition cannot be recognized or understood within any conceptual framework built on the theories of modern science. And in fact, it is certainly true that no one, with or without the aid of scientific theories and concepts, can, in any absolute meaning of the word, know what life was like as a member of the Menominee Tribe six hundred years ago. But we can imagine what it was like.\\" Academic career In 1970, Deloria took his first faculty position, teaching at the Western Washington University College of Ethnic Studies in Bellingham, Washington. As a visiting scholar, he taught at the Pacific School of Religion, the New School of Religion and Colorado College. From 1972 to 1974 he also taught at the University of California, Los Angeles. His first tenured position was as Professor of Political Science at the University of Arizona, which he held from 1978 to 1990. While at UA, Deloria established the first master's degree program in American Indian Studies in the United States. Such recognition of American Indian culture in existing institutions was one of the goals of the Alcatraz-Red Power Movement. Numerous American Indian studies programs, museums and collections, and other institutions have been established since Deloria's first book was published. Deloria next taught at the University of Colorado Boulder from 1990 to 2000.\\"Vine Deloria Jr., Renowned Author And American Indian Leader, Dies At 72.\\" University of Colorado at Boulder News Center.

Salmeron was born in S√£o Paulo. He did his undergraduate studies in electrical engineering at the Escola Polit√©cnica da Universidade de S√£o Paulo, in S√£o Paulo, and in physics in the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (then named Universidade do Brasil), in Rio de Janeiro. From 1947 to 1950, he worked as researcher and physics instructor at the Escola Polit√©cnica and in the Department of Physics of the Faculty of Philosophy, Sciences and Letters of the University of S√£o Paulo, where he studied cosmic radiation under Italian physicists Gleb Wataghin and Giuseppe Occhialini. From 1950 to 1953, Salmeron worked at the recently created Centro Brasileiro de Pesquisas F√≠sicas (Brazilian Center of Physical Research) in Rio. In S√£o Paulo and Rio, Salmeron was contemporary of a brilliant generation of young Brazilian physicists, such as C√©sar Lattes, Jos√© Leite Lopes, Oscar Sala, M√°rio Schenberg, Marcelo Damy de Souza Santos and Jayme Tiomno. From 1953 onwards, Salmeron lived in Europe, first doing his Ph.D. from 1953 to 1955 at the University of Manchester, under Patrick Blackett, Nobel Prize winner of Physics, and then as an associate researcher in the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN), in Geneva, Switzerland, from 1955 to 1963. In 1963, Salmeron returned to Brazil and accepted a post as professor of physics in the newly created Universidade de Bras√≠lia. Unfortunately, the military dictatorship repressed strongly the faculty with liberal and leftist ideas and he joined 223 other professors in protest, who resigned from the University in October 1965. In 1966 Salmeron left definitely Brazil and went to work in Europe at CERN again, where he had an important role in experiments attempting to discover the quark‚Äìgluon plasma. Afterwards (1967) he worked at the √âcole Polytechnique in Paris, France, one of the most important schools of engineering in the world.

Many types of calipers permit reading out a measurement on a ruled scale, a dial, or a digital display. Some calipers can be as simple as a compass with inward or outward-facing points, but no scale. The tips of the caliper are adjusted to fit across the points to be measured and the dimension read by measuring between the tips with another measuring tool, such as a ruler. It is used in many fields such as mechanical engineering, metalworking, forestry, woodworking, science and medicine.  Plural vs. singular  A single tool might be referred to as a \\"caliper\\" or as \\"calipers\\", like a pair of scissors or glasses (a \\"plural only\\" or plurale tantum form). In colloquial usage the phrase \\"pair of verniers\\" or just \\"vernier\\" might refer to a vernier caliper. Colloquially these phrases can also refer to dial calipers, although they involve no vernier scale. In machine-shop usage, the term \\"caliper\\" is often used in contradistinction to \\"micrometer\\", even though outside micrometers are technically a form of caliper. In this usage, \\"caliper\\" implies only the form factor of the vernier or dial caliper (or its digital counterpart). History The earliest caliper has been found in the Greek Giglio wreck near the Italian coast. The ship find dates to the 6th century BC. The wooden piece already featured a fixed and a movable jaw.Mensun Bound: The Giglio wreck: a wreck of the Archaic period (c. 600 BC) off the Tuscany island of Giglio, Hellenic Institute of Marine Archaeology, Athens 1991, pp. 27 and 31 (Fig. 65)Roger B.

Although rare finds, calipers remained in use by the Greeks and Romans.\\"hand tool.\\" Encyclop√¶dia Britannica from Encyclop√¶dia Britannica 2006 Ultimate Reference Suite DVD. [Accessed July 29, 2008] A bronze caliper, dating from 9 AD, was used for minute measurements during the Chinese Xin dynasty. The caliper had an inscription stating that it was \\"made on the gui-you day, the first day of the first month of the first year of Shijianguo .\\" The calipers included a \\"slot and pin\\" and \\"graduated in inches and tenths of an inch.\\". An abridged version. Caliper with graduated bow 0‚Äì10 mm The modern vernier caliper was invented by Pierre Vernier, as an improvement of the nonius of Pedro Nunes. Types Inside caliper = Two inside calipers The inside calipers are used to measure the internal size of an object. * The upper caliper in the image (at the right) requires manual adjustment prior to fitting. Fine setting of this caliper type is performed by tapping the caliper legs lightly on a handy surface until they will almost pass over the object. A light push against the resistance of the central pivot screw then spreads the legs to the correct dimension and provides the required, consistent feel that ensures a repeatable measurement. * The lower caliper in the image has an adjusting screw that permits it to be carefully adjusted without removal of the tool from the workpiece. =Outside caliper= Three outside calipers. Outside calipers are used to measure the external size of an object. The same observations and technique apply to this type of caliper, as for the above inside caliper. With some understanding of their limitations and usage, these instruments can provide a high degree of accuracy and repeatability. They are especially useful when measuring over very large distances; consider if the calipers are used to measure a large diameter pipe. A vernier caliper does not have the depth capacity to straddle this large diameter while at the same time reach the outermost points of the pipe's diameter. They are made from high carbon steel. =Divider caliper= A pair of dividers In the metalworking field, a divider caliper, popularly called a compass, is used in the process of marking out locations. The points are sharpened so that they act as scribers; one leg can then be placed in the dimple created by a center or prick punch and the other leg pivoted so that it scribes a line on the workpiece's surface, thus forming an arc or circle. A divider caliper is also used to measure a distance between two points on a map. The two caliper's ends are brought to the two points whose distance is being measured. The caliper's opening is then either measured on a separate ruler and then converted to the actual distance, or it is measured directly on a scale drawn on the map. On a nautical chart the distance is often measured on the latitude scale appearing on the sides of the map: one minute of arc of along any great circle, as for example, any longitude meridian, is approximately one nautical mile or 1852 metres. Dividers are also used in the medical profession. An ECG (also EKG) caliper transfers distance on an electrocardiogram; in conjunction with the appropriate scale, the heart rate can be determined. A pocket caliper version was invented by cardiologist Robert A. Mackin.http://www.mackinmfg.com/ =Oddleg caliper= Oddleg calipers Oddleg calipers, Hermaphrodite calipers, or Oddleg jennys, as pictured on the left, are generally used to scribe a line at a set distance from the edge of a workpiece. The bent leg is used to run along the workpiece edge while the scriber makes its mark at a predetermined distance, this ensures a line parallel to the edge. In the diagram at left, the uppermost caliper has a slight shoulder in the bent leg allowing it to sit on the edge more securely, the lower caliper lacks this feature but has a renewable scriber that can be adjusted for wear, as well as being replaced when excessively worn. =Vernier caliper= thumbnone600px Diagram of Vernier calipers. The labeled parts are The calipers in the diagram show a primary reading on the metric scale of about 2.475 cm (2.4 cm read from the main scale plus about 0.075 cm from the Vernier scale). Calipers often have a \\"zero point error\\", which is when the calipers do not read 0.000 cm when the jaws are closed. The zero point error must always be subtracted from the primary reading. Let us assume these calipers have a zero point error of 0.013 cm. This would give us a length reading of 2.462 cm. For any measurement, reporting the error on the measurement is also important. Both the primary reading and the zero point reading are bounded by plus/minus half the length corresponding to the width of the smallest interval on the Vernier scale (0.0025 cm). These are \\"absolute\\" errors and absolute errors add, so the length reading is then bounded by plus/minus the length corresponding to the full width of the smallest interval on the Vernier scale (0.005 cm). Assuming no systematics affect the measurement (the instrument works perfectly), a complete measurement would then read 2.462 cm ¬± 0.005 cm. The vernier, dial, and digital calipers give a direct reading of the distance measured with high accuracy and precision. They are functionally identical, with different ways of reading the result. These calipers comprise a calibrated scale with a fixed jaw, and another jaw, with a pointer, that slides along the scale. The distance between the jaws is then read in different ways for the three types. The simplest method is to read the position of the pointer directly on the scale. When the pointer is between two markings, the user can mentally interpolate to improve the precision of the reading. This would be a simple calibrated caliper; but the addition of a vernier scale allows more accurate interpolation, and is the universal practice; this is the vernier caliper. Vernier, dial, and digital calipers can measure internal dimensions (using the uppermost jaws in the picture at right), external dimensions using the pictured lower jaws, and in many cases depth by the use of a probe that is attached to the movable head and slides along the centre of the body. This probe is slender and can get into deep grooves that may prove difficult for other measuring tools. The vernier scales may include metric measurements on the lower part of the scale and inch measurements on the upper, or vice versa, in countries that use inches. Vernier calipers commonly used in industry provide a precision to 0.01 mm (10 micrometres), or one thousandth of an inch. They are available in sizes that can measure up to 1828 mm (72 in). =Dial caliper= TESA dial caliper Instead of using a vernier mechanism, which requires some practice to use, the dial caliper reads the final fraction of a millimeter or inch on a simple dial. In this instrument, a small, precise rack and pinion drives a pointer on a circular dial, allowing direct reading without the need to read a vernier scale. Typically, the pointer rotates once every inch, tenth of an inch, or 1 millimeter. This measurement must be added to the coarse whole inches or centimeters read from the slide. The dial is usually arranged to be rotatable beneath the pointer, allowing for \\"differential\\" measurements (the measuring of the difference in size between two objects, or the setting of the dial using a master object and subsequently being able to read directly the plus- or-minus variance in size of subsequent objects relative to the master object). The slide of a dial caliper can usually be locked at a setting using a small lever or screw; this allows simple go/no-go checks of part sizes. =Digital caliper= Digital caliper A popular refinement replaces the analog dial with an electronic digital display that displays the reading as a numeric value. Rather than a rack and pinion, these calipers use a linear encoder. Some digital calipers can be switched between centimeters or millimeters, and inches. All provide for zeroing the display at any point along the slide, allowing the same sort of differential measurements as with the dial caliper. Digital calipers may contain a \\"reading hold\\" feature, allowing the reading of dimensions after use in awkward locations where the display cannot be seen. Ordinary 6-in/150-mm digital calipers are made of stainless steel, have a rated accuracy of 0.001 in (0.02mm) and a resolution of 0.0005 in (0.01 mm). The same technology is used to make longer 8-in and 12-in calipers; the accuracy for longer measurements declines to 0.001 in (0.03 mm) for 100‚Äì200 mm and 0.0015 in (0.04 mm) for 200‚Äì300 mm. Increasingly, digital calipers offer a serial data output to allow them to be interfaced with a dedicated recorder or a personal computer. The digital interface significantly decreases the time to make and record a series of measurements, and it also improves the reliability of the records. A suitable device to convert the serial data output to common computer interfaces such as RS-232, Universal Serial Bus, or wireless can be built or purchased. With such a converter, measurements can be directly entered into a spreadsheet, a statistical process control program, or similar software. The serial digital output varies among manufacturers. Common options are *Mitutoyo's Digimatic interface. This is the dominant name brand interface. Format is 52 bits arranged as 13 nibbles. *Sylvac interface. This is the common protocol for inexpensive, non-name brand, calipers. Format is 24 bit 90 kHz synchronous. *Starrett *Brown & Sharpe *Federal *Tesa *Aldi. Format is 7 BCD digits. *Mahr (Digimatic, RS232C, Wireless FM Radio, Infrared and USB) Like dial calipers, the slide of a digital caliper can usually be locked using a lever or thumb-screw. Some digital calipers contain a capacitive linear encoder. A pattern of bars is etched directly on the printed circuit board in the slider. Under the scale of the caliper another printed circuit board also contains an etched pattern of lines. The combination of these printed circuit boards forms two variable capacitors. The two capacitances are out of phase. As the slider moves the capacitance changes in a linear fashion and in a repeating pattern. The circuitry built into the slider counts the bars as the slider moves and does a linear interpolation based on the magnitudes of the capacitors to find the precise position of the slider. Other digital calipers contain an inductive linear encoder, which allows robust performance in the presence of contamination such as coolants. Magnetic linear encoders are used in yet other digital calipers. =Micrometer caliper= A caliper using a calibrated screw for measurement, rather than a slide, is called an external micrometer caliper gauge, a micrometer caliper or, more often, simply a micrometer. (Sometimes the term caliper, referring to any other type in this article, is held in contradistinction to micrometer.) Comparison Each of the above types of calipers has its relative merits and faults. Vernier calipers are rugged and have long lasting accuracy, are coolant proof, are not affected by magnetic fields, and are largely shock proof. They may have both centimeter and inch scales. However, vernier calipers require good eyesight or a magnifying glass to read and can be difficult to read from a distance or from awkward angles. It is relatively easy to misread the last digit. In production environments, reading vernier calipers all day long is error-prone and is annoying to the workers. Dial calipers are comparatively easy to read, especially when seeking exact center by rocking and observing the needle movement. They can be set to 0 at any point for comparisons. They are usually fairly susceptible to shock damage. They are also very prone to getting dirt in the gears, which can cause accuracy problems. Digital calipers switch easily between centimeter and inch systems. They can be set to 0 easily at any point with full count in either direction, and can take measurements even if the display is completely hidden, either by using a \\"hold\\" key, or by zeroing the display and closing the jaws, showing the correct measurement, but negative. They can be mechanically and electronically fragile. Most also require batteries, and do not resist coolant well. They are also only moderately shockproof, and can be vulnerable to dirt. Calipers may read to a resolution of 0.01 mm or 0.0005 in, but accuracy may not be better than about ¬±0.02 mm or 0.001 in for 150 mm (6 in) calipers, and worse for longer ones. Use Using the vernier caliper A biologist uses calipers to measure the length of a bird's leg A caliper must be properly applied against the part in order to take the desired measurement. For example, when measuring the thickness of a plate a vernier caliper must be held at right angles to the piece. Some practice may be needed to measure round or irregular objects correctly. Accuracy of measurement when using a caliper is highly dependent on the skill of the operator. Regardless of type, a caliper's jaws must be forced into contact with the part being measured. As both part and caliper are always to some extent elastic, the amount of force used affects the indication. A consistent, firm touch is correct. Too much force results in an underindication as part and tool distort; too little force gives insufficient contact and an overindication. This is a greater problem with a caliper incorporating a wheel, which lends mechanical advantage. This is especially the case with digital calipers, calipers out of adjustment, or calipers with a poor quality beam. Simple calipers are uncalibrated; the measurement taken must be compared against a scale. Whether the scale is part of the caliper or not, all analog calipers‚Äîverniers and dials‚Äîrequire good eyesight in order to achieve the highest precision. Digital calipers have the advantage in this area. Calibrated calipers may be mishandled, leading to loss of zero. When a calipers' jaws are fully closed, it should, of course, indicate zero. If it does not, it must be recalibrated or repaired. A vernier caliper does not easily lose its calibration but a sharp impact or accidental damage to the measuring surface in the caliper jaw can be significant enough to displace zero. Digital calipers have zero set buttons, for quick recalibration. Vernier, dial and digital calipers can be used with accessories that extend their usefulness. Examples are a base that extends their usefulness as a depth gauge and a jaw attachment that allows measuring the center distance between holes. Since the 1970s a clever modification of the moveable jaw on the back side of any caliper allows for step or depth measurements in addition to external caliper measurements, in similar fashion to a universal micrometer (e.g., Starrett Mul-T-Anvil or Mitutoyo Uni-Mike). Zero error When the jaws are closed and if the reading is 0.10 mm, the zero error is referred to as +0.10 mm. The method to use a vernier scale or caliper with zero error is to use the formula \\"(actual reading) = (main scale) + (vernier scale) ‚àí (zero error)\\", thus the actual reading is 19.00 + 0.54 ‚àí (0.10) = 19.44 mm. The resolution of the measurement, based on the width of the smallest sub-interval, is ¬±0.02 mm. The method to use a vernier scale or caliper with zero error is to use the formula \\"actual reading = main scale + vernier scale ‚àí (zero error)\\". Zero error may arise due to knocks that affect the calibration at 0.00 mm when the jaws are perfectly closed or just touching each other. Positive zero error refers to the fact that when the jaws of the vernier caliper are just closed, the reading is a positive reading away from the actual reading of 0.00 mm. If the reading is 0.10 mm, the zero error is referred to as +0.10 mm. Negative zero error refers to the fact that when the jaws of the vernier caliper are just closed, the reading is a negative reading away from the actual reading of 0.00 mm. If the reading is ‚àí0.08 mm, the zero error is referred to as ‚àí0.08 mm.

It was written while he was studying at Leeds University\\"Ng≈©gƒ© wa Thiong'o: A Grain of Wheat\\", themodernnovel.org. and first published in 1967 by Heinemann. The title is taken from the Gospel According to St. John, 12:24. The novel weaves together several stories set during the state of emergency in Kenya's struggle for independence (1952‚Äì59), focusing on the quiet Mugo, whose life is ruled by a dark secret. The plot revolves around his home village's preparations for Kenya's independence day celebration, Uhuru day. On that day, former resistance fighters General R and Koinandu plan on publicly executing the traitor who betrayed Kihika (a heroic resistance fighter hailing from the village). Plot summary The events of the novel take place in the days of 1963 before and on the day of Uhuru, Kenya‚Äôs liberation from British colonial rule. The novel also features flashbacks of the past. Mugo, an introverted villager of Thabai, does not want to give a speech at Uhuru, even though town elders ask him to. The village thinks him a hero for his stoicism and courage while he was in detention during Kenya‚Äôs State of Emergency, but he labors under a secret: he betrayed their beloved Mau Mau fighter, Kihika. He is restless and can achieve no peace in the village. Kihika had joined the Mau Mau as a young man and attained fame for capturing the police garrison at Mahee and killing the cruel District Officer (‚ÄòDO‚Äô) Robson, but after Mugo betrayed him in secret, he was captured and hanged. Those planning Uhuru want to honor him. Mugo had betrayed Kihika because he was unsettled by the young man‚Äôs zeal and because of the reward offered for his head, but as soon as he betrayed him he felt remorse. Most people, including General R. and Koina, two Mau Mau soldiers, believe Karanja was the one who betrayed Kihika. They plan on executing him at Uhuru. Mugo was not the only man from Thabai who spent time in detention camp. Gikonyo, a well-respected businessman and former carpenter, was also taken to a camp. Before the camp he was very much in love with his beautiful wife Mumbi, the sister of Kihika. He had won her love even though many, including Karanja, a friend of Kihika, sought her love as well. He dreamt of her while he was away, and was horrified to find out that Mumbi had borne a child by Karanja while he was gone those years. He does not believe they can ever repair their relationship, and he throws himself into his work. Karanja works at Githima, a Forest Research Station started by the British. He tries to cultivate the approval of the DO, Roger Thompson, who is stationed there with his wife Margery. Thompson was once destined for an illustrious career, but it was derailed by a hunger strike and violence at Rira, the camp where Mugo was. Now Thompson is at Githima, but is preparing to return to Britain because he does not want to be around when whites are no longer in charge. Karanja did not join the freedom movement but rather started to work for the whiteman, first joining the homeguard and then becoming Chief during the Emergency. This incurred a lot of resentment from people; however, Karanja was simply looking out for himself. Mumbi, distressed that her husband no longer loves her, comes to see Mugo. She confides in him the story of how she and Gikonyo fell in love, and how sad she was when he was away in camp. She only fell for Karanja‚Äôs advances when she heard Gikonyo was returning and became deliriously happy. She begs Mugo to come to Uhuru; on a second visit to him, she begs him again. Mugo becomes violent and says he betrayed Kihika. Mumbi is shocked, but she does not want any more blood shed for her brother. Uhuru arrives, the day first rainy and then sunny. People are joyful and all of them want to see Mugo, even though he has said he is not coming. There are games and speeches. There is also a spontaneous race, and Gikonyo and Karanja find themselves competing with each other (much as they competed in a race for Mumbi‚Äôs attention long ago). They stumble, though, and Gikonyo breaks his arm and has to go to the hospital. General R. gives a speech instead of Mugo and calls for the traitor to step forward, assuming it will be Karanja. Mugo comes out of the crowd and says it is he who did it; he feels a sense of freedom at first, quickly followed by terror. No one accosts him, and the confused crowd parts and lets him go. Later, General R. and Koina come to arrest him and tell him he will have a private trial. Mugo makes peace with this, deciding he will accept his punishment. Some of the village elders feel that Uhuru did not go well, and that there is something wrong. Karanja heads back to Githima. He is unhappy and considers killing himself in front of a train. Ultimately, he decides against this. Gikonyo wakes in the hospital and finds himself ready to make amends with Mumbi. When she visits him, he tells her he is ready to speak of the child he has assiduously ignored since he came back. She tells him it must wait until they can have a serious and heartfelt discussion of their wants and needs. He is happy, and plans to carve a stool featuring an image of a pregnant Mumbi. Characters *Mugo, a loner who became a hero after leading a hunger strike in a British concentration camp and trying to stop a village guard from beating a pregnant woman to death. Although he is thought to be a hero throughout the whole book, he is the traitor who betrayed Kihika to the British in the hope of collecting a reward. *Gikonyo, an ambitious carpenter and business man married to Mumbi. He confessed to taking the oath of the resistance while in a concentration camp, securing an early release only to find that his wife had borne a child with his hated rival Karanja while he was away. *Mumbi, the wife of Gikonyo and sister of Kihika. While Gikonyo was imprisoned she slept with Karanja, who had been appointed village chief by the colonial power. *Karanja, a collaborator with the British and widely suspected to be the traitor. *Kihika, a resistance fighter who conquered a police station and killed the hated District Officer Robson.

Major ThemesColonialism and its Legacies= Kenya was colonized by the British in 1895 and was not independent until 1963. In the subsequent years the country struggled to negotiate a post-colonial reality in which the divisions caused by political and economic oppression, the Emergency, violence, racism, exploitation of rivalry and competition amongst Kenyans, and psychological trauma endured and deepened. Even though Ngugi does not take his readers into the days after colonialism, he hints at the difficulties the characters will face. Thompson's claim that Africa will always need Europe may not be true in the sense he wishes it to be, but it is prescient in that Europe's involvement in the region can never fully be erased. Finally, on a more personal level, all of the characters' lives are affected by colonialism, whether they are in detention camps or the Movement or losing their homes and land or trying to repair their fractured families or dealing with paternalistic colonial administrators. Colonialism is an inescapable reality, even after it is ostensibly over. =Betrayal, Guilt, and Redemption= Almost every character feels guilty about something in this novel, and those sources of guilt tend to derive from a betrayal of another character or of the Kenyan people. Mumbi has betrayed her husband, Karanja has betrayed his people by becoming a homeguard and Chief, and Mugo has betrayed Kihika. These characters manifest their guilt differently, with both Mumbi and Mugo eventually taking the path toward redemption while Karanja can only choose that of exile. Mumbi and Mugo's redemption comes from open confession of their sin and a willingness to accept the consequences. Mumbi's also comes from being true to herself and regaining control of her life; she will be able to live out those choices, whereas Mugo's fate is death. Nevertheless, Mugo's death offers redemption to the community as a whole. =Forgiveness= Many of the characters in this novel do reprehensible things: they betray loved ones and their community and the Movement, they commit acts of violence, they engage in selfishness and bitterness, and they compete and fight with each other. Some characters ask for forgiveness (either directly or subtly), while others do not. Forgiveness is important on both a personal and communal level, and those levels are related to each other. Individuals must work to forgive those who have wronged them in order to work together to build a stronger community. In the vacuum left by British rule, it will be more important than ever for Kenyans to trust each other, work together, and create a mutually sustaining and fulfilling community. Mugo's public confession, an act of asking for forgiveness, is significant, and indicates a model for the future. =Violence= Violence is an undeniable part of the Movement. Many characters carry out violent acts, speak positively of violence, or ignore it when it happens in front of them. Others decry and excoriate it, but usually this happens when the British or their African loyalists do it. Ngugi's view of violence is thus complex. He understands that violence is necessary to the Mau Mau because occasionally it is the only tool they have in their quest to throw off their colonial oppressor. That oppressor uses violence with abandon, so why should the oppressed not rise up and use violence for their own ends? Ngugi isn't unequivocally supportive of violence, though, and several of his scenes (such as the scene between Koina and Dr. Lynd) make the reader uncomfortable and hint at some of the problems of using violence in promoting human rights. =Silence and Confession= Silence in this novel rarely leads to redemption, whereas confession does. Mugo's silence about his role in Kihika's death is poisonous, disturbing his own psyche and polluting the health of the community. It is mistaken for courage and helps create the mythic reputation he has in the village, but it is false. Silence can also lead to death, as it does for the deaf and mute Gitogo. Real healing only happens when someone speaks up, confesses, and reveals secrets. Mumbi's story and the resulting confession from Mugo tear away the facade of unity and allow a more authentic (albeit painful) reality to emerge; this reality allows for an honest assessment of the community's divisions and needs, and facilitates a move toward a better future.

She was the daughter of novelist Olivia Shakespear and the wife of American poet Ezra Pound. One of a small number of women vorticist painters, her art work was published in BLAST, the short-lived but influential pre-World I literary magazine. Dorothy and Pound first met in 1909 in London, and after a long courtship the two married in 1914. They lived in Paris from 1920 until 1924, and in 1925 settled in Rapallo, Italy. In spite of her husband's 50-year affair with Olga Rudge, whom he met in Paris in the early 1920s, Dorothy stayed married to Pound. In 1926 she gave birth to a son Omar Pound, who was raised in England by her mother. By the 1930s she received a number of family bequests, making her financially independent, but lost much of her money by following Pound's advice to invest in Benito Mussolini's Fascist regime. Toward the end of World War II, Dorothy and Pound were evacuated from their home in Rapallo, and for a period she lived with Pound in Rudge's home. After the war, when Pound had been arrested for treason and incarcerated on grounds of insanity in Washington, D.C., she moved there, visiting daily, taking control of his estate, and staying with him until his release. They returned to Italy in 1958; in 1961 she moved to London, leaving her husband to live out the last decade of his life with Olga Rudge.  Early years  Dorothy's parents both came from British Indian Army families. Her mother Olivia Shakespear, born on the Isle of Wight, lived her early years in Sussex and later in London where she and her sister Florence were raised to live a life of leisure.Harwood, 1‚Äì7 In 1885 she married Henry Hope Shakespear (1849‚Äì1923), who traced his family line to 17th-century East London rope makers and, like his wife, came from a military family. Educated at Harrow, he went on to study law, became a barrister, and in 1875 joined a law practice. The couple's only child Dorothy was born nine months after the two were married.Harwood, 13‚Äì16 Dorothy's mother, a minor novelist, was active in London literary circles for much of her life.Harwood, 21‚Äì30 From her father Dorothy learned to paint, with the two going to the countryside for regularly scheduled painting excursions.Moody, 83 She attended Hampshire Boarding School and for a short period a Geneva finishing school, after which she lived in her parents' home, keeping herself occupied with water-colour painting, reading, letter writing, and accompanying her mother on social visits. Ezra Pound biographer Wilhelm describes her as a \\"bright, pert, pretty English girl with a winning smile although some people found her cold\\",Wilhelm, 16 and Humphrey Carpenter says that she lived a sheltered life before meeting Pound.Carpenter, 105‚Äì106  Courtship  Dorothy met Pound at her own home on 16 February 1909 when her mother, who had recently met the young American poet at a friend's salon in Kensington, invited him to tea.Harwood, 130‚Äì135 Although Olivia was more than 20 years older than Pound, she was a beautiful woman, and influential in London literary society, to whom Pound may have been attracted. But it was Dorothy, a year younger than Pound, who was struck by his presence, writing in her diary on the very day she met him: > Listen to it ‚Äî Ezra! Ezra! And a third time ‚Äî Ezra! He has a wonderful, > beautiful face, a high forehead, prominent over the eyes; a long delicate > nose, with little, red, nostrils; a strange mouth, never still & quite > elusive; a square chin, slightly cleft in the middle ‚Äî the whole face pale; > the eyes grey-blue; the hair golden-brown, and curling in soft wavy > crinkles. Large grotesque eyes, with long, well-shaped fingers and beautiful > nails.Carpenter (1988a), 106 Many years later she would tell Ezra Pound biographer Noel Stock that her memory of the visit \\"was very hazy, all she could remember was that it was winter and she sat on a low stool near the fire and listened\\".Stock, 60 Dorothy's mother, Olivia Shakespear, introduced Pound to her daughter in 1909. From her mother, she gained an interest in theosophy and mysticism. With her best friend and cousin, Georgie Hyde-Lees, she joined the Order of the Golden Dawn. Most specifically Dorothy was interested in astrology and asked Pound for his exact moment of birth to prepare an astrology chart. In her notebook she wrote: \\"You are very broad-minded‚Äîtoo much so. Very artistic. All for colour. Very sensitive‚Äîover-sensitive. At a very great turning point in life....you will marry twice & have two children.\\"Tytell, 57 In late 1909 and early 1910, chaperoned by her mother, Dorothy attended Pound's lectures at the London Polytechnic Institute; in June 1910, mother and daughter went to Italy and joined him in Sirmione for a few weeks. Dorothy spent the time painting, becoming enthralled with Lake Garda, as was Pound, claiming it was the first time she had seen color.Stock, 70, 81 She would later write to Pound that the days spent in Sirmione were deeply profound; according to Pound's biographer John Tytell, for the next two decades the watercolors she painted were of that location in Italy.Tytell, 68 Dorothy likely considered herself engaged to Pound after the Italian trip. Olivia restricted contact between the two after the trip. Days before Pound was to leave for an extended stay in the US, Dorothy wrote him promising to abide by her mother's stricture and exhorting him to follow her lead: \\"In case I do not see you alone on Wednesday, I take it that during your 'exile' you have been forbidden to write to me?.... if you have promised‚Äîdon't break your word‚Äîdon't write to me!\\"qtd in Harwood, 133 Olivia allowed Dorothy to write a thank-you note when Pound's Canzoni were published‚Äîthat he dedicated to Olivia and Dorothy‚Äîthe only instance when she let Dorothy contact him directly. John Harwood, Olivia Shakespear's biographer, writes that Dorothy's lack of resistance seems extreme, even by Edwardian standards; however, he speculates that Olivia's motives were to keep Dorothy's behaviour controlled, whereas Pound's behaviour was ignored. Engagement The two remained unofficially engaged until 1914, with Dorothy adhering to social convention and waiting for her father's permission to marry.Dennis, 267 In 1911 Pound returned from America and in October formally approached Dorothy's father asking permission to marry her. Pound told Shakespear he had a guaranteed annual income of ¬£200 in addition to earnings from writing and Dorothy's own income of ¬£150 a year. Shakespear refused on the grounds of insufficient income believing Pound overstated his potential to earn money writing poetry. At the same time, Hilda Doolitle arrived from America, believing herself to be engaged to Pound. Walter Rummel, with whom Pound was sharing a room while he waited for his old rooms at Church Walk to be vacated, told Hilda about Dorothy a few days before Pound asked permission to marry Dorothy. During that period Olivia invited Hilda to her home to meet her, and was concerned about the tension between Dorothy, Hilda and Pound, as well as her daughter's apparent obsession with Pound. Olivia continued to restrict contact between the two while Dorothy continued to treat the relationship as an engagement, despite short weekly or bi-weekly supervised visits in the family drawing room.Harwood, 142‚Äì145 Throughout the nearly five- year-long courtship, Dorothy and Pound corresponded regularly, filling their letters with gossip about mutual acquaintances such as T.E. Hulme, Violet Hunt, Walter Rummel, Florence Farr, and Henri Gaudier-Brzeska; additionally in their letters they shared trivial incidents, family information, and showed affection for one another. They were separated for long periods each year when the Shakespear family visited friends and extended family (mostly members of the Tucker family) in the country, returning to London only for a few months in the spring and autumn‚Äîcustomary for many Victorian families. Generally young women of the period were expected to indulge in activities such as painting, embroidery and music while waiting for marriage. Dorothy, however, through the influence of her mother, was well read (and quite capable of conversing with Pound who had multiple degrees), knowledgeable in music, and a talented artist.Reynolds, Ann She became a skilled artist and during the vorticist period was capable of conversing easily with artists such as Wyndham Lewis whom she met at her mother's salon.  Marriage  Olivia realised her 27-year-old daughter was determined to marry Pound and in 1914 allowed the two to marry although Pound was earning less than in 1911 when he made the first proposal.Harwood, 150 On 20 April 1914, Dorothy married Pound despite her father's opposition‚Äîhe relented when the couple agreed to a church rather than a civil ceremony.Wilhelm (2008), 151‚Äì154 The marriage ceremony took place at St Mary Abbots, Kensington, in the morning with six guests in attendance; official witnesses were the bride's father and her uncle Henry Tucker.Stock, 154 As a wedding present Olivia gave them two circus drawings by Pablo Picasso.Wilhelm (2008), 151‚Äì154 Cover of Ripostes designed by Dorothy Shakespear Dorothy and Pound moved into an apartment at 5 Holland Place, with Hilda Doolittle, recently married to Richard Aldington, living in the adjacent apartment.Moody, 249 Hilda was shocked and hurt when Pound married Dorothy, and even more shocked to find he rented the apartment opposite at Holland Place. She and Dorothy were not on friendly terms, with Hilda writing of her, \\"she is unbearably critical and never has been known to make a warm friend with a man or woman. She loathes (she says) children! However that may be a little pose. She is a bit addictive to little mannerisms. I don't think she can be poignantly sensitive or she would never have stuck Ezra.\\" When Dorothy came to in the small apartment she refused to cook‚Äîever. In fact, she never cooked until she was to forced to during World War II.Wilhelm, 151 Pound cooked in the larger room and worked in a small better-lit room. He made furniture for the apartment where they stayed until 1919. Although Dorothy and Ezra planned to honeymoon in Spain that September, the outbreak of World War I forced them to postpone. Instead they lived with W.B. Yeats at Stone Cottage for the winter, where Pound worked on proofs for the second issue of BLAST magazine.Wilhelm (2008), 154 Of Dorothy, Yeats wrote, \\"she looks as if her face were made out of Dresden china. I look at her in perpetual wonder. It is hard to believe she is real; yet she spends all her daylight hours drawing the most monstrous cubist pictures.\\"Moody, 252 Poet Iris Barry, writing in the 1930s about the Pounds during this period, describes Dorothy as, \\"With [Ezra] came Mrs. Pound, carrying herself delicately with the air, always of a young Victorian lady out skating, and a profile as clear and lovely as that as a porcelain Kuan-yin\\".qtd. in Stock, 195 From her father she learned landscape art but by 1913 her art showed influences of Japanese prints. Additionally, she was influenced by exposure to artists such as Wyndham Lewis and Henri Gaudier-Brzeska and by 1914 had assumed her own abstract Vorticist style. In 1915, she designed the cover art for Ezra's volume of poetry, Ripostes, and she designed Chinese characters to add to his manuscripts. Her work was simply signed as \\"D.S.\\" and never exhibited. When the first issue of BLAST was published, to promote its publication, Dorothy walked along Tottenham Court Road conspicuously holding the brightly colored avant-garde magazine for all to see.Stock, 162  Paris and Italy  Passport photo of Dorothy Shakespear, July 1919 Ezra Pound by E.O. Hopp√© (1920, the year he and Dorothy moved to Paris.) Dorothy and Pound moved to Paris in 1920 where they first lived in a hotel until renting a studio at 70 bis rue de Notre Dame des Champs, a small street near the D√¥me Caf√©. With a letter of introduction from Sherwood Anderson, Hemingway secured an invitation to tea for himself and his wife Hadley, who found Dorothy's manners to be intimidating, saying of their apartment that it was as \\"poor as Gertrude Stein's studio was rich\\".Carpenter (1988b), 65 Nonetheless they forged a firm friendship that lasted many years,Stock, 267 with Dorothy turning to Hemingway for help in the early 1950s, during Pound's incarceration at St. Elizabeths.Reynolds, 244 During this period Pound edited and Dorothy worked as business manager for the four volume literary magazine, The Exile, featuring works by Pound himself, Hemingway, and others. In 1923, Pound met classical violinist Olga Rudge, with whom he fell in love and had a relationship until his death.Wilhelm (2008), 241‚Äì251 A year later, in 1924, Dorothy and Pound left Paris for Italy to allow Ezra time to recuperate after suffering from appendicitis. They stayed in Rapallo briefly, moving on to Sicily, and then returning to settle in Rapallo in January 1925.Carpenter (1988a), 437 On 9 July 1925 Olga gave birth to their child Mary, in the Italian Tyrol.Stock, 262 Dorothy was separated from Pound for much of that year and the next; she joined her mother in Siena in the autumn, and then went to Egypt from December 1925 to March 1926, returning pregnant to Rapallo.Carpenter (1988a), 448‚Äì453 In Paris in June for the opening of Pound's opera Le Testament de Villon, Dorothy decided to stay and to have the child at the American Hospital. Because Pound was away when the child was born Hemingway brought Dorothy to the hospital. Omar Pound was born in the afternoon of 10 September 1926. Dorothy kept the boy with her for only a short time; before his second birthday she sent him to London where Olivia raised him with Dorothy visiting frequently. When Olivia died in 1938 she left a substantial income to Dorothy. In 1931 Olivia doubled Dorothy's income, who by that time had additional income in the form of various family bequests and dividends from investments. With her husband earning as little as ¬£50 annually, the Pounds lived on Dorothy's income. Olivia set up a stock account for her which was soon depleted because she followed Pound's advice to invest in Italian stock. She inherited ¬£16,000 from her mother, but during the war the money was inaccessible with assets from England prohibited from being sent to an Axis country. As a result, during the war years the couple relied solely on Pound's income, for the first time since their marriage.Harwood, 179‚Äì181 In 1941 on two separate occasions, Pound tried to leave Italy with Dorothy: once he was denied passage by plane,Nadel, xxv the second time they were refused passage on a diplomatic train out of the country.O'Connor, 43 In 1944 Pound and Dorothy were evacuatedStock, 190 from their home for being too near the coast. Pound wanted Dorothy to stay in Rapallo and care for his mother, Isabel, while he went to live with Olga. Dorothy insisted on staying with her husband‚Äîfor a year the three lived together. Olga took a job in an Ursuline school; Dorothy‚Äîwho had not learned Italian after almost two decades in the country‚Äîwas forced to learn to shop and how to cook.Wilhelm (1997), 206‚Äì207  Later years  On 25 November 1945, Pound was arraigned in Washington D.C. on charges of treason. The list included broadcasting for the enemy, attempting to persuade American citizens to undermine government support for the war, and strengthening Italian morale against the United States. Pound was ill at the arraignment and remanded to a Washington D.C. hospital where he underwent psychiatric evaluation. A week later he was admitted to St. Elizabeths hospital and assigned to a lunatic ward until February 1947\\\\. Unable to renew her passport Dorothy only arrived in the US in June, at which point her husband, then declared 'legally incompetent', was placed in her charge. She was allowed infrequent visits until his move to Chestnut Ward the following year‚Äîthe result of an appeal she initiated.Stock, 417‚Äì422 She moved into a dreary apartment where she lived for 12 years, visiting her husband each afternoon. Tytell writes that she had \\"generally a calming, soothing influence.\\" She typed his letters, acted as his confidante, shielded him from unwanted visitors, and led conversations amongst the visitors who flocked to visit the poet, particularly in the 1950s. However she failed to keep Pound from \\"himself\\" as Tytell writes, unable to prevent her husband's friendship with far-right activists such as John Kasper. Furthermore, Pound continued to be interested in other women. He was visited at Chestnut Ward by Sheri Martinelli, a former model according to Tytell, about whom Dorothy complained in a letter to the hospital's superintendent Winfred Overholser. Martinelli was then replaced with Marcella Spann, \\"a naive young English teacher from a small town in Texas\\".Tytell, 329‚Äì339 In April 1958, Archibald MacLeish instigated the campaign for Pound's release which was successful. He stayed on at St. Elizabeths for the next month, waiting for a passport, packing books and papers that were stored in Dorothy's apartment, leaving the hospital early in May. In June Dorothy and her husband, traveling with Marcella, now acting nominally as Pound's secretary, boarded a ship for Italy. Upon their arrival they were met in Verona by Mary, Pound's daughter with Olga, and from there they traveled to her home in South Tyrol, Schloss Brunnenburg. In January 1959 tensions between the three women became intolerable. Dorothy, who lived in her own section of the castle, maintained legal guardianship and controlled his funds. A few months later, Dorothy took Pound and Marcella to Rapallo to visit Olga, and then traveled through Italy. In Sirmione Pound began to talk about marrying Marcella, and Dorothy used her legal power: by the end of the summer Marcella, 40 years younger than Pound, had been sent back to the US. Pound fell into a period of ill-health in 1960 that lingered through the early months of 1961. Dorothy eventually brought him to Rapallo, and unable to cope with him, she turned his care over to Olga. Dorothy returned to London where she lived until the end of her life. When in 1970, Noel Stock published what was meant to be definitive biography of her husband's life, Dorothy approved the final version.Nadel (2010), 162 Pound died in Venice 1972 but she did not attend the funeral. She died a year later, in 1973.Cockram, 274  Vorticist  The Nasher Museum of Art at Duke University held an exhibition entitled The Vorticists: Rebel Artists in London and New York, 1914‚Äì18 from September 30, 2010 through January 2, 2011 including a painting by Shakespear.Nasher Museum Retrieved September 17, 2010  Notes  References  Sources = * Carpenter, Humphrey.

A passed pawn is sometimes colloquially called a passer. Passed pawns can be an advantage because only the opponent's pieces can stop them from promoting. In the diagram, the white pawns on b5, c4, and e5 are passed pawns, and Black's pawn on d4 is a passed pawn. If Black plays ...fxg4, then the black pawn on g4 will be passed, as well as White's pawn on f4. Protected passed pawn A passed pawn that is protected by its own pawns is called a protected passed pawn. In the first diagram in this article, the pawns on the b- and e-files are protected passed pawns. Two or more passed pawns on adjacent files are called connected passed pawns (see connected pawns), and they are very strong. In the diagram at the top, White's b- and c-pawns are connected passed pawns. A pair of connected passed pawns is sometimes called a steamroller. It is often strategically advantageous for the side with connected passed pawns to place them on the same rank and then advance them in tandem, because this makes them more difficult to . Sometimes, minor pieces are sacrificed so that a pawn can have a clear path to promotion on the eighth rank. In the example illustrated (Mikhail Botvinnik‚ÄìJos√© Capablanca, AVRO 1938), in order to capitalize on the passed pawn on e6 and break its blockade by Black's queen, White continued 30. Ba3! Qxa3 31. Nh5+! gxh5 32. Qg5+ Kf8 33. Qxf6+ guaranteeing the e-pawn's promotion. The passed pawn's value is well worth the sacrifice of the bishop in order to clear its path to promotion. The only pieces preventing the e-pawn's promotion are the black queen and knight, and once they are gone, the pawn has a free path to promote. Black's pawns are also helpless to stop it. Outside passed pawn An outside passed pawn is a passed pawn that is on or near the left or right edge of the board, and is separated by a number of files from the rest of the pawns. Such a pawn often constitutes a strong advantage for its owner because the opposing king does not have the range to cover both sides of the board. In the diagrammed position from the fifth game of the 1971 Candidates match between Bobby Fischer and Bent Larsen, the outside passed pawn on the a-file confers White a winning advantage, even though is equal. The pawn will force Black's king to keep it from queening, leaving White's king free to capture Black's remaining pawns and win the game. White wins with: :41. Kd4 Kd6 :42. a5 f6 :43. a6 Kc6 :44. a7 Kb7 :45. Kd5 h4 If 45...f5 46.h4 wins. :46. Ke6 1‚Äì0 . An outside passed pawn is also powerful in an endgame with . It is not so powerful in an endgame with rooks if the opposing rook can get behind the pawn (see diagram), as in the Tarrasch rule , . Passed pawns in the endgame Passed pawns are particularly important, often of decisive significance, in the endgame. The position illustrated provides a dramatic example of this. White has no passed pawns and seems to be in desperate straits, since Black's king will soon attack White's pawns with ...Kg4. In fact, White by means of a sacrificial combination creates a passed pawn and wins: 1. g6! fxg6 (or 1...hxg6 2.f6! gxf6 3.h6!) 2. h6! gxh6 3. f6! and White's newly created passed pawn will queen. If it is Black's move, he must avoid this combination by playing 1... g6! (not 1...f6 2.h6!, nor 1...h6 2.f6!). Four examples of advanced passed pawns Since passed pawns have no opposing pawns to stop them, the threat of queening often forces the opponent to use a piece to block or capture the pawn, wasting valuable time and immobilizing material or possibly even losing it (as when a defender of the blocking piece is forced to move). Indeed, the value of a far-advanced passed pawn or pawn group is often equal to or even greater than that of a piece. Four examples of this are seen in the subdivided diagram. In the upper-left quadrant of the board, White's connected passed pawns on the sixth rank are superior to Black's rook. Even if on move, Black cannot stop one of White's pawns from queening. Similarly, in the upper- right quadrant, Black's bishop cannot hold back both of White's pawns. White queens a pawn after 1. f7 (1.h7 also works) Bxf7 2. h7 followed by 3. h8=Q. In the lower-left quadrant, White's queen cannot stop Black's pawn from queening without stalemating Black. The lower-right quadrant highlights how awkward a knight is in dealing with a passed pawn, especially a rook pawn. White's knight is actually worse than useless in trying to stop Black's pawn. It cannot do so itself, and if White's king (which could catch the pawn if the knight were not there) approaches with 1. Kf2 (hoping for 1...hxg2? 2.Kxg2), Black plays 1... h2! and 2... h1=Q. A striking (albeit very unusual) example of the power of passed pawns is seen in the conclusion of an endgame study by Leopold Mitrofanov (see diagram). Black, with a queen, bishop, and knight, is helpless against White's two passed pawns, which threaten both 10.b7# and 10.c8=Q+ Bb8 11.b7#.

Usually, words with the same meaning are turned into the same word (e.g. \\"take\\" and \\"get\\") and certain filler words are dropped (e.g. articles, or the \\"at\\" in \\"look at rock\\"). The parser makes it easier for the game's author to react on input. The author does not have to write special code to process the commands \\"get the gem\\", \\"take the gem\\", \\"get gem\\", \\"take gem\\", \\"take the precious gem\\", etc. separately, as the parser will have stripped the input down to something like \\"take gem\\". For the player, the game is more flexible, as the game has a larger vocabulary, and there are fewer guess-the-verb and guess-the-noun problems. Parsers are used in early interactive fiction games like the Zork series, and more recently in games created by systems like Inform and TADS.

It remains popular as a children's song, having been recorded by numerous artists over the decades. Kennedy lived at Staplegrove Elm and is buried in Staplegrove Church, Taunton, Somerset, England. Local folklore has it that the small wooded area between the church and Staplegrove Scout Hut was the inspiration for his lyrics.  Background  Advertisement for sheet music of \\"The Teddy Bears Picnic\\" as published in the Star Tribune newspaper in April 1908 Bratton composed and personally copyrighted it in 1907, and then assigned the copyright to M. Witmark & Sons, New York City, who published it later that year as \\"The Teddy Bears Picnic: Characteristic Two Step\\", according to the first page of the published piano score, as well as the orchestral parts Witmark published in an arrangement by Frank Saddler. However, the illustrated sheet music cover gives the title as THE TEDDY BEARS' PICNIC, with apostrophe on \\"BEARS\\" and no genre descriptor.1st edition copy of piano version at Lilly Library, Indiana University http://webapp1.dlib.indiana.edu/inharmony/detail.do?action=detail&fullItemID;=/lilly/devincent/LL- SDV-092037Front cover of the piano score: http://fedora.dlib.indiana.edu/fedora/get/iudl:338274/SCREEN Irish songwriter Jimmy Kennedy wrote the now familiar lyrics for it in 1932. After Bratton wrote \\"The Teddy Bears' Picnic\\", however, many people felt that the composer plagiarized portions of the melody. Music aficionados pointed out in particular that the refrain echoed the theme from Robert Browne Hall's 1895 \\"Death or Glory March\\". Nevertheless, charges were not filed and Bratton's song still has the same tune it had in 1907. The first recording of the piece was by the Edison Symphony Orchestra, made at Edison Records' \\"New York Recording Department\\" studio, 79 Fifth Avenue, New York City, in November 1907 and was released as Edison two-minute cylinder 9777 in March 1908, as announced on page 3 of the January 1908 issue of The Edison Phonograph Monthly (vol. VI, no. 1).https://archive.org/details/edisonphonograph06moor Edison also re-recorded it in June 1909 for four-minute wax Amberol cylinder 255, released in October of that year (as announced in the EPM, vol. VII no. 8, August 1909, p. 20), and reissued that as four-minute celluloid Blue Amberol cylinder 1867 in September 1913 (\\"Blue Amberol Regular List\\", EPM, vol. 11 no. 7, July 1913). Arthur Pryor's Band made the work's first disc recording for the Victor Talking Machine Company in Camden, New Jersey, on 14 September 1908. Take 2 from that session was released in November 1908 as Victor single- faced disc 5594 and as side A of the company's first double-faced disc 16001, with the title on the label reading \\"The Teddy Bears' Picnic/Descriptive Novelty\\". An early UK recording was made by the Black Diamonds Band for Zonophone records in 1908. The first vocal version was recorded in 1932 on BBC Radio by Henry Hall with his BBC Orchestra, with Val Rosing singing Kennedy's lyrics. The song has subsequently been recorded by numerous notable artists, including: Rosemary Clooney, Bing Crosby (recorded 22 June 1950), Frank DeVol, Michael Feinstein, Jerry Garcia, John Inman, Anne Murray, and Dave Van Ronk. Notable non-solo artists to record the song include the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, Rosenshontz, and Trout Fishing in America.  In popular culture  * In the late 1940s and early 1950s, a version performed by organist Ethel Smith was used as the theme song for the Big Jon and Sparkie radio program, an American children's show presented on weekdays and Saturday mornings. The Saturday show was later named No School Today. *John Inman's 1975 recording of the song (as featured on his first album Are You Being Served Sir?) was regularly playlisted on BBC Radio 1/2 Saturday morning children's show Ed Stewart's Junior Choice in the late 1970s. * In 1983, Green Tiger Press turned Kennedy's lyrics into a children's book, with illustrations by company co- founder Sandra Darling (under the name Alexandra Day). Original printings included a 7\\" record, with the Bing Crosby recording on the A side, and a recording by a local klezmer band, dubbed \\"The Bearcats\\", on the B-side. * The song appears in the 2006 film Open Season. The original lyrics are sung by Beth and Shaw, and a version with different lyrics is sang by Elliot. * In 1989, a short film entitled The Teddy Bears' Picnic was released, featuring two teddy bears named Benjamin (voiced by Jonathan Crombie) and Wally (voiced by Stuart Stone) attending the said picnic. Ann Stevens performed the song, which served as the film's theme song. Two other films based on the film were released called The Teddy Bears' Christmas (1992) and The Teddy Bears' Scare (1998) and later a television series called The Secret World of Benjamin Bear. * In the 1998 Nintendo 64 game Banjo-Kazooie, the theme music for Gruntilda's Lair is based on the original song. * Teddy Bears' Picnic Day is July 10. Use by BBC radio engineers The 1932 Henry Hall recording was of especially good quality with a large tonal range. It was used for more than 30 years by BBC audio engineers (up until the early 1960s) to test and calibrate the frequency response of audio equipment.

The freeway starts at I-80 near Davenport, Iowa and ends at I-80 near Colona, Illinois; its eastern part runs concurrent with I-74 to return to I-80. I-280 forms the southern part of a circle around the Quad Cities as well as forming part of a bypass (along with I-80) for U.S. Highway 61 around Davenport. This road is long. Route description I-280 begins at a directional T interchange with Interstate 80 on the northwestern outskirts of Davenport. U.S. Route 6 (US 6) and US 61 join I-280 from opposite directions of I-80 at the interchange. It heads south along the western edge of Davenport. At the Kimberly Road exit, US 6 splits off to the east. It continues south for , crossing Duck Creek, towards a diamond interchange with Scott County Road F65 (CR F65), which becomes Locust Street in Davenport. Further south, I-280 passes the West Lake Park. South of West Lake Park, US 61 splits away from the interstate on its way towards Muscatine. In the other direction, U.S. Route 61 Business heads towards the Davenport riverfront. South of US 61, I-280 curves to the southeast towards the Mississippi River. It drops into the river valley and meets Iowa Highway 22 (Iowa 22). It continues southeast and crosses the river via the Sergeant John F. Baker, Jr. Bridge. alt=A bridge with a large arch crosses a river. In Illinois, I-280 runs for . It runs southeast from the Baker Bridge to Milan, where it parallels the Rock River. I-280 joins with I-74 at the Quad Cities International Airport; this concurrency continues for 9.4 miles (15.1 km) before terminating at the I-74/I-80 interchange. On the SE corner of the Quad Cities (in Illinois) I-280 heading East ends and becomes I-80 while I-80 heads South from Le Claire, Rapids City, and Port Byron. I-80 heading South becomes I-74 which (after going through the center of the Quad Cities hooks up with I-280. This exchange is called The Big X. History The original plan of I-280 matches the western half of the route today. Interstate 280 has been at the center of a few debates regarding its routing. In the early 1990s, the state of Illinois suggested, via AASHTO and ISTEA hearings, swapping the I-80 and I-280 designations around the Quad Cities. The plan would have also changed I-74 to I-174. This was challenged by the state of Iowa, and the idea was dropped.http://www.kurumi.com/roads/3di/i280.html#280il, Retrieved on July 7, 2009. One of the reasons Illinois pursued the matter was due to the configuration of the eastern terminus of I-280; as a simple cloverleaf interchange, through I-80 traffic (along the north and east branches) was required to exit on both directions. Thru I-74 traffic (along the west and south branches) is also required to exit on both directions. I-280 runs due west from the interchange.

Most courts have no such power, and must entertain any case properly filed, so long as the court has subject matter jurisdiction over the questions of law which must be decided, and in personam jurisdiction over the parties to the case. Typically, the highest court in a state or country will have discretionary jurisdiction. The reason for this is that appellate courts in common law countries have two basic functions: error correction and ensuring the orderly development of case law. In the first case, the appellate court simply examines the record and determines whether the lower court applied existing law correctly, and reverses and remands (sends the case back) for severe errors. That is, the parties may generally agree on the applicable law, but the appellant will contend that the trial court incorrectly interpreted and applied the existing law. In the second case, the appellate court rules on novel issues in a case, and under stare decisis, those rulings become new law in themselves. In those cases, the parties disagree vigorously if any existing legal rule even applies to the facts of the case, or the appellant may be deliberately trying to attack an established rule in the hope that the appellate court will overturn a prior decision and establish a new rule, or the question has been ruled upon by multiple intermediate appellate courts and is so perplexing that all the lower courts disagree with each other. An appellate court with discretionary jurisdiction is able to delegate error correction to lower courts, while it focuses its limited resources on developing case law properly. In the latter situation, the appellate court will focus on truly novel questions or revisiting older legal rules that are now clearly obsolete or unconstitutional. For example, the United States Supreme Court hears cases by a writ of certiorari, essentially meaning that it calls appellants up to the court only if their case is important enough to merit the resources of the court. The Supreme Court employs a \\"rule of four\\", meaning that four justices have to think the case is important enough to hear before the court will grant it review. Many state supreme courts use a similar process to choose which cases they will hear.

In practice, most commonly used algorithms have key sizes of 128 bits or more, providing sufficient security also in the case that the chosen algorithm is slightly weakened by cryptanalysis. Different kinds of keys are compared in the document (e.g. RSA keys vs. EC keys). This \\"translation table\\" can be used to roughly equate keys of other types of algorithms with symmetric encryption algorithms. In short, 128 bit symmetric keys are said to be equivalent to 3248 bits RSA keys or 256-bit EC keys. Symmetric keys of 256 bits are roughly equivalent to 15424 bit RSA keys or 512 bit EC keys. Finally 2048 bit RSA keys are said to be equivalent to 103 bit symmetric keys. Among key sizes, 8 security levels are defined, from the lowest \\"Attacks possible in real-time by individuals\\" (level 1, 32 bits) to \\"Good for the foreseeable future, also against quantum computers unless Shor's algorithm applies\\" (level 8, 256 bits). For general long-term protection (30 years), 128 bit keys are recommended (level 7).  Use of specific algorithms  Many different primitives and algorithms are evaluated. The primitives are: * symmetric encryption algorithms such as 3DES and AES; * block cipher modes of operation such as ECB, CBC, CTR and XTS; * authenticated encryption methods such as GCM; * stream ciphers RC4, eSTREAM and SNOW 2.0; * hashing algorithms MD5, RIPEMD-128/160, SHA-1, SHA-2 and Whirlpool; * MAC algorithms HMAC, CBC-MAC and CMAC; * asymmetric encryption algorithms ElGamal and RSA; * key exchange schemes and algorithms such as SSH, TLS, ISO/IEC 11770, IKE and RFC 5114; * key encapsulation mechanisms RSA-KEM and ECIES-KEM; * signature schemes such as RSA-PSS, DSA and ECDSA; and * public key authentication and identification algorithm GQ. Note that the list of algorithms and schemes is non-exhaustive (the document contains more algorithms than are mentioned here). = Main Computational Assumptions in Cryptography = This document, dated 11 January 2013, provides \\"an exhaustive overview of every computational assumption that has been used in public key cryptography.\\" = Report on physical attacks and countermeasures = The \\"Vampire lab\\" produced over 80 peer reviewed and joined authored publications during the four years of the project. This final document looks back on results and discusses newly arising research directions. The goals were to advance attacks and countermeasures; bridging the gap between cryptographic protocol designers and smart card implementers; and to investigate countermeasures against power analysis attacks (contact-based and contact- less).

It is the most popular park in the city, covering consisting of formal, conservation, woodland and sports areas. Recreational activities at the park include boating, fishing, bowls, tennis, putting and picnic areas. It also contains Birmingham Wildlife Conservation Park, the mac theatre, and adjacent to the park is Edgbaston Cricket Ground. History On 18 April 1873, a local benefactor, Miss Louisa Ann Ryland (1814‚Äì89) of Barford Hill House, Warwickshire, gave just over of meadow land, known as Cannon Hill Fields, to the Corporation and paid for the draining of the site to create a public park. J.T Gibson of Battersea was employed to transform the site. He constructed two large lakes, the smaller ornamental ponds and a bathing pool. 35 acres were devoted to ornamental gardens and shrub borders. Kew Gardens donated seeds and plants to establish the collection, this collection was used by students to enable them to study botany. It opened to the public in September 1873. A further were given by the brewer John Holder in 1897, and in 1898 were acquired to straighten the River Rea, which is now culverted and runs along the western edge.  Features  South African memorial A 1906 granite and bronze memorial to the dead of the Second Boer War by Albert Toft, stands on the western edge of the park. Grade II* listed, it was refurbished in 2012. In 1911 a 16th-century timbered house was moved from Deritend and re-erected in the park by the Birmingham Archaeological Society, to serve as a refreshment room and cricket pavilion. Named the Golden Lion Inn it is a Grade II listed building but is now in a very poor state of repair and fenced-off. The bandstand, the bridge over the lake ('Red Carriage Bridge'), and Cannon Hill House are also Grade II Listed. The Scout memorial Another memorial, unveiled on 27 July 1924, commemorates Scouts who fell in the first and (by later inscription) second world wars. It is in concrete, and was designed by the architect William Haywood. Elan Valley Reservoirs - model in Cannon Hill Park A scale model of the Elan Valley Reservoirs, in the form of ornamental ponds, is located in a Japanese garden near the mac. It was built in the 1960s. On 4 March 2019, a memorial to the British victim of the 2015 Bardo National Museum attack, and 30 British victims of the 2015 Sousse attacks, in Tunisia, was unveiled by Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex. The memorial is called Infinite Wave. Events A free 5 kilometre parkrun running event is held in the park every Saturday morning at 9am and usually attracts over 750 runners each week. A free 2 kilometre junior parkrun event for children aged between 4 and 14 takes place at 9am on Sunday mornings. The Great Birmingham 10k and Great Birmingham Run half-marathon events also pass through the park.

The route extends from Interstate 80 near Coralville to Waterloo. I-380 connects the cities of Cedar Rapids and Waterloo, the state's second- and sixth-largest cities, respectively, to the Interstate Highway System. Except for its last north of U.S. Route 20 (US 20), I-380 runs concurrently with Iowa Highway 27 (Iowa 27), which represents Iowa's portion of the Avenue of the Saints highway connecting St. Louis, Missouri, with St. Paul, Minnesota. Construction of I-380 took 12 years to complete, ending in 1985. After the interstate opened, US 218 was moved onto the new freeway. In the 1990s, the I-380 corridor was selected as part of the Avenue of the Saints corridor, which Iowa designated as Iowa 27 in 2001. I-380 has been affected by two major floods, the Great Flood of 1993 and the Iowa flood of 2008, both of which closed the road at the Iowa River for two weeks.  Route description  Interstate 380 begins at a cloverleaf interchange, where US 218 and Iowa 27 cross Interstate 80 in Coralville in Johnson County. From the interchange, I-380, US 218, and Iowa 27, the route assigned to the Avenue of the Saints Highway in Iowa run together towards Cedar Rapids. The interstate heads north and serves North Liberty. North of North Liberty, the freeway runs parallel to the former routing of US 218 and Iowa 965; here the two highways cross the Iowa River. After crossing into Linn County, the three routes enter the Cedar Rapids city limits near The Eastern Iowa Airport. Three miles (4.8 km) north of the airport, I-380 intersects US 30 and US 151 at a cloverstack interchange. At this interchange, US 218 splits away from I-380 and Iowa 27. Through Cedar Rapids, the I-380 freeway is elevated relative to the nearby streets and residential neighborhoods. As it approaches downtown and the Cedar River, the freeway takes a tight, 90-degree turn to the east, crosses the river, squeezes between a Quaker Oats plant and the U.S. Cellular Center before turning back 90 degrees to the north. Between downtown and the Coldstream‚Äì29th Street interchange, I-380 serves as a dividing line between residential areas to the east and industry to the west. Towards the northern end of Cedar Rapids, industry is replaced with commerce as I-380/Iowa 27 meet Iowa 100, locally known as Collins Road, at a volleyball interchange. The collector/distributor ramps for Collins Road also serve the same function for Blairs Ferry Road, the next overpass to the north. The freeway leaves Cedar Rapids and enters Hiawatha, where there is only one interchange, a diamond with Boyson Road. Quickly escaping the Cedar Rapids area, I-380 turns to the northwest and passes through predominantly rural areas with small communities and farms dotting the way. Because of its northwestern angle, I-380 enters four counties within , as counties in Iowa are generally rectangular in shape. It passes Center Point in northwestern Linn County, Urbana in northeastern Benton County, where it meets Iowa 150, and Brandon in southwestern Buchanan County. The interstate travels into Black Hawk County, heading northwest for before turning north for until a directional T interchange with US 20. Together with US 20, I-380 and Iowa 27 travel west towards Waterloo and Cedar Falls. The three routes pass the eastern Waterloo suburbs of Raymond, Evansdale, and Elk Run Heights Almost immediately after crossing the Cedar River again, I-380 splits away from US 20 and Iowa 27 and rejoins US 218 at a three-level stack interchange. I-380 and US 218 head north to the east of the Crossroads Center shopping mall. One half-mile (0.8 km) north of the interchange which serves the Crossroads Center, I-380 ends at the traffic light at Mitchell Avenue. US 218 continues to the north at this point.  History  alt=Roofs of buildings and tops of trees peek through a vast body of water The first section of I-380 opened to traffic on September 19, 1973. That section connected The Eastern Iowa Airport to I-80 at Coralville. Within three years, the interstate had been extended into Cedar Rapids at the Cedar River. The bridge which crossed the river would not open until June 1979. By the end of 1981, I-380 was a continuous road to the Coldstream Avenue/Glass Road interchange. The interstate was originally scheduled to be open by Christmas 1984, but weather delays pushed back the construction timetable. The last section of I-380 to be completed opened on September 12, 1985. In 1985, US 218 was bypassed around Iowa City and Coralville, joining I-380 at the I-80 interchange. US 218 to Cedar Rapids was replaced by Iowa 965. In the early 1990s, most of I-380 was designated as part of the Avenue of the Saints corridor, which connects St. Louis, Missouri, to St. Paul, Minnesota. Avenue of the Saints route markers were erected along the route the next year. In August 2001, the Avenue of the Saints in Iowa was given a single designation, Iowa 27, to facilitate following the route through the state. I-380 crosses two of Iowa's major rivers, the Iowa and the Cedar. Both rivers have affected the interstate during major floods, as the case was in 1993 and in 2008. During the Great Flood of 1993, I-380 and Iowa 965 were both closed at the Iowa River's Coralville Lake reservoir between July 13 and July 28. The roads reopened after the lake's waters receded enough to allow Department of Transportation inspectors to check the three bridges over the water. The great Iowa flood of 2008 affected the same section of I-380 at the Iowa River in much the same fashion as in 1993. I-380 and former Iowa 965 were closed at the Iowa River on June 13 until July 3. In Cedar Rapids, flooding did not close I-380; the only bridge not to close, though traffic was restricted through the city. The flooding damage was much more severe in Cedar Rapids than in Iowa City. The Cedar River crested at over on June 13, causing hundreds of millions of dollars in damage.  Exit list Future The Iowa Department of Transportation has plans to rebuild I-380's southern terminus interchange with I-80. As the Eastern Iowa region has grown, traffic has increased, and the current arrangement of the interchange with its cloverleaf ramps has been deemed unsafe. The Iowa DOT proposes to rebuilt the interchange as a turbine interchange, which will eliminate weaving. The project is scheduled to begin in 2020.

The northern terminus of I-380 is at I-81 and U.S. Route 6 (US 6) in Dunmore; the southern terminus is in Tunkhannock Township at the junction with I-80. The entire length of the highway is . Route description Roaring Brook Township, southeast of Scranton. I-380 begins at an interchange with I-80 in the northeastern corner of Tunkhannock Township in Monroe County, heading north as a four-lane freeway. The road soon crosses into Tobyhanna Township and runs through forested areas in the Pocono Mountains with nearby development, passing west of the Kalahari Resort and Convention Center. The highway comes to an interchange with PA 940 to the west of Pocono Summit. I-380 continues north and crosses into Coolbaugh Township, where it curves northwest and runs through dense forests. The road passes through part of Pennsylvania State Game Lands Number 127 before it comes to a northbound exit and southbound entrance at PA 423 near Tobyhanna. A short distance later, the highway comes to a southbound exit and northbound entrance serving the northern terminus of PA 611. Following this interchange, I-380 passes to the southwest of the Tobyhanna Army Depot before it runs along the border between Pennsylvania State Game Lands Number 127 to the southwest and Gouldsboro State Park to the northeast. Farther northwest, the highway comes to a diamond interchange with the southern termini of PA 435 and PA 507 near Gouldsboro. Immediately after the PA 435/PA 507 interchange, I-380 passes through a small corner of Lehigh Township in Wayne County before it crosses the Lehigh River into Clifton Township in Lackawanna County. The highway continues through forested areas and curves to the north, passing a northbound weigh station and crossing into Covington Township. The freeway runs past a southbound weigh station and bends northwest again. The route curves back to the north into a mix of fields and woods and reaches a diamond interchange with PA 307. Past this interchange, I-380 curves north into the borough of Moscow and coming to a southbound exit and northbound entrance at PA 690. The roadway curves northwest and passes through a corner of Spring Brook Township before entering Roaring Brook Township, where it runs through forests with nearby development and comes to an interchange with I-84. At this point, I-84 and I-380 become concurrent, with the freeway using I-84's exit numbers and mileposts. The two routes continue north through forested areas in the Moosic Mountains, entering the borough of Dunmore and coming to a bridge over Roaring Brook and a Delaware‚ÄìLackawanna Railroad line. After this bridge, the highway curves northwest and comes to a southbound exit and northbound entrance with the northern terminus of PA 435. The freeway widens to six lanes and winds through the mountains before it comes to an interchange with Tigue Street, at which point it runs past commercial development. A short distance later, I-84 and I-380 both come to their termini at an interchange with I-81 and US 6, with the freeway merging onto northbound I-81/westbound US 6. History Prior to receiving its current designation, the planned corridor of I-380 had several other designations. When the initial numbers for the Interstate System were assigned in 1957, the Scranton‚ÄìNew York route (including the current I-380) was designated I-82. This changed the next year, and the Scranton- Stroudsburg connection became I-81S, a spur of I-81. In 1961, construction began on a short section of the route between what is now Exit 2 for PA 435 (then part of U.S. Route 611) and its northern terminus at I-81 outside of Scranton.Jeffrey J. Kitsko. Interstate 380 at Pennsylvania Highways. 17 December 2012. Retrieved 5 September 2013. This section was opened in 1962 as part of US 611. In 1964, the designation of the proposed road was changed again to Interstate 81E and construction began on the section between the southern terminus at Interstate 80 and Exit 3 for PA 940 near Pocono Manor. This section was built at the same time as the connecting section of I-80 and both opened in 1965. In December 1966, it was announced bids were to occur soon to build a portion of the highway between Pocono Manor in Tobyhanna Township and Coolbaugh Township. On December 30, 1966, bids were made to build a section of I-81E in Coolbaugh and Tobyhanna townships. In February 1967, construction was planned for a section of highway in Coolbaugh Township between Tobyhanna and the border with Lackawanna County. On April 21, 1967, the state announced bidding would take place to build a section of I-81E in Monroe County on May 12. The state announced on June 9, 1967 that bidding would take place on June 23 to construct a section of the highway in Covington Township. The section of I-81E between the PA 940 interchange in Pocono Manor and US 611/PA 423 at Tobyhanna was projected to open in late 1968, and construction of the highway between Tobyhanna and Elmhurst was underway by 1968. On November 21, 1969, the section of I-81E between PA 507 in Gouldsboro and PA 307 in Daleville opened to traffic. By 1970, the road between PA 307 in Daleville and US 611 southeast of Dunmore was under design. In 1967, construction on the road was restarted on a southern section from PA 940 to PA 423 and PA 507 to the Dorantown Road overpass, and, in 1968, was expanded to the sections from PA 423 to PA 507 and the Dorantown Road overpass to PA 307. This section opened in 1970 with US 611 multiplexed onto the portion between Exit 8 (now PA 611) and Exit 13 (PA 507) adjacent to Gouldsboro State Park. On June 20, 1972, the American Association of State Highway Officials (AASHO) approved renumbering I-81E as I-380, along with extending I-84 concurrent with I-380 from Elmhurst Township north to I-81. The renumbering was done in order to avoid the confusion of I-81E with the connecting I-80 and I-81 designations. The new I-380 designation and extended I-84 would take effect in mid-1973, with the new signs to be installed by June of that year. In 1973, the northern section was upgraded to Interstate standards. In 1974 and 1975, work commenced on the final sections from PA 307 to the Shutters Road underpass and Shutters Road to PA 435, respectively. This included an interchange with Interstate 84, and was opened to traffic in 1976 as an east- west highway with mileage-based exit numbers. These mileage-based numbers were scrapped by 1977 and replaced with eight sequential numbers beginning in Scranton. Mileage-based exit numbers were revived in 2001 when the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation renumbered its Interstate System exit numbers. I-380 was redesignated as a north‚Äìsouth highway so that its exit numbers would commence from I-80 in the south.

It is one of the most commonly used web server administration tools. It was initiated by Bradford L. Barrett in 1997. Statistics commonly reported by Webalizer include hits, visits, referrers, the visitors' countries, and the amount of data downloaded. These statistics can be viewed graphically and presented by different time frames, such as by day, hour, or month. Overview Website traffic analysis is produced by grouping and aggregating various data items captured by the web server in the form of log files while the website visitor is browsing the website. The Webalizer analyzes web server log files, extracting such items as client's IP addresses, URL paths, processing times, user agents, referrers, etc. and grouping them in order to produce HTML reports. Web servers log HTTP traffic using different file formats. Common file formats are Common Log Format (CLF), the Apache Custom Log Format, and Extended Log File Format. An example of a CLF log line is shown below. 192.168.1.20 - - [26/Dec/2006:03:09:16 -0500] \\"GET HTTP/ 1.1\\" 200 1774 Apache Custom Log Format can be customized to log most HTTP parameters, including request processing time and the size of the request itself. The format of a custom log is controlled by the format line. A typical Apache log format configuration is shown below. LogFormat \\"%a %l \\\\\\"%u\\\\\\" %t %m \\\\\\"%U\\\\\\" \\\\\\"%q\\\\\\" %p %>s %b %D \\\\\\"%{Referer}i\\\\\\" \\\\\\"%{User-Agent}i\\\\\\"\\" my_custom_log CustomLog logs/access_log my_custom_log Microsoft's Internet Information Services (IIS) web server logs HTTP traffic in W3C Extended Log File Format. Similarly to Apache Custom Log format, IIS logs may be configured to capture such extended parameters as request processing time. W3C extended logs may be recognized by the presence of one or more format lines, such as the one shown below. #Fields: date time s-ip cs-method cs-uri-stem cs-uri-query s-port cs-username c-ip cs(User-Agent) cs(Referer) sc-status sc-bytes cs-bytes time-taken The Webalizer can process CLF, Apache and W3C Extended log files, as well as HTTP proxy log files produced by Squid servers. Other log file formats are usually converted to CLF in order to be analyzed. In addition, logs compressed with either GZip (.gz) or BZip2 (.bz2) can be processed directly without the need to uncompress before use. Command line The Webalizer is a command line application and is launched from the operating system shell prompt. A typical command is shown below. webalizer -p -F clf -n en.wikipedia.org -o reports logfiles/access_log This command instructs The Webalizer to analyze the log file access_log, run in the incremental mode (-p), interpret the log as a CLF log file (-F), use the domain name en.wikipedia.org for report links (-n) and produce the output subdirectory of the current directory. Use the -h option to see the complete list of command line options. Configuration Besides the command line options, the Webalizer may be configured through parameters of a configuration file. By default, The Webalizer reads the file webalizer.conf and interprets each line as a processing instruction. Alternatively, a user-specified file may be provided using the -c option. For example, if the webmaster would like to ignore all requests made from a particular group of hosts, he or she can use the IgnoreSite parameter to discard all log records with the IP address matching the specified pattern: IgnoreSite 192.168.0.* There are over one hundred available configuration parameters, which make The Webalizer a highly configurable web traffic analysis application. For a complete list of configuration parameters please refer to the README file shipped with every source or binary distribution. Reports By default, The Webalizer produces two kinds of reports - a yearly summary report and a detailed monthly report, one for each analyzed month. The yearly summary report provides such information as the number of hits, file and page requests, hosts and visits, as well as daily averages of these counters for each month. The report is accompanied by a yearly summary graph. Each of the monthly reports is generated as a single HTML page containing a monthly summary report (listing the overall number of hits, file and page requests, visits, hosts, etc.), a daily report (grouping these counters for each of the days of the month), an aggregated hourly report (grouping counters for the same hour of each day together), a URL report (grouping collected information by URL), a host report (by IP address), website entry and exit URL reports (showing most common first and last visit URLs), a referrer report (grouping the referring third-party URLs leading to the analyzed website), a search string report (grouping items by search terms used in such search engines as Google), a user agent report (grouping by the browser type) and a country report (grouping by the host's country of origin). Each of the standard HTML reports described above lists only top entries for each item (e.g. top 20 URLs). The actual number of lines for each of the reports is controlled by configuration. The Webalizer may also be configured to produce a separate report for each of the items, which will list every single item, such as all website visitors, all requested URLs, etc. In addition to HTML reports, The Webalizer may be configured to produce comma-delimited dump files, which list all of the report data in a plain-text file. Dump files may be imported to spreadsheet applications or databases for further analysis. Internationalization HTML reports may be produced reports in over 30 languages, including Catalan, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Estonian, Finnish, French, Galician, German, Greek, Hungarian, Icelandic, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Latvian, Malay, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Portuguese (Brazil), Romanian, Russian, Serbian, Simplified Chinese, Slovak, Slovene, Spanish, Swedish, Turkish, Ukrainian. To generate reports in an alternate language requires a separate webalizer binary compiled specifically for that language. Criticism *Generated statistics do not differentiate between human visitors and robots. As a result, all reported metrics are higher than those due to people alone. Many webmasters claim that webalizer produces highly unrealistic figures of visits, which are sometimes 200 to 900% higher than the data produced by Javascript based web statistics such as Google Analytics or StatCounter. *Reported hits are too high for download managers with segmented downloads; each 206 \\"Partial Content\\" is reported as one hit. *No query string analysis.

History The Notting Hill Mystery first appeared as an eight-part serial in Once A Week magazine beginning on 29 November 1862, then as a single-volume novel in 1865 by Saunders, Otley, and Company, with illustrations by George du Maurier (grandfather of Daphne du Maurier). The magazine editors stated that the manuscript was submitted to them under the pseudonym \\"Charles Felix\\". In 1952, William Buckler identified Charles Warren Adams (1833‚Äì1903) as the author of The Notting Hill Mystery and in January 2011, Paul Collins, a writer, editor and academic, writing in The New York Times Book Review, came to the same conclusion. Adams, a lawyer, was the sole proprietor of Saunders, Otley & Co., which published another book by \\"Charles Felix\\" called Velvet Lawn, and an edition of The Notting Hill Mystery in 1865. Collins bases his theory on several lines of evidence, including a reference to Felix's identity as Adams in a 14 May 1864 \\"Literary Gossip\\" column of The Manchester Times: \\"It is understood that Velvet Lawn, by Charles Felix, the new novel announced by Messrs. Saunders, Otley & Co., is by Mr. Charles Warren Adams, now the sole representative of that firm.\\" Some critics ‚Äì including Julian Symons, a crime writer and poet ‚Äì believe it to be the first modern detective novel, though it was later overshadowed by works by Wilkie Collins and √âmile Gaboriau, which usually receive that accolade.Symons, Julian (1972), Bloody Murder: From the Detective Story to the Crime Novel. Faber and Faber (London). . p. 51: \\"There is no doubt that the first detective novel, preceding Collins and Gaboriau, was The Notting Hill Mystery.

Blackmore's sensation novel Clara Vaughan (written in 1853, published in 1864), about the daughter of a murder victim seeking her father's killer,The Victorian Web: Retrieved 7 February 2013. but Adams's novel contains several innovations, such as the main character presenting evidence of his own findings through diary entries, family letters, depositions, chemical analysts report and crime scene map. These techniques would not become common until the 1920s. Symons said it \\"quite bowled me over\\" how far ahead of its time it was. Plot Source documents compiled by insurance investigator Ralph Henderson are used to build a case against Baron \\"R___\\", who is suspected of murdering his wife. The baron's wife died from drinking a bottle of acid, apparently while sleepwalking in her husband's private laboratory.Staff writer (8 January 2011). \\"Who Wrote The First Detective Novel?\\". NPR. Retrieved 10 January 2011. Henderson's suspicions are raised when he learns that the baron recently had purchased five life insurance policies for his wife. As Henderson investigates the case, he discovers not one but three murders. The plot hinges on the dangers of mesmerism, a subject explored in fiction earlier by Isabella Frances Romer.Sturmer: a Tale of Mesmerism (London, 1841). Although the baron's guilt is clear to the reader even from the outset, how he did it remains a mystery. Eventually this is revealed, but how to catch him becomes the final challenge; he seems to have committed the perfect crime.

The unbuilt section from Doyle Drive to Van Ness Avenue was to have been called the Golden Gate Freeway and the Embarcadero Freeway as originally planned would have extended from Van Ness along the north side of Bay Street and then along the Embarcadero to the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge. The Embarcadero Freeway, which had only been constructed from Broadway along the Embarcadero to the Bay Bridge, was demolished after the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, and Doyle Drive is now part of U.S. Route 101. SR 480 was Interstate 480 (I-480), an auxiliary route of the Interstate Highway System, from 1955 to 1965. The entire route was removed in 1991, approximately two years after the earthquake. History 1955 map of the planned Interstates in the San Francisco Bay Area. I-480 would have run along the north side of the city, while I-280 would run south along the peninsula. I-80 was to have run past the east end of I-480 to end at I-280. Legislative Route 224 (LR 224) was defined in 1947 to connect U.S. Route 101 (US 101, pre-1964 Legislative Route 2) at the intersection of Lombard Street and Van Ness Avenue with US 40 and US 50 (pre-1964 Legislative Route 68) at the west end of the San Francisco‚ÄìOakland Bay Bridge (near the Transbay Terminal). Its alignment was roughly along Lombard Street and the Embarcadero. LR 224, as well as Route 2 (US 101) from Route 224 west to the junction with SR 1 near the Golden Gate Bridge, was added to the Interstate Highway System on September 15, 1955. This included the 1936 Doyle Drive, an early freeway built to access the Golden Gate Bridge. After some discussion, the I-480 number was assigned on November 10, 1958. (I-280, as originally planned, ran south from the west end of I-480 along SR 1, through the MacArthur Tunnel and Golden Gate Park, to join its present alignment in Daly City.) The original 1955 plan was to extend the Central Freeway as a double decked structure between Van Ness Avenue and Polk Street north to Clay Street, then as a single deck depressed freeway north to Broadway, where it would have tunneled under Russian Hill to connect with I-480. The first section of the Embarcadero Freeway, from the Bay Bridge approach (I-80) north to Broadway, opened in 1959 (the Clay Street and Washington Street ramps opened around 1965). The freeway revolt caused the San Francisco Board of Supervisors to pass Resolution 45‚Äì59 in January 1959, opposing certain freeways, including the remainder of I-480. The freeway revolt continued after a new freeway plan was proposed in 1964, with a major protest on May 17, 1964‚Äî200,000 people rallied in Golden Gate Park against any more new freeways. Poet Kenneth Rexroth spoke at the rally (among others), and folk singer Malvina Reynolds sang (she was most famous for her song \\"Little Boxes\\", attacking urban sprawl, which she sang at the anti-freeway rally). The proposed section as replanned in 1964 would have extended not from the Lombard Street exit of Doyle Drive along Lombard Street as originally planned in 1955, but from the Marina Boulevard exit off Doyle Drive, through the Marina Green and then along the north side of Fort Mason, then along the north side of Bay Street to the Embarcadero and south along the Embarcadero to connect with the Embarcadero Freeway. The section between the Golden Gate Bridge (including an upgraded Doyle Drive) and Van Ness Ave. would have been named the Golden Gate Freeway; the rest of the freeway east of Van Ness Avenue would have been the extended originally planned full length of the Embarcadero Freeway, originally planned to extend from Van Ness Avenue to the San Francisco‚ÄìOakland Bay Bridge‚Äîgoing east first down the north side of Bay Street, then going southeast curving around the base of Telegraph Hill and meeting at Broadway the former end of the actually built section of the Embarcadero Freeway. (map with route numbers added)\\"San Francisco Freeway Plan\\", 1964 [Revised from 1955 plan] San Francisco Department of City Planning map In the 1964 renumbering, Route 480 was designated for the full route of I-480, including the US 101 concurrency. The route was deleted from the Interstate Highway System in January 1968, and I-280 was rerouted north of Daly City at the same time. The short piece of former I-480 from the junction with new I-280 (previously SR 87) south to the Bay Bridge approach became part of I-280 (to allow I-280 to meet I-80), now named the Southern Embarcadero Freeway. These changes were made to the state highway system in 1968; Route 480 was truncated only slightly, with the from I-280 to SR 1 remaining, though downgraded to SR 480; this extension of I-280 south (the Junipero Serra Freeway) is considered the southern terminus of Junipero Serra Boulevard. Demise Ferry Building during demolition (May 1991) In the 1980s, opposition to the Embarcadero Freeway resurfaced in proposals to tear it down (which was first proposed in 1963). On November 5, 1985, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors voted to tear down the Embarcadero Freeway. The proposal was put to the voters in 1987 and soundly defeated, opposed in particular by influential Chinatown community organizer Rose Pak, who feared that Chinatown would suffer catastrophic consequences if it lost this fast crosstown connection. The October 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake significantly damaged the structure, causing it to be closed to traffic. The California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) planned to retrofit and retain the double-decker freeway. Various groups in and outside the city supported the Caltrans plan, but there was a significant opinion within the city in favor of removing the freeway structure. Then-Mayor Art Agnos proposed demolishing the freeway in favor of a boulevard with an underpass at the Ferry Building to allow for a large plaza. Opposition to demolishing the freeway mounted again, with over 20,000 signatures gathered to again create a ballot measure. Prior to the earthquake, the Embarcadero Freeway carried approximately 70,000 vehicles daily in the vicinity of the Ferry Building. Another 40,000 vehicles per day used associated ramps at Main and Beale streets. The strongest opposition came from Chinatown and other neighborhoods north of downtown. Merchants in Chinatown had suffered a dramatic decline in business in the months immediately following the earthquake and feared that if the freeway was not reopened they would not recover. Agnos continued to negotiate with federal and state officials to win enough funding to make the demolition practical, and the opposition relented. Agnos argued that the city would squander \\"the opportunity of a lifetime\\" if it allowed the freeway to remain. After months of debate, the Board of Supervisors narrowly voted in favor of demolition by a 6‚Äì5 margin. Demolition began on February 27, 1991. That year, Agnos was defeated for re-election as Chinatown switched its support away from him. Meanwhile, the state legislature deleted SR 480 from the state's Streets and Highway Code. The northwest section was transferred to US 101. The only piece of the Embarcadero Freeway to remain was the beginning of the ramp from the Bay Bridge to Fremont Street, including a short ramp stub that formerly carried traffic to the freeway (I-280 after 1968). This part was rebuilt as part of the Bay Bridge retrofit project. (I-280 was never finished to that interchange, though its legislative definition still takes it there.) In 2003, Caltrans began work on a retrofitting project to replace the western approach to the Bay Bridge. This retrofitting was part of a larger, $6-billion project to upgrade the aging Bay Bridge to modern earthquake standards, which included replacing the entire eastern span. In late 2005, Caltrans began the demolition of the original western approach after traffic was routed onto a temporary bypass structure. The western approach to the Bay Bridge was completed in 2009; the entire project was completed in 2013. As a result of this retrofitting project, all old parts of the approach have been replaced, removing the last traces of the Embarcadero Freeway. Legacy The Embarcadero in 2011 Along the waterfront, the former freeway was replaced with a wide, palm-lined boulevard with San Francisco Municipal Railway tracks in the median. The E Embarcadero and F Market & Wharves heritage streetcar lines and N Judah and T Third Street light rail lines were extended to run along the Embarcadero. Sue Bierman Park replaced offramps just north of the Embarcadero Center, and Ferry Plaza was constructed in front of the San Francisco Ferry Building, which itself was remodeled into an upscale gourmet marketplace in 2003. Other new parks include Pier 14 Public Pier, Rincon Park near Folsom Street, and the Brannan Street Wharf. A former onramp at Broadway and Sansome streets was redeveloped into 75 low-income housing units. Along the north side of Folsom Street between Essex and Spear streets, former freeway right-of-way was transferred to the City of San Francisco and included in the Transbay Redevelopment Plan, which calls for the development of over 2,500 new homes, of new office and commercial space, and of retail. The demolition of the freeway and redevelopment of the Embarcadero has been cited by urban planners from jurisdictions around the world studying freeway removal projects, including Seattle, Massachusetts, and Toronto. In a 2004 retrospective of the Loma Prieta earthquake, San Francisco Chronicle architecture critic John King wrote: > [The Embarcadero Freeway] cut off the downtown from the water that gave > birth to it, and it left the iconic Ferry Building ‚Äì a statuesque survivor > of the 1906 ‚Äì stranded behind a dark wall of car exhaust and noise. > Oppressive does not begin to describe it... Take a walk today on the 2 > 1/2-mile promenade between Fisherman's Wharf on the north and China Basin on > the south, and it's hard to believe that an elevated freeway ever scarred > the open air. On June 16, 2006, the Port of San Francisco unveiled a monument at Pier 14 to Mayor Agnos honoring his vision, noting: \\"This pedestrian pier commemorates the achievement of Mayor Agnos in leaving our city better and stronger than he found it.\\" Popular culture The Embarcadero Freeway was featured in several films, including Magnum Force, Freebie and the Bean, Bullitt, Serial, Superman IV: The Quest for Peace, The Lineup, Time After Time, Innerspace, and Koyaanisqatsi. On television, the freeway was seen in such shows as Full House (in several overhead screen shots) and The Streets of San Francisco. In 1985, four years before its destruction, James Bond (played for the last time by Roger Moore) drove along the freeway in A View to a Kill as he followed his ally Stacey Sutton (Tanya Roberts) during his quest to eliminate the villainous Max Zorin (Christopher Walken). For a sequence at the beginning of the 2007 film Zodiac, which takes place in the late 1960s and early 1970s, the now-demolished freeway was digitally added behind a shot of the Ferry Building. In the 1993 NBC made-for-TV movie Miracle on Interstate 880, the Embarcadero Freeway, which was being demolished at the time, was used in place of the Cypress Street Viaduct in Oakland, California. The film focuses on the survival of three victims who survived the collapse of the similarly designed two-level I-880 freeway during the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. In the science fiction alternative-history novel The Man in the High Castle by Philip K. Dick, the sight of the Embarcadero Freeway deeply rattles a character who has apparently stumbled into a different reality.

I-480 is one of 13 auxiliary Interstate Highways in the state. The western terminus of I-480 is an interchange with I-80 and the Ohio Turnpike in North Ridgeville. Starting east through suburban Lorain County, I-480 enters Cuyahoga County, then approaches Cleveland Hopkins International Airport, which serves as the primary airport for Northeast Ohio. After traversing Brooklyn and crossing the Cuyahoga River on the Valley View Bridge, the highway continues east towards the communities of Bedford and Twinsburg toward its eastern terminus at I-80 and the Ohio Turnpike in Streetsboro. On its route, I-480 crosses I-71 and I-77 and is concurrent with I-271 for approximately . In 1998, the Governor of Ohio, George Voinovich, gave I-480 the additional name of the \\"Senator John Glenn Highway\\", in honor of the former NASA astronaut and a U.S. Senator from Ohio for 24 years. Parts of I-480 were to have been I-271 and/or I-80N. Route description The freeway runs concurrently with I-271 for . I-271 and I-480 are the only two three-digit Interstates in the nation that run concurrently with each other for any distance. This is because I-80 was concurrent with I-271 until 1971, when I-80 was routed back on to the turnpike and replaced by I-480. Due to the convergence of these high traffic roads, congestion is common during peak times. They run concurrently through Bedford Heights, Bedford, and Oakwood in Cuyahoga County. Because of that, the Ohio Department of Transportation started a $120 million widening project in 2016, expanding the concurrency to five lanes in each direction. The project is expected to be completed in late 2020. Broadway/Forbes interchange in 2002 The Valley View Bridge, which is high and spans , carries I-480 across the Cuyahoga River valley. It is the busiest crossing in the state of Ohio with approximately 180,000 cars per day. An expansion and deck replacement project began in 2018, which includes building a third bridge between the existing bridges to allow for deck replacement of the existing bridges with minimal disruption of traffic. When completed, scheduled for 2024, plans call for the bridges to carry six lanes of traffic in each direction. History I-480 was conceived as a means of giving motorists a faster way of crossing Cleveland's southern borders and suburbs. The first segment of the route was partially concurrent with I-271, and constructed simultaneously with that highway in 1965. Planning for the route was largely finished by 1968, and construction began on its first mile began at the highway's interchange with I-77 in 1970. The segment from Bedford west to Maple Heights opened in November 1976. The segment from Maple Heights west to Brooklyn Heights opened in January 1978. Construction from west to east began as political controversies and engineering work were resolved on the highway's middle section. I-480 between I-80 and I-71 was completed in 1983. The of the route north and northeast of Cleveland Hopkins International Airport proved the most difficult to plan due to existing high levels of traffic on Brookpark Road and the expansion requirements of the airport. The final $115 million (equivalent to $ in ), segment linking the east and west ends of I-480 was finished in August 1987. Exit listInterstate 480N The spur freeway connecting I-480 to I-271 and US 422 is officially designated as Interstate 480N, by the Ohio Department of Transportation.

Practices and areas that should be separated under the more strict interpretations of the doctrine of separation include: *Mental Life: Thoughts, reading, attitudes *Physical Life: Dress, physical contact, entertainment, speech *Social Life: Friendships, courtship, career *Spiritual Life: Personal devotional life, fellowship with other Christians, the Church The doctrine of separation often leads to ecclesiastical separatism, in which Christians leave Christian denominations that they believe are apostate (Rev. 18:4).

It runs concurrently with U.S. Route 395 (US 395) from an intersection with US 50 near the southern boundary of Carson City to the Reno Spaghetti Bowl interchange with I-80 in Reno. The freeway provides a high-speed direct route between Lake Tahoe and Carson City to Reno and I-80. Construction on a freeway between Carson City and Reno was planned since 1956, but construction did not occur until 1964. The freeway opened in sections, with the final section opening on August 2, 2017. The I-580 designation was approved on October 27, 1978, but the freeway was not signed as such until the portion between Reno and Carson City was completed following the opening of the Galena Creek Bridge in late August 2012. Route description I-580 and US 395 route markers between Carson City and Reno I-580 runs from an intersection with US 50 in Carson City to an interchange with I-80 near downtown Reno. The only portion remaining to be constructed is the interchange at the freeway's southern terminus. Within Reno, the freeway is designated as the Martin Luther King, Jr., Freeway. Within Carson City, the freeway is designated the Carson City Deputy Sheriff Carl Howell Memorial Freeway, in honor of a sheriff's officer who was shot to death while attempting to rescue a victim of domestic violence from her house. The freeway begins at the junction of US 395 with the Lake Tahoe leg of US 50 and follows the eastern edge of Eagle Valley, where most of the population of Carson City resides. The highway loosely follows the former alignments of Edmonds Drive and Lompa Lane along the eastern half of the city, which were relocated or truncated to make room for the freeway. After rejoining the original alignment of US 395 at the Carson Tahoe Regional Medical Center, the highway crests Lakeview Hill to enter the Washoe Valley. The portion of I-580/US 395 and US 395 Alternate through Washoe Valley are prone to high crosswinds and, as such, the highways are frequently closed to high-profile vehicles. During prohibited times, trucks are rerouted to Eastlake Boulevard and US 395 Alternate (US 395 Alt.), which is the old route of US 395\\\\. The high wind area ends near the Bowers Mansion interchange near the northern end of the Washoe Valley. Unlike the old US 395 which ran along the valley floor of Pleasant Valley, I-580 is routed in the mountains overlooking the valley. While traversing Pleasant Valley, the highway crosses the Galena Creek Bridge, the largest cathedral arch bridge in the world. Upon the descent from these mountains the highway cuts through the center of one of the largest geothermal power plants in the United States, Ormat Industries' Nevada Power station, just before entering Reno. View from U.S. Route 50 eastbound towards southern end of I-580 at intersection with U.S. Route 395. View seen by northbound traffic approaching north end of I-580 at interchange with I-80 At the extreme southern edge of Reno, the highway has a junction with the Mount Rose Highway (SR 431) and Geiger Grade (SR 341), which connect the freeway with North Lake Tahoe and Virginia City, respectively. Upon entering Reno, the freeway proceeds in a generally northern direction, crossing Virginia Street, the old routing of US 395, several times. Along the way the freeway passes to the side of The Summit mall, Meadowood Mall and Reno‚ÄìTahoe International Airport. The elevated freeway also passes over a bus garage used by RTC Washoe, the local bus agency. The I-580 designation ends at the Reno Spaghetti Bowl where the highway crosses I-80; however, the freeway continues on only as US 395, heading towards the north valley neighborhoods of Sun Valley, Lemon Valley, Stead, Cold Springs Valley and Bordertown (which are all entirely part of the City of Reno) before eventually crossing the California state line. History US 395 running through Pleasant Valley, as seen from Geiger Grade (SR 341), with the I-580 extension under construction in the mountains above Development of the I-580/US 395 freeway has been in planning since 1956, but significant construction did not occur until 1964. The freeway would be opened gradually over time, and would initially be constructed in two main separate sections before 2012. The first segment of freeway constructed along I-580 was the Washoe Valley segment, which was constructed between 1964 and 1970 between present-day Bowers Mansion Road/Carson‚ÄìReno Highway (exit 50, now exit 16) near Washoe City, south through Washoe Valley to just north of North Carson Street (exit 43, now exit 8) in Carson City. Northbound I-580 and US 395, approaching the Neil Road and Meadowood Mall Way interchange (exit 62, now exit 30) The Reno section was constructed between 1973 and 1996. In 1973, the section running between US 395 Bus. (exit 72) to East Second Street/Glendale Avenue (exit 67, now exit 35) in Reno opened to traffic. This section was extended south to Mill Street (exit 66, now exit 34) in 1978, Plumb Lane/Villanova Drive (exit 65, now exit 33) in 1979, South Virginia Street/Kietzke Lane (exit 63, now exit 31) in 1981, Neil Road/Meadowood Mall Way (exit 62, now exit 30) in 1986, South Virginia Street (exit 61, now exit 29) in 1989 and Mount Rose Highway (exit 56, now exit 24) in 1996. The Carson City section was constructed in the 2000s with the construction of the Carson City Bypass project. The first phase completed the freeway from North Carson Street (exit 43, now exit 8) south to East William Street (exit 39, now exit 5) in 2006. The freeway was extended south to Fairview Drive (exit 38, now exit 3) in 2009. On August 2, 2017, the final section of the freeway between Fairview Drive (exit 38, now exit 3) and South Carson Street in Carson City opened to traffic. In 2012, the section between Mount Rose Highway (exit 56, now exit 24) and Bowers Mansion Road/Carson‚ÄìReno Highway (exit 50, now exit 16) south of Reno opened following the opening of the Galena Creek Bridge to traffic in late August 2012, connecting the two main segments together. After the completion of this section, the freeway south of I-80 (US 395 southbound exit 68 and I-580 northbound exit 36) was signed as I-580, officially connecting Carson City to the Interstate Highway System. This left four other state capitals still not served by the Interstate Highway System: Dover, Delaware; Juneau, Alaska; Pierre, South Dakota; and Jefferson City, Missouri. The I-580 designation was first approved by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) on October 27, 1978; at the time, this route extended from I-80 to US 395 (South Virginia Street, at exit 63, now exit 31). AASHTO approved the remainder of planned I-580, to the southern terminus at US 50, US 395 and US 395 Bus. south of Carson City, at its December 7, 1984, meeting. Despite the route number being approved and being shown on some maps in the 1980s, I-580 was not signed along the Interstate until the freeway gap between Mount Rose Highway and Bowers Mansion Road was completed in 2012. In October 2019, NDOT began replacing US 395 exit numbers with I-580 exit numbers per federal requirements on the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices. Exit list Old exits on I-580 were numbered according to US 395 mileposts.

Tryon Branch Library) -- 5740 N. 9th Ave. *Molino Branch Library -- 6450-A Highway 95A, in the Molino Community Center History In 1885, the Pensacola Library Association organized as a subscription library. The library had 184 members who paid .25/month to use the library. During the years of 1904, 1910, 1911 and 1919, the city made attempts to secure Carnegie funds for a public library, however, because the city failed to provide a site and future support for such a library, it was unable to obtain the funds. The city later allotted 25.00/month and then 50.00/month to the library. Still, the library moved to various locations downtown and, at some point, a bond election failed. In 1933, the subscription library closed and its books were stored in the San Carlos Hotel. In February 1937, the Pensacola City Council passed an ordinance to establish a free public library and it created a five-member board. In January 1938, Lucia Tryon was hired as librarian to convert Old Christ Church to the city's first public library which opened on February 15, 1938 with 3352 books. Also in 1938, the Shakespeare Club opened a library on Oak St. in Milton Florida. By March 1, 1938, the Pensacola free public library counted 2,375 cardholders. On August 17, 1952, the Alice S. Williams branch was opened to serve the black community and in 1957, a new Pensacola public library opened at Spring and Gregory St. Finally, in 1963, the city of Santa Rosa entered into an inter- local agreement with the city of Pensacola with service to 1800 patrons at the Milton branch library. This was the beginning of the West Florida Regional Library System.Florida Library History Project/ Pensapedia/http://digital.lib.usf.edu/fl-libraryhistory Funding and administration The Escambia County branches and the Bookmobile are funded primarily by the City of Pensacola and Escambia County. The branches also receive aid supplement funds from the State, as well as federal grant money. The West Florida Public Library System is administered by the West Florida Public Library Board, which is made up of nine members, three of which are appointed by the Pensacola City Council and the Escambia County Commission. While several libraries in Santa Rosa County (including the Gulf Breeze, Jay Navarre & Milton branches) used to be a part of the West Florida Regional Library system, they have since parted ways, hence the name change to 'West Florida Public Library'.

Dunleer is situated midway between Dundalk and Drogheda and is located on the junction of the R132, R169 and R170 regional roads that intersect the town. Dunleer used to be the principal Town Borough in the Barony of Ferrard and has a Charter dating back to 1252. History Athclare Castle lies approximately 1.5km south of Dunleer The town has ties to the early sixth century Christian monastery of Lann Leire. The monastery, which was located approximately where today Dunleer's Church of Ireland church is now located, suffered numerous attacks over its history and was finally burned to the ground in 1148. After a period of ruin, the Norman family of De Audley settled the area about thirty years later. In 1513, John Barnewall was knighted and received large grants of land in the Dunleer area, including the manor of Dunleer. It is possible that it was at this time that the settlement became known as \\"Dun\\" Leire. It is hard to determine when it changed to \\"Dun\\" There is a reference to \\"the ville of Dun Leire\\" in old records dating from 1227. The town was raised to the status of a Manor at this time. Dunleer was subsequently granted a Market Town Charter in 1252, with the right to hold a Fair and Markets at various times. Dunleer is the principal town in the former Barony of Ferrard and was granted an enhanced Charter by King Charles II in 1671 to hold markets and fairs. This was followed by Royal Charter in 1678 establishing Dunleer as a Municipal Corporation (Town Borough Council). This was to encourage greater settlement. The Corporation had 13 members, and annually elected a mayor, known as \\"Sovereign\\" of the Borough. It was the very last Borough to be established in Ireland. Dunleer at one time also elected two members of parliament to the old Irish House of Commons, which was abolished by the Act of Union in 1801. After the Act of Union between the English and Irish House of Commons, there was very little business for the Corporation to do. It last convened in 1811. Demographics Dunleer's population grew from 1,104 to 1,822 inhabitants between the 1991 and 2016 census. Dunleer's proximity to Drogheda, Ardee, Dundalk, and its location as a crossroads on the main north-south economic corridor of Ireland have made this once rural village officially a town. Industry Dunleer has been a centre of industry from the 17th Century. At one time it had three water powered mills. Rosevale; which was a flax mill (location of today's Glen Dimplex on the Barn Road), Skibbolmore; which was a steel pin manufacturing mill (later converted to flour milling) and Glebe Mill (operating since 1698) which is still producing stone ground flour in small amounts from time to time for the artisan trade. Dunleer has also been a centre of domestic appliance manufacturing since the late 1930s, and is still a centre of manufacturing, with two factories employing several hundred people. There are also a number of services firms in the area. Dunleer is also home to Suretank, an industrial liquid container technology firm. Other businesses include Swift Composites, and M-Cor 3D Printing and fabrication technologies located in Dunleer's Shamrock Hill Business Park. Glen Dimplex the local company also produces technology to help upgrade homes and businesses. Dunleer Development Board founded a \\"New Energy Ambassador\\" program to help people reduce energy costs and upgrade their homes in 2016 and 2017. Education Dunleer is served by several schools, all of which are co- educational facilities. The town has three mixed gender national (primary) schools: St. Kevins National School, St. Fintan's National School, and St. Brigids National School. Scoil Ui Mhuiri Post Primary, the only secondary school in the local area, is a mixed post-primary school which is located on Barn Road in Dunleer. The school has seen the construction of a number of extensions over the years, and has 586 pupils enrolled with over 50 staff employed. The school received funding for a multimillion-euro extension but (as of 2018), the work was halted. The work was originally planned to be finished before the end of 2018. Amenities and community life St. Brigid's Church, in Dunleer dates to the early 19th century Dunleer has a Roman Catholic church (St. Brigid's) and a Church of Ireland Church. There is also a community library which is located in the old Station Master's House on Station Road. The local Pavilion Centre has an indoor basketball arena and gym facilities. Dunleer also has an outdoor athletics racing track, the home of Dunleer Athletic Club, located on Lann L√©ire C.P.G. football sports campus. Dunleer A.C. organise the world-famous Ras na hEireann Cross-Country International Athlete Races. Efforts are underway to establish a Gaelscoil (an Irish language medium primary school) in the area. The Market House of Dunleer reopened during July 2014. It is the civic centre of Dunleer Village, and is a civic body established by the Dunleer Community Development Board, whom are the trustees of the building. The board formed a Limited Liability Company, known as DCDB Limited to manage the market house as a civic amenity. Dunleer has a number of community groups, many of which are affiliated to the community umbrella body, the Dunleer Community Development Board. One such community group is the Dunleer Tidy Towns committee. The Tidy Towns committee partners with Dunleer Development Board in funding projects and have succeeded in 2016 and 2017. Part of the strategy for developing the town is expected be the development of a river walk along the White River which runs through Dunleer. Dunleer was a prize winner (2nd place) in the 2017 Pride of Place an All Ireland Competition. And Dunleer also won the Leinster and All Ireland Enterprise town of the year Award 2018 (posted January 2019). Sport Dunleer is home to Lannleire GFC, the town's only Gaelic football club. The club grounds are one of the largest in the county, with an athletics club accommodated at the grounds too. Transport Dunleer station and platform on the Belfast-Dublin Line Dunleer railway station opened on 1 April 1851, closed for goods traffic on 2 December 1974 and finally closed altogether on 26 November 1984. The local community has an ongoing campaign to have the railway station reopened, and there was a public meeting held on 21 February 2008 in which the public gave support to having the existing station reopened. During September 2009, it became an issue during the formation of the forthcoming Louth County Development Plan, and after much debate and discussion amongst the public and their public representatives, Dunleer's station was granted equal status with Drogheda and Dundalk in being eligible during the lifetime of the plan as a preferable location to have another railway station opened on the Dublin - Belfast rail corridor. The railway station was refurbished in 2014, but still remains closed to the public. The town is served by a bus service, which links the town primarily to Drogheda and Dundalk, and some direct services to and from Dublin city daily.  Location  Located adjacent to the M1 motorway to its west, there is access to and from the M1, as Dunleer is served by three motorway interchanges (M1 Junctions 12, 13 and 14) and is bisected by the main Dublin-Belfast railway line. These linkages played a part in Dunleer changing from a mainly rural town to an expanding commuter town for those working primarily in Dublin, Drogheda and Dundalk. Annalistic references * 919.

KEKB was a particle accelerator used in the Belle experiment to study CP violation. KEKB was located at the KEK (High Energy Accelerator Research Organisation) in Tsukuba, Ibaraki Prefecture, Japan. It has been superseded by its upgrade, the SuperKEKB accelerator (located at the same site). The SuperKEKB is a luminosity upgrade of KEKB. SuperKEKB had its first particle collisions in 2018. The SuperKEKB accelerator produces particle beams for the Belle II experiment, which is an upgrade of the Belle experiment (located at the same site as Belle). The Belle experiments studied b-quark hadrons to research CP violation. KEKB was called a B-factory for its copious production of B-mesons which provide a golden mode to study and measure the CP violation due to its property of decaying into other lighter mesons. KEKB was basically an asymmetric electron‚Äìpositron collider, with electrons having the energy of 8 GeV and positrons having the energy of 3.5 GeV, giving 10.58 GeV centre-of-mass energy, which is equal to the mass of the Œ•(4S) meson. There are basically two rings for accelerating electrons and positrons. The ring for electrons, having energy of 8 GeV, is called the high-energy ring (HER), while the ring for positrons, having energy of 3.5 GeV, is called low-energy ring (LER). The HER and LER are constructed side-by-side in the tunnel, which has been excavated already in the past for the former TRISTAN accelerator. TRISTAN was the first site to confirm vacuum polarization around an electron and operated at center-of-mass energies between 50 and 61.4 GeV. There were four experiments at the old TRISTAN accelerator: Venus, Topaz, AMY, and Jade. The RF cavities in the HER use superconducting RF (SRF) technology, whereas the RF cavities in the LER use a normal conducting design denoted ARES.K. Akai et al., \\"RF systems for the KEK B-Factory\\", Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research A 499 (2003) 45‚Äì65 The circumference of each ring is 3016 m, having four straight sections. In the KEKB, there is only one interaction point in the \\"Tsukuba area\\", where the Belle experiment is located. The other areas (called \\"Fuji\\", \\"Nikko\\" and \\"Oho\\") are currently not actively used by an experiment. Since the energy of the electrons and positrons is asymmetric, the B meson pairs are created with a Lorentz boost Œ≤Œ≥ of 0.425, allowing measurements of the B meson decay times via the distance from the (known) collision point. A section of the KEKB accelerator. The left-hand ring (blue) is for electrons, and the right-hand ring (green) is for positrons. KEKB's leading finite crossing angle interaction design provides its high luminosity. In the last upgrade, KEKB installed crab cavities on each of its accelerating beams to rotate the bunches of accelerating electrons or positrons, hoping to further increase its luminosity. However, the improvement is not clear and currently under tuning. As of June 2009 KEKB was the world's highest luminosity machine, with a world record of more than cm‚àí2s‚àí1.

Career His father Svante Arnold Afzelius (1923‚Äì1976) was an engineer and his mother Ulla Afzelius (1926‚Äì1971) was a housewife. His only sibling is his brother Bengt (b. 1952) who is a music teacher. He came into contact with music from a very young age, because his mother and her side of the family were largely into music. In 1970, Afzelius formed the progg group Hoola Bandoola Band together with Mikael Wiehe. Wiehe and Afzelius became very close friends and worked together long after Hoola Bandoola had dissolved in 1975. Afzelius released his first solo album in 1974, his last one in 1999. Some of his most popular songs are \\"Ikaros\\", \\"Tusen bitar\\" (Thousand pieces ‚Äì which was originally recorded by Danish Anne Linnet as \\"Tusind Stykker\\"), \\"S√•ng till friheten\\" (Song for Freedom ‚Äì which was originally recorded by Cuban Silvio Rodr√≠guez as \\"El D√≠a Feliz Que Est√° Llegando\\"), \\"Kungens man\\" (The king's man), \\"Tankar i Havanna\\" (Thoughts in Havanna) and \\"Till min k√§ra\\" (For my dear). He died from lung cancer in 1999, 52 years old, but he remains one of the most beloved artists in Scandinavia. He wrote about 150 songs and sold over two-and-a-half million albums.

History In 1965, Roy Orbison was riding high with the hit single \\"Oh, Pretty Woman\\", which was No. 1 globally, when word got about that his Monument contract was due to expire in June. Orbison was interested in Hollywood and signed to MGM Records for $1 million for three albums per year from 1965-1985. Half of the money went to Decca's London Records. He also was looking for freedom when he signed with the label. His producer for Monument Records, Fred Foster and Orbison's manager Wesley Rose were having disagreements about whether or not to keep Orbison.

Its origines are connected to the lectures delivered in Romanian by Gheorghe LazƒÉr in the Princely Academy, beginning with 1818. After the Hetairia movement from 1821, the Ottoman Sultan forbade the existence of Greek schools, but he allowed the existence of Romanian schools. Thus, by the efforts of LazƒÉr and of other professors that associated with him, like Eufrosin Poteca, Ion Heliade RƒÉdulescu, Vasile Ardelean, a.k.a.

Originally based in the Kona town of Captain Cook and later headquartered in Hilo, the Journal focused on political, environmental, and cultural news. The print paper shut in 2008 and as of 2014, the website has not been updated since 2011. History The Hawaii Island Journal grew out of the Big Island news and opinion magazine Ka'u Landing, which had been publishing since 1992. Both publications were established and edited by Michael Gibson. Ka'u Landing was noted for its glossy covers featuring works by local artists (the inside pages were newsprint). After seeing a marked decline in Ka'u Landing's circulation over the past several years, Gibson decided to start an islandwide community newspaper. The content was eclectic, ranging from reprints of a contributor's grandmother's letters to lengthy articles on environmental issues. In 2001 Gibson sold the newspaper to Lane Wick and Karen Valentine, who shifted the Journal 's focus to local politics and environmental news. From 2002 to 2005, Gretchen Currie Kelly served as editor, expanding the paper's focus to include comprehensive coverage of Native Hawaiian issues as well as investigative reporting of development issues on the island. HIJ's format allowed for in- depth exploration of topics that were only being superficially covered in the island's dailies, and the paper became a uniquely valuable source of information for island residents. Award-winning journalist Alan McNarie, who had begun writing for Ka'u Landing, continued with HIJ and was the paper's senior contributor. Between 2001 and 2007, HIJ's circulation grew to 24,000, making it the widest-circulation paper on Hawaii island. Honolulu Weekly acquired the Journal in the spring of 2005. Peter Serafin was named as HIJ's new editor. An article in the June 11, 2008 issue of The Honolulu Advertiser reported that the Journal would close in June. Competition In a letter published in the July 19, 2006 issue of Honolulu Weekly, publisher Laurie V. Carlson noted the Stephens Media Group has offered to buy the Journal, but Honolulu Weekly refused its offer. She added, \\"Apparently Stephens sees the Journal as a threat to their printing and daily newspaper monopoly because they are launching what they refer to as an alternative (to what, one might ask?) publication. We suspect that whatever they come up with will be entertainment heavy and will avoid the serious issues that can draw criticism and cancelled advertising orders from the advertising community.\\" In December 2006 the aforementioned Stephens publication made its debut as Big Island Weekly. Speaking on the Journal's demise, Carlson told the Honolulu Star- Bulletin that \\"[Stephens] can run something that was heavily subsidized and we can't. It's a very sad thing.\\" ReferencesExternal links *Official site Category:Biweekly newspapers published in the United States Category:Defunct newspapers published in Hawaii Category:Publications established in 1999 Category:1999 establishments in Hawaii Category:Publications disestablished in 2011 Category:2011 disestablishments in Hawaii ","title":"Hawaii Island Journal"},{"id":"1635983","text":"Thomas Wharton, 1st Baron Wharton (1495 ‚Äì 23 August 1568) was an English nobleman and a follower of King Henry VIII of England. He is best known for his victory at Solway Moss on 24 November 1542 for which he was given a barony.Subject studies include: M.E. James, Change and Continuity in the Tudor North: The Rise of Thomas First Lord Wharton, Borthwick Papers no. 27 (University of York, 1965); Alan Davidson, 'Wharton, Thomas I (c. 1495-1568), of Wharton and Nateby, Westmorland, and Healaugh, Yorks', The History of Parliament 1509-1558 (article published 1982) Read here. Early life He was born in Wharton, Kirkby Stephen, Westmorland, the eldest son of Sir Thomas Wharton of Wharton Hall and his wife Agnes Warcup, daughter of Reynold or Reginald Warcup of Smardale. His younger brother was the English martyr Christopher Wharton. His father died around 1520, and in April 1522 he served on a raiding expedition into Scotland. Officer on the Scottish border On 10 February 1524 he was placed on the commission for the peace in Cumberland, and on 20 June 1527 he is said to have been knighted at Windsor. To the parliament that met on 3 November 1529, Wharton was returned for Appleby, but on the 9th he was pricked for High Sheriff of Cumberland. On 30 June 1531 he was appointed commissioner for redress of outrages on the Anglo-Scottish Border. On 6 February 1532 he was made Justice of the Peace for the East Riding of Yorkshire, and on 19 March for Northumberland, and he was usually included in the commissions for Cumberland and Westmorland. In 1531 he purchased the manor of Healaugh, near Tadcaster where he resided for the latter part of his life. =Official posts= In 1532 he appears to have been captain of Cockermouth, and, as comptroller, was associated with Henry Percy, 6th Earl of Northumberland in the government of the border marches. This followed the grant in 1530 of the hereditary lieutenancy of Cockermouth by Northumberland, part of a package of gifts designed to allow Wharton to take over military duties from the ailing Northumberland, and they would remain closely associated until his death. On 29 June 1534 Northumberland recommended Wharton's appointment as captain of Carlisle, and on 9 July he was commissioned to inquire into the ‚Äòtreasons‚Äô of William Dacre, 3rd Baron Dacre of Gilsland, against Northumberland; Dacre was brought to trial, but acquitted by his peers. On 22 November 1535 Wharton was again appointed sheriff of Cumberland. During the northern rebellions of 1536 Wharton remained loyal to Henry VIII. In October 1536 the rebels marched on his house at Kirkby Stephen to force Wharton to join them, but he had escaped and joined the Duke of Norfolk, under whom he served during the troubles; he was one of the king's representatives at the conference at York on 24 November, with Robert Aske and his followers. His appointment as Warden of the West Marches was suggested as a reward for his services; but Norfolk instead recommended Henry Clifford, 1st Earl of Cumberland, for the post. Wharton was, however, on 28 June 1537 appointed deputy warden, and in the same year was acting as a visitor of monasteries in Cumberland. He was unpopular with the older nobility, being one of the new men on whom the Tudors relied; Robert Holgate, as President of the Council of the North, commented on the disdain of his neighbours. On 17 November 1539 he was for the third time appointed sheriff of Cumberland; on 14 May 1541 he sent Henry an account of the state of Scotland, and on 22 October the king ordered reprisals for the burning of some barns near Bewcastle by the Scots; two days later he added the captaincy of Carlisle to his office of deputy warden, and on 3 January 1542 he was returned to parliament as knight of the shire for Cumberland. =Battle of Solway Moss= During 1542 both English and Scots were preparing for war, and Wharton submitted a plan for raiding Scotland and seizing the person of James V at Lochmaben; the council, however, disapproved of the idea. Wharton burnt Dumfries on 5 October, and on 23 November made another raid, doing as much damage as he could. Meanwhile, the Scots had planned an extensive invasion of the west marches, of which Wharton was kept informed by spies. At supper on the 23rd he received definite information of an impending attack on the morrow: the Scots were said to be fourteen (or even twenty) thousand strong, while Wharton could only muster a few hundred men. With these he watched the progress of the Scots over the River Esk during the 24th; towards evening he attacked their left; under Oliver Sinclair, the Scots became entangled in Solway Moss at the mouth of the river. Many including nobles were taken prisoner, killed, or drowned, while the English loss was small. Before the Privy Council had heard of his victory at Solway Moss, on 30 November they wrote requesting Wharton to review the building works of the Moravian military engineer Stefan von Haschenperg at Carlisle. On 12 December 1542, the Council read his official report of the battle.John Roche Dasent, ed., Acts of the Privy Council, vol. 1 (1890), 59, 63 =The Rough Wooing= In 1543 Wharton was occupied with forays into Scotland, and with intrigues to win over disaffected Scots nobles and obtain control of the south-west of Scotland. For his services in these matters and at Solway Moss he was early in 1544 raised to the peerage as Baron Wharton, and in letters of the period was called \\"Lord Wharton.\\" Exactly how this happened was the subject of later interest.The fact that his patent was not enrolled and could not be found led to the assumption that he was created by writ of summons to parliament from 30 January 1544‚Äì5 to 30 September 1566, in which case the barony would descend to his heirs general and not merely to his heirs male, as in the case of creation by patent; and in 1843‚Äì4 Charles Kemeys-Tynte, a descendant in the female line, laid claim to the barony, which was considered extinct since the outlawry of Philip, Duke of Wharton, on 3 April 1729. The House of Lords decided that this outlawry was illegal, and, assuming the barony to have been created by writ, declared Kemeys-Tynte heir to a third part of the barony (Courthope ed., Complete Peerage, p. 509). In fact the barony was created by patent; on 20 March 1543‚Äì4 Hertford wrote to Henry VIII that he had on the 18th at Newcastle delivered to Wharton the king's letters patent, creating him a baron (Hamilton Papers, ii. 303; Academy, 1896, i. 489; G. E. C[okayne]'s Complete Peerage, viii. 124, 130; cf. Hatfield MSS. i. 27, 28). Charles Harding Firth considered therefore that the decision of the House of Lords was erroneous. In 1544, Wharton acted as a commissioner to draw up terms and bonds of assurance with the disaffected Scots for an English invasion, and the marriage of Mary, Queen of Scots and Prince Edward, which the Parliament of Scotland had rejected. Wharton held musters at Keswick and Penrith in March 1544. In April the Earl of Hertford gave him particular instructions to carefully entertain offers of alliance from Lord Maxwell and his heir, Robert, and Lord Fleming. Robert Maxwell offered to hand over Lochmaben Castle and three other strongholds; Caerlaverock Castle, \\"Langhole\\" and Threave Castle.HMC Salisbury, Hatfield, vol. 1 (London, 1883) pp. 30, 33-35. Wharton kept guard at Carlisle, as Warden of the West March, while the Earl of Hertford burnt Edinburgh in May 1544. Later in May 1544 border troops were sent to accompany Henry VIII to France, but Wharton was refused leave to join them on the grounds that he could not be spared from the marches. Wharton then helped plan a \\"Warden raid\\" on Jedburgh, which was led by William and Ralph Eure.HMC Salisbury, Hatfield, vol.1 (London, 1883), pp. 40-41 Haynes (1740), pp. 37, 39. Border forays and intrigues with Angus, Glencairn, Lord Maxwell, and others, who professed to desire the marriage of the Mary Queen of Scots to Edward, occupied Wharton for the rest of Henry VIII's reign. In December 1646 Wharton wrote to Wriothesley about gold-mining in Scotland at Crawford Moor, and offered to investigate the ground. Wharton recalled a conversation with the Scottish ambassador Adam Otterburn, who said that James IV had mines but only found loose pieces of gold or gold ore rather than a vein, and spent more on the work than he recovered. The Duke of Albany also opened mines. Wharton owned a gold medallion coined by Albany, said to be minted from Scottish gold.State Papers Henry VIII, 5:4 (London, 1836), pp. 574-5, 1 December 1546. =War under Edward VI= With the accession of Edward VI the War of the Rough Wooing continued, with effort being made by Somerset as Lord Protector to complete the marriage, and a Scottish raid in March 1547 provided a pretext for his invasion. On the 24th the council asked Wharton for two despatches, one giving an exact account of the raid, the other exaggerating the number of raiders and towns pillaged. The latter was intended to justify English reprisals, in the eyes of the French king, and prevent his giving aid to the Scots. In September following, while Somerset invaded Scotland from Berwick-upon-Tweed, Wharton and the Earl of Lennox created a diversion by an incursion on the west. They left Carlisle on the 9th, with two thousand foot and five hundred horse, and on the 10th captured Milk Castle; on the following day Annan, and on the 12th Dronok, both surrendered, but on the 14th they returned to Carlisle, explaining their lack of further success by lack of supplies. Wharton was excused attendance at the ensuing session of parliament, his presence being needed on the borders. In the autumn William Grey, 13th Baron Grey de Wilton was appointed Warden of the East Marches, but his relations with Wharton were strained, and led eventually to a challenge from Henry Wharton to Grey, though Somerset on 6 October 1549 forbade a duel. Their joint invasion of Scotland in February 1548 was a failure. Wharton and Lennox left Carlisle on the 20th, sending on Henry Wharton to burn Drumlanrig and Durisdeer. Wharton himself occupied Dumfries and Lochmaben, but on the 23rd a body of ‚Äòassured‚Äô Scots under Maxwell, who accompanied Henry Wharton, changed sides, joined Angus, and compelled Henry Wharton, with his cavalry, to escape across the mountains. News was brought to Carlisle that the whole expedition had perished, and Grey, who had penetrated as far as Haddington, retreated. In reality the Scots, after their defeat of Henry Wharton, were themselves thrown back by his father; many were captured or killed, but Wharton was forced to retreat, and Dumfries again fell into Scottish hands. In revenge for Maxwell's treason, Wharton hanged his pledges at Carlisle, and so initiated a lasting feud between the Whartons and the Maxwells. After Somerset's fall in October 1549 Wharton's place as warden was taken by his rival, Baron Dacre; but early in 1550 Wharton was appointed a commissioner to arrange terms of peace with Scotland and afterwards to divide the debatable land. He was one of the peers who tried and condemned Somerset on 1 December 1551. On 8 March 1552 the council effected a reconciliation between Wharton and Dacre; and when, in the following summer, Northumberland secured his own appointment as lord-warden- general, Wharton was on 31 July nominated his deputy-warden of the three marches. Under Queen Mary On Edward VI's death Dacre sided at once with Queen Mary, and it was reported that Wharton was arming against him; but Mary, saying she disbelieved the accusations against him, continued him in the office of warden, while his eldest son became one of the queen's trusted advisers. Dacre was, however, appointed warden of the west marches, Wharton continuing in the east and middle marches, and residing mainly at Alnwick. Wharton's own sympathies were conservative in religious matters; he had voted against the act of 1549 enabling priests to marry, against that of 1549 for the destruction of the old service books, and against the Act of Uniformity 1552, though he had acted as chantry commissioner under the Dissolution Act 1547. In spite of advancing years, Wharton retained his wardenry throughout Mary's reign, the Earl of Northumberland being joined with him on 1 August 1557 when fresh trouble with the Scots was imminent (owing to the war with France). In the parliament of January 1558 a bill was introduced into the House of Lords for punishing the behaviour of the Earl of Cumberland's servants and tenants towards Wharton, but it did not get beyond the first reading. Later life In June 1560 Norfolk, then lieutenant-general of the north, strongly urged Wharton's appointment as captain of Berwick-upon-Tweed, his restoration to the west marches being impossible because of his feud with Maxwell, who was now friendly to the English; but the recommendation was not adopted. He saw no further service, died at Healaugh near Tadcaster on 23 or 24 August 1568, and was buried there on 22 September. His will was proved at York on 7 April 1570, and there were monuments to him at Healaugh near Tadcaster and St Stephen's Church, Kirkby Stephen. Family Wharton was twice married: first, before 4 July 1518, to Eleanor, daughter of Sir Bryan Stapleton of Wighill, near Healaugh; and, secondly, on 18 November 1561, to Anne, second daughter of Francis Talbot, 5th Earl of Shrewsbury and widow of John Braye, 2nd Baron Braye, by whom he had no issue. By his first wife he had; * Thomas Wharton, 2nd Baron Wharton * Sir Henry Wharton, a dashing leader of horse, who served in many border raids, was knighted on 23 February 1547‚Äì8 for his services during the expedition to Durisdeer, led the horse to the relief of Haddington in July 1548, and died without issue about 1550, having married Jane, daughter of Thomas Mauleverer, and later wife of Robert, 6th Baron Ogle; * Joanna, wife of William Penington of Muncaster, ancestor of the Barons Muncaster; * Agnes, wife of Sir Richard Musgrave. Their daughter Eleanor Musgrave (1546-1623) married the diplomat Robert Bowes. Legacy Wharton is still vilified in the vicinity of Kirkby Stephen for having demolished the town of Wharton because it marred his view of the valley. Reference?

The show is a collaboration work between Swedish TV channel TV4, the Swedish lottery game company Folkspel and the Swedish sports life. The show premiered on 16 January 1989 on the local TV channel K√•llevisionen with the highly popular Leif \\"Loket\\" Olsson as show host. Since the beginning, the show has given 16 billion Swedish krona to the Swedish sports life centre. 1989‚Äì1999: Early rise, success In January 1989, Bingolotto premiered and Olsson introduced the game show to the people in the Gothenburg area. The programme became very popular in this area and 10,000 lottery tickets were sold to every episode between 1989 and 1991. In the autumn of 1990, the game show's owner and C.E.O. Gert Eklund started his collaboration with TV4 to start broadcasting the show nationwide. Olsson, who had built the game and company together with Eklund in 1988, owned a 25 percent share of the game but was bought of the company in 1999. On 19 October 1991, Bingolotto premiered nationwide on TV4 with the popular Leif \\"Loket\\" Olsson as show host. The premiere episode was watched by 1.3 million viewers in Sweden, a very high and surprising viewing figure. From October 1991 to March 1992, Bingolotto had raised viewing figures from 1.3 million viewers to 2.1 million viewers. The success of the show was positively associated with the popularity of host Leif \\"Loket\\" Olsson. In 1992, Loket received the television award The Lennart Hyland TV Prize for Best Male Show Host of the Year. Loket received this prize again in 1994 and 1997. In 1993, Loket received the prize \\"√Örets G√∂teborgare\\" (Gothenburg Citizen of the Year). In 1994, Olsson attracted 3.5 million viewers to watch every single program throughout the whole year, a record-high viewing figure. In 1995, Olsson attracted 4.5 million viewers to every programme, the highest viewing figure that has been registered in Swedish TV. In 1999, Olsson left the show and was replaced by Lasse Kron√©r. The viewing figure crashed immediately down to only 900,000 viewers per programme and the viewers and fans of the show wanted Loket to return. In January 2004, Kron√©r was fired and Loket was asked to return briefly to fill in for him. The price of the lottery ticket has been between 25 and 50 Swedish kronor, and in March 2005, one billion tickets had been sold since the beginning. The surplus is given to Swedish sport associations, a fact which is commonly believed to have increased the penetration of the show. 31.5 million Swedish kronor (approx ¬£2.5 million) is the highest won prize ever in the history of Bingolotto. It was won by a woman from Vara, Sweden. Leif \\"Loket\\" Olsson hosted the show from 1989 to 1999 (and for a short period in 2004). Since Olsson's retirement, the show has been hosted by entertainer and musician Lars Kron√©r, skiing athlete Gunde Svan, and TV-personality Rickard Olsson, of which none has been able to maintain the show's earlier popularity. A significant rise in popularity developed when the singer Lotta Engberg took over the hosting in fall 2008. From fall 2011 is the show hosting by Jan Bylund. Fore beginning the program shows in TV4, after 2008 the program is on TV4 Plus. On 12 September 2011 change the channel name to Sjuan (The Seven). In August 2015 was the program back on TV4 with Ingvar Oldsberg as host. Clips from Bingolotto are featured in the video of Madonna's 1998 song \\"Ray of Light\\", directed by Swede Jonas √Ökerlund. and in the 1998 film Show Me Love. In both cases clips from the period when Leif \\"Loket\\" Olsson hosted the show were used. A UK version was also produced, see BingoLotto (UK). Both TV programs have had as media consultant professor Charlie Medina. Music The programmes contains music pauses, where an artist or group appears. During the Leif \\"Loket\\" Olsson leadership era, Bingolotto was strongly dominated by dansband music. Later, other popular music also has become more common.

Kuku≈°ka) is a 2002 Russian historical comedy drama film directed by Aleksandr Rogozhkin. It takes place during World War II from the perspective of opposing Soviet and Finnish soldiers stranded at a Sami woman's farmhouse. \\"Kukushka\\" was the nickname given by Soviet soldiers to Finnish cuckoo snipers, who ambushed their targets from a purpose-built tree- branch-nest. Thus the title refers to both Veikko (the sniper) and Anni (whose name means cuckoo in Sami, and who is a lone woman living in the forest, much like a cuckoo). It received generally positive reviews from critics. Plot In September 1944, in the final moments Continuation War against the Soviet Union, Veikko (Ville Haapasalo), a Finnish soldier, is turned in by his German compatriots for being, in their eyes, a would-be deserter. As a punishment, the young man is placed in shackles, chained to a rock outcrop in a remote Lapland forest, left with nothing but a few supplies, a Karabiner 98k rifle and ammunition - effectively made a forced Kamikaze kukushka sniper. To ensure his willingness to fight, they dress him in the uniform of the German Waffen- SS, as Soviet soldiers felt little mercy towards SS men. Days pass, and after several failed attempts, Veikko succeeds in freeing himself and heads for safety, shackles still attached. Meanwhile, Ivan (Viktor Bychkov), a captain in the Red Army accused of anti-Soviet correspondence, is arrested by the NKVD secret police. En route to his court martial, Soviet planes accidentally bomb the vehicle carrying the disgraced captain, killing the driver and Ivan's guard. Veikko, at this stage still chained to the rock, witnesses the bombing through his rifle scope. Not far away is the farm of Anni (Anni-Kristiina Juuso), a Sami reindeer farmer whose husband was taken away together with their whole reindeer herd by Germans four years earlier, never to return. Hungry and alone, the young and resourceful widow locates the bodies of Ivan and his captors while foraging for food. As she begins to bury the dead, Anni discovers that Ivan is still alive, but seriously hurt. She carries him to her wooden hut and nurses him back to health. Meanwhile, Veikko, in search of tools to remove his shackles, stumbles upon Anni‚Äôs farm. Comic, and sometimes tragic, misunderstandings soon arise, resulting in a passionate and very human three-way relationship. Unable to communicate with the others and unaware that the war between the USSR and Finland is over, Ivan is convinced that Veikko is a German soldier gone astray. To Ivan, the German uniform the Finnish soldier was forced to wear is further proof. Ivan even refuses to tell his name to Veikko, answering only \\"Poshol ty!\\" (¬´–ü–æ—à—ë–ª —Ç—ã!¬ª \\"Get lost!\\") ‚Äî as a result, the two others think his name is \\"Psholty\\". Veikko is unaware of Ivan‚Äôs hatred and just wants to cut off his shackles, return home and put the war behind him, but opts to stay on Anni's farm to avoid falling into enemy hands. The earthly and sensuous Anni, who has not been with a man in four years, could not be more delighted with her good fortune, disregarding the language barrier between them. For Anni, Veikko and Ivan are not enemies, but just men. An uncommon and touching bond develops, as the three unlikely souls begin a domestic routine of hunting and gathering in preparation for the long Lapp winter. The two men do what they can to contribute to Anni‚Äôs well-being. Veikko builds a sauna and Ivan picks mushrooms. Veikko, Ivan and Anni communicate only with gestures. Starved for love and physical touch, Anni seduces young, strapping Veikko, much to the chagrin of jealous middle-aged Ivan. Not long afterwards a Soviet biplane crashes in the forest near Anni‚Äôs hut, spilling leaflets announcing an armistice between Finland and the USSR. Veikko thinks he can finally return home safely, but Ivan ‚Äì who does not understand Finnish ‚Äì manages to find a pistol in the wreckage and, still convinced that Veikko is an enemy, shoots him when he seemingly tries to attack Ivan, really only trying to destroy his rifle. When Ivan reads the last line of the leaflet the plane was dropping (written in Russian and instructing Soviet soldiers to allow the Finns to return home unharmed), he realizes that the war is over. Ivan is torn with remorse and, stumbling, carries Veikko back to the farm. The nurturing Anni brings Veikko back from the brink of death through a series of ancient Sami magic rituals. With Veikko bedridden, Anni‚Äôs needs for companionship and sexual longing draw Ivan into her bed. Gradually, Ivan and Veikko, no longer separated by ethnic hate nor rivalry for the affections of Anni, become friends. As winter arrives and the two men head back to their respective homes in opposite directions, Anni is left behind with memories ‚Äìand much more‚Äì of her two unlikely comrades in war and peace. In the final scene, she narrates the story to her children, whom she named after their fathers: Veikko and Psholty.

In the parable (), Jesus tells his audience ‚Äì his disciples and some Pharisees ‚Äì of the relationship, during life and after death, between an unnamed rich man and a poor beggar named Lazarus. The traditional name Dives is not actually a name, but instead a word for \\"rich man\\", dives, in the text of the Latin Bible, the Vulgate. The rich man was also given the names Neuƒìs (i.e. Nineveh) and Fineas (i.e. Phineas)Fitzmyer IX, Ad populum I (CSEL 18.91), spelled Finees; and in Ps.-Cyprian, De pascha computus 17 (CSEL 3/3.265), spelled Finaeus in the 3rd and 4th centuries. Anonymity and naming play an important role in this parable. Ordinarily, poverty is anonymous, and wealth is acknowledged. Yet Lazarus is named, and the rich man is anonymous, anticipating the reversal that occurs at the end.John Nolland, Luke (Dallas: Word, 1993) 2:828; James L. Resseguie, Spiritual Landscape: Images of the Spiritual Life in the Gospel of Luke (Grand Rapids, MI: Baker Academic, 2008), 106. Along with the parables of the Ten Virgins, Prodigal Son, and Good Samaritan, it was one of the most frequently illustrated parables in medieval art, perhaps because of its vivid account of an afterlife. Parable Detail from the prefatory cycle to the Eadwine Psalter, Morgan Library leaf M.521 (recto), English c. 1160s Luke 16:19‚Äì31, New International Version: Interpretations Illustration by Gustave Dor√© of the Rich man and Lazarus. There are different views on the historicity and origin of the story of the Rich Man and Lazarus.See R.M. Bredenhof, Failure and Prospect: Lazarus and the Rich Man (Luke 16:19‚Äì31) in the Context of Luke-Acts (LNTS 603; London: Bloomsbury T&T; Clark, 2019), pp 5-10. . The story is unique to Luke and is not thought to come from the hypothetical Q document. =As a literal historical event= Some Christians view the story not as a parable, but as an actual event which was related by Jesus to his followers.e.g. Webpage which argues that Lazarus and the rich man is literally true (whilst the language used by them could have been figurative). This was generally the view of the medieval Church. Supporters of this view point to a key detail in the story: the use of a personal name (Lazarus) not found in any other parable. By contrast, in all of the other parables Jesus refers to a central character by a description, such as \\"a certain man\\", \\"a sower\\", and so forth. For a review of ancient and contemporary interpretations of the name 'Lazarus', see R.M. Bredenhof, \\"Looking for Lazarus: Assigning Meaning to the Poor Man in Luke 16.19‚Äì31\\", New Testament Studies 66 (2020), pp 51-67. . Critics of this view point out that \\"The soul that sins, it shall die\\" (Ezekiel 18); \\"For dust you are and to dust you shall return\\" (Genesis 3:19). Paul (1 Thessalonians 4:13‚Äì18) describes death as sleep until the Day of the Lord, when the dead will receive glorified bodies upon the resurrection (1 Corinthians 15). No scripture, other than Philippians 1:23‚Äì25 (in which the apostle expresses the confidence that on departure from this life he would be with Christ), 2 Corinthians 12:2‚Äì4 (in which he affirms the possibility of being taken to paradise out of the body), 2 Corinthians 5:8, etc., accounts for a disembodied soul and its comfort or torture. Because this seems to raise the question of what kind of body is tortured in Hades as depicted in Luke, there are those who maintain that whilst the conversations took place as described, the language used in them, referring to body parts, etc., was figurative. =As a parable created by Jesus= Other Christians consider that this is a parable created by Jesus and told to his followers.e.g. The IVP Bible Background Commentary Tom WrightWright T. Luke for Everyone \\"doesn't add anything new to the general folk belief about fortunes being reversed in a future life. If it's a parable, that means once again that we should take it as picture language about something that was going on in Jesus' work\\" p. 201 and Joachim Jeremias both treat it as a \\"parable\\". Proponents of this view argue that the story of Lazarus and the rich man has much in common with other stories which are agreed-upon parables, both in language and content (e.g. the reversal of fortunes, the use of antithesis, and concern for the poor). Jesus using parable against the High Priest According to Josephus, Caiaphas was appointed High Priest in AD 18 by the Roman prefect who preceded Pontius Pilate, Valerius Gratus.Metzger & Coogan Oxford Companion to the Bible, 1993. p 97 One identification is that the man in torment in the parable is Caiaphas the High Priest. Caiaphas met the criteria Jesus gives in the parable to the identity of the Rich Man. He was rich, and as the high priest was dressed in purple and fine linen, he had five brothers, and was well versed in Moses and the Prophets, but according to Jesus, were ignoring what they wrote. Luther: a parable of the conscience Martin Luther taught that the story was a parable about rich and poor in this life and the details of the afterlife not to be taken literally: Lightfoot: a parable against the Pharisees Illustration of Lazarus at the rich man's gate by Fyodor Bronnikov, 1886. John Lightfoot (1602‚Äì1675) treated the parable as a parody of Pharisee belief concerning the Bosom of Abraham, and from the connection of Abraham saying the rich man's family would not believe even if the parable Lazarus was raised, to the priests' failure to believe in the resurrection of Christ: E. W. Bullinger in the Companion Bible cited Lightfoot's comment,Companion Bible p. 1489, citing \\"Lightfoot xii, 159‚Äì63\\" and expanded it to include coincidence to lack of belief in the resurrection of the historical Lazarus (John 12:10). Bullinger considered that Luke did not identify the passage as a \\"parable\\" because it contains a parody of the view of the afterlife: Drioux: a parable against the Sadducees An alternative explanation of the parable is a satirical parable against the Sadducees. One writer to identify the Sadducees as the target was Johann Nepomuk Sepp.Sepp Thaten und Lehren Jesu: mit ihrer weltgeschichtlichen Beglaubigung 1864 The arguments in favour of identification of the Rich Man as the Sadducees are (1) the wearing of purple and fine linen, priestly dress, (2) the reference to \\"five brothers in my father's house\\" as an allusion to Caiaphas' father-in-law Annas, and his five sons who also served as high priests according to Josephus,Friedrich Gustav Lisco, (trans. Patrick Fairbairn) The parables of Jesus: explained and illustrated 1853 p. 343 \\"Many expositors have thought they discovered, in this story, a real history, and referred it to the family of Annas and his son-in-law, Caiaphas,\\" (3) Abraham's statement in the parable that they would not believe even if he raised Lazarus, and then the fulfillment that when Jesus did raise Lazarus of Bethany the Sadducees not only did not believe, but attempted to have Lazarus killed again: \\"So the chief priests made plans to put Lazarus to death as well\\" (John 12:10). This last interpretation had wide circulation in France during the 1860s‚Äì1890s as a result of having been included in the notes of the pictorial Bible of Abb√© Drioux.\\"et c'est cet endurcissement que J√©sus pr√©dit quand il dit que du moment qu'ils n'√©coutent ni Mo√Øse ni les proph√®tes ils n'√©couteront pas d'avantage quelqu'un qui viendrait de l'autre monde\\". Drioux Claude-Joseph La Bible populaire: hist. illustr√©e de l'Ancien et du Nouveau Testament. Hachette, Paris 1864 p. 497 Perry: a parable of a new covenant Simon Perry has argued that the Lazarus of the parable (an abbreviated transcript of \\"Eleazer\\") refers to Eliezer of Damascus, Abraham's servant. In Genesis 15‚Äîa foundational covenant text familiar to any first century Jew‚ÄîGod says to Abraham \\"this man will not be your heir\\" (Gen 15:4). Perry argues that this is why Lazarus is outside the gates of Abraham's perceived descendant. By inviting Lazarus to Abraham's bosom, Jesus is redefining the nature of the covenant. It also explains why the rich man assumes Lazarus is Abraham's servant. Afterlife doctrine A depiction of the rich man in torment by James Tissot Most Christians believe in the immortality of the soul and particular judgment and see the story as consistent with it, or even refer to it to establish these doctrines like St. Irenaeus did. Others believe that the main point of the parable was to warn the godless wealthy about their need for repentance in this life and Jesus did not intend to give a preview of life after death. The parable teaches in this particular case that both identity and memory remain after death for the soul of the one in a hell. Eastern Orthodox Christians and Latter-Day Saints see the story as consistent with their belief in Hades, where the righteous and unrighteous alike await the resurrection of the dead. Western Christians usually interpret Lazarus as being in Heaven or Paradise and the rich man in Hell. The belief in a state of Limbo is less common. Some Christians believe in the mortality of the soul (\\"Christian mortalism\\" or \\"soul sleep\\") and general judgment (\\"Last Judgment\\") only. This view is held by some Anglicans such as E. W. Bullinger. Proponents of the mortality of the soul, and general judgment, for example Advent Christians, Conditionalists, Seventh-day Adventists, Jehovah's Witnesses, Christadelphians, and Christian Universalists, argue that this is a parable using the framework of Jewish views of the Bosom of Abraham, and is metaphorical, and is not definitive teaching on the intermediate state for several reasons.Bryan T.

Howard Marshall, The New International Greek Testament Commentary: The Gospel of Luke, p. 634 Hugo Gressmann,Hugo Gressmann, Vom reichen Mann und armen Lazarus: eine literargeschichtliche Studie (1918)‚Äîsuggest the basic storyline of The Rich Man and Lazarus was derived from Jewish stories that had developed from an Egyptian folk tale about Si- Osiris.Also see The Interpreter's Bible, Vol. 8 (New York: Abingdon Press), p. 290Also note: '...a passage from Whiston‚Äôs edition of Josephus, A Discourse to Greeks Concerning Hades,...bears an uncanny resemblance to Luke 16. Unfortunately, the resemblance is so uncanny because the passage is based on Luke 16. The author is not Josephus but the 4th Century Bishop Hippolytus. At some point, a copying error confused the names and the mistake was not discovered until recently.' Steven Cox, 'Not Giving Heed to Jewish Fables (2): Abraham in the Underworld' in The Christadelphian Tidings of the Kingdom of God (July 2000) Richard Bauckham is less sure,'It is quite plausible that a version of the Egyptian and Jewish story was current in first-century Palestine and that Jesus would have known it. Thus...he could have borrowed the two motifs from it. On the other hand, he may well have known other stories which used one of both motifs. He could have known the motifs without consciously borrowing them from any one particular story.'

Hippolytus of Rome (ca. AD 200) describes Hades with similar details: the bosom of Abraham for the souls of the righteous, fiery torment for the souls of wicked, and a chasm between them. He equates the fires of Hades with the lake of fire described in the Book of Revelation, but specifies that no one will actually be cast into the fire until the end times. In some European countries, the Latin description dives (Latin for \\"the rich man\\") is treated as his proper name: Dives. In Italy, the description epulone (Italian for \\"banquetter\\") is also used as a proper name. Both descriptions appear together, but not as a proper name, in Peter Chrysologus's sermon De divite epulone (Latin \\"On the Rich Banquetter\\"), corresponding to the verse, \\"There was a rich man who was clothed in purple and fine linen and who feasted sumptuously every day\\". The story was frequently told in an elaborated form in the medieval period, treating it as factual rather than a parable. Lazarus was venerated as a patron saint of lepers. In the 12th century, crusaders in the Kingdom of Jerusalem founded the Order of Saint Lazarus. The story was often shown in art, especially carved at the portals of churches, at the foot of which beggars would sit (for example at Moissac and Saint-Sernin, Toulouse), pleading their cause. There is a surviving stained-glass window at Bourges Cathedral.√âmile M√¢le, The Gothic Image, Religious Art in France of the Thirteenth Century, p. 200, English trans of 3rd edn, 1913, Collins, London (and many other editions) In the Latin liturgy of the Roman Catholic Church, the words of In paradisum are sometimes chanted as the deceased is taken from church to burial, including this supplication: \\"Chorus angelorum te suscipiat ... et cum Lazaro quondam paupere aeternam habeas requiem\\" (May the ranks of angels receive you ... and with Lazarus, who was once poor, may you have eternal rest\\"). Conflation with Lazarus of Bethany The name Lazarus, from the Hebrew: ◊ê◊ú◊¢◊ñ◊®, El øƒÅzƒÅr, Eleazar‚Äî\\"God is my help\\", also belongs to the more famous biblical character Lazarus of Bethany, known as \\"Lazarus of the Four Days\\",Gavrilova, L. V., From the History of Artistic Interpretations of the Biblical Story about the Lazarus Resurrection, Journal of Siberian Federal University, Humanities & Social Sciences 1 (2014 7) 20-29, accessed 2 July 2018 who is the subject of a prominent miracle attributed to Jesus in the Gospel of John, in which Jesus resurrects him four days after his death.. For a discussion of the conflation of the Luke 16 Lazarus and the John 11 Lazarus, see R.M. Bredenhof, \\"Looking for Lazarus: Assigning Meaning to the Poor Man in Luke 16.19‚Äì31\\", New Testament Studies 66 (2020), pp. 63-64. Historically within Christianity, the begging Lazarus of the parable (feast day June 21) and Lazarus of Bethany (feast day December 17) have often been conflated, with some churches celebrating a blessing of dogs, associated with the beggar, on December 17, the date associated with Lazarus of Bethany.Money talks: folklore in the public sphere December 2005, Folklore magazine. Another example of this conflation can be found in Romanesque iconography carved on portals in Burgundy and Provence. For example, at the west portal of the Church of St. Trophime at Arles, the beggar Lazarus is enthroned as St. Lazarus. Similar examples are found at the church at Avallon, the central portal at V√©zelay, and the portals of the cathedral of Autun.Richard Hamann, \\"Lazarus in Heaven\\" The Burlington Magazine for Connoisseurs 63 No. 364 (July 1933), pp. 3‚Äì5, 8‚Äì11 In literature and poetry Geoffrey Chaucer's Summoner observes that \\"Dives and Lazarus lived differently, and their rewards were different.\\"The Summoners's Prologue and Tale , line 1877 ‚Äì \\"Lazar and Dives lyveden diversly, And divers gerdon hadden they therby.\\" In William Shakespeare's Henry IV Part I, Sir John Falstaff alludes to the story while insulting his friend Bardolph about his face, comparing it to a memento mori: \\"I never see thy face,\\" he says \\"but I think upon hell-fire and Dives that lived in purple; for there he is in his robes, burning, burning\\" (III, 3, 30‚Äì33). When recalling the death of Falstaff in Henry V the description of Lazarus in heaven (\\"into Abraham's bosom\\") is parodied as \\"He‚Äôs in Arthur‚Äôs bosom, if ever man went to Arthur‚Äôs bosom.\\" (II. 3, 7‚Äì8) References to Dives and Lazarus are a frequent image in socially conscious fiction of the Victorian period.Smith Sheila The Other Nation OUP 1980 pp. 12‚Äì16 for extended discussion of the Dives and Lazarus imagery. For example: :\\"workers and masters are separate as Dives and Lazarus\\" \\"ay, as separate as Dives and Lazarus, with a great gulf betwixt\\" (Elizabeth Gaskell; Mary Barton a tale of Manchester life 1848) :\\"Between them, and a working woman full of faults, there is a deep gulf set.\\" (Charles Dickens; Hard Times 1854) Although Dickens' A Christmas Carol and The Chimes do not make any direct reference to the story, the introduction to the Oxford edition of the Christmas Books does.\\"And he cried it, how he cried it, from the housetops!‚Äîthe wealth of Dives jostling the want of Lazarus, Trotty Veck's humble dish of tripe made humbler by Sir Joseph Bowley's opulent cheque-book; above all, Scrooge, who, obliged to subscribe to the prisons and the Poor Law, shut his eyes to the conditions of those ghastly institutions,...\\" The Oxford Illustrated Dickens: Christmas books ‚Äì p. vi Charles Dickens, illustrated by Phiz, Hablot Knight Browne, 1998 In Herman Melville's Moby-Dick, Ishmael describes a windswept and cold night from the perspective of Lazarus (\\"Poor Lazarus, chattering his teeth against the curbstone...\\") and Dives (\\"...the privilege of making my own summer with my own coals\\").Herman Melville, Moby- Dick , Penguin Classics, 2003, , Chapter 2, pp. 11‚Äì12 The poem \\"The Love Song of J.

Eliot contains the lines: 'To say: \\"I am Lazarus, come from the dead,/Come back to tell you all, I shall tell you all\\"' in reference to Dives' request to have Beggar Lazarus return from the dead to tell his brothers of his fate. Richard Crashaw wrote a metaphysical stanza for his Steps to the Temple in 1646 entitled, \\"Upon Lazarus His Tears\\": > Rich Lazarus! richer in those gems, thy tears, Than Dives in the robes he > wears: He scorns them now, but oh they'll suit full well With the purple he > must wear in hell.Samuel Johnson, The Works of the English Poets, from > Chaucer to Cowper: Including the Series Edited with Prefaces, Biographical > and Critical, 1810, p. 557.

The Military and Hospitaller Order of Saint Lazarus of Jerusalem The Military and Hospitaller Order of St. Lazarus of Jerusalem (OSLJ) is an order of chivalry which originated in a leper hospital founded by Knights Hospitaller in the 12th century by Crusaders of the Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem. The Order of Saint Lazarus is one of the most ancient of the European orders of chivalry, yet is one of the less-known and less-documented orders. The first mention of the Order of Saint Lazarus in surviving sources dates to 1142. The Order was originally established to treat the virulent disease of leprosy, its knights originally being lepers themselves.David Marcombe, Leper Knights: The Order of St. Lazarus of Jerusalem in England, c. 1150‚Äì1544 (Rochester, NY: Boydell) 2003; Chapter 1 gives the general history. According to the Order's official international website, \\"From its foundation in the 12th century, the members of the Order were dedicated to two ideals: aid to those suffering from the dreadful disease of leprosy and the defense of the Christian faith.\\"\\"History\\" , official international website of the Military and Hospitaller Order of Saint Lazarus of Jerusalem. Retrieved on 2009-09-14. Sufferers of leprosy regarded the beggar Lazarus (of Luke 16:19‚Äì31) as their patron saint and usually dedicated their hospices to him. The order was initially founded as a leper hospital outside the city walls of Jerusalem, but hospitals were established all across the Holy Land dependent on the Jerusalem hospital, notably in Acre. It is unknown when the order became militarised but militarisation occurred before the end of the 12th century due to the large numbers of Templars and Hospitallers sent to the leper hospitals to be treated. The order established ‚Äòlazar houses‚Äô across Europe to care for lepers, and was well supported by other military orders which compelled lazar brethren in their rule to join the order upon contracting leprosy.David Marcombe, Leper Knights, The Boydell Press 2003, p. 11 See also * Lazaretto * Life of Jesus in the New Testament * Luke 16 * Ministry of Jesus * The Sheep and the Goats ReferencesExternal links * Biblical Art ** Purple and Poverty ** In Hades Category:Abraham Category:Angelic apparitions in the Bible Category:Eschatology in the Bible Category:Gospel of Luke Category:Parables of Jesus Category:Caiaphas ","title":"Rich man and Lazarus"},{"id":"1636039","text":"Willem Wilmink (1988) Willem Wilmink [' ã…™l…ôm ' ã…™lm…™≈ãk] (Enschede, 25 October 1936 ‚Äì 2 August 2003) was a Dutch poet and writer. He was best known for the large number of songs he wrote for popular children programs and his simple poetry. Life and career Wilmink was born in Enschede and studied Dutch and history at the University of Amsterdam. From 1960 to 1978, he taught modern literature at the same university. He wrote many songs for musicals and wrote a number of novels for young adults. At first he mainly wrote for adults, but later mainly for children. His first publication was in 1966: Brief van een Verkademeisje (Eng: \\"letter from a Verkade girl\\"). From 1970, he formed a writers' collective, together with Karel Eijkman, Hans Dorrestijn, Ries Moonen, Fetze Pijlman and Jan Riem. They contributed a lot to television programs such as De Stratemakeropzeeshow, Het Klokhuis, De Film van Ome Willem, Sesamstraat and Kinderen voor Kinderen. He received numerous prizes for his work, including the Louis Davids Prijs in the 1970s, the Zilveren Griffel in 1983 and 1994, the Nienke van Hichtum-prijs in 1985, the Gouden Griffel in 1986, and the Theo Thijssen-prijs in 1988. While never really well- known as a performing artist, though he sang and played accordion, a lot of Dutch people know Wilmink's songs. He performed regularly with his group in the nineties. Many Dutch artists have performed Wilminks poetry, including Herman van Veen, Wieteke van Dort, Joost Prinsen and the cabaret group Don Quishocking. Many of his texts have been put to music by Harry Bannink and Frank Deiman. In later life, his health declined due to a number of strokes.

Spa towns or spa resorts (including hot springs resorts) typically offer various health treatments, which are also known as balneotherapy. The belief in the curative powers of mineral waters goes back to prehistoric times. Such practices have been popular worldwide, but are especially widespread in Europe and Japan. Day spas are also quite popular and offer various personal care treatments. Origins of the term The term is derived from the name of the town of Spa, Belgium, whose name is known back from Roman times, when the location was called Aquae Spadanae,Journal of the History of Medicine and Allied Sciences, George Rosen, Yale University Dept. of the History of Science and Medicine, Project Muse, H. Schuman, 1954 sometimes incorrectly connected to the Latin word spargere meaning to scatter, sprinkle or moisten. Since medieval times, illnesses caused by iron deficiency were treated by drinking chalybeate (iron-bearing) spring water (in 1326, the iron-master Collin le Loup claimed a cure,Medical Hydrology, Sidney Licht, Sidney Herman Licht, Herman L. Kamenetz, E. Licht, 1963 Google Books when the spring was called Espa, a Walloon word for \\"fountain\\"). In 16th-century England, the old Roman ideas of medicinal bathing were revived at towns like Bath (not the source of the word bath), and in 1596 William Slingsby who had been to the Belgian town (which he called Spaw) discovered a chalybeate spring in Yorkshire. He built an enclosed well at what became known as Harrogate, the first resort in England for drinking medicinal waters, then in 1596 Dr. Timothy Bright after discovering a second well called the resort The English Spaw, beginning the use of the word Spa as a generic description. It is commonly claimed, in a commercial context, that the word is an acronym of various Latin phrases, such as salus per aquam or sanitas per aquam, meaning \\"health through water\\".For instance, 'Leisure and Recreation Management', George Torkildsen, Routledge, 2005, Google Books This is very unlikely: the derivation does not appear before the early 21st century and is probably a backronym as there is no evidence of acronyms passing into the language before the 20th century; nor does it match the known Roman name for the location. History Roman Baths in Bath, England Spa therapies have existed since the classical times when taking bath with water was considered as a popular means to treat illnesses. The practice of traveling to hot or cold springs in hopes of effecting a cure of some ailment dates back to prehistoric times. Archaeological investigations near hot springs in France and Czech Republic revealed Bronze Age weapons and offerings. In Great Britain, ancient legend credited early Celtic kings with the discovery of the hot springs in Bath, England. Many people around the world believed that bathing in a particular spring, well, or river resulted in physical and spiritual purification. Forms of ritual purification existed among the Native Americans, Babylonians, Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans. Today, ritual purification through water can be found in the religious ceremonies of Jews, Muslims, Christians, Buddhists, and Hindus. These ceremonies reflect the ancient belief in the healing and purifying properties of water. Complex bathing rituals were also practiced in ancient Egypt, in prehistoric cities of the Indus Valley, and in Aegean civilizations. Most often these ancient people did little building construction around the water, and what they did construct was very temporary in nature. =Bathing in Greek and Roman times= The spa town of Hisarya in Bulgaria. An ancient Roman city was built in the 1st century AD because of the mineral springs in the vicinity. Coriovallum Roman baths in Heerlen, The Netherlands (reconstructed) Roman Baths of Alange, Extremadura, Spain Some of the earliest descriptions of western bathing practices came from Greece. The Greeks began bathing regimens that formed the foundation for modern spa procedures. These Aegean people utilized small bathtubs, wash basins, and foot baths for personal cleanliness. The earliest such findings are the baths in the palace complex at Knossos, Crete, and the luxurious alabaster bathtubs excavated in Akrotiri, Santorini; both date from the mid-2nd millennium BC. They established public baths and showers within their gymnasium complexes for relaxation and personal hygiene. Greek mythology specified that certain natural springs or tidal pools were blessed by the gods to cure disease. Around these sacred pools, Greeks established bathing facilities for those desiring healing. Supplicants left offerings to the gods for healing at these sites and bathed themselves in hopes of a cure. The Spartans developed a primitive vapor bath. At Serangeum, an early Greek balneum (bathhouse, loosely translated), bathing chambers were cut into the hillside from which the hot springs issued. A series of niches cut into the rock above the chambers held bathers' clothing. One of the bathing chambers had a decorative mosaic floor depicting a driver and chariot pulled by four horses, a woman followed by two dogs, and a dolphin below. Thus, the early Greeks used the natural features, but expanded them and added their own amenities, such as decorations and shelves. During later Greek civilization, bathhouses were often built in conjunction with athletic fields. The Romans emulated many of the Greek bathing practices. Romans surpassed the Greeks in the size and complexity of their baths. This came about by many factors: the larger size and population of Roman cities, the availability of running water following the building of aqueducts, and the invention of cement, which made building large edifices easier, safer, and cheaper. As in Greece, the Roman bath became a focal center for social and recreational activity. As the Roman Empire expanded, the idea of the public bath spread to all parts of the Mediterranean and into regions of Europe and North Africa. With the construction of the aqueducts, the Romans had enough water not only for domestic, agricultural, and industrial uses, but also for their leisurely pursuits. The aqueducts provided water that was later heated for use in the baths. Today, the extent of the Roman bath is revealed at ruins and in archaeological excavations in Europe, Africa, and the Middle East. The Romans also developed baths in their colonies, taking advantage of the natural hot springs occurring in Europe to construct baths at Aix and Vichy in France, Bath and Buxton in England, Aachen and Wiesbaden in Germany, Baden, Austria, and Aquincum in Hungary, among other locations. These baths became centers for recreational and social activities in Roman communities. Libraries, lecture halls, gymnasiums, and formal gardens became part of some bath complexes. In addition, the Romans used the hot thermal waters to relieve their suffering from rheumatism, arthritis, and overindulgence in food and drink. The decline of the Roman Empire in the west, beginning in AD 337 after the death of Emperor Constantine, resulted in Roman legions abandoning their outlying provinces and leaving the baths to be taken over by the local population or destroyed. Thus, the Romans elevated bathing to a fine art, and their bathhouses physically reflected these advancements. The Roman bath, for instance, included a far more complex ritual than a simple immersion or sweating procedure. The various parts of the bathing ritual ‚Äî undressing, bathing, sweating, receiving a massage, and resting ‚Äî required separated rooms which the Romans built to accommodate those functions. The segregation of the sexes and the additions of diversions not directly related to bathing also had direct impacts on the shape and form of bathhouses. The elaborate Roman bathing ritual and its resultant architecture served as precedents for later European and American bathing facilities. Formal garden spaces and opulent architectural arrangement equal to those of the Romans reappeared in Europe by the end of the 18th century. Major American spas followed suit a century later. =Bathing in medieval times= Hot springs at Aachen, Germany, 1682 With the decline of the Roman Empire, the public baths often became places of licentious behavior, and such use was responsible for the spread rather than the cure of diseases. A general belief developed among the European populace was that frequent bathing promoted disease and sickness. Medieval church authorities encouraged this belief and made every effort to close down public baths. Ecclesiastical officials believed that public bathing created an environment open to immorality and disease. Roman Catholic Church officials even banned public bathing in an unsuccessful effort to halt syphilis epidemics from sweeping Europe. Overall, this period represented a time of decline for public bathing. People continued to seek out a few select hot and cold springs, believed to be holy wells, to cure various ailments. In an age of religious fervor, the benefits of the water were attributed to God or one of the saints. In 1326, Collin le Loup, an iron-master from Li√®ge, Belgium, discovered the chalybeate springs of Spa, Belgium. Around these springs, a famous health resort eventually grew and the term \\"spa\\" came to refer to any health resort located near natural springs. During this period, individual springs became associated with the specific ailment that they could allegedly benefit. Bathing procedures during this period varied greatly. By the 16th century, physicians at Karlsbad, Bohemia, prescribed that the mineral water be taken internally as well as externally. Patients periodically bathed in warm water for up to 10 or 11 hours while drinking glasses of mineral water. The first bath session occurred in the morning, the second in the afternoon. This treatment lasted several days until skin pustules formed and broke resulting in the draining of \\"poisons\\" considered to be the source of the disease. Then followed another series of shorter, hotter baths to wash the infection away and close the eruptions. In the English coastal town of Scarborough in 1626, a Mrs. Elizabeth Farrow discovered a stream of acidic water running from one of the cliffs to the south of the town. This was deemed to have beneficial health properties and gave birth to Scarborough Spa. Dr Wittie's book about the spa waters published in 1660 attracted a flood of visitors to the town. Sea bathing was added to the cure, and Scarborough became Britain's first seaside resort. The first rolling bathing machines for bathers are recorded on the sands in 1735. =Bathing in the 18th century= In the 17th century, most upper-class Europeans washed their clothes with water often and washed only their faces (with linen), feeling that bathing the entire body was a lower- class activity; but the upper-class slowly began changing their attitudes toward bathing as a way to restore health later in that century. The wealthy flocked to health resorts to drink and bathe in the waters. In 1702, Anne, Queen of Great Britain, traveled to Bath, the former Roman development, to bathe. A short time later, Richard (Beau) Nash came to Bath. By the force of his personality, Nash became the arbiter of good taste and manners in England. He along with financier Ralph Allen and architect John Wood transformed Bath from a country spa into the social capital of England. Bath set the tone for other spas in Europe to follow. Ostensibly, the wealthy and famous arrived there on a seasonal basis to bathe in and drink the water; however, they also came to display their opulence. Social activities at Bath included dances, concerts, playing cards, lectures, and promenading down the street. A typical day at Bath might be an early morning communal bath followed by a private breakfast party. Afterwards, one either drank water at the Pump Room (a building constructed over the thermal water source) or attended a fashion show. Physicians encouraged health resort patrons to bathe in and drink the waters with equal vigor. The next several hours of the day could be spent in shopping, visiting the lending library, attending concerts, or stopping at one of the coffeehouses. At 4:00 pm, the rich and famous dressed up in their finery and promenaded down the streets. Next came dinner, more promenading, and an evening of dancing or gambling. Similar activities occurred in health resorts throughout Europe. The spas became stages on which Europeans paraded with great pageantry. These resorts became infamous as places full of gossip and scandals. The various social and economic classes selected specific seasons during the year's course, staying from one to several months, to vacation at each resort. One season aristocrats occupied the resorts; at other times, prosperous farmers or retired military men took the baths. The wealthy and the criminals that preyed on them moved from one spa to the next as the fashionable season for that resort changed. During the 18th century, a revival in the medical uses of spring water was promoted by Enlightened physicians across Europe. This revival changed the way of taking a spa treatment. For example, in Karlsbad the accepted method of drinking the mineral water required sending large barrels to individual boardinghouses where the patients drank physician-prescribed dosages in the solitude of their rooms. Dr. David Beecher in 1777 recommended that the patients come to the fountainhead for the water and that each patient should first do some prescribed exercises. This innovation increased the medicinal benefits obtained and gradually physical activity became part of the European bathing regimen. In 1797, in England, Dr. James Currie published The Effects of Water, Cold and Warm, as a Remedy in Fever and other Diseases. As shown by M D Eddy, this book, along with numerous local pamphlets on composition of spa water, stimulated additional interest in water cures and advocated the external and internal use of water as part of the curing process.Vigier Baths on the banks of the Seine river, in Paris (1797) =Bathing in the 19th and 20th centuries= A thermal spa in Budapest, Hungary Turkish spa Sina (Hammam) in Trenƒçianske Teplice, Slovakia A section of the demolished Balneario da Toxa spa set in A Toxa Island, in Galicia, Spain In the 19th century, bathing became a more accepted practice as physicians realized some of the benefits that cleanliness could provide. A cholera epidemic in Liverpool, England in 1842 resulted in a sanitation renaissance, facilitated by the overlapping hydropathy and sanitation movements, and the implementation of a series of statutes known collectively as \\"The Baths and Wash-houses Acts 1846 to 1896\\". Full text at Internet Archive (archive.org). The result was increased facilities for bathing and washed clothes, and more people participating in these activities. Also in 1842, a house in Cincinnati, Ohio, received the first indoor bathtub in the United States. Bathing, however, was still not a universal custom. Only one year later ‚Äî in 1843 ‚Äî bathing between 1 November and 15 March was outlawed in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, as a health measure, and in 1845 bathing was banned in Boston, Massachusetts, unless under the direct orders of a physician. The situation improved, however, and by 1867 in Philadelphia most houses of the well-to-do had tubs and indoor plumbing. In England, hot showers were installed in barracks and schools by the 1880s. The taboos against bathing disappeared with advancements in medical science; the worldwide medical community was even promoting the benefits of bathing. In addition, the Victorian taste for the exotic lent itself perfectly to seeking out the curative powers of thermal water. In most instances, the formal architectural development of European spas took place in the 18th and 19th centuries. The architecture of Bath, England, developed along Georgian and Neoclassical lines, generally following Palladian structures. The most important architectural form that emerged was the \\"crescent\\" ‚Äî a semi-elliptical street plan used in many areas of England. The spa architecture of Carlsbad, Marienbad, Franzensbad, and Baden-Baden was primarily Neoclassical, but the literature seems to indicate that large bathhouses were not constructed until well into the 19th century. The emphasis on drinking the waters rather than bathing in them led to the development of separate structures known as Trinkhallen (drinking halls) where those taking the cure spent hours drinking water from the springs. By the mid-19th century, the situation had changed dramatically. Visitors to the European spas began to stress bathing in addition to drinking the waters. Besides fountains, pavilions, and Trinkhallen, bathhouses on the scale of the Roman baths were revived. Photographs of a 19th-century spa complex taken in the 1930s, detailing the earlier architecture, show a heavy use of mosaic floors, marble walls, classical statuary, arched openings, domed ceilings, segmental arches, triangular pediments, Corinthian columns, and all the other trappings of a Neoclassical revival. The buildings were usually separated by function ‚Äî with the Trinkhalle, the bathhouse, the inhalatorium (for inhaling the vapors), and the Kurhaus or Conversationhaus that was the center of social activity. Baden- Baden featured golf courses and tennis courts, \\"superb roads to motor over, and drives along quaint lanes where wild deer are as common as cows to us, and almost as unafraid\\". The European spa, then, started with structures to house the drinking function ‚Äî from simple fountains to pavilions to elaborate Trinkhallen. The enormous bathhouses came later in the 19th century as a renewed preference for an elaborate bathing ritual to cure ills and improve health came into vogue. European architects looked back to Roman civilizations and carefully studied its fine architectural precedents. The Europeans copied the same formality, symmetry, division of rooms by function, and opulent interior design in their bathhouses. They emulated the fountains and formal garden spaces in their resorts, and they also added new diversions. The tour books always mentioned the roomy, woodsy offerings in the vicinity and the faster-paced evening diversions. Waterfall, Carolus Spa, Aachen, Germany By the beginning of the 19th century, the European bathing regimen consisted of numerous accumulated traditions. The bathing routine included soaking in hot water, drinking the water, steaming in a vapor room, and relaxing in a cooling room. In addition doctors ordered that patients be douched with hot or cold water and given a select diet to promote a cure. Authors began writing guidebooks to the health resorts of Europe explaining the medical benefits and social amenities of each. Rich Europeans and Americans traveled to these resorts to take in cultural activities and the baths. Each European spa began offering similar cures while maintaining a certain amount of individuality. The 19th-century bathing regimen at Karlsbad can serve as a general portrayal of European bathing practices during this century. Visitors arose at 6 am to drink the water and be serenaded by a band. Next came a light breakfast, bath, and lunch. The doctors at Karlsbad usually limited patients to certain foods for each meal. In the afternoon, visitors went sight-seeing or attended concerts. Nightly theatrical performances followed the evening meal. This ended around 9 pm with the patients returning to their boardinghouses to sleep until 6 the next morning. This regimen continued for as long as a month and then the patients returned home until the next year. Other 19th-century European spa regimens followed similar schedules. At the beginning of the 20th century, European spas combined a strict diet and exercise regimen with a complex bathing procedure to achieve benefits for the patients. One example will suffice to illustrate the change in bathing procedures. Patients at Baden-Baden, which specialized in treating rheumatoid arthritis, were directed to see a doctor before taking the baths. Once this occurred, the bathers proceeded to the main bathhouse where they paid for their baths and stored their valuables before being assigned a booth for undressing. The bathhouse supplied bathers with towels, sheets, and slippers. The Baden-Baden bathing procedure began with a warm shower. The bathers next entered a room of circulating, hot air for 20 minutes, spent another ten minutes in a room with temperature, partook of a vapor bath, then showered and received a soap massage. After the massage, the bathers swam in a pool heated approximately to body temperature. After the swim, the bathers rested for 15 to 20 minutes in the warm \\"Sprudel\\" room pool . This shallow pool's bottom contained an layer of sand through with naturally carbonated water bubbled up. This was followed by a series of gradually cooler showers and pools. After that, the attendants rubbed down the bathers with warm towels and then wrapped them in sheets and covered them with blankets to rest for 20 minutes. This ended the bathing portion of the treatment. The rest of the cure consisted of a prescribed diet, exercise, and water-drinking program. The European spas provided various other diversions for guests after the bath, including gambling, horse racing, fishing, hunting, tennis, skating, dancing, golf, and horseback riding. Sight- seeing and theatrical performances served as further incentives for people to go to the spa. Some European governments even recognized the medical benefits of spa therapy and paid a portion of the patient's expenses. A number of these spas catered to those suffering from obesity and overindulgence in addition to various other medical complaints. In recent years, elegance and style of earlier centuries may have diminished, but people still come to the natural hot springs for relaxation and health. In Germany, the tradition survives to the present day. 'Taking a cure' (Kur) at a spa is generally covered to a large amount by both public and private health care insurance. Usually, a doctor prescribes a stay of three weeks at a mineral spring or other natural setting where a patient's condition will be treated with healing spring waters and natural therapies. While the insurance companies used to also cover meals and accommodation, many now only pay for the treatments and expect the patient to pay for transportation, accommodation, and meals. Most Germans are eligible for a Kur every two to six years, depending on the severity of their condition. Germans do still get paid their regular salary during this time away from their job, which is not taken out of their vacation days. =In colonial America= Gentlemen's Pool House, Jefferson Pools, Warm Springs, Virginia, built 1761 it is the oldest spa building in the United States. The spa waters flow through the centre of the building. President Thomas Jefferson bathed here. Some European colonists brought with them knowledge of the hot water therapy for medicinal purposes, and others learned the benefits of hot springs from the Native Americans. Europeans gradually obtained many of the hot and cold springs from the various Indian tribes. They then developed the spring to suit European tastes. By the 1760s, British colonists were traveling to hot and cold springs in Connecticut, Pennsylvania, New York, and Virginia in search of water cures. Among the more frequently visited of these springs were Bath, Yellow, and Bristol Springs in Pennsylvania; and Warm Springs, Hot Springs, and White Sulphur Springs (now in West Virginia) in Virginia. In the last decade of the 1700s, New York spas were beginning to be frequented by intrepid travelers, most notably Ballston Spa. Nearby Saratoga Springs and Kinderhook were yet to be discovered.Gassan, Birth of American Tourism, 2008, pp. 1-9Chambers, Drinking the Waters, 2002 Colonial doctors gradually began to recommend hot springs for ailments. Dr. Benjamin Rush, American patriot and physician, praised the springs of Bristol, Pennsylvania, in 1773. Dr. Samuel Tenney in 1783 and Dr. Valentine Seaman in 1792 examined the water of Ballston Spa in New York and wrote of possible medicinal uses of the springs. Hotels were constructed to accommodate visitors to the various springs. Entrepreneurs operated establishments where the travelers could lodge, eat, and drink. Thus began the health resort industry in the United States. =Bathing in 19th- and 20th-century America= Ladies' Sulphur Vapor Baths in the Hotel Toledo, Toledo, Ohio, 1919 After the American Revolution, the spa industry continued to gain popularity. The first truly popular spa was Saratoga Springs, which, by 1815, had two large, four-story, Greek revival hotels. It grew rapidly, and by 1821 it had at least five hundred rooms for accommodation. Its relative proximity to New York City and access to the country's most developed steamboat lines meant that by the mid-1820s the spa became the country's most popular tourist destination, serving both the country's elite and a more middle-class audience.Gassan, Birth of American Tourism, 2008Chambers, Drinking the Waters, Smithsonian Institution Press, 2002 Although spa activity had been central to Saratoga in the 1810s, by the 1820s the resort had hotels with great ballrooms, opera houses, stores, and clubhouses. The Union Hotel (first built in 1803 but steadily expanded over the coming decades) had its own esplanade, and by the 1820s had its own fountain and formal landscaping, but with only two small bathhouses. As the resort developed as a tourist destination mineral bathhouses became auxiliary structures and not the central features of the resort, although the drinking of mineral water was at least followed as a pro-forma activity by most in attendance, despite nightly dinners that were elaborate and extensive. Although Saratoga and other spas in New York centered their developments around the healthful mineral waters, their real drawing card was a complex social life and a cultural cachet. However, the wider audience it garnered by the late 1820s began to take some of the bloom off the resort, and in the mid-1830s, as a successful bid to revive itself, it turned to horse racing.Gassan, Birth of American Tourism, pp. 125-157. By the mid-1850s hot and cold spring resorts existed in 20 states. Many of these resorts contained similar architectural features. Most health resorts had a large, two-story central building near or at the springs, with smaller structures surrounding it. The main building provided the guests with facilities for dining, and possibly, dancing on the first floor, and the second story consisted of sleeping rooms. The outlying structures were individual guest cabins, and other auxiliary buildings formed a semicircle or U-shape around the large building. These resorts offered swimming, fishing, hunting, and horseback riding as well as facilities for bathing. The Virginia resorts, particularly White Sulphur Springs, proved popular before and after the Civil War. After the Civil War, spa vacations became very popular as returning soldiers bathed to heal wounds and the American economy allowed more leisure time. Saratoga Springs in New York became one of the main centers for this type of activity. Bathing in and drinking the warm, carbonated spring water only served as a prelude to the more interesting social activities of gambling, promenading, horse racing, and dancing.Boyer-Lewis, Ladies and Gentlemen on Display, 2001.Chambers, Drinking the Waters, 2002. During the last half of the 19th century, western entrepreneurs developed natural hot and cold springs into resorts ‚Äî from the Mississippi River to the West Coast. Many of these spas offered individual tub baths, vapor baths, douche sprays, needle showers, and pool bathing to their guests. The various railroads that spanned the country promoted these resorts to encourage train travel. Hot Springs, Arkansas, became a major resort for people from the large metropolitan areas of St. Louis and Chicago. The popularity of the spas continued into the 20th century. Some medical critics, however, charged that the thermal waters in such renowned resorts as Hot Springs, Virginia, and Saratoga Springs, New York, were no more beneficial to health than ordinary heated water. The various spa owners countered these arguments by developing better hydrotherapy for their patients. At the Saratoga spa, treatments for heart and circulatory disorders, rheumatic conditions, nervous disorders, metabolic diseases, and skin diseases were developed. In 1910, the New York state government began purchasing the principal springs to protect them from exploitation. When Franklin Delano Roosevelt was governor of New York, he pushed for a European type of spa development at Saratoga. The architects for the new complex spent two years studying the technical aspects of bathing in Europe. Completed in 1933, the development had three bathhouses ‚Äî Lincoln, Washington, and Roosevelt ‚Äî a drinking hall, the Hall of Springs, and a building housing the Simon Baruch Research Institute. Four additional buildings composed the recreation area and housed arcades and a swimming pool decorated with blue faience terra-cotta tile. Saratoga Spa State Park's Neoclassical buildings were laid out in a grand manner, with formal perpendicular axes, solid brick construction, and stone and concrete Roman-revival detailing. The spa was surrounded by a natural park that had of bridle paths, \\"with measured walks at scientifically calculated gradients through its groves and vales, with spouting springs adding unexpected touches to its vistas, with the tumbling waters of Geyser Brook flowing beneath bridges of the fine roads. Full advantage has been taken of the natural beauty of the park, but no formal landscaping\\". Promotional literature again advertised the attractions directly outside the spa: shopping, horse races, and historic sites associated with revolutionary war history. New York Governor Herbert Lehman opened the new facilities to the public in July 1935. The healing power of mineral water used to treat patients and other users in the lazy river section in Vuƒçkovec, Croatia Other leading spas in the U.S. during this period were French Lick, Indiana; Hot Springs and White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia; Hot Springs, Arkansas; and Warm Springs, Georgia. French Lick specialized in treating obesity and constipation through a combination of bathing and drinking the water and exercising. Hot Springs, Virginia, specialized in digestive ailments and heart diseases, and White Sulphur Springs, Virginia, treated these ailments and skin diseases. Both resorts offered baths where the water would wash continuously over the patients as they lay in a shallow pool. Warm Springs, Georgia, gained a reputation for treating infantile paralysis by a procedure of baths and exercise. President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who earlier supported Saratoga, became a frequent visitor and promoter of this spa. Treatments A 'body treatment', 'spa treatment', or 'cosmetic treatment' is non-medical procedure to help the health of the body. It is often performed at a resort, destination spa, day spa, beauty salon or school. Typical treatments include: * Aromatherapy * Ayurveda * Bathing or soaking in any of the following: ** Artificial waterfall, as cervical (spine) waterfall. ** Feetbath:de:Fu√übad, :fr:P√©diluve ** Hot spring *** Onsen (Japanese Hot Springs) *** Thermae (Roman Hot Springs) ** Hot tub ** Mud bath ** Jet hydro massage, as swan-neck jet hydro massage ** Peat pulp bath ** Sauna ** Steam bath ** Vichy shower * Body wraps, wrapping the body in hot linens, plastic sheets and blankets, or mud wraps, often in combination with herbal compounds. * Massage * Hair care * Nail care such as manicures and pedicures * Electrolysis * Waxing, the removal of body hair with hot wax *Facial Recent trends By the late 1930s more than 2,000 hot- or cold-springs health resorts were operating in the United States. This number had diminished greatly by the 1950s and continued to decline in the following two decades. In the recent past, spas in the U.S. emphasized dietary, exercise, or recreational programs more than traditional bathing activities. Up until recently, the public bathing industry in the U.S. remained stagnant. Nevertheless, in Europe, therapeutic baths have always been very popular, and remain so today. The same is true in Japan, where the traditional hot springs baths, known as onsen, always attracted plenty of visitors. But also in the U.S., with the increasing focus on health and wellness, such treatments are again becoming popular.\\"The increasing focus on fitness and wellness has fuelled the reemergence of the spa industry...\\" Anne Williams, Spa bodywork: a guide for massage therapists.

He was a songwriting partner and best friend of Buddy Holly, performing together as the duo \\"Buddy and Bob\\" while teenagers in high school. Initially, they played a variety of bluegrass music, which evolved into rockabilly sounds. Montgomery met Holly at Hutchinson Junior High School in Lubbock, Texas, in 1949. They started playing together at school assemblies and on local radio shows. Montgomery sang lead and Holly harmonized. They soon had a weekly Sunday radio show on station KDAV. On October 14, 1955, Bill Haley & His Comets played a concert at the Fair Park Auditorium, and Montgomery, Holly and bassist Larry Welborn were also on the bill. Eddie Crandall, Marty Robbins' manager, spoke to KDAV station owner Pappy Dave Stone and told him he was interested in Holly as a solo performer. Holly's career then began after demo recordings of his music were made and sent to Decca Records. Montgomery co-wrote some of Holly's songs, such as \\"Heartbeat\\", \\"Wishing\\", and \\"Love's Made a Fool of You\\". He wrote the pop standard \\"Misty Blue\\" and, for Patsy Cline, \\"Back in Baby's Arms\\". His son Kevin recorded a version of this, which appeared on his album True.

It is near the volcanic field known as the Phlegraean Fields (') and comprises part of the wider Campanian volcanic arc. The lake is roughly circular, measuring in circumference and 60 m (213 ft) deep. Roman era Avernus was of major importance to the Romans, who considered it to be the entrance to Hades. Roman writers often used the name as a synonym for the underworld. In Virgil's Aeneid, Aeneas descends to the underworld through a cave near the lake. In Hyginus' Fabulae, Odysseus also goes to the lower world from this spot, where he meets Elpenor, his comrade who went missing at Circe's place.hyginus, fabulae 125 Richard Wilson, Despite the alleged dangers of the lake, the Romans were happy to settle its shores, on which villas and vineyards were established. The lake's personification, the ', was worshipped in lakeside temples. A large bathhouse was built on the eastern shore of the lake. In 37 BC, the Roman general Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa converted the lake into a naval base named the Portus Julius after Julius Caesar. It was linked by a canal to a nearby lake (Lucrinus Lacus) and, from there, to the sea. The lake shore was also connected to the Greek colony of Cumae by an underground passage known as Cocceio's Cave (Grotta di Cocceio), which was long and wide enough to be used by chariots. This was the world's first major road tunnel; it remained usable until as recently as the 1940s. Italian era The Borboni, the Naples-ruling members of the House of Bourbon, owned the lake until 1750 when they ceded it to another aristocratic family, who in turn sold it, in 1991, to the Cardillo family.

It started in 1980, and expanded in 2001, to an international movement. In 2004, it registered under the name All-Russian Scientific Organization. Many of the activities are in the form of expeditions to sites that are reputed to have extraterrestrial activity or unusual creatures. Formation The organization was founded by Russian science-fiction writer Alexander Kazantsev, aerospace engineer Vadim Chernobrov, astronaut Georgy Beregovoy, and other enthusiasts, in order to explore the mysteries of the universe and nature, research new ways of space technology development, and work on breakthrough branches of science. In 1945, Kanzanstev started to research the Tunguska event of 1908 and link it to a UFO crash and explosion. Two years later, there were UFO sightings in the United States. In 1980, Chernobrov and his colleagues from the Moscow Aviation Institute created the group whose objectives were to collect information about UFOs and anomalous events in the Soviet Union, to develop a Lovondatr device (aka \\"time car\\"), and to send expeditions to explore the most promising anomalous zones. In 2004, the group registered themselves as Kosmopoisk (All- Russian Scientific Organization). They consider themselves the largest non- commercial public research organization in the world. Membership The organization has more than 2,500 active members, in more than 100 groups in 25 countries. It has organized more than 250 expeditions. Expeditions In the 1990s, the group made expeditions an annual event. To save costs, they would hitchhike as a main way of traveling. For instance, in 1999, the group made an expedition to the remote Labynkyr Lake in Yakutia, Sakha Republic, where an underwater monster, similar to Nessie, has been believed to exist since the 1960s. They hitchhiked the Kolyma federal road to get to Labynkyr Lake in Yakutia. They then collected their results of anomalous events into a database. One of the events the group would investigate was the meteorite landing at Korenevo in Kaluga Oblast. The meteorite landed in October 1996. The group conducted expeditions annually from 1997 to 2003. They also held a Kosmopoisk conference in May in Korenevo. Its objective was not only to search for the impact point, but also a way to involve a large number of people, mostly from educational institutions, in the public research process. Another annual event is the \\"monitoring\\" expedition to Southern Russia, mostly to Krasnodar Krai to investigate crop circles before they become structurally damaged by tourists. The group deployed \\"UfoSETI\\" to collect and analyze the reports about UFO spottings and crop circle discoveries in Russia. Another popular expedition site is the She-Bear Ridge (Russian: –ú–µ–¥–≤–µ–¥–∏—Ü–∫–∞—è –≥—Ä—è–¥–∞; Medveditskaya gryada), which is situated in Volgograd Oblast. It is considered to be one of the most impressive anomalous zones in Russia, including multiple observations of \\"triangle UFOs\\", \\"crazy lightnings slope\\", mysterious tunnels, and a possible Lovondatr-7 time travel experiment. The group started exploring the ridge in the 1980s. In 2002 and 2003, the group made expeditions to Brosno Lake in Tver Oblast in search of the Brosno Dragon, \\"Brosnya\\", an underwater creature. According to the legends, Brosnya was first spotted by Mongolian invaders in 1240. The group did a complete sonar underwater scan and coastal monitoring. They concluded that the Brosnya was likely caused by massive gas eruptions from the lake bottom. From 2002 to 2004, the group made expeditions to Verkhoshizhemye in Kirov Oblast to look for the habitats of bigfoot creatures. They found and photographed some probable camp sites. In 2002, the group launched a multi-profile expedition to find the Kyshtym dwarf \\"Aleshenka\\". They traveled to Kyshtym which is located in the Urals Federal District. The dwarf allegedly appeared in the town in the late 1990s but after it died, its corpse was retrieved by militsiya officers and then was stolen with present whereabouts unknown. The expeditioners collected data, gathered evidence from witnesses, found a possible UFO landing site, and explored a deep Sugomak cave, where they suspect the dwarf beings might have lived. In May and June 2003, the group held an expedition to the Vitim River in Siberia to investigate the site of the Vitim event, which was a large explosion suspected to be from a comet landing. In September 2004, the group held an expedition to the Mountains of Ararat in search of Noah's Ark.

In today's France, Gouren is overseen by the F√©d√©ration de Gouren which has an agreement with the F√©d√©ration Fran√ßaise de Lutte (French Wrestling Federation). History Gouren was especially popular in Brittany towards the beginning of the 20th century, before the beginning of WW1st (1914), with competitions every Sunday at the summer season in numerous small villages. In 1930, in order to revitalize the practice of gouren, Charles Cottonec of Quimperl√© (Finist√®re) breathed new life into the sport with the creation of a set of rules: age and weight categories, limited time of contest, and the creation of a federation. Today gouren is well-organised. It has its own federation, clubs (skoliou), and its own European Championships which take place every two years. Gouren has also kept its cultural ties, and displays of the martial art can be seen alongside traditional Breton music and dance. Rules The wrestlers, required to fight barefoot, wear a special white shirt or vest (roched) tied with a belt and black trousers (brago√π), and try to throw each other to the ground by grappling the other's roched. A victory (lamm) is declared when the opponent is on his back on the ground, with the winner standing. Victory is only achieved when both the opponent's shoulder blades hit the ground at the same time, and before any other part of the body. Each bout lasts seven minutes maximum. ResultsThe Lamm= The perfect result is the lamm. It ends the bout immediately. The goal is to throw the opponent to obtain a backfall with both shoulders blades touching the ground at the same time, before any other part of the body and before any part of the opponent's. =The Kostin= It is the next best result, very close to the lamm : a fall on one shoulder, for example. It is counted at the end of a bout. It is worth 4 points. =The Kein= It is an advantage and is taken into account at the end of an astenn (extra time: half the time of a bout). It is a fall of the inferior part of the back, or the whole back and posterior.

Following her commissioning, Breslau and the battlecruiser were assigned to the Mittelmeerdivision (Mediterranean Division) in response to the Balkan Wars. After evading British warships in the Mediterranean to reach Constantinople, Breslau and Goeben were transferred to the Ottoman Empire in August 1914, to entice the Ottomans to join the Central Powers in World War I. The two ships, along with several other Ottoman vessels, raided Russian ports in October 1914, prompting a Russian declaration of war. The ships were renamed Midilli and Yav√ªz Sult√¢n Sel√Æm, respectively, and saw extensive service with the Ottoman fleet, primarily in the Black Sea against the Russian Black Sea Fleet. Midilli was active in laying minefields off the Russian coast, bombarding Russian ports and installations and, because of a shortage of Ottoman merchant ships, transporting troops and supplies to the Black Sea ports supplying Ottoman troops fighting in the Caucasus Campaign. She was lightly damaged several times by Russian ships, but the most serious damage was inflicted by a mine in 1915, which kept her out of service for half of a year. The ship was mined and sunk in January 1918 during the Battle of Imbros, with the loss of the vast majority of her crew. Description Breslau in the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal, passing underneath the Levensau High Bridge Breslau was long overall and had a beam of and a draft of forward. She displaced normally and up to at full load.Gr√∂ner, p. 108 Her propulsion system consisted of two sets of AEG-Vulcan steam turbines driving two propellers. They were designed to give , but reached in service. These were powered by sixteen coal-fired Marine-type water-tube boilers, although they were later altered to use fuel oil that was sprayed on the coal to increase its burn rate. These gave the ship a top speed of . Breslau carried of coal, and an additional of oil that gave her a range of approximately at . Breslau had a crew of 18 officers and 336 enlisted men.Gr√∂ner, pp. 107‚Äì108 The ship was armed with a main battery of twelve SK L/45 guns in single pedestal mounts. Two were placed side by side forward on the forecastle, eight were located amidships, four on either side, and two were side by side aft.Gardiner & Gray, p. 159 The guns had a maximum elevation of 30 degrees, which allowed them to engage targets out to .Gardiner & Gray, p. 140 They were supplied with 1,800 rounds of ammunition, for 150 shells per gun. By 1917, the 10.5 cm guns were replaced with eight SK L/45 guns, one fore and aft and three on each broadside. She was also equipped with a pair of torpedo tubes with five torpedoes; the tubes were submerged in the hull on the broadside. She could also carry 120 mines. The ship was protected by a waterline armored belt that was thick amidships. The conning tower had thick sides, and the deck was covered with up to 60 mm thick armor plate. Service history c. 1912‚Äì1914 Breslau was ordered under the contract name \\"Ersatz \\" and was laid down at the AG Vulcan shipyard in Stettin in 1910.Gr√∂ner, p. 107 At her launching ceremony on 16 May 1911, she was christened by the mayor of Breslau, the ship's namesake.Hildebrand, R√∂hr, & Steinmetz, p. 139 After her launching, fitting-out work commenced and lasted until mid-1912. She was commissioned into the High Seas Fleet on 20 August 1912. Following her commissioning, Breslau was attached to the German Mittelmeerdivision (Mediterranean Division) along with the battlecruiser under the command of Admiral Wilhelm Souchon. The German Navy decided it needed a permanent naval presence in the Mediterranean in the aftermath of the Balkan Wars that began in 1912.Halpern, p. 15 Karl D√∂nitz, the future Grand Admiral during World War II, served aboard Breslau from 1912 to 1916.Zabecki, p. 7 At the outbreak of World War I, Breslau and Goeben were to interdict French transports transferring troops from Algeria to France. On 3 August 1914, Souchon's two ships were steaming off Algeria; shortly after 06:00, Breslau bombarded the embarkation port of B√¥ne while Goeben attacked Philippeville. The attacks caused minimal damage, however, and Souchon quickly broke off and returned to Messina to replenish his coal stocks.Halpern, pp. 51‚Äì52 Although the British were not yet at war with Germany, the two British battlecruisers and shadowed the German ships while en route to Messina. After partially replenishing Goebens coal on the 5th, Souchon arranged to meet a collier in the Aegean.Halpern, p. 52 Goeben and Breslau left port the following morning bound for Constantinople, pursued by the British Mediterranean Fleet.Bennett, pp. 33‚Äì34 That evening, the 1st Cruiser Squadron, commanded by Rear Admiral Ernest Troubridge, intercepted the Germans; Breslau briefly exchanged fire with the light cruiser before Troubridge broke off the attack, fearing Goebens powerful guns.Halpern, p. 56 On 8 August, Goeben and Breslau met the collier off the island of Donoussa near Naxos, and two days later they entered the Dardanelles. To circumvent neutrality requirements, Germany transferred the two ships to the Ottoman Navy on 16 August, though the supposed sale was simply a ruse. On 23 September, Souchon accepted an offer to command the Turkish fleet. Breslau was renamed Midilli while Goeben was renamed Yav√ªz Sult√¢n Sel√Æm; their German crews remained with the ships and donned Ottoman uniforms and fezzes.Halpern, pp. 57‚Äì58 The British did not accept the sale of the ships to the Ottoman Empire and stationed a blockading force outside the Dardanelles with orders to attack the ships if they appeared, regardless of the flag they flew.Halpern, p. 63 =Ottoman service= Breslau, flying the Turkish flag as Midilli On the evening of 27 October 1914, Midilli and the rest of the Ottoman fleet left the Bosporus and steamed into the Black Sea, ostensibly to conduct maneuvers. Instead, the fleet split into four groups to attack Russian bases on the other side of the Black Sea; Midilli and another cruiser were tasked with mining the Strait of Kerch and then attacking the port of Novorossisk. Midilli laid sixty mines in the Strait, which later claimed two Russian merchant ships,Nekrasov, p. 25 and then joined the other ship in bombarding Novorossisk. They set the port's oil tanks on fire, damaged seven merchant ships, and sank Nikolai of .Langensiepen & G√ºlery√ºz, p. 45 Although the damage inflicted on the Russians was relatively light, it forced the Russians to declare war on the Ottoman Empire, bringing the country into the war on the side of Germany.Halpern, p. 64 In early November 1914, while Midilli was operating in the eastern Black Sea and covering Ottoman transports, she was detached to shell the Russian port of Poti in retaliation for Russian attacks on Turkish shipping.Halpern, p. 224 On 17 November, she sortied with Yav√ªz Sult√¢n Sel√Æm, under the command of Souchon, in an attempt to intercept the Black Sea Fleet as it returned from bombarding Trebizond. Midilli discovered the Russian ships off Cape Sarych, the southern tip of the Crimea in poor visibility at short range. In the resulting engagement, Souchon ordered Midilli to assume a safer position to Yav√ªzs rear, but she was engaged by the pre-dreadnoughts and without effect before Souchon ordered the Turkish ships to disengage shortly afterward.McLaughlin, pp. 123‚Äì133 The cruiser spent the rest of the month escorting shipping to Trebizond. On 5 December, she escorted a small raiding party to Akkerman, Bessarabia, that was intended to attack railroad installations. On the return voyage, Midilli bombarded Sevastopol, damaging some minesweepers at anchor.Langensiepen & G√ºlery√ºz, p. 46 A month later, on 23 December, Midilli sortied to rendezvous with Yav√ªz Sult√¢n Sel√Æm off Sinope, and in the darkness the following morning she encountered the Russian transport Oleg, which was intended to be sunk as a blockship in Zonguldak. Midilli quickly sank Oleg but was forced to turn away after spotting Rostislav. She then encountered another blockship, Athos, and forced her crew to scuttle the ship. She then briefly engaged Russian destroyers before moving ahead of the Russian fleet to monitor their progress. Ottoman coastal guns forced the remaining blockships to scuttle in deep water.Halpern, p. 228 Midilli conducted a series of sorties against the Russians in early 1915, including an operation in concert with the cruiser in January, during which they inadvertently came into contact with the Black Sea Fleet. Midilli scored a hit on the battleship s main battery turret before the Ottoman ships withdrew.Halpern, pp. 228‚Äì229 On 3 April, the Ottoman fleet sortied to attack Russian transports off Odessa. Midilli and Yav√ªz Sult√¢n Sel√Æm provided the covering force for the attack, which failed after the cruiser struck a mine and sank off Odessa. The Russian fleet attempted to intercept the Turkish force, but Midilli and Yav√ªz Sult√¢n Sel√Æm were able to escape undamaged. The two ships, joined by Hamidiye, conducted a sweep to attack Russian transports on 6 May, but found no targets.Halpern, p. 231 Later that month, detachments of naval infantry from Midilli and Yav√ªz Sult√¢n Sel√Æm were landed to assist in the defense against the Allied landings at Gallipoli.Herwig, p. 171 On the night of 10/11 June, Midilli encountered the Russian destroyers and off Zonguldak. In a brief firefight, the cruiser crippled Gnevny with a hit in her starboard engine compartment that broke the main steam line to the engines, but was forced to turn away when Gnevny fired five torpedoes at her. Midilli was hit seven times herself with only slight damage and Gnevny was towed back to Sevastopol the following day by Derzki.Langensiepen & G√ºlery√ºz, p. 48Nekrasov, pp. 59‚Äì60 Sailors from Midilli during the Gallipoli campaign Midilli struck a mine on 18 July as she sailed from Constantinople to escort a merchant ship through the minefields defending the capital. The explosion under No. 4 boiler room killed eight crewmen and she was flooded with over of water. The ship made it to port at ƒ∞stinye and an inspection revealed that she was not badly damaged. Hampered by a shortage of trained personnel and material, however, the ship's repairs took quite a long time.Langensiepen & G√ºlery√ºz, p. 49 The ship did not return to service until February 1916, and the opportunity was taken to replace two of her 10.5 cm guns with 15 cm pieces. On 27 February, she was used to quickly transport 71 officers and men of a machine-gun company and a significant stock of supplies and munitions to Trebizond, which was then under heavy pressure from the Russian army. While en route on the night of the 28th, she encountered the Russian destroyers and . Midilli evaded the Russians and reached Trebizond. On 2 March, she attempted to attack a pair of destroyers north of Zonguldak, but she was unable to catch them. The ship then returned to the Bosporus. On 11 March, Midilli made another run, this time carrying 211 soldiers and twelve barrels of fuel and lubricating oil, which were successfully landed on the 13th. She then stopped in Samsun, where she picked up of flour, one ton of maize, and 30 tons of coal, before returning to the Bosporus.Halpern, pp. 241‚Äì242 A third supply operation followed on 3 April, when the ship brought 107 men, 5,000 rifles, and 794 cases of ammunition to Trebizond. After making the delivery, the ship met the U-boat and proceeded to attack Russian forces. Midilli shelled Russian positions at S√ºrmene Bay, where she set the minesweeper T.233 on fire, which was then destroyed by U-33s deck gun. Midilli then turned north and sank a Russian sailing vessel off Tuapse before running into the powerful dreadnought battleship . Midilli fled at high speed after being straddled several times, though she was not damaged.Halpern, pp. 242‚Äì243 In early May, the cruiser laid two minefields, each of 60 mines. The first of these was laid off the Chilia branch of the Danube River and the other off Cape Tarkhankut in the Crimea. On the second trip she bombarded Yevpatoria after laying her mines. Midilli transported more troops to Sinope and Samsun on 30 May, returning with grain and tobacco as deck cargo. In July, Midilli and Yav√ªz Sult√¢n Sel√Æm sortied to support the Ottoman counterattack at Trebizond, which broke the Russian lines and advanced some . Midilli sank a pair of Russian ships off Sochi on 4 July and destroyed another that had been torpedoed the previous day. She then rejoined Yav√ªz Sult√¢n Sel√Æm for the return to the Bosporus, during which the two ships evaded strong Russian forces attempting to intercept them.Halpern, p. 245 Later that month, on 21 July, Midilli attempted to lay a minefield off Novorossisk, but Russian wireless interception allowed the dreadnought and several destroyers to leave port and attempt to cut Midilli off from the Bosporus. The two ships encountered each other at 13:05, and Midilli quickly turned back south. Her stern 15 cm gun kept Russian destroyers at bay, but the ship only slowly drew out of range of Imperatritsa Mariyas heavy guns. Several near misses rained shell splinters on the deck and wounded several men. Heavy use of smoke screens and a rain squall allowed Midilli to break contact with her Russian pursuers, and she reached the Bosporus early the following morning.Halpern, p. 246 By the end of 1916, a severe coal shortage prevented Midilli and Yav√ªz Sult√¢n Sel√Æm from conducting offensive operations.Halpern, p. 248 In May 1917, Midilli laid a minefield off the mouth of the Danube; while there, she destroyed the wireless station on Fidonisi Island and captured 11 prisoners. The minefield she laid later sank the destroyer on 30 June. While Midilli was at sea, a Russian force including Imperatritsa Ekaterina Velikaya, which had by then been renamed , raided the Bosporus. Returning to port, Midilli was spotted by the Russian fleet, which attempted to cut her off from the safety of the Bosporus. Midilli raced toward port, while salvos from Svobodnaya Rossiya fell around her. The destroyer Gnevny closed to attack, but Midillis 15 cm guns drove her off. The cruiser managed to reach port without damage; this was the last engagement of the war between the former German warships and the Russian fleet.Halpern, p. 253 On 1 November, Midilli left the Bosporus to conduct a sweep for Russian warships. The Russians observed the departure and attempted to attack the cruiser with Svobodnaya Rossiya and the new battleship , but mutiny aboard Svobodnaya Rossiya prevented the force from intercepting Midilli before she slipped back into port that night.Halpern, p. 254 =Battle of Imbros= On 20 January 1918, Midilli and Yav√ªz Sult√¢n Sel√Æm left the Dardanelles under the command of Vice Admiral Hubert von Rebeur-Paschwitz, who had replaced Souchon the previous September. Rebeur-Paschwitz's intention was to draw Allied naval forces away from Palestine in support of Turkish forces there.Halpern, p. 255 Outside the straits, in the course of what became known as the Battle of Imbros, the two Ottoman ships surprised and sank the monitors and which were at anchor and unsupported by the pre-dreadnoughts that should have been guarding them. Rebeur-Paschwitz then decided to proceed to the port of Mudros; there the British pre-dreadnought battleship was raising steam to attack the Turkish ships.Buxton, pp. 36‚Äì37 While en route, Midilli struck a total of five mines and sank;Meek, et al., p. 95 Yav√ªz hit three mines as well and was forced to beach to avoid sinking.Gardiner and Gray, p. 152 Three hundred and thirty of Midillis crew were killed in her sinking, 162 survivors were rescued by British destroyers.Langensiepen & G√ºlery√ºz, p. 32 According to Hildebrand, R√∂hr, and Steinmetz, only 133 men were rescued from the ship.

Type 57s were built from 1934 through 1940, with a total of 710 examples produced. Type 57s used a twin-cam 3,257 cc engine based on that of the Type 49 but heavily modified by Jean Bugatti, unlike the single cam engines of the Type 49 and earlier models.Jarraud, Robert: Bugatti Doubles Arbres, Editions de l'Automobiliste, 1977, page 44 The engines of the Type 50, 51 used bevel gears at the front of the engine to transmit power from the crankshaft, whereas the Type 57 used a train of spur gears at the rear of the engine, with fiber gear wheels on the camshafts to achieve more silence in operation. There were two basic variants of the Type 57 car: * The original Type 57 * The lowered Type 57S/SC The Type 57 chassis and engine was revived in 1951 as the Bugatti Type 101. A rediscovered Type 57 sold for 3.4 million euros at auction on 7 February 2009 at a motor show in Paris. Bugatti Type 57 chassis Type 57 1936 Type 57 Coup√© with bodywork by Graber of Switzerland The original Type 57 was a touring car model produced from 1934 through 1940. It used the 3.3 L (3,257 cc; 198 cu in) engine from the Type 59 Grand Prix cars, producing 135 hp (100 kW). Top speed was . It rode on a wheelbase and had a wide track. Road-going versions weighed about . Hydraulic brakes replaced the cable-operated units in 1938, a modification Ettore Bugatti hotly contested. 630 examples were produced. The original road-going Type 57 included a smaller version of the Royale's square-bottom horseshoe grille. The sides of the engine compartment were covered with thermostatically-controlled shutters. It was a tall car, contrary to the tastes of the time. Dimensions: * Wheelbase: * Track: * Weight: =Type 57T= 1935 Type 57T Tourer The \\"tuned\\" Type 57T pushed the performance of the basic Type 57. It was capable of reaching . =Type 57C= 1938 Type 57C A Type 57C racing car was built from 1937 through 1940, with about 96 produced. It shared the 3.3 L engine from the road-going Type 57 but produced 160 hp (119 kW) with a Roots-type supercharger fitted. =Type 57C Tank= The 2nd incarnation Tank, this time based on the Type 57C, won Le Mans again in 1939. Shortly afterwards, Jean Bugatti took the winning car for a test on the Molsheim-Strasbourg road. Swerving to avoid a drunken bicyclist on the closed road, Bugatti crashed the car and died at age 30. Type 57S/SC 1937 Type 57SC Gangloff Drop Head Coup√© from the Ralph Lauren collection The Type 57S/SC variants are some of the most iconic Bugatti cars. The \\"S\\" stood for \\"Surbaiss√©\\" (\\"Lowered\\") and the \\"C\\" for \\"Compresseur\\" (a supercharger introduced by Bugatti as a result of customers' desire for increased power). It included a V-shaped dip at the bottom of the radiator and mesh grilles on either side of the engine compartment. Lowering the car was a major undertaking. The rear axle now passed through the rear frame rather than riding under it, and a dry-sump lubrication system was required to fit the engine under the new low hood. The 57S had a nearly-independent suspension in front, though Ettore despised that notion. Just 43 \\"Surbaiss√©\\" cars and only two supercharged Type 57SC's were originally manufactured. But most 57S owners wanted the additional power afforded by the blower. Therefore, most of the original Type 57S cars returned to Molsheim for the installation of a supercharger, pushing output from 175 hp (130 kW) to 200 hp (150 kW) and . Dimensions: * Wheelbase: * Track: * Weight: =Type 57S/SC \\"A√©rolithe\\" concept and Atlantic production cars= The Type 57S Atlantic body featured flowing coup√© lines with a pronounced dorsal seam running from the front to the back end of the vehicle. It was based on the 1935 A√©rolithe concept car designed by Jean Bugatti which was built on a prototype chassis, more specifically, a standard Type 57 chassis shortened to what would eventually become the Type 57S chassis. Like the Type 59 Grand Prix car, the A√©rolithe used Elektron composite for its body panels, known for being a very lightweight and durable material, but also for being extremely flammable when exposed to high temperatures. Therefore, being unable to weld the body panels, the engineers riveted them externally, a technique frequently used in the aviation industry, thus creating the signature seam. However, the production Atlantics, just four built, used plain aluminum, but the dorsal seams were retained for style and have led to the car's present fame. Three of the original four Atlantics are known to survive and each had been restored to its former glory. Two of them have been honored with \\"Best of Show\\" awards at the Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance in 1990 and 2003, respectively. The model was named in honor of Jean Bugatti's friend, French pilot Jean Mermoz, one of the pioneers in aviation and the first to cross the South Atlantic by air. Unfortunately, in December 1936, he and his crew crashed into the Atlantic Ocean after a supposed engine failure. Originally, the Atlantic model was named \\"Coup√© Aero\\" after its predecessor, the Type 57 A√©rolithe. The first two production units already bore that name, but after hearing the tragic news, Jean Bugatti commissioned to change the name of the model to \\"Atlantic Coup√©\\". Bugatti's past during the pre-war and World War II era is often considered as being somewhat imprecise. Therefore, initially, it was believed that only three Atlantic cars were manufactured, as the popular belief hinged on the idea of No. 57453 (2nd Atlantic) and No. 57473 (3rd Atlantic) being the same car, for they were closely related in terms of production date and both being painted black by the Bugatti factory. However, in 2004, renowned Bugatti historian Pierre-Yves Laugier confirmed their separate identities, a research thoroughly comprised in his book entitled \\"Bugatti: les 57 Sport\\", along with an elaborate illustration of each vehicle's past.https://www.motors- mania.com/fr/livres-automobiles/8263-bugatti-57-sport.html 1935 Bugatti No. 57331 prototype on display at the 1935 British International Motor Show ‚óè 1935 Bugatti Type 57 A√©rolithe No. 57331 prototype (Chassis No. 57331 / Engine No. 226S / Original Color: \\"Cr√®me de menthe\\" / Interior: \\"Cr√®me de menthe\\" leather and beige cloth) Code-named the \\"Elektron Coup√©\\" or \\"Competition Coup√©\\" at launch, this Bugatti prototype had a very short existence. It was finished around the end of July 1935 and only four months later, it made its first public appearance at the Paris Motor Show. The car was a faithful recreation of Jean Bugatti's stunning Art Deco inspired \\"SuperProfile coup√©\\" design, but due to its seemingly bizarre shape, the vehicle has brought attention to a very limited audience, thus there were only four Atlantics built the years after. A few people, however, had the chance to sit in the vehicle next to Bugatti race driver William Grover-Williams while he offered them a \\"quick\\" tour of Paris and were surprised by the vehicle's performance and looks, so they called it \\"La A√©rolithe\\" after the phrase \\"Rapide comme une a√©rolithe\\" (\\"Fast as a meteorite\\"), a name that was later adopted by Bugatti. A few weeks later, the vehicle was displayed at the British International Motor Show in Olympia, London. The prototype remained in London until the spring of 1936, being frequently driven and tested by William Grover-Williams. Beyond this point, historians lose its tracks, but as Bugatti's chief mechanic Robert Auma√Ætre stated a few decades later, the car was, essentially, just a styling concept with no technical interest, thus being transported back to France at the Bugatti factory where it was disassembled for components. Over the span of five years, from 2008 to 2013, Canadian car restoration team from The Guild of Automotive Restorers, led by David Grainger, had built a 1:1 exact replica of the Type 57 A√©rolithe, having only 11 photographs, 2 blueprints and a painting at their disposal from which they gathered all the dimensions of the vehicle. It was built on the No. 57104 chassis and its body was crafted entirely out of Elektron alloy. Mullin collection ‚óè 1936 Bugatti Type 57S(+C) Coup√© Aero No. 57374 (Chassis No. 57374 / Engine No. 25S / Original Color: Metallic gray-blue / Interior: Blue leather) It was completed on 2 September 1936 and sold to Victor Rothschild, 3rd Baron Rothschild. Painted a metallic gray-blue, No. 57374 was supposedly built using various components from the A√©rolithe prototype, the most notable being the chromed elements on either side of the engine grille. In 1939, at the request of Victor Rothschild, the car was brought back to Molsheim in order to have the \\"C\\" specification supercharger fitted. He used the car until October 1941, when he abandoned it in the middle of a field after the engine exploded due to the malfunctioning supercharger that was fitted two years before. It was then sold to a mechanic whom repaired it, thus removing the defective supercharger. In 1945, a wealthy american doctor whom just arrived in England bought the car and a year later, he brought it to the US and sold it to Bugatti enthusiast Mike Oliver. In the hands of that owner, No. 57374 received the US regulations changes and was painted a dark red. In 1953, Oliver decided that the car should have the \\"C\\" specification refitted. As a result, No. 57374 was brought back to France at the Bugatti workshop to make this change and, once completed, was returned to the US. Oliver died in 1970 at the age of 50. Before his death, he sold it to Briggs Cunningham, american entrepreneur and pilot, owner of the \\"Costa Mesa\\" car collection. Just a year later, it was sold for a total of $59,000 to collector Peter Williamson. He was the owner of that car for 32 years, during which time he returned it to its original state. Eventually, it was exhibited at the 2003 Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance where it won the \\"Best of Show\\" award. Peter Williamson died a year later and No. 57374 remained in his family's possession until 2010, when it was sold for no less than $30 million to collector Peter W. Mullin, who then exhibited it in his automotive masterpiece collection at the Mullin Automotive Museum located in Oxnard, CA. 1936 Bugatti No. 57453 on display at the 1937 Nice Motor Show ‚óè 1936 Bugatti Type 57SC Coup√© Aero No. 57453 (Chassis No. 57453 / Engine No. 2SC / Original Color: Black / Interior: Dark brown leather and beige cloth) Also known as \\"La Voiture Noire\\" (French for \\"The Black Car\\"), this is the second Atlantic that was manufactured. Apart from its first years after production, the car's history and current whereabouts remain mostly unknown. Due to its past and exclusivity, experts had estimated the value of this car at around $114 million.https://www.hemmings.com/stories/2019/02/26/the-114-million-barn-find- that-has-yet-to-be-found On 10 March 1936, Greek racing driver Nico E. Embiricos ordered a Bugatti Type 57S Coup√© Aero bearing chassis No. 57375 and engine No. 3S which was completed on 24 August 1936 and then shipped to his residence in London. By some unclear reason, once received, the car was sent to Corsica Coachworks for the conversion to a two-seater convertible racing body, this process coming to an end on 4 September 1936. The Coup√© Aero bodywork was sent back to the Bugatti workshop, where it was eventually mounted on chassis No. 57453 with engine No. 2SC. Being the only Atlantic already fitted with the \\"C\\" specification supercharger straight from the factory, No. 57453 was completed on 3 October 1936. During the winter of the same year, the car was mostly driven by Jean Bugatti, racing driver William Grover-Williams and his wife, Yvonne. Subsequently, No. 57453 was photographed for the company's 1937 promotional catalogue and was also exhibited at the Nice and Lyon Motor Shows in the spring of 1937. Brought back to Molsheim, it was proudly driven by Jean Bugatti until the end of July, when he offered it as a gift to Bugatti race driver Robert Benoist after winning the 1937 24 Hours of Le Mans race. Being a very close friend with the Grover-Williamses, Benoist used the car alongside them. In the spring of 1940, all three of them fled to England before the Germans took over France and the car was returned to the factory. Even though it was frequently driven, No. 57453 never had a registered owner. The last mention about it was on a list of cars that were to be sent via a train to Rue Alfred Daney in Bordeaux on 18 February 1941, during the French exodus, being registered \\"1244 W5\\" and bearing chassis No. 57454.https://motofiction.eu/home/ Jean Bugatti, whom unfortunately died on 11 August 1939 at the age of 30 in a car crash, often considered the Atlantic model and most notably No. 57453, as his most innovative and most valuable creation. Thus, at the 2019 Geneva Motor Show, commemorating the 110-year anniversary of both Jean Bugatti and the brand, Bugatti introduced the one-off model \\"La Voiture Noire\\". It was sold to an anonymous buyer for $19 million and declared the most expensive new car ever sold. According to the Bugatti stylistic team, the vehicle identifies itself as the ultimate Grand Tourer, but also as a modern representation of No. 57453 and a tribute to Jean Bugatti's stylistic genius. 1936 Bugatti No. 57473 on display at the Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance in 2010 ‚óè 1936 Bugatti Type 57S Atlantic Coup√© No. 57473 (Chassis No. 57473 / Engine No. 10S / Original Color: Black / Interior: Black leather and beige cloth) Succeeding No. 57453, this second black Atlantic was finished on 13 December 1936 and was delivered to Parisian businessman, Mr. Jacques Holtzschuch. A few months later, while driving along the French Riviera, he and his wife, Yvonne, entered the \\"Juan-Les-Pins Concours d'Elegance\\" event where the vehicle received the \\"Grand Prix d'Honneur\\" award. Subsequently, between 1939 and 1941, the car received significant styling changes, so No. 57473 differs from the other Atlantics. The author of this coachwork is believed to be Italian designer Giuseppe Figoni. Eventually, Mr. Holtzschuch and his wife were captured and killed by Nazis by the end of World War II and the car was purchased alongside their Monaco mansion by Cannes businessman and mechanic Robert Verkerke in 1949. In the hands of this owner, the car entered the \\"3rd International Speed Circuit for touring cars series\\" race in Nice, but failed to finish. Over the next couple of years, No. 57473 had more than three additional owners. In 1952, it was sold to Bugatti enthusiast Ren√© Chatard which commissioned to have it painted pale blue after his own liking. On 22 August 1955, Chatard and Janine Vacheron, a female companion, were driving the car near Gien, France, when they were hit by a train. Neither survived the crash and the vehicle was sold to a scrap trader in Gien. The remains of the car were purchased in 1963 by a French collector who began a full reconstruction which culminated in 1977. As a result of the severe deterioration, most of the original components were replaced with new ones, therefore the value of the car decreased substantially. In November 2006, No. 57473 was bought by an anonymous collector, who decided that the vehicle should be thoroughly restored by American specialist Paul Russell and brought back to Chatard's specification. In 2010, the finished car was exhibited at the Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance event, where it didn't win any prize, being considered a replica. Today, No. 57473 is one among other classic cars displayed at the Torrota private collection in Spain. 1938 Bugatti No. 57591 from the Ralph Lauren collection ‚óè 1938 Bugatti Type 57S(+C) Atlantic Coup√© No. 57591 (Chassis No. 57591 / Engine No. 39S / Original Color: Sapphire Blue / Interior: Beige leather) This final production Atlantic led a charmed life that continues to this day. Its first owner was British tennis player Richard B. Pope and it was delivered to him on 2 May 1938 before being registered \\"EXK6\\", as it's commonly referred to. Painted a rich sapphire blue, No. 57591 distinguished itself from the other Atlantics mostly by the \\"facelift\\" at the front end and the absence of the rear fender covers. In 1939, Richard Pope sends the car back to Molsheim at the Bugatti factory to have the \\"C\\" specification fitted. He kept the car for nearly 30 years, sometimes loaning his Atlantic to Bugatti specialist Barrie Price. Eventually, Price bought the car in 1967 and had it in its possession for 10 years. In the meantime, No. 57591 suffered a light crash during a commemoration which led to it getting stuck in a ditch. The car was handed to wealthy businessman Anthony Bamford and, shortly after, was given to another collector. Eventually, renowned fashion designer Ralph Lauren buys the car in 1988, who then commissions a complete restoration with Paul Russell and Co. They were able to cut through the past restoration work and revive the car back to its 1938 glory, even though it was painted black at Mr. Lauren's request. The car was given the \\"Best of Show\\" award at Pebble Beach in 1990 and \\"Best of Show\\" at Villa d'Este in 2013, along with many other top awards. =Type 57S/SC Atalante= Type 57SC Atalante The Atalante was a two-door coup√© body style similar to and built after the Atlantic, both built on the 57S chassis, but with a single- piece windscreen and no fin. The name \\"Atalante\\" was derived from a heroine of Greek mythology, Atalanta. Only 17 Atalante cars were made, four of which reside in the Cit√© de l'Automobile Museum in Mulhouse, France (formerly known as the Mus√©e National de L'Automobile de Mulhouse). One Atalante, chassis number 57784, a 3-seater vehicle version with aluminium bodywork made by Vanvooren of the iconic Bugatti Type 57S model, resides in the Museu do Caramulo in Caramulo, Portugal. Vanvooren would do two more bodies alike, one (Chassis 57808) for the French government, who gave it, in 1939, as a marriage gift for Prince Reza and Princess Fawzia, and another one (Chassis 57749). These two cars are in private collections in the United States. Rediscovered Type 57S Atalante In 2008, the Bugatti Type 57S with chassis number 57502 (built in 1937 with the Atalante coachwork for Francis Curzon, 5th Earl Howe) was discovered in a private garage in Newcastle upon Tyne, having been stored untouched for 48 years and known only by a select few people. It was auctioned in February 2009 at the R√©tromobile motor show in Paris, France, fetching ‚Ç¨3.4 million (~ US$5 million). =Type 57S45= A special Type 57S45 used a 4,743 cc engine like the Tank. =Type 57G Tank= Type 57G Tank The famous, 57S-based, 57G Tank won the 1936 French Grand Prix, as well as the 1937 24 Hours of Le Mans. Three 57G Tanks were produced. Chassis number 57335, the Le Mans winner, is the only one known to exist and is currently on display at the Simeone Foundation Automotive Museum in Philadelphia.
