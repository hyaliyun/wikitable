S58CA04 was implemented following A v UK where domestic law allowed a step- father to successfully use the defence of Lawful Correction after inflicting injuries to his step-son that the European Court had ruled were counter to the child’s inalienable rights under Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights (“ECHR”). The Section is this: : Section 58 of the Children Act, 2004 : (1) In relation to any offence specified in subsection (2), battery of a child cannot be justified on the ground that it constituted reasonable punishment. : (2) The offences referred to in subsection (1) are— :: (a) an offence under section 18 or 20 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861 (wounding and causing grievous bodily harm); :: (b) an offence under section 47 of that Act (assault occasioning actual bodily harm); :: (c) an offence under section 1 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 (c. 12) (cruelty to persons under 16). : (3) Battery of a child causing actual bodily harm to the child cannot be justified in any civil proceedings on the ground that it constituted reasonable punishment. : (4) For the purposes of subsection (3) “actual bodily harm” has the same meaning as it has for the purposes of section 47 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861. : (5) In section 1 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933, omit subsection (7). By defining immoderate chastisement through its subsections 1 and 2, S58CA04 by implication defined immoderate's antonym of moderate punishment (and moderate's bilateral synonym reasonable) as an injury that is less than ABH and therefore only potentially chargeable as the lesser offence of Common Assault under Section 39 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1988. Subsections 3 and 4 provided a statutory definition of significant harm in civil proceedings such as Social Services investigations under Section 47 of the Children Act (1989) as ABH. Subsection 5 of S58CA04 repealed the former statutory defence of Lawful Punishment under Section 1.7 of the Children and Young Persons Act of 1933, removing corporal punishment’s legal basis from the primary legislation of England and Wales and immunising the UK from any declaration of incompatibility under Section 4 of the Human Rights Act, 1998 through reversion of legality solely to the common law precedent of R v Hopley. Allied to introduction of S58CA04, the UK made various press releases informing the citizens of England and Wales that Act’s effects in lay terms, such as the following from The Daily Telegraph. > “Parents who smack their children hard enough to leave a mark will face up > to five years' imprisonment from today. New laws which came into force at > midnight allow mild smacking but criminalise any physical punishment which > causes visible bruising. > A ‘reasonable chastisement’ defence will still be available to parents but > they could be charged with common assault if a smack causes bruises, grazes, > scratches, minor swellings or cuts. Child protection charity the NSPCC said > the law was flawed and called for a total ban on smacking. > NSPCC boss Mary Marsh said: ‘Hitting a child remains legal — as long as > parents do not cause children injury amounting to anything more than > transient reddening of the skin. This new law is flawed. There is a risk > that parents may choose to hit children on parts of their body where injury > is less visible, such as the head, which can cause serious harm.’ > The Government suffered a rebellion by 47 Labour MPs who wanted a total ban > when the measures were passed in the Children Act last November. Mrs Marsh > added: ‘Parents may find themselves, often in the heat of the moment, trying > to decide how hard and where on the body they can hit their children to > avoid prosecution for leaving a mark. It should be just as wrong to hit a > child as it is to hit an adult.’ > A Department for Education and Skills spokeswoman said: ‘The Government has > sent a clear message to parents that they will not be criminalised for > bringing up their children in a supportive disciplinary environment and are > able to consider smacking as part of that.’” Also contemporary, the CPS made less public assertion that with child victims of assault, their age could be considered an aggravating factor in deciding upon the charge, presumably to prevent further cases similar to A v UK. This led to interpretations by parties of the UK that any injury more than “transient reddening of the skin” should usually be charged as S47ABH and by this, the police could prosecute or issue a police caution to the parent by disregarding the defence by justification of Lawful Correction as being not applicable (often giving the caution for the lesser charge of common assault), such as the following in the UK’s Review of Section 58 of the Children Act, 2004 (“S58 Review”) at [8]: > “Following the change in the law, the Crown Prosecution Service amended the > Charging Standard on offences against the person, in particular the section > dealing with common assault. The Charging Standard now states that the > vulnerability of the victim, such as being a child assaulted by an adult, > should be treated as an aggravating factor when deciding the appropriate > charge. Injuries that would usually lead to a charge of ‘common assault’ now > should be more appropriately charged as ‘assault occasioning actual bodily > harm’ under section 47 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861 (on which > charge the defence of reasonable punishment is not now available), unless > the injury amounted to no more than temporary reddening of the skin and the > injury is transient and trifling.” The same S58 Review however provides a subtlety different interpretation at [11] with a spelling mistake highlighted: > “Therefore any injury sustained by a child which is serious enough to > warrant a charge of assault occasioning actual bodily harm cannot be > considered to be as the result of reasonable punishment. Section 58 and the > amended Charging Standard mean that for any injury to a child caused by a > parent or person acting in loco parentis which amounts to more than a > temporary reddening of the skin, and where the injury is more that transient > and trifling, the defence of reasonable punishment is not available.” This change to the charging standard reached police officers as the following bulletin (obtained via the FOIA from Humberside Police and operational 2015) transmuting the original CPS assertion in possibility of “could”, through the advisory of “should” and reaching those operationally responsible for enforcing the law bearing the definitive “would”: > “It states that, in respect of adults, an assault which causes injuries such > as grazes, scratches, abrasions, minor bruising, swellings, reddening of the > skin, superficial cuts, or a 'black eye' would normally be considered common > assault. But where the assault is against a child, such injuries (other than > ‘reddening of the skin’) would normally be charged as assault occasioning > actual bodily harm.” Precedent of R v Donovan 25 [1934] Cr App R 1 CCA demands that allegations of S47ABH must be supported by evidence of injury that “must, no doubt, be more than merely transient and trifling.” The Criminal Justice Act of 1988 provides a good reference for transient and trifling as being an injury only chargeable as Common Assault. S47ABH has always been regarded as a serious offence, warranting a prison sentence of up to five years. The CPS withdrew the explicit authorisation and clarified its position in 2011. This was communicated to the police by letter from the ACPO 16 December 2011 with the following words: > “In addressing the likely sentence, prosecutors should consider the > Sentencing Council’s Definitive Guideline on Assault and to only charge ABH > where the sentence is likely to be ‘clearly’ more than six months.” This approach uses statute and common law precedent in defining the chargeability of S47ABH where injury is no doubt more than “not serious” or \\"transient and trifling\\" Common Assault and that offence’s sentencing availability of six months (and less than “really serious” grievous bodily harm with its term between two and ten years). The CPS modified the Charging Standard as such and clarified the “mark” that parents are “not allowed to leave” as an injury clearly warranting a prison sentence in excess of six months, after consideration of all circumstances, including in exceptional cases, aggravating factors such as the age of the victim: > “The offence of Common Assault carries a maximum penalty of six months’ > imprisonment. This will provide the court with adequate sentencing powers in > most cases. ABH should generally be charged where the injuries and overall > circumstances indicate that the offence merits clearly more than six months’ > imprisonment and where the prosecution intend to represent that the case is > not suitable for summary trial. > There may be exceptional cases where the injuries suffered by a victim are > not serious and would usually amount to Common Assault but due to the > presence of significant aggravating features (alone or in combination), they > could more appropriately be charged as ABH contrary to section 47 of the > Offences Against the Person Act 1861. This would only be where a sentence > clearly in excess of six months’ imprisonment ought to be available, having > regard to the significant aggravating features.” Following them being made aware of the CPS 2011 withdrawal, the Children Are Unbeatable! alliance stated the following in their bulletin of April 2016: > “We do not yet know why these changes to the charging standards were made or > who was involved. The CPS told us: ‘The CPS sought views from interested > parties on the charging standards when in draft and the DPP chaired a > roundtable that included the magistracy and ACPO (NPCC) [the Association of > Chief Police Officers/National Police Chiefs Council] to discuss them. There > was general support for the new charging standards > 'It does not appear that any health, social work or voluntary bodies > working in child protection were either consulted or informed of the > changes. Certainly there has been no change in advice to professionals: even > the Authorised Professional Practice Guidance for the Police on the College > of Policing website still refers to the ‘reddening of the skin’ threshold > for the defence of ‘reasonable punishment’.” In the S58 Review the UK states at [56]: > “The law is clear. But there appears to be a lack of understanding about > precisely what the law allows and does not allow. The law does not permit > anyone deliberately or recklessly to cause injury to a child which is more > than transient and trifling. It is important that parents understand the law > so that they can bring up their children in the most effective way they see, > and not live in unreasonable fear of being subject to criminal > investigation. It is important too that practitioners, particularly social > workers, understand the law and are honest with parents about its effect, > while giving whatever advice and recommendations they think best to help > parents bring up their children effectively.” However, when asked what parents are allowed to do in corporal punishment, the UK responded through the Department for Education: > “The Department cannot offer definitive advice on the interpretation of the > law.” The police forces of England and Wales continue to use the withdrawn assertion of the CPS that minor injuries to children may be charged as ABH many years after being informed of this withdrawal such as the following FOIA response obtained in 2016 from Dyfed–Powys Police: > \\"Section 58 of the Children Act 2004 removes the defence of lawful > chastisement for parents or adults acting in loco parentis where the accused > person is charged with ABH, Wounding, GBH or Child Cruelty.

Paul in 1933 for patients unable to breathe for themselves due to illness. It was the first 'Intermittent Abdominal Pressure Ventilator' (IAPV). Design The Pulsator applied pressure externally upon the body to force exhalation, and the natural elasticity of the chest and the weight of the internal organs upon the diaphragm produced inhalation when that external pressure was removed. This method is now described as 'intermittent abdominal pressure ventilation', in contrast to negative pressure ventilators, commonly called 'iron lungs', that force inhalation and rely on chest elasticity to produce exhalation. Bragg came up with the idea for the machine to help a friend suffering from muscular dystrophy. His first version comprised a football bladder strapped to the patient's chest connected to a second football bladder sandwiched between two boards hinged together. Squeezing of the second bladder inflated the first, which compressed the chest and forced exhalation from the lungs. The first version built by scientific instrument maker R W Paul was water-powered - it was used for 17 hours per day for 3 years, except when the water supply froze one hard winter. It consumed about 700 gallons (3 cubic metres) of water per day. The commercial Pulsator designed by Paul consisted of a belt worn around the patient's abdomen and lower thorax that was rhythmically filled with air from bellows being driven electrically. A gauge indicated the pressure being applied to the chest, and the rate of compression could be modified to suit the patient's breathing. An escape-valve on the bellows controlled the pressure being applied. The 1934 model could be driven by hand, water or electric power, one case having used water power for a year. Following an analysis of the ventilation induced by the 1934 model, physiologist Phyllis Tookey Kerridge recommended some modifications that greatly improved the efficiency and usability of the belt. A quieter and more portable model was produced in 1937. The advantages of the design were its ease of transportation and use, it did not impede orthopaedic and nursing care, and could prevent lung collapse in some cases. Disadvantages were that inhalation depended upon elastic recoil of the chest and upon gravity pulling the diaphragm back down, and so breathing could be shallow and the patient could not lie down; attention was required in its use, and the action gave the patient more discomfort compared with cabinet (iron lung) respirators. It was built in Britain by Siebe Gorman & Company Ltd. Use The Pulsator was used predominantly for the treatment of diphtheria and anterior poliomyelitis-related respiratory paralysis. Other conditions treated with some degree of success were drug overdoses, and muscular dystrophy. The Pulsator and the 'iron lung' where the only respirators available during the severe outbreak of poliomyelitis in the United Kingdom in 1938. By March 1939 there were 43 Pulsators known to be in use in the British Isles, more common than the 'iron lungs', but already vastly outnumbered by the new Both respirators, which had been selected by a Medical Research Council committee investigating the shortage of equipment needed to cope with the polio epidemic. The Both was chosen over the equally effective Bragg-Paul when Lord Nuffield offered to give the Both to hospitals for free. This choice probably curtailed the further development of the Pulsator. In 1950 the Pulsator was still in use in Great Britain, Ireland and Portugal, still being the preferred ventilator for polio cases in Ireland. An early documented use of the Pulsator was at the Cork Street Fever Hospital, Dublin. From 1935 to 1938 all cases of post-diphtheria respiratory paralysis were treated with the Pulsator, only one of which died due to respiratory failure (when the machine broke down). Use of the Pulsator spread in the late 1950s due to its convenience and portability for chronically ill patients. Legacy The Pulsator provided life-saving treatment for many people in the early days of artificial ventilation, and when the only alternative was the 'iron lung' the much less intrusive treatment of the Pulsator allowed for a more normal life for its patients. As the first 'Intermittent Abdominal Pressure Ventilator', the Pulsator was the forerunner of various newer apparatuses, in particular the 'Pneumobelt' which subsequently became a generic name for the genre. A 1991 study concluded that IAPV was effective for the long-term daytime treatment of respiratory insufficiency and could avoid the need for tracheostomy. While the less- severely ill patients preferred IPPV (intermittent positive pressure ventilation), IAPV was found to be best for severe cases, and was the preferred type of mechanical assistance in the seated position. However it should not be used for 24 hours a day, and its effectiveness for some patients could decline after years of use. Although considered obsolete by 2014, superseded by newer types of ventilators, Pneumobelts were still manufactured at least until 2008.

Fornieles uses film, social media platforms, sculpture, installation and performance to express the interaction of family, relationships, popular memes, language and the subcultures of the 21st century. His work operates within immersive simulations, which construct and enact alternative political and social spaces. His projects often involve cultural, social, and infrastructural production. Biography Fornieles was born in rural Hampshire, where his parents had an architectural practice. Fornieles attended the University of Oxford, receiving his BFA from the Ruskin School of Drawing and Fine Art in 2005. He went on to the Royal College of Art in London, completing an M.A. in sculpture in 2011. While in graduate school, Fornieles worked as a studio assistant to Anish Kapoor, where he demonstrated his extensive technical skills.http://www.artslant.com/9/articles/show/44437 Living in East London, he often worked as a freelance data analyst while he immersed himself in art and curating, having established in 2007 (with Ross McNicol and Vanessa Carlos), the Wallis Gallery. During this time Fornieles work evolved mocking, often with a dark sense of humour, the high seriousness of the London art scene. Ed Fornieles has lived and worked in London, Los Angeles, and Montreal. Work Davay, Glubzhe! Fornieles was first recognized for his performance pieces such as Animal House (2011) at the experimental space, Guest Projects in London. Animal House helped refine a method that Fornieles would repeat in his subsequent works, engaging participants and viewers in sometimes awkward situations. Dorm Daze, grew out of Fornieles' interest in American fraternity culture as a large-scale on-line performance played-out on Facebook, where participants adopted profiles taken from real life American college students. Fornieles work focuses on the effect of narratives, habits, and technology in the formation of social roles and personal identity. He uses performance to re-enact and distort relationships to archetypes and conventions. Each chapter of work is driven by an intense period of research centered on reinterpreting and remodeling the subject under investigation. The Dreamy Awards (2012), was a fictional ceremony initiated to raise questions about the cult of the awards bash. The work was presented at the Serpentine Galleries Park Nights with the participation of over 200 people, including actor Zac Efron, in a pre-recorded video clip. Other works include, New York New York Happy Happy (NY NY HP HP) (2013) where Fornieles was invited by Rhizome to organize a gala at the New Museum. The event was controversial because Fornieles scripted both actual Museum donors and actors, blurring any sense of reality. Modern Family (2014) was a sullen installation where Fornieles explored the breakdown of the family both metaphorically and literally. Ed Fornieles first solo gallery exhibition, The Hangover Part II, constructed from the detritus of Animal House, was organized at the Carlos/Ishikawa Gallery, London in 2011. Other significant sculptural installations include Characterdate, Frame (2012), at the Frieze Art Fair, London, where he continued demonstrating his interest in American college culture. Despicable Me 2 (2013) at the Mihai Nicodim Gallery in Los Angeles, invented a female character, \\"Britney Rivers\\" who develops a stereotypical personality as she builds her network of friends on Social Media. With Jupiter Ascending (2015) at Carl Kostyal, Stockholm, Fornieles recreated a spa reflecting the meditative culture associated with care of the body and Der Geist: Flesh Feast (2016) at Arratia Beer in Berlin continued the body theme in which Fornieles expressed, through film, objects, and installation, his attempt to adopt a self-management diet. Fornieles has also been invited to participate in important group shows curated to bring together postinternet creators. These include Meanwhile... Suddenly, and Then curated by Gunnar B. Kvaranat for the 12e Biennale d'art contemporain de Lyon, Family state of mind (2014) with Petra Cortright at Galerie Chez Valentin in Paris,https://www.aqnb.com/2014/05/21/family-state-of-mind-valentin- may-23-jun-28/ and I feel we think bad (2016) with Hannah Perry and Matt Goerzen at Arsenal in Montreal. Curating In September 2019 Fornieles' curated a show at Lisa Kandlhofer Gallery in Vienna. The show's title was Cursed Images and included artists John Bock, Doug Bressler, Chris Burden, VALIE EXPORT, Ann Hirsch, Joey Holder, Rachel Maclean, Otto Muehl, Naked, Hermann Nitsch, Puppies Puppies, Rudolf Schwarzkogler, Omsk Social Club, Tommy Turner, Anna Uddenberg, David Wojnarowicz, Issy Wood and Katerina Zbortkova.

Her art work was the main feature and cover of 2016's January/February issue of the American magazine SCULPTURE, one of the world's most relevant publications on that field. Life and career The eclecticism which characterises her work can be traced back to her studies in Architecture, Medieval and Renaissance History and Contemporary Art. She graduated in Architecture (2014) and completed a Masters degree in Medieval and Renaissance History (2007) at the University of Porto, Portugal. Later she moved to Manchester, United Kingdom, where she lectured at university and was awarded a PhD in Art and Design at Manchester School of Art (2016). In 2011 Cristina was awarded a research grant by the Arts and Humanities Research Council to develop her ongoing research project ‘Design for Desertification’. She then focused her research work on the study and register of Portuguese territories with low population density. She also began to create some of her most poignant contemporary art work, and textiles became her trade mark from the outset. The recurring use of satin ribbons, industrial fabrics and lace has been a distinguishing feature in her aesthetic narrative. Manchester, the old textile capital of Europe, became her chosen home for seven years and during this time Cristina focused on the study of Contemporary Art. By combining her many interests, namely culture, oral traditions and textiles, she created The Blanket, one of her most emblematic works. The original version of this contemporary art installation was made with Idanha-a-Nova's traditional instrument, the adufe, cotton lace and satin ribbons. Themes Cristina Rodrigues interprets reality by analyzing mentalities and iconographies in contemporary society. The dialectics between tradition and contemporaneity is central to her work. Her art celebrates the role of women in contemporary society. Items which are characteristic of the female universe are used in her works of art. Cotton lace, satin ribbons, glass and crystal necklaces are combined with iron and musical instruments in order to build narratives. Ready-made necklaces bought in the pound shop are combined with luxurious china, in an eclectic blend creating an analogy with contemporary society. Emigration, a theme which is particularly relevant to her generation, is addressed in some of her work, namely the sculpture Grapes of Wrath, inspired by John Steinbeck's work. Herself a migrant, for several years Cristina collected furniture that had belonged to migrants from the various communities in Manchester, United Kingdom. The contemporary art installation titled Bourgeois comprises four chairs previously owned by an Iranian family living in Stockport, United Kingdom. Like these, several other conventional furnishing underwent an intervention by the artist, transforming them into luxury objects. Works In situ, Cristina's art installations and sculptures adorne ordinary objects with baroque detail. She combines creative flair with everyday items. Each of her art installations is locally inspired yet universal in meaning, and it intentionally touches the lives of all those involved in its artistic production. Cristina's practice is marked by simple aesthetics, almost always based on ethnographic research.

Centered around Currier Park, a rectangular park laid out in 1883 just east of the city's downtown, are a collection of a high quality predominantly Italianate and Queen Anne Victorian residences. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990. Description and history The city of Barre rose in the last quarter of the 19th century as a major center of the granite quarrying and processing industry. It experienced rapid growth, resulting in the development of its downtown, and the need for workers increased development pressures on adjacent rural areas. To the east of its downtown was a farm property owned by Stedman Chubb, a stonemason who had purchased it from his father-in-law, Richard Carrier, in 1881. First used by Chubb as a dairy farm, he began laying out Currier Park in 1883. Chubb donated the park to the city in 1883; it was first named Chubb Park in his honor, but was later renamed for his father-in-law. The first houses were built facing the park about 1885, and the area was completely developed by 1905. with The historic district consists of Currier Park and all of the buildings facing it on East, North, Park, and Academy Streets. It extends a bit further from the park along Park, East, and Academy, and also includes abutting properties on the adjacent Averill, Cliff, and Mount Streets. The district directly abuts the Barre Downtown Historic District, which lies to the west and south. The majority of main buildings in the district are in a vernacular Italianate style, although a large minority of the 38 buildings are Queen Anne in style. There are four Colonial Revival houses in the district, built in the early 20th century. The park is rectangular in shape, with a star-shaped path layout and grassy areas dotted with trees.

History  In 1506 the Fathers of the Order of Saint Augustine had already a friary in Alcamo opposite Porta Saccari (a town gate) near the present via San Nicolò. As they bore hard being subject to the Bishop’s authority, in 1589 they built another friary, together with the Church of Saint Augustine, in the same place where the Church is located now.Carlo Cataldo, La conchiglia di S.Giacomo p.236, Alcamo, Campo, 2001. In 1650 the premises were still being constructed because the monks lived in great poverty of alms in kind and finally, in 1660, for the same reasons they left both the Church and the friary to the vescovile Curia; since 1713 they were administrated by the parish of Saints Paul and Bartholomew's Church. During the years 1849-1850 it was rebuilt in the rectangular shape, with chapels having pilasters and corinthian capitals; then it was restored several times, while the area where there was the friary was used for private residences. At present the parson of the Saints Paul and Bartholomew's Church is the Rector of this Church. In 1876 they founded the Pia Unione Femminile Gesù, Maria and Giuseppe: its founder, the priest Antonio Barbuscia Santoro, was told by his mother, when a boy, that during his birth (with death danger for both of them), he had been consecrated to the Holy Family. The parson of the Saints Paul and Bartholomew's Church gave this priest an altar with the image of the Holy Family. As “good and evil inside families and society originated from woman’s good and bad behaviour”, the scopes of this Congregation were: *to put a stop to all the evils filling the town *to honour Jesus, Mary and saint Joseph *give to its members every means more profitable for their sanctification and the moral and religious edification of their families.  Works  The Church has 5 altars and one nave with a barrel vault; there are 24 built-in pillars with Corinthian capitals. Main altar *High altar: Saint Augustine, a painting made by an unknown author; until 1835 it was dedicated to Saint Nicholas of Tolentino, with a painting on canvas made 1610 by Giuseppe Carrera, now hosted in the anti sacristy of the Saints Paul and Bartholomew's Church. *Brass Tabernacle in Gothic style and inlayings (in the high altar Carlo Cataldo, Guida storico-artistica dei beni culturali di Alcamo-Calatafimi-Castellammare Golfo p. 76-78-79, Alcamo, Sarograf, 1982.

It is the oldest church in continuous use in Ireland. The Tuamgraney parish operates as a unit with the Mountshannon parish in the Killaloe Union of parishes in the Diocese of Limerick and Killaloe.http://www.clarelibrary.ie/eolas/claremuseum/projects/clare_heritage_newsletter_no2_autumn2005_1sted.pdf History A wooden monastery was built at the site before 550 CE, most likely by Saint Cronan. Despite looting by vikings in 886 and 949, the monastery thrived. The current stone church was built by Cormac ua Cillín around 949-964 CE. In 1012, the church was repaired by Brian Boru, High King of Ireland, whose brother Marcán was Abbot of Tuamgraney at the time. It is the only preserved building with a recorded link to Brian Boru. The building was extended in the 12th century. Archaeologically and architecturally, it is described as a Type 2 unicameral mortared pre-Romanesque church in Zone 2 (west of the River Shannon).Tomás Ó Carragáin. REGIONAL VARIATION IN IRISH PRE-ROMANESQUE ARCHITECTURE. The Antiquaries Journal, 85, 2005, pp 23-56. Ua Cillin also built a round tower on the site, but this no longer exists. Outside the church is a large stone which appears similar to a washing stone found at Ross Errilly Friary in County Galway. One of the earliest records of tower building in Ireland dates to Ua Cillin's obituary in the Chronicon Scotorum, which notes: \\"he had built the ‘great’ church and round tower\\" at Tuamgraney.Tadhg O’Keeffe, Ireland’s Round Towers: Buildings, Rituals and Landscapes of the Early Irish Church.

He did not enter the church and stated: \\"The present church of Tuaim Greine is of no antiquity, and there is nothing there by which the antiquarian can be interested but a rude castle.\\" The castle to which he referred is the 15th century O'Grady's Castle which is extant. O'Grady's Castle by St. Cronan's Church, Tuamgraney Both Church of Ireland and Roman Catholic followers are buried in the church's graveyard, including genealogist Edward MacLysaght and the parents of writer Edna O'Brien. The church remains in use by the Church of Ireland as a place of worship. Heritage centre In 1989, a local voluntary group established the East Clare Heritage Centre (ECHC) and in 1992 acquired a 21-year licence on the property. The licence on the church expired in October 2013 but was extended until October 2014. The Church of Ireland Dean declined to renew the licence, preferring the church to be used exclusively as a place of worship.http://www.clarechampion.ie/east-clare-heritage-centre-remains-place- worship/ The centre was officially opened by President of Ireland Mary Robinson in June 1991. As well as St. Cronan's Church, the group's work included the 7th century monastic settlement of Holy Island (Inis Cealtra) and a restored Famine memorial park. The centre obtained charitable status in 2002 and received an annual maintenance grant of €10,000 from Clare County Council until 2009. The centre published a regular journal and several books.http://www.aughty.org/pdf/eclare_famine.pdf Design The church is built from roughly coursed sandstone which was sourced within 3 km of the church. Its design contains elements of cyclopean masonry with a deep anta of 0.59 metres. The ashlar walling in the chancel is rare for a pre-Romanesque building. It is similar in form to Clonmacnoise and retains its original doorway, the lintel and architrave of which denote its significance to worshippers. =Carved head= Inside the church lies a carved Romanesque sandstone head which was originally part of the external wall on the eastern gable. Until its complete restoration in 1990, it was covered in several layers of plaster, with only the nose visible. It is known locally as Gráinne and thought to be the provenance of the placename of Tuamgraney; alternatively the carving is claimed to represent St. Cronan himself.\\"On a Female Stone Head at Tuamgraney:‘Gráinne and her sisters’\\" by Lorna Moloney, http://homepage.eircom.net/~eastclareheritage/Grainne.html viewed 25 June 2018. =Windows= In 1990, a three-light stained glass window by renowned stained-glass artist Alfred E. Child worth approximately €1 million was added to the eastern window of the church by ECHC. Titled The Ascension, it shows Jesus accompanied by 2 angels. The window had been commissioned in 1906 by a Miss Ivers in memory of her parents. It had been vandalised at its former location in the disused parish church of Kilfinaghta, County Clare. The northern wall includes a 12th-century Romanesque window with chevrons on its arch and sides. The south wall features 4 windows, one decorated with fretwork and another with spirals.

Out of this, ₦55 billion was for salaries, ₦18,114,178,637 for payment of pensions and gratuities with overhead costs at ₦14,524,179,815. In addition, projected capital expenditure was ₦187 billion, which gave a capital to recurrent expenditure ratio of 60:40. In terms of allocation, the figure showed that 15.5% was allocated to administration, 29.1% to the economic sector, 0.41% to law and justice, and 28.4% to the social sector. Funding sources All major revenue sources of the ₦307 billion budget for fiscal year 2016 were broken down as follows: * Statutory allocation, including derivation and VAT: ₦115 billion (est.) * Internally generated revenue: ₦120 billion (est.) * Other: ₦72 billion (est.) Criticism There was criticism from across the political spectrum about the budget, mainly from members of the opposition party. Most of this criticism was directed towards the quick passage of the budget with the All Progressives Congress calling it the \\"height of banditry\\". The party believed that the budget shouldn't have been passed since some of the House members were then contesting the nullification of their elections at the appeal courts. It also claimed that such action was an indication that the legislative and executive branches of government in Rivers State were conniving with a hidden agenda to benefit themselves.

Built in 1887 for a private fire company, it is a fine local example of 19th-century commercial architecture. It served the city as a fire and police station until the 1960s, and is now used as a commercial space. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971, and is a contributing property to the City Hall Park Historic District. Description and history The former Ethan Allen Engine Company No. 4 building is located just north of Burlington City Hall, on the west side of Church Street between Main and College Streets. Its front facade faces Church Street, but it also presents a designed facade to City Hall Park, which is located directly behind it. It is three stories in height, built out of red brick, in a commercial variation of the Richardsonian Romanesque style. The facade facing Church Street has two former equipment bays on the ground floor, now converted to commercial storefronts, which art articulated by pilaster-like brick pillars set on granite block piers with red rusticated stone base and capital. A stone band above these bays identifies the engine company. The upper two floors have windows set in groups in tall round-arch openings, which are in a Palladian style with a large central opening and narrower flanking ones. The building is topped by an tower that was originally used to dry hoses. with The firehouse was built in 1887 for a private fire company that operated horse-drawn fire engines. It was later folded into the city's fire department, and the building adapted to house motorized fire equipment. Later in the 20th century it was occupied by the Burlington Police Department, which vacated the premises in the late 1960s. It has since been adapted for commercial uses.

They were originally thought to be cephalopods or annelid worms. The living animals filled up to five-sixths of their shell with laminae, angled layers composed of grains of quartz or calcium carbonate detritus from the environment cemented together, with larger grains near the shell wall and smaller grains near the center. A very fine tube ran through the center of the shell. The grains may be of quartz or calcium carbonate, but are of specific shapes and materials that are rare in the surrounding rock. Though the body of the living animal is not preserved, it had to be able to find, choose, and retrieve rare grains from its environment to build the laminae. The phylum's name comes from the Greek word for \\"fragments\\", referring to these fine fragments and grains of detritus. It was proposed by the paleontologist and geologist (1928–2006) in 1977 to house the agglutinating Early Cambrian fossils Salterella and Volborthella, with the Middle Cambrian Ellisell yochelsoni later included. The poorly known Middle Cambrian fossil Vologdinella was also considered for inclusion, as it has superficial resemblance to the Agmata, but was later excluded from the group. Currently, the phylum contains only one family, Salterellidae; a second family, Volborthellidae, was originally included but later became a synonym of the former. No orders, classes or superfamilies are used within the phylum, despite the order \\"Volborthellida\\" being previously proposed for Volborthella before the phylum's own proposal. The reasoning for this was that taxa of these ranks were not seen as necessary in a phylum with very few genera. The genera within the group are clearly different: Salterella had a pointed shell made of calcium carbonate with a thin outer layer and a thick inner layer, and secreted a calcium carbonate cement to hold its grains in place. Volborthella was the older genus, had a blunter shell with a shallower opening, and cemented grains in place with organic material that also may have formed the outside surface of the shell. Fossils are found in large numbers in some areas. Paleontologists have offered several different ideas of how these animals lived: filter-feeding with the points of the shells embedded in the substrate, grazing actively like snails, or lying on their sides on the substrate. Volborthella is found in silt and clay deposits, and apparently lived on tidal mudflats. Attempts to reconcile these genera as members of any other group have been rejected due to basic differences in structure, but not all paleontologists accept them as a phylum; Jones (2007) considers the shell an agglutinating test parallel to that of foraminifers. Yochelson considered Agmata to be complex multicellular animals.

A porch was later added by John Bowden. The church was restored in 1879 by Thomas Newenham Deane. The original construction was funded by the Board of First Fruits with a gift of £100 and a loan of £775. It is a detached, single-cell, gable- fronted church. The pitched roof is covered with artificial slate. There are 5 bays on each side of the nave which features Gothic pointed-arch stained glass windows, with a vestry to the south east, and a porch and 4-stage bell tower to the south west. The string coursed sandstone walls and tower feature crenellation and pinnacles, as well as diagonal buttresses and pinnacles on the porch. The pointed-arch main doorway holds a timber battened double-leaf door. Preservation The church has been renovated several times, including a large renovation in the 1960s when the slate roof was replaced, the interior was redecorated, and the graveyard was deforested. Its most notable historical artefact is a 17th-century pre-Reformation silver chalice decorated with raised angelic figures. The chalice may have been used at a wedding as the letters S.C. M.P., thought to be the initials of the couple, are inscribed on the base.

Another notable journalist, Sergio Romano, wrote of Gentile that he had an irrepressible tendency to deconstruct fashionable ideas, to puncture the balloons of political rhetoric and systematically to destroy received wisdoms. Life Panfilo Gentile was born in L'Aquila, an ancient city in the mountains between Rome and the Adriatic Sea. He was the eldest son of Vincenzo Gentile, prominent in the area as a lawyer and politician, by his marriage to Giuseppina Giorgi. Panfilo trained as a lawyer. However, rather than following in his father's footsteps, he studied Philosophy with Giorgio Del Vecchio and, while still young, became an unattached philosophy lecturer, later teaching his chosen subject at Bologna and, later, at Naples. Between 1911 and 1913 he worked on L'Unità, a relatively short-lived weekly publication focused on the arts and politics, founded and run by Gaetano Salvemini. He later became a contributor to the socialist daily newspaper, l'Avanti!. In July 1914 Gentile was an adherent of the neutralist position, speaking out against Italian participation in the war. In 1917/18 he moved from Bologna to Naples where the climate was more benevolent in the context of the respiratory problems he was having. After the war he moved again, to Rome, where he worked as a literary critic on \\"Il Paese\\", a daily newspaper set up by which defined itself, at least in part, through its opposition to Mussolini's newspaper, \\"Il Popolo d'Italia\\". During this time he wrote less about the legal themes that had been at the heart of his early published work, turning instead to the history of religions and the origins of Christianity. In 1923 the publishers Laterza published his ambitious \\"Summary of a philosophy of religion\\" (\\"Sommario d'una filosofia della religione\\"). Hostile to the Mussolini régime, which extended its control of the country during 1924 and 1925, Gentile backed the \\"Manifesto of the Anti-Fascist Intellectuals\\" (\\"Manifesto degli intellettuali antifascisti\\") which Benedetto Croce produced in May 1925. Setting aside his university career, he concentrated now on working as a legal advocate, defending both in the traditional courts and in the \\"Special courts for the defence of the State\\" which were a feature of the Italian justice system between 1926 and 1943. Directly after the Second World War, with Leone Cattani and others, Gentile co-founded the Independent Liberal Movement (\\"Movimento Liberale Indipendente\\" / MLI), comprising a liberal breakaway group from the recently re-founded Liberal Party (\\"Partito Liberale Italiano\\" / PLI) combined with the Democratic Socialist elements. The idea was to create a \\"third force\\" in Italian politics and form a democratic counter- weight to the Christian Democrats. The movement lasted approximately three years. In elections the anti-communist majority repeatedly favoured Christian Democratic candidates. There being no space found in the political spectrum for the MLI, its elements returned to their respective Liberal and Socialist origins while the Christian Democrats dominated the political scene nationally for the next half century. During this period, in 1946, Panfilo Gentile was a member of the National Consultation [assembly] (\\"Consulta Nazionale\\"), a short-lived appointed \\"pre-parliament\\" mandated to create the basis for a return to democratic government. However, his more notable contributions to history come from his work as a writer and journalist. He wrote for the Risorgimento Liberale newspaper from its inception in August 1943, shortly after the collapse of the Fascist regime, till November 1947 when he left in a disagreement over political tactics during a reconfiguration of the political centre in Italy. Between 1949 and 1951 Gentile was a member of the editorial team on Il Mondo, a weekly magazine devoted to politics, economics and culture. His own contributions, which appeared under the pseudonym \\"Averroè\\" included a political diary and were characterised by a passionate defence of free market economics, invoking the philosophical stance of Friedrich Hayek and his economist allies. For half a year, between April and October 1952, Gentile ran the Florence based daily newspaper La Nazione in succession to Sandro Volta. After this he was recruited by to write for Corriere della Sera: he stayed till 1966, the year of his seventy-seventh birthday. At Corriere he sustained his economic liberal credentials, while becoming increasingly critical of the interventionist solutions advocated by political left. Along with this, his writing was characterised by increasing pessimism about Italian politics. During the 1960s he produced a succession of increasingly shrill political critiques, such as \\"Polemic against my own times\\" (\\"Polemica contro il mio tempo\\" - 1965), \\"Displeasing opinions\\" (\\"Opinioni sgradevoli\\" - 1968) and \\"Mafia democracy\\" (\\"Democrazie mafiose\\" - 1969). Penfilo Gentile's down- beat evaluation was of modern democracies dominated by party machines, incapable of promoting real talent, and programmed to construct, especially in Italy, oligarchic dictatorship masquerading as political pluralism. With grim lucidity he captured he degenerative aspects of the Italian politics. Gentile's pugnacious writing was characterised by Satre as \\"imposter philosophy\\" and Herbert Marcuse called him a \\"livid polemicist\\".

In the game, the player controls a character known as the god, who interacts with a character called the hero. The hero progresses in the video game without interaction with the player's god character. Reception to the game was positive, with the focus on its gameplay.  Gameplay  Godville is a zero-player game, which means it does not require interaction from the player for the game to progress. In the game, there is the hero-character, who is a non-player character, and there is the god-character, who is played by the player. The hero is a religious fanatic who uses a diary to communicate with the god, and occasionally needs a sign of the god's existence; the player uses the god- character to influence the hero positively or negatively using rewards and punishments, and sometimes direct communication. The game is also a role- playing game, meaning the hero will wander his world, defeat monsters, find and use treasure and items, and sometimes lose to monsters and unfriendly non- player characters. The player names the hero. Over time, the hero levels up and learns special skills, and has his own personality as a result of his adventuring, as well as his interaction with the god. The game provides some items with enhanced abilities which the hero can use only with the god's involvement; the hero will sell these items even if they do \\"have some marvelous effect\\". The hero can also have a pet companion. The game allows some limited player-vs-player interaction: the god can have the hero duel other heroes. The hero who wins takes some coins from the losing hero as well some of his items. The god can somewhat influence these duels, but sometimes the god's attempt aids the opposing god's hero instead of his own. The game has day and night themes. After a period of time playing the game, the game enables the player to review the most-important events the hero has participated in since the last time the player checked the game. The Russian version of the game in 2010, which was entirely in a web browser, had no graphics or sound.  Development and release  Mikhail Platov developed the video game as \\"a clear progeny of Progress Quest\\". A beta version of the game was announced in May 2010. The game was released for iPhone and iPod in July 2010 and shortly after for iPad; Android in March 2011 and for web browser a month later; Windows Phone in July 2013; and Apple Watch in 2015. The game is free-to-play and connected to the Internet. Once their characters reach level 10, players can suggest updates to the game, which are then voted upon by the community of players for subsequent inclusion. = Themes = The game satirizes religion, the role-playing game genre, the massively-multiplayer online game genre, and video games in general. Occasionally, the hero will be philosophical.  Reception  On release, Eli Hodapp, editor-in-chief of TouchArcade, said that the game \\"sounds a little stupid\\" but that \\"it's surprisingly amusing without needing to actually do anything at all\\". Jim Sterling, writing for Destructoid, called Godville \\"a fun, funny, incredibly clever little game\\"; he later added in GamesRadar that it was \\"one of the most compelling, engaging, and addictive little bits of software out there\\". In 2012, Edge Online called the game \\"darkly rewarding in its meaningless levelling and incessant battles even before you take into account the smart writing\\", and was similarly addicted to \\"the promises of numbers that get larger and larger over time\\". In 2014, The New York Times said the game \\"has a wickedly funny side, and it will light up your imagination.\\" Hodapp said that the original adventures the character went on were repetitive, but that the developers had implemented a number of excellent community suggestions within the first month. The lack of control over the hero was appealing to Hodapp. He originally thought the game was novel and didn't expect it to last, but was surprised that he was still interested in the game years later, and likens checking the game to checking his email or Twitter feed. NDTV compared the game favorably to Godus, another video game in the genre. Reviewers approved of the game on mobile platforms, including iPod Touch, iPhone, Apple Watch, and Android.

He was part of the art movement known as Fantastic Realism. Life Rauh's father was a civil servant, and his mother came from a family of farm labourers. After the family moved to the town of Bayreuth he attended the Gymnasium (academic secondary school) there from 1923 on. In 1926 he joined the “Wandervogel” youth movement. Graduating from school in 1931, he began his studies at the art academy in Düsseldorf in 1932, attending lectures by Werner Heuser and Heinrich Nauen. Rauh was an enthusiastic admirer of the works of Kubin, Masereel and Cézanne. During the years 1934/35 he spent some months in Amsterdam, meeting former students of Paul Klee and Bauhaus. In 1936 he continued his studies at the academy in Leipzig under the supervision of Walter Tiemann. The following year he moved to Berlin, where he worked as a freelance artist and was employed by an advertising agency. He had his first exhibition at the Berlin gallery Zintl in 1939. In the same year, immediately after his marriage, he was conscripted and sent to the Polish front as an infantryman. During the war his skills as a cartographer were discovered; he was deployed in France and Russia, and was briefly imprisoned at the end of the war. His family had been evacuated to the small Franconian village of Himmelkron during the war, and Rauh lived there with them under financially constrained circumstances from 1945 to 1955. To make ends meet, Rauh would sketch the houses of villagers, who often paid in natural produce for the drawings. In 1955 he moved to Kulmbach with his wife and two children, and lived there until his death in 1983. From 1958 onwards, Rauh was a member of Fantasmagie, a Belgian-based movement to which representatives of Fantastic Realism from all over Europe subscribed. He regularly participated in exhibitions held by this and other groups, and eventually mounted a public exhibition devoted exclusively to his work. Caspar Walter Rauh died in Kulmbach on 7 October 1983. Work =Ink drawings and engravings= Already during the war, Rauh was working on ink drawings in small formats which drew on a repertoire of phantasmagorical images rich in symbols. The shock and terror of the war was a point of departure for Rauh's artistic productions during the post-war period. In 1947 he published a folder with 16 ink drawings. Shortly afterwards the volume Niemandsland (No Man's Land) was published in a subsidised print run of 10,000 copies. It contains 48 ink drawings accompanied by 48 short but distinctive texts. Its imagery – inspired by surrealism and phantasmagorical drawing – depicts the war as an apocalypse that has created a no man's land within which humanist values have been marginalised. More or less simultaneously, Rauh was working on a second project entitled Traumland (Dreamland), but this volume was not published until 1993, when it was released as part of his bequest. In contrast to Niemandsland the ink drawings in Traumland are coloured throughout and the imagery leans more strongly towards the humorous, idyllic and bizarre. Rauh himself describes it as an attempt to “soar above misery while dreaming and construct a world in its own right – a magic garden”. The differences between the two collections illustrate a tension that goes right through Rauh's later works: between the unstinting illustration of barbarity and destruction on the one hand, and the quest for fantastic imagination, irony and burlesque on the other hand. After a short engagement with abstraction during the fifties, in which he chiefly worked in mixed media, Rauh returned to Fantastic Realism with its potential for humour and revulsion. Although he increasingly worked in larger formats, the main focus of his artistic production was still on small formats – ink drawings and above all engravings. From 1958 onwards he regularly produced folders of hand-produced etchings printed and sold by Rauh himself. =Watercolours= Watercolours (also involving ink draughtsmanship) constituted an important second sphere of activity which, while present since the fifties, intensified after 1970. The watercolours are chiefly depicting landscapes, but run the gamut from “real” landscape drawing to imaginative scenarios exploiting surreal figurations. =Book Illustrations= Illustrations of literary works opened up a third line of activity for Rauh. His marked preference for the classics of fantastic literature is recognisable in his illustrations of works and productions written by Edgar Allan Poe, Jean Paul and E.T.A. Hoffmann. In addition, Rauh worked as an illustrator of children's books, providing ink drawings for the German edition of three novels in Mary Norton’s series The Borrowers. In addition, he produced numerous works based on motifs taken from the fairy tales of the Grimm brothers and others. =Rauh as author: fairy tales= Rauh's interest in fairy tales is also documented by his own literary productions. Between 1950 and 1955 he wrote 33 short fairy tales which were broadcast by Bayerischer Rundfunk (Bavarian Radio) and published in German daily newspapers. =\\"Kunst am Bau\\"= It was initially in order to provide a financial income for his family that Rauh accepted a number of commissions involving the composition of large-scale glass mosaics for building projects. Examples of this work can mainly be seen in the region of Upper Franconia. A well-known example can be seen on an electric transformer in Kulmbach – the “Transformatorenhäuschen” depicts the animals of the African savannah. However, in his brief autobiographical sketch Curriculum Vitae, Rauh described these commissioned works as “unsatisfactory\\". =The C.W. Rauh bequest= The C.W Rauh bequest, comprising a significant collection of Rauh's drawings, engravings and paintings as well as his entire studio materials, is on permanent loan to the Oberfrankenstiftung (Culture Foundation of Upper Franconia) and is housed at the art museum (Kunstmuseum) in Bayreuth.

Since then. the bridge became known for the sporting venues to the south, as the 'Lillie Bridge Grounds' opened in 1869 and closed by arson and a riot in 1887. It was the scene of athletics, football and county cricket, as well as cycling and ballooning. To the north it has become associated with the eponymous Lillie Bridge Depot, built in 1871 as an engineering hub for the early railways and latterly, a maintenance centre for London Transport's tube network.Route and Track diagrams for West Kensington and Lillie Bridge: http://www.trainweb.org/tubeprune/route%20and%20track%20diagrams.htm#West%20Kensington%20and%20Lillie%20Bridge retrieved 2016-10-03 Fowler's bridge has been lengthened and strengthened in ensuing years.

Green corridor In spite of repeated disturbance since the early 19th-century, with canal and railway building, the verges of the West London Line and the proximity of Brompton Cemetery and the town gardens of Empress Place in Fulham, had ensured the survival of a rich biodiversity in the area of the bridge. Most notably there is a pond, remnant of the ever-present Counter's Creek, along platform 4 of West Brompton station on the Fulham side. The pond and its acre of 'scrub' was, until 5 years ago, supervised by the erstwhile Railtrack and local volunteers from Fulham Groundwork UK.

The church is built in the neoclassical style, and is registered in the list of cultural heritage. History Pyatigorsk had a few thousand Roman Catholics in the 1830s, mainly Polish exiles in the city after the Polish uprising of 1830. The Emperor Nicholas in 1837 granted permission to build a church for Catholics in the city. After raising money, the church was built from 1840 to 1844 according to designs by Giuseppe and Giovanni Battista, members of a famous dynasty of architects, authors of many architectural monuments in the Caucasus. Others taking part in the construction work included the Bernardazzi brothers, and Samuel Upton, of English origin. The dedication ceremony of the Church of the Transfiguration was held on August 6, 1844. After the 1917 revolution, the Bolshevik government suppressed all religions. Religious services continued until 1937 despite the repression. However, in January 1938, at the height of Stalinist repression, the priest Johann Roth was shot and the church was closed. After the fall of communism the church was registered again in 1992. The building was returned fully to the Catholic Church in 2005; previously it served as both a concert hall and a Catholic church.

The poem comprises 3,460 verse couplets divided into 13 cantos of unequal length and is also notable for providing information on the political history of ancient India. The Trishashtishalakapurushacharitra (; The Lives of the Sixty-three Illustrious People), an epic Sanskrit poem on the key figures in Jainism, was composed by Hemachandra at the request of the Chaulukya king, Kumarapala. The Sthaviravalicharitra (The Lives of the Jain Elders) is considered a self-contained sequel to this work and is consequently referred to as the Parishishtaparvan or The Appendix. The period largely covered in the poem corresponds to and follows the growth of the kingdom of Magadha and the establishment of the Maurya Empire. According to Hemachandra, the sequence of rulers in the times of the Jains discussed was: Shrenika, Kunika, Udayin, the nine Nandas, Chandragupta Maurya, Ashoka, and Samprati. Hemachandra also speaks of Samprati being instrumental in the spread of Jainism further south. The Parishishtaparvan was Hemachandra's last major work.

He often works in large-format portraiture. His work has been featured in solo and collective exhibitions since 2011.  Biography  Although he was interested in drawings and making portraits since childhood, Nguyen's life shows that his daily responsibilities delayed his entry into the art world. Hom Nguyen decided to start his own business as a leather patina artist in 2009, the year his mother's died. He originally worked as a shoe salesman.http://londonstreetartdesign.co.uk/28617-2/ With a difficult start, he developed his own technique during the initial few months in Tokyo, Japan, learning from great masters of the tattoo in Shibuya. In France, his work focused on patinas, colors, and material. He became known for \\"works of art you can wear.\\" Many collaborations (notably one with the designer Ora-Ito in 2011) guided him further into the world of design and art. In 2009, Nguyen moved into a large workshop in Bagnolet, allowing him to start portraits on large format canvases. Since then, Hom Nguyen has devoted himself to drawing and painting. His works are increasingly exposed to the world through international contemporary art exhibitions. The Bangkok Post highlights that the artist never stops himself from making a foray into other lands, such as his perspective on Asian artistic and philosophical tradition. As the representative of occidental and oriental culture, Hom Nguyen works toward widening the cultural set, creating a bridge between France and Asia. During the 2016 edition of the contemporary art fair Art Paris Art Fair, held at the Grand Palais in Paris, French President François Hollande came to appreciate Hom Nguyen's work. On June 15, 2016, Hom Nguyen presented the series \\"Sans Repères\\" for the first time in the Palais de Tokyo.http://www.ifitshipitshere.com/hom-nguyen-x-pinel-pinel/ Since 2016, Hom Nguyen has led a drawing and painting workshop at the psychiatric ward of the hospital of the Pitié-Salpêtrière with adolescent patients in Professor David Cohen's unit. In 2019, working in association with the Monnaie de Paris Museum and vogue magazine, he creates Michele Obama’s iconic portrait. The auction of this work of art by Christie’s is a success. The money raised is used to fund UN Women’s programs for sex equality and women empowerment. This same year, he pays a vibrant tribute to Edit Piaf by giving birth to a monumental portrait currently being displayed in the entrance hall of Tenon Hospital’s Meyneil wing. A gigantic permanent masterpiece also covers the outside wall of the same building, where Edit Piaf was born in 1915. Next, the artist took part in the 250th birthday celebration of Napoleon Bonaparte by creating a contemporary portrait of the emperor for the MUDACC (museum of the art of the citadel in Calvi). During that same time, the artist puts on an exhibition titled Portraits of Legionnaires for the 2nd foreign regiment of paratroopers at the Camp Raffalli in Corsica. This encounter leaves a profound mark on the artist. The French Foreign Legion’s values, its traditions and its attachment to France, which are born from its personal stories, resonate with the artist’s origins. Colonel Christophe Passerat de la Chapelle would later say “Hom Nguyen has this legionnaire soul” In 2020, the artist made a record auction for an amount of €224,000 in favor of the NGO the Children of the Mekong. Thanks to this sale, 750 children will be able to be fed and will receive additional lessons at the center for a year, including drawing lessons. Hom hopes to motivate other artists and enhance a sense of generosity in the art world.  Technique  Hom Nguyen is a self-taught artist whose work is characterized by an instinctive and lively style. He uses many different materials such as oil, acrylic, ink, felt gouache and charcoal. Colors and movement are projected onto the canvas in the same visual manner that is characteristic of Jenny Saville's treatment of the flesh. Hom can also be linked with the figurative art of Lucian Freud, due to his expressive touch and tendency to torture and layer his material. However, Hom Nguyen offers a new pictorial vocabulary that is more emotional than that of Freud. The artist creates most of his works on canvas with a brush, pen, and knife.https://www.leanhduy.fr/en/hom-nguyen-2.  Artwork  The first series Hidden ,\\"Sans Repères\\" and \\"Inner Cry\\" continue to pay tribute to the artist’s mother and the history of immigration. Each one leads the audience to feel the pains and nightmares experienced by these children and illustrate the interpretation of our subconscious dreams: on one hand, the desire to establish a first human interaction necessarily requires eye contact; on the other hand, shouting for help is not necessarily heard. No sound comes out, only the inner cry remains. Hom's work on a series of penciled masks particularly focused on the expression of Asian children without mouth, is the result of a purely mental projection. Working without a human model, Hom Nguyen solely relies on his memory and emotion of the moment to draw the face of the child he used to be : a child born to an immigrant mother, one of the \\"boat people\\". With the following series “lifeline”, “trajectory”, “dark side” and “Roots”, the artist continues with his introspective process, his works echo a resilient memory, passing down a history gone by in a quest for identity. The fleetingness of the artist’s life lines facilitate the emergence of an emotional experience where barriers fade. His works fit in the transition between figurative and abstract art, serving to question the lines between material and intellect, emotion and questioning. The artist’s intent is to open the individual to the possibility of changeability, of an openness toward others. His stroke does not completely outline the model, he does not define it. Hom suggests perspectives, offers temporary limits, draws new trajectories and tends to break the boundaries between the human and the world, between the subject and the object, between sense and sensibility. = Notable works = *Napoléon, MUDDAC, museum of the art of the citadel in Calvi, 2019 *Michelle Obama, Christie's, Auction Sales, 2019 *La vie en rose, tribute to Édith Piaf, Hôpital Tenon, 2019 *Série Trajectoire, mixed medias and multiples sizes, 2017 *Serie Ligne de vie, 300 x 500 cm, mixed medias, 2017 *Serie Inner Cry, mixed medias and multiples sizes, 2016. * Série Sans Repères, mixed medias and multiples sizes, 2015 - 2016. * Hidden (Mizaru / Kikazaru / Iwazaru), 2015. * Grand-Mère, raconte-moi (\\"Grandmother, tell me\\"), Art Paris Art Fair, Grand Palais, Paris, 2015. * Jean-Marc Mormeck, « Le combat du siècle », A2Z Art Gallery, Paris, France, 2015. * Gandhi, Hommage, Paris Match, 2014. * La Vénus à la fourrure, Portrait of Marie Gillain, 2014 * Nelson Mandela, Hommage, 2013. * Angie, série portrait d’enfant, 2013. * Anthony Hopkins, Hôtel Drouot, Auction Sales, 2013.

The South Carolina Petroglyph Site is a county- owned museum at Hagood Mill Historic Site in Pickens County, South Carolina, managed by the non-profit Hagood Mill Foundation. The museum exhibits and protects in situ at least 32 rock art carvings (including 17 human figures), most believed to be prehistoric. The Hagood petroglyphs were discovered on a rainy day in January 2003 by Michael Bramlett, a volunteer with the South Carolina Petroglyph Survey headed by University of South Carolina archaeologist Tommy Charles. Subsequently Charles and his team examined the large, low-lying boulder at night with side-scanning lights and found other glyphs invisible in daylight.

There he discovered additional human representations, all \\"sticklike figures\\" except for one with a head and legs but no arms and with a torso in the form of a rectangle, which the team dubbed \\"refrigerator man.\\" Charles believed these carvings were prehistoric because they had been created by pecking (presumably with stone tools) rather than by scratching or incising with metal.Tommy Charles, Discovering South Carolina's Rock Art (Columbia: University of South Carolina Press, 2010), 27-29. On a dry, sunny day, Charles had examined the rock for petrogylphs without success. Two historic petroglyphs were found at the same site (including the name \\"Thomas\\"), which had not been created by pecking. Charles described the discovery and the figures themselves in a seven-minute YouTube video. Nevertheless, the age and purpose of the rock art (at least beyond motifs \\"universal to human experience, such as representations of animals or humans\\") remains undetermined.Charles, 26. Almost immediately plans were made to exhibit the rock art to encourage tourism; but the museum did not open until 2015 because of political infighting, construction errors,Ron Barnett, \\"12 years after discovery, Pickens Co. petroglyphs will open to public,\\" The State (Columbia SC), August 28, 2015. \\"Unearthing the reason for the repeated delays in opening the center has been nearly as murky as business as discovering who made the enigmatic carvings and when.\\" the firing of a county administrator,Kasie Strickland, \\"Former administrator clear of wrongdoing,\\" Easley Progress, October 1, 2015 stalled fundraising during the Great Recession,Julie Howle, \\"Petroglyphs site at Hagood could become solid draw,\\" Indian Country News, November 26, 2010.

His homosexual-themed cartoons were among the first to appear in US publications, including a regular feature in the early years of The Advocate. He worked under two pen-names: Shawn for more mainstream gay publications such as In Touch, and Sean for fetish publications such as Drummer and Bound & Gagged.  Career  Klamik was born on July 22, 1935 in Chicago, and studied at the Art Institute. He moved to West Hollywood, California in the mid 1960s, where he worked in an art factory producing paintings for hotel rooms, and as Display Director for the Akron stores. His first erotic work was \\"published\\" in 1963, by taking photographs of the illustrations and making prints in home darkrooms. In 1965, he began doing editorial and gag comics for The Advocate, and in the late 1960s did a half-page series under the title \\"Gayer Than Strange\\". In the 1970s he did both softcore and hardcore illustrations for erotic novels and collections of short stories published by Larry Townsend, and his Leatherman’s Handbook. In the mid 1970s he created stand-alone wordless hardcore comics Biff and Biff Bound for San Francisco publisher Le Salon, which featured centerfolds with 10 and 15 men having sex, respectively. During this time he produced eighteen 10-page comics stories for hardcore photo-story magazines published by Nova Studios, which were reprinted in Meatmen. In the 1980s he also did art direction for some of Nova's porn films and videos. In the late 1980s he produced \\"Up the Block\\", a humor comic strip set in a gay neighborhood, for Frontiers. He produced 27 installments of \\"Jake\\", a 4-page series for Jock magazine; over 20 episodes of \\"Dick Darling, Hollywood Cover Boy\\", a 2- or 4-page strip for a twink-themed porn magazine; and 7 episodes of \\"Johnny Guitar\\" for another magazine. At the end of the 1980s, he moved to Phoenix, Arizona, and continued to work with California publishers by mail.

D. Vance about the Appalachian values of his Kentucky family and their relation to the social problems of his hometown of Middletown, Ohio, where his mother's parents moved when they were young. Summary Vance describes his upbringing and family background while growing up in the city of Middletown, Ohio, which is the third largest city in the Cincinnati metropolitan area. He writes about a family history of poverty and low-paying, physical jobs that have since disappeared or worsened in their guarantees, and compares this life with his perspective after leaving that area and life. Though Vance was raised in Middletown, his mother and her family were from Breathitt County, Kentucky. Their Appalachian values include traits like loyalty and love of country despite social issues including violence and verbal abuse. He recounts his grandparents' alcoholism and abuse, and his unstable mother's history of drug addictions and failed relationships. Vance's grandparents eventually reconciled and became his de facto guardians. He was pushed by his tough but loving grandmother, such that Vance was able to leave Middletown and ascend social ladders to attend Ohio State University and Yale Law School. Alongside his personal history, Vance raises questions such as the responsibility of his family and people for their own misfortune. Vance blames hillbilly culture and its supposed encouragement of social rot. Comparatively, he feels that economic insecurity plays a much lesser role. To lend credence to his argument, Vance regularly relies on personal experience. As a grocery store checkout cashier, he watched welfare recipients talk on cell phones although the working Vance could not afford one. His resentment of those who seemed to profit from poor behavior while he struggled, especially combined with his values of personal responsibility and tough love, is presented as a microcosm of the reason for Appalachia's overall political swing from strong Democratic Party to strong Republican affiliations. Likewise, he recounts stories intended to showcase a lack of work ethic including the story of a man who quit after expressing dislike over his job's hours and posted to social media about the \\"Obama economy\\", as well as a co-worker, with a pregnant girlfriend, who would skip work. Publication The book was popularized by an interview with the author published by The American Conservative in late July 2016. The volume of requests briefly disabled the website. Halfway through the next month, The New York Times wrote that the title had remained in the top ten Amazon bestsellers since the interview's publication. Vance credits his Yale contract law professor Amy Chua as the \\"authorial godmother\\" of the book. Reception The book reached the top of The New York Times Best Seller list in August 2016 and January 2017. Many journalists wrote that the book was of specific importance during the 2016 United States presidential election, as Vance describes the white underclass who fueled the campaign of Donald Trump and a resurgence of outsider politics. Other journalists criticized Vance for generalizing too much from his personal upbringing in Ohio. Conservatives expressed admiration for Hillbilly Elegy, particularly The American Conservative contributor and blogger Rod Dreher, who said that Vance \\"draws conclusions…that may be hard for some people to take. But Vance has earned the right to make those judgments. This was his life. He speaks with authority that has been extremely hard won.\\" However, the following month, Dreher posted about why liberals loved the book. New York Post columnist and editor of Commentary John Podhoretz described the book as among the year's most provocative. The book was positively received by conservatives such as National Review columnist Mona Charen and National Review editor and Slate columnist Reihan Salam. By contrast, Jared Yates Sexton of Salon criticized Vance for his \\"damaging rhetoric\\" and for endorsing policies used to \\"gut the poor.\\" He argues that Vance \\"totally discounts the role racism played in the white working class's opposition to President Obama.\\" Sarah Jones of The New Republic mocked Vance as \\"the false prophet of Blue America,\\" dismissing him as \\"a flawed guide to this world\\" and the book as little more than \\"a list of myths about welfare queens repackaged as a primer on the white working class.\\" The New York Times wrote that Vance's direct confrontation of a social taboo is admirable regardless of whether the reader agrees with his conclusions. The newspaper writes that Vance's subject is despair, and his argument is more generous in that it blames fatalism and learned helplessness rather than indolence. Bob Hutton of Jacobin wrote that Vance's argument relied on circular logic, ignored existing scholarship on Appalachian poverty, and was \\"primarily a work of self-congratulation.\\" Sarah Smarsh with The Guardian noted that \\"most downtrodden whites are not conservative male Protestants from Appalachia\\" and called into question Vance's generalizations about the white working-class from his personal upbringing. A 2017 Brookings Institution report noted that Hillbilly Elegy was a \\"raw, emotional portrait of growing up in and eventually out of a poor rural community riddled by drug addiction and instability.\\" Vance's account anecdotally confirmed the report's conclusion that family stability is essential to upward mobility.Eleanor Krause and Richard V. Reeves (2017) Rural Dreams: Upward Mobility in America's Countryside, pp.12–13. Brookings Institution. https://www.brookings.edu/wp- content/uploads/2017/08/es_20170905_ruralmobility.pdf The book provoked a response in the form of an anthology, Appalachian Reckoning: A Region Responds to Hillbilly Elegy, edited by Anthony Harkins and Meredith McCarroll. The essays in the volume criticize Vance for making broad generalizations and reproducing myths about poverty. Film adaptation A film adaptation is being developed for release in 2020. It will be directed by Ron Howard and star Glenn Close, Amy Adams, Gabriel Basso and Haley Bennett with Netflix distributing the film. Although a few days of filming were planned for the book's setting of Middletown, Ohio, much of the filming in the summer of 2019 was in Atlanta, Clayton, Georgia and Macon, Georgia, using the code-name \\"IVAN\\". In June 2020, Netflix set the release date for November 2020.

It is dedicated to the Sacred Heart of Jesus and is located at 57 Babushkin street. In 1892 several thousand Catholics, the workers of the Neva district east of the capital and of Polish origin, most sought permission to build a new church that was finally obtained in autumn 1905. It was then officially dedicated to the Sacred Heart of Jesus. Before the structure was finished the parishioners met in a near Obukhov factory, under the auspices of the parish of St. Catherine. The necessary land was purchased 18 November 1906 and plans for construction were entrusted to the architect Stefan Galenzovski and the first stone was blessed on 8 September 1907, but due to financial difficulties, the main work was completed only in 1912 and worship began in 1914. The church was consecrated in 1917 after the February revolution. A tower could not be built. After the fall of the USSR and the end of an atheistic government, the Catholic Church in Russia, like other Christians were again allowed to operate relatively normally. A parish was formed in 1993, which was assigned a part of the building. The first Mass was celebrated on 6 June 1996. The parish obtained the right to recover the entire building in 2003, but the right to build a tower as it was in the original plans was denied by the municipality in 2009.

In 1872, the Galveston Daily News referenced White's work on the Grover House, saying that “it looks to-day almost as good as new.

The house sits on a property covering over three lots between 15th and 16th streets on the north side of Market street inside Galveston's East End Historic District. The brick structure of the house is covered with beige stucco scored to give the visual impression of cut stone. The existing hipped roof was added to the building in 1943. The original roof had a cupola, which was accessible via steps in the house's third story.“War, Storms, Fire Fail to Destroy Island Home.” Houston Post; November 10, 1966. A 1943 hurricane destroyed two stories on the north (rear) side of the house. The three-bay south façade has a double gallery, which is not original to the house. The gallery was altered or expanded three times during the twentieth century.Sanborn Fire Insurance Map, 1889. Dolph Briscoe Center. University of Texas, Austin, Texas; Sanborn Fire Insurance Map, 1899. Dolph Briscoe Center. University of Texas, Austin, Texas. In the current configuration, the galleries are accessible from the interior of both stories via doors on the western ends of the south facade. The first-story door, with an architrave featuring colored glass, pilasters, sidelights, and a transom, serves as the house's primary entrance. The lintels of the windows on the south facade have stucco scored to simulate heavy keystones. The sills, original to the house, are made of white Vermont marble.“War, Storms, Fire Fail to Destroy Island Home.” Houston Post; November 10, 1966.

Grover's Life in Galveston After its construction, the Grover House “became a social center,” according to Walter Grover, who later recalled that “many gay parties were held there, and, according to the custom of the time, friends and relatives visited there from distant places and enjoyed their hospitality.”Claitor, J.D, “Walter E. Grover – ‘Mr. Galveston’,” 1951. =The Battle of Galveston= The firm of Grover and Andrews operated from the Strand until 1861, when the firm dissolved upon the outset of the Civil War.“Wright S. Andrews.” The Galveston Daily News; Saturday, March 26, 1906. In that year, Grover was elected city alderman. He went on to serve as Galveston Mayor pro tem during the war after other members of the city government retreated to Virginia Point. When the Union Army took control of the city, Grover met their officers.Personal statement by Walter E. Grover, November 30, 1949. After the deaths of Union leaders Captain Jonathan Mayhew Wainwright and Lieutenant Commander Edward Lea during the Battle of Galveston on January 1, 1863, Grover offered his own family's plot in the Episcopal section of Galveston's Broadway Cemetery for their burial.Cotham, Edward T., Jr. Battle of Galveston: The Civil War Struggle for Galveston. Austin: University of Texas Press, 1998, p. 138; Personal statement by Walter E. Grover, November 30, 1949. Following the war, Grover's respectful treatment of Union soldiers was a subject of controversy in Galveston. Newspaper accounts of his election reveal a lingering debate over his actions as late as 1869.“Local Intelligence.” Flake’s Galveston Bulletin; Saturday, May 15, 1869. =Late career= By 1870, Grover had launched his own grocery company at the old Grover and Andrews location at 22nd Street and Strand.“Galveston City Directory, 1870.” An advertisement in the 1872 Galveston City Directory lists the firm as retail dealers in “family supplies, produce and boat stores.”“Galveston City Directory, 1872.” The company was out of business by 1874. Between 1874 and 1881, Grover was an employee of Rice and Baulard, sellers of paints and oils from a store at 213-217 23rd Street.“Galveston City Directory, 1874;\\" “Galveston City Directory, 1876-77;\\" “Galveston City Directory, 1878-1879;\\" “Galveston City Directory, 1880-1881.” Grover was an artist himself and two of his works survive as important portrayals of mid-nineteenth-century Galveston. The first depicts the capture of the U.S.R.C Harriet Lane during the Battle of Galveston. The second famous painting, “Galveston as Seen from the Main Top of Ship at Central Wharf – October, 1855”, was given to the Rosenberg Library by the Galveston Historical Foundation and restored in 1968.“Two Historic Waterfront Paintings Restored.,” The Galveston Daily News; August 18, 1968. In his later years, Grover remained active recounting his early exploits in the Battle of Plum Creek, the Santa Fe Expedition, the Gold Rush, and the Battle of Galveston.“In the Indian Times,” The Galveston Daily News; March 18, 1895. He died on December 21, 1901, after a fall.“G.W. Grover Dead.” The Galveston Daily News; December 22, 1901. His wife, Eliza died in 1913 as one of the oldest citizens in Galveston.“Mrs. E.A. Grover,” The Galveston Daily News; May 21, 1913. The Grover House in 2016 Preservation Efforts Thanks to relatively stable ownership and the preservation projects, the Grover House retains a remarkable amount of its original integrity. A substantial rehabilitation project during the 1990s included restoration of some distinctive features of the house, including its scored stucco. Some mid- century alterations, including changes to the east elevation of the house, were replaced with features from the house's original design. The house incurred flood damage during Hurricane Ike of 2008. An oak tree in the front yard, which had withstood the devastating 1900 Galveston Hurricane, did not survive. All of the damage from Hurricane Ike has been repaired and the historic masonry is subject to ongoing observation. The house listed on the National Register of Historic Places as a contributing member of the East End Historic District.

Compared to the rest of the world, the history of wine in Tanzania is very recent and dates back to just a few years before independence. Tanzania only has one major grape growing region and it is centered around the capital city Dodoma. The most common grape varietals in the region are Chenin Blanc, Syrah, Cabernet Sauvignon and a local variety named for a Dodoma sub-region, Makutupora. Initially wine production and grape growing was limited to missionaries, however, in 1969 the government entered the market with the formation of the Dodoma Wine company.  History  = Early history = Vines were first introduced in the country by members of the Roman Catholic Congregation of the Holy Ghost in 1938. The missionaries from the Hombolo Catholic mission planted their first vines near the Kondoa District in Dodoma. Initially the vines grown were used for domestically making wine for religious practises and domestic consumption. In 1957 Passionist Father Irioneo Maggioni, of the Bihawana Mission started his own commercial farm from three vine seedlings out of curiosity and the farm grew rapidly to a commercial scale. After independence the local government took interest in the industry and made their first investment into a four-acre grape farm at Dodoma Isanga Prison 1961. The program was very successful and in just three years expanded to 5 of the nearby villages centered around the prison. In 1963, the national service camp in Makutupora also joined the scheme and began growing grapes in the village that created a new center for grape growing around the village. In 1969 the prison built a winery plant and was Tanzania's sole purchaser of grapes for wine production in the country. In 1979, in a plan to add value for the local farmers the central government invested in a new company and created the Dodoma Wine Company, which directly procured grapes from the farmers for wine production. The company assisted farmers in grape growing practises and set up a research center called the Makutupora Grapevine Research Centre. = International investment = International investors mainly from South Africa began to take interest in the industry in the early 1990s. In 1999 South Africa's Distell Group Limited acquired a stake in the local Tanzania Breweries Limited subsidiary Tanzania Distilleries Limited (TDL). TDL acquired the Dodoma Wine Company and bought the brand of the government. The company brought in investment and skill to the farmers to help manage their farms at a low cost. The company currently holds the highest market share of wine in country with their flag ship brand \\"Dodoma Wine\\". As the company continued to invest in the production capacity, the company also began importing South African wine into the country to help develop the market. Simultaneously, in 2002 an Italian engineer started the Central Tanzania Wine company, which today is part of the top three company producing wine in the country. Between 1998 and 2013, wine exports in the country skyrocketed and grew by 900 times. In 1998 the country exported 176 kg worth of wine and in 2013 exported 151,221 kg.  Makutupora  Makutupora is a local grape varietal named after a district in the Dodoma Region where it is grown. The Makutupora is a local dry red grape that grows in dry earth, sandy soil with low humidity. There are two harvests seasons a year, in March and August/September.

Early and personal life  She was born Wendy Felicité Storey in Bowness-on-Windermere, Cumbria in 1915. She was educated at home by a governess until she was 14; she painted from the age of six. She was not permitted to attend art school, but studied privately under the animal painters Cecil Aldin and Arminell Morshead. During the second world war she worked as a VAD (Voluntary Aid Detachment) field nurse. During that time she met her future husband, and in 1941 she married John Mainwaring Walsh, then a Major, ultimately a Lieutenant Colonel in the British Army. His mother was from Edgeworthstown in County Longford. After following her husband around the world on various military postings, including in Japan (where she studied Chinese ink techniques) and Washington DC, she moved in 1958, with her husband and three children (daughters Lesley and Anna and son Michael), to Lusk, Ireland, as John Walsh had retired from the British Army to become Agent of Trinity College Dublin. They lived there for 41 years. In 1999 she and her husband retired to a house in Kildare next to Lesley Fennell, at Burtown House near Athy. There is now a permanent exhibition of some of her work at that house. After the death of her husband in 2007, she divided her time between her three children and died at Abergavenny, Wales in 2014, a few weeks short of her 99th birthday. Botanical illustration  In the 1930s Walsh painted mostly dog portraits for customers, and horses for herself. She remained an amateur painter until the mid-1970s, when, following a visit to the Gilbert Islands, she was commissioned to design floral stamps, starting her career as a professional artist at the age of 60. The Gilbert Islands stamps led to a series of commissions for Irish stamps, on the theme of Irish flora and fauna, and then to a series of books. In 1980 she was the recipient of her first RHS medal. She continued to win awards through the 80s and 90s. She was awarded a doctorate from Trinity College, Dublin in 1997. In 1983, her best known book, The Irish Florilegium – Wild and Garden Plants of Ireland, was published. It was awarded a bronze medal for the 'Most beautiful Book in the World' at the Leipzig Book Fair. She received many awards including the Alpine Society Gold Award in 1991 and 1993. Walsh produced the art for 15 books on Ireland's flora and fauna, working with the Irish taxonomist Charles Nelson who wrote the accompanying text for most of her books.

It is at 11 Lenin Avenue, the main street in that city. History Catholics in Petrozavodsk long fought for the right to build a church in the city. Several petitions were filed in 1862, and declined until 1897, when the number of Catholics in Petrozavodsk arrived in this period of about 150 people. The construction of a small stone church began in 1898 and was suspended due to financial problems. The final building in the shape of a medieval basilica, was completed in 1904 and was consecrated the same year as the chapel. The pipe organ was built in 1906. In 1910, the building was dedicated to Virgin Mary. The church was closed in 1927 and its assets seized by the Bolsheviks. Between 1930 and 1961 it was occupied by several agencies, an aviators' club, a house of culture, and finally by the Union of Soviet Composers. After the collapse of the Soviet Union the church was authorized again, for a time the church shared the space together with the Union of Composers and was only given to the Catholic community from 2003. On September 4, 2005, a century after its first consecration, the church was reconsecrated by Archbishop Tadeusz Kondrusiewicz. Masses are held in Russian and Polish.

Controcorrente: il cinema milanese di Eriprando Visconti, Cesare Canevari, Alberto Cavallone. Nocturno Dossier (19). pp. 8, 24. Plot Friuli, autumn of 1917. The dwarf Marcello Giammarco, the only son of a wealthy lawyer, is held by his father confined in a majestic country villa near Palmanova. The villa is located in the Italian rear of the front and has been partially converted into a military hospital. In this unreal atmosphere, between servants and dying, which precedes the defeat of Caporetto, the courteous and dignified Marcello tries to lead a normal existence, pursuing the sentimental dream of bonding with Maria, a prostitute of the local brothel. The death of his father, accidentally hit by an artillery shell during the capture of Palmanova, invests Marcello with responsibility for the great family heritage, while his villa, where he continues to live, becomes the seat of an Austrian rear command. Even the brothel changes customs and customers: now all Austrian soldiers. In those moments of extreme social and moral uncertainty, Marcello's rich patrimony becomes a possible target and a hope of revenge for some neglected, maneuvered by a shrewd profiteer, from whom the war seems to have taken away any future and any ethical sense.

She began in a freelance capacity and sold sketches to scarf brands Richard Allan and Jacquar. Collier joined Liberty in 1961, and specialised in floral prints dresses. She was helped by her sister Sarah Campbell starting in 1968, and co-founded the independent Collier Campbell studio. Early life Collier was born on 12 October 1938 in Manchester. She was the daughter of actress Patience Collier and campaigning pharmacologist Harry Collier. She had two siblings; a sister Sarah and a brother Joe. Collier had the importance of hard work and creative thought instilled in her from an early age. Both parents painted pictures of flowers which excited Collier, and they brought her drawer-lining paper and powder paints to practise her skill. She was taken on walks by her father which garnered an interest in nature, and taught her to concentrate on butterflies wings. Collier left school with three O Level qualifications at the age of 15 and attended catering college. She moved to London when she was 18. Career She started her career as a freelance textile designer in a self-made studio in a spare bedroom in her South London home. She was attracted to the area because of its cultural diversity and class mixture. Collier sold sketches of her work to the scarf brands Richard Allan and Jacqmar. She grew frustrated at another person was using her work under her name, and went to London Prints company Liberty. Collier decided that continue her career, the company would have to purchase two of her designs. They elected to purchase six in 1961 and commissioned further designs. She firstly worked for the Tana Lawn cotton range and specialised in floral prints dresses, and supplied Liberty scarves with designs. Collier began being assisted by her younger sister Sarah Campbell in 1968. That same year she was retained by Liberty. Collier was appointed as Liberty's design and colour consultant on its London Prints’ fabrics and products in 1971, and had responsibility for its apparel, decorative fabrics and accessory ranges. Collier eventually succeeded Bernard Nevill as design director. Collier became determined to supply wholesale quantities required for couturiers ready-to- wear collection, and do a similar action for furnishings. She and Campbell founded the independent Collier Campbell studio. Collier worked on the design for the first off-the-peg collection by Yves Saint Laurent, along with Bill Gibb, Cacharel, and Daniel Hechter Paris. The company established relationships with several shopping firms. She left Liberty in 1977 which allowed her to retain copyright of her work. Her value was that good designs should be made available to every person. They were commissioned by Habitat to design their textile lifestyle look in 1974, and was the company's major textile converter by 1980. Collier Campbell won the Duke of Edinburgh's designer prize in 1984 for a decorative fabric collection called \\"six views\\", and four years later, they were commissioned by Conran to design the carpets Gatwick Airport's North Terminal. Personal life and death She was twice married: firstly to pharmacologist Andrew Herxheimer in 1961 with whom she had two children, Charlotte and Sophie Herxheimer, and to broadcaster Frank Delany. Both marriages ended in divorce. Collier died in London on 18 May 2011 from cancer.

At different times in his career, he lectured at Columbia University, the University of Chicago, and the University of California at Los Angeles. His 1962 La Religion de l’Iran Ancien is still considered a masterpiece and the best scholarly introduction to Zoroastrianism despite the decades of subsequent developments in the scholarship of the religion.

History  Initially it was a small chapel built in the 17th century; in 1619 they put an image that Pietro Maria Rocca, a scholar from Alcamo, thought it was the triptych realized in 1462 on a board, and moved to the National Museum of Palermo in 1865.Carlo Cataldo, Guida storico- artistica dei beni culturali di Alcamo-Calatafimi-Castellammare del Golfo p.83-84, Alcamo, Sarograf, 1982. The chapel was enlarged between the years 1626 and 1636, after an event happened on 21 June 1625: miraculously in front of it, the cart carrying the plague victims to the cemetery of Saint Ippolito broke irremediably, the sign that plague had finished.  Description and works  Statue of Our Lady of Graces (1925) The façade was carved by Domenico Marchese in 1627. The church was then restored in 1898, and in 1914 it was frescoed by Liborio Mirabile, a painter from Alcamo. A sculptor from Palermo, Paolo La Licata, realized the white marble high altar and the floor with polychrome marbles, after the design created in 1914 by Francesco Alesi, a priest and painter from Alcamo. The Church is with one nave and three altars: *High altar: statue of Our Lady of Graces (1925), realized by the firm Malecore from Lecce Salvatore Messina, Alcamo nella storia, nella leggenda e nell'arte p.141, Alcamo, ed. Campo, 2015. *Right altar: statue of Saint Joseph. *Left altar: statue of Saint Lucy. On the south side, on the external wall of the church, there is a wayside shrine with a statue of the Virgin and Child, called Madonna del buon viaggio an Ebron (that is Madonna of the Good Trip to Ebron). In June 2015 it was subject of an act of sacrilege, in fact they broke an arm of the child Jesus and took it away. Every year on 2 July, after a triduum of liturgical preparation, they carry the simulacrum of the Madonna in procession as far as the Salesian Oratory in the Church of the Holy Souls, where the end of the festivity takes place. In 1929 they founded the male Congregation of Mary Most Holy of Graces, which had the scope of solemnizing her feast and the Forty Hours Devotion. It has not been existing for years.

She specializes in remote sensing technology, and her research focuses on the use of Synthetic Aperture Radar satellites (SARs) to monitor the condition of crops and soils. Biography McNairn received a Bachelor of Environmental Studies from the University of Waterloo, in 1987, a Masters in Soil Science from the University of Guelph, in 1991, and a Ph.D. in Geography from Université Laval in 1999. Career McNairn is also an adjunct professor at Carleton University and the University of Manitoba. She has more than 25 years of experience researching methods to monitor crops and soil using multi-spectral, hyperspectral and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) sensors. Throughout her career, she has led numerous national and international research teams and has written over 60 peer-reviewed scientific papers. McNairn has developed new methods to derive land and soil information, such as land cover, crop residue, tillage, soil moisture, and crop bio-physical characteristics, from Synthetic Aperture Radar satellites. She also specializes in developing pre-processing image analysis approaches using multispectral and hyperspectral sensors. Dr. McNairn led a 3-year research project which developed the methodology to integrate radar and optical satellite data to classify crop types. This method is now used operationally by AAFC to produce a national map of crops, each year. Her current projects include developing innovative approaches to estimate soil moisture, Leaf Area Index and biomass from SAR sensors. These methods provide temporal and spatial information on soils and crops for use in applications such as flood and drought forecasting, and on farm decision making. Her research team also worked with industry and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA) to develop a new user-friendly application called the Soil Moisture Toolkit. This Toolkit ingests data from satellites such as the Canadian RADARSAT-2 satellite and generates maps of surface soil moisture. The Toolkit is freely available and is used by remote sensing practitioners around the world. McNairn collaborates with NASA and the Canadian Space Agency, as well as many Canadian and international research institutions. Dr. McNairn led a Canada-U.S. research effort in 2012 which gathered soil moisture and crop biomass data to assist NASA in calibrating and validating their Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite – a system that provides global maps of soil moisture. This 2012 experiment involved 75 researchers from Canadian and U.S. universities, Environment Canada, the Province of Manitoba, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and NASA. The success of the 2012 campaign led to a request by NASA’s SMAP team to repeat this experiment in 2016. This 2016 data is helping NASA refine soil moisture maps over global sites of annually cropped land. McNairn is currently collaborating with researchers in The Netherlands, Italy, India and Chile to develop SAR methods to support information requirements for the agriculture sector. In 2016 she was awarded an OECD fellowship and worked for three months in Chile to assist the Instituto de Investigaciones Agropecuraris (INIA) to develop remote sensing tools for use in variable rate irrigation. McNairn is using data from the RADARSAT Constellation Mission launched in June 2019 to refine her methods to determine crop type, crop health and soil moisture from remote sensing. Honours and awards * 2012 Queen’s Diamond Jubilee medal for her scientific contributions * 2016 OECD Fellowship from the Co-operative Research Program Interests McNairn has a second degree black belt in Karate, and for many years competed in point sparring. In 2009 she won a bronze medal in sparring at the World Karate and Kickboxing Council World Championships in Dublin, Ireland. She has since retired, and is now a certified fitness instructor teaching fitness classes at AAFC, and for the City of Ottawa.

To maximize the number of casualties, the explosion took place on Ashura, one of the holiest days for Shia muslims, when hundreds of pilgrims had gathered to commemorate the death of their third Imam, Husayn ibn Ali. The attack left at least 25 dead and at least 70 injured. The bomb was equivalent to 10 pounds of TNT, according to experts. Although a Sunni group claimed responsibility, the Iranian government laid the blame on the People's Mujahedin of Iran, and others have accused a Pakistani militant. Bombing On 20 June, the shrine was crowded with self-flagellating mourners, celebrating Ashura and commemorating the death of Husayn ibn Ali. At 14:26, a bomb exploded in a crowded prayer hall in the women's section of the shrine. The Independent described it as \\"the first attack on such a holy place\\" or \\"the worst terrorist atrocity in Iran since 1981\\". In protest, people gathered outside the mosque and hospitals. Damage included the destruction of one wall and the prayer hall's dome, and the breaking of crystal chandeliers. Suspects The Iranian government blamed the Iraqi-backed People's Mujahedin of Iran (MEK). According to IRNA, the official Iranian news agency, a caller claimed responsibility for the event in the name of MEK. However, MEK condemned the attack. Ramzi Yousef, a member of al-Qaeda who was responsible for several terrorist attacks worldwide, was also accused of being responsible, supposedly having been hired by MEK. According to an anonymous US official, Yousef built the bomb and MEK agents placed it in the shrine. According to the analysts, he was suspected of having connections with MEK because of his Iraqi background. However, Raymond Tanter, a member of the United States National Security Council under President Ronald Reagan, believes that MEK was not involved, and that a Pakistani militant connected to Yousef was the perpetrator. News, A Pakistani daily newspaper, identified that person to be Abdul Shakoor, a young religious radical living in Lyari in Karachi. A month after the attack, a Sunni group calling itself Al-Haraka al-Islamiya al-Iraniya claimed responsibility for the attack. Despite this, the Iranian government continued to hold the MEK responsible. According to the National Council of Resistance of Iran, in a trial in November 1999, Interior Minister Abdollah Nouri claimed it was a false flag attack by the Iranian regime to blame MEK. Aftermath Strict security measures were applied after this attack, and visitors are now searched before entering the shrine. The event caused further political unrest in Iran.

His books were destined for young readers and Fantômette featured a female superhero for the first time in French literature. He is also the author of Les 4 As, a series created in 1957. He also released Le Petit Lion children's book series. Career Chaulet's father was an engineer, and his mother a shopkeeper. The family settled in 1936 in Antony (Hauts-de-Seine), France. After his baccalaureate, Georges Chaulet continued studying architecture at École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts. From 1952 to 1954, he served in the French Army in Germany. Then he returned to Antony, where he worked in the family coffee business with his parents, at the same time starting to write as an author. He would stay in Antony most of the time. In 1957, Georges Chaulet proposed his first series, Les 4 As, to Hachette, one of France biggest publishers. But Hachette refused to publish it, having just bought the rights to all of Enid Blyton's novels, most notably The Famous Five. Eventually Casterman, another major French publisher, published Chaulet's work. There were six books in the series, followed by 43 volumes as a comics series narrated by Chaulet and drawn by François Craenhals. The series was the basis of the Belgian illustrated novel Les 4 As au collège by Chaulet and Craenhals, first published in 1962. The novel was published by Casterman in the Relais series. Strengthened by the success of Les 4 As, George Chaulet then proposed a new series titled Fantômette to Hachette, and this time the publishing house accepted. Forty-nine volumes of Fantômette were published from 1961 to 1987 in the Bibliothèque rose series. The Fantomette books were aimed at eight- to twelve-year-old girls. There are 52 books in the series. It also resulted in a comic book series by François Craenhals, and a 1993 live-action TV series starring Katia Sourzac and a cartoon series in 1998. In 2006, to celebrate the 150 years of the \\"Bibliothèque rose\\", and after an eighteen-year absence, Georges Chaulet wrote a new adventure of his favorite heroïne titled Le Retour de Fantômette. Chaulet also authored Le Petit Lion, a series of 13 children books inspired by the TV series of the same title. The books were published between 1968 and 1979 on Hachette in the collection series Bibliothèque rose. Chaulet died on 13 October 2012, having written more than one hundred and fifty books for youth in the course of his career.

These murders took place in the aftermath of World War II. In January and February 1946, units of the PAS Special Forces (Pogotowie Akcji Specjalnej) from the National Military Union (Narodowe Zjednoczenie Wojskowe) burned down the villages of Zaleszany, Wólka Wygonowska, Zanie, Szpaki, and Końcowizna. They also executed 30 coachmen on 30 January 1945 near Puchały Stare, and a similar number of armed resistors in Zanie on 2 February 1946. Since 1995, this mass killing of civilians was the subject of official investigation by the government- affiliated Institute of National Remembrance. The inquiry resulted in the publication of a final report in June 2005, summarizing this case. The Commission interviewed a total of 169 persons, and analysed all documents and testimonies dating back to the 1949 show trial of Polish cursed soldiers: Captain Romuald Rajs of the PAS Special Forces, and his co-conspirator and deputy, Lieutenant Kazimierz Chmielowski from NZW. Among the individuals questioned by IPN were families of victims, as well as former soldiers of the 3rd Brigade of NZW responsible for the deaths of 79 Polish nationals of Belarusian ethnicity from several villages in Bielsk County. The IPN closed its official investigation without additional charges filed. Sentences from the Stalinist period had already been carried out. In addition, there had been extrajudicial killings of partisans by governmental authorities during the Polish anti-Communist insurrection. No living perpetrators of the atrocities committed in early 1946 have been identified. These postwar atrocities have continued to receive considerable press coverage by the media. Background During the Soviet advance across occupied Poland, in November 1944 the Home Army split up when faced with the prospect of fighting two wartime enemies, Germany and the USSR. As a result, the National Military Union (Narodowe Zjednoczenie Wojskowe) was formed. The Home Army was disbanded entirely by the order of Gen. Leopold Okulicki on 18 January 1945, due to the Soviet takeover of Poland. Thousands of partisans and underground soldiers were arrested by the NKVD and sent to the Soviet Gulag. Okulicki was murdered in Moscow. The annexation of eastern half of the Second Polish Republic by Joseph Stalin was ratified by the new communist authorities in postwar Poland on 16 August 1945, See also: which was followed by mass expulsions of Poles and Belarusians across the new borders. Major Zygmunt Szendzielarz (centre) with soldiers of the 5th Wilno Brigade of Armia Krajowa, 1945 Mayor Zygmunt Szendzielarz refused to surrender; and recreated the already disassembled Polish 5th Wilno Brigade of Armia Krajowa in order to oppose the Soviet occupation of Podlachia (Podlasie) and the Białystok region. Equipped with machine guns and machine pistols, his brigade fought a successful battle with the advancing Red Army and the pro-Soviet Polish People's Army around Miodusy-Dworaki village in Siemiatycze County on 18 August 1945. The brigade was joined by Captain Romuald Rajs (codename \\"Bury\\") with 29 soldiers of the State Forest Defence Battalion in September 1945. But, faced with the overwhelming concentration of the enemy forces, Major Szendzielarz ordered the dissolution of the 5th Brigade in the same month. See also: Captain Rajs (\\"Bury\\") was active in the area of Wilno during the German occupation of Poland. Since 1943, he led the 1st Company of the 3rd Wilno Brigade of Armia Krajowa with the rank of Second Lieutenant. After the dissolution of the 5th Brigade, Rajs made contact with Commandant of the National Military Union Okręg III Białystok, Major Jan Szklarek, and moved his LWP platoon under his command. He was promoted to the rank of Captain and became leader of the PAS Special Forces (Pogotowie Akcji Specjalnej) within NZW Białystok. The process of unification of smaller underground units in the area of Wysokie Mazowieckie County, commanded by Kazimierz Chmielowski (\\"Rekin\\"; meaning \\"Shark\\", in Polish) until December 1945, resulted in the gathering of the largest anti-Soviet partisan group in the region. Assaults of January and February 1946 Captain Romuald Rajs By the end of 1945, the NZW III Białystok consolidated most of the local anti- communist underground by absorbing into its own command scattered units of NSZ and NOW. Many former members of resistance left the forest to begin a new life, although for some the return to civilian life was not possible. Both MO and the NKVD had compiled hit lists of anti-communist conspirators from local sources. By early 1946, the NZW was the only underground organization still capable of active resistance. Their assaults included destruction of MO outposts and Communist Party bureaus, ambushes on special units of UBP, KBW, WP and NKWD; as well as various retaliatory actions. A few local towns were taken over by PAS NZW temporarily. Some police stations were destroyed repeatedly. In early January 1946, NZW headquarters called a meeting of local commanders. Rajs was given leadership of partisans enrolled by Chmielowski (\\"Rekin\\"). His unit, consisting of 228 soldiers, was renamed as the 3rd Wilno Brigade of the NZW PAS. A decision was made to move the entire force to an area around Bielsk Podlaski for further military training. =Actions in Łozice and Hajnówka= On 27 January 1946 the battalion entered Łozice village and approached a gathering of horse-drawn vehicles organized by the local authorities in need of conscripted labour. The partisans requisitioned around 40 carriages and ordered their drivers to go along. Some coachmen mistakenly believed that the uniformed soldiers have belonged to the communist forces. The battalion boarded the carriages and in the same evening rode to the County of Hajnówka. Rajs ordered the attack on Hajnówka where the Polish communist militia as well as some Red Army soldiers returning to the USSR, were stationing. The takeover of Hajnówka was unsuccessful. The farmers with horse- drawn carriages remained with the battalion throughout January as means of transportation even though several failed attempts were made by PAS NZW to replace them with new carriers. Contrary to opinions disseminated by politicized media in today's Belarus, the single criterion used by PAS NZW in the selection of carriages was their durability and strength; it was not the alleged faith of the actual coachmen, nor their purported Belarusian roots, as revealed by research conducted by the Polish Institute of National Remembrance. The coachmen came to Łozice from about a dozen neighbouring villages because they were ordered to do so by the communist authorities attempting to transport nationalized wood to Orla village. Meanwhile, the relocation of the NZW battalion was planned well ahead. =Pacification of Zaleszczany and Wólka Wygonowska= On 29 January 1946 the battalion arrived in Zaleszany, Hajnówka County, to feed the horses. During a routine document check by the partisans, a Red Army soldier and NKVD informer, Aleksander Zielinko was identified, serving as Communist Party secretary in nearby Suchowolce. All inhabitants were ordered to report to a big house of Dymitr Sacharczuk where they were taken hostage. They were questioned on the whereabouts of suspected collaborator, and Sołtys of Zaleszany, Łukasz Demianiuk who vanished. His 16-year-old son Piotr (already a PPR member) was identified and executed together with Zielinko. Not a single hostage was killed from the gathering at Sacharczuk's house. According to official report released in 2005 by the Institute of National Remembrance, all hostages kept in Sacharczuk's house run out to safety and survived; they were not persecuted, but the PAS NZW set a number of buildings on fire, and 16 people died in Zaleszany while attempting to hide from the soldiers. The final IPN investigation revealed that the later description of what happened there was falsified by the Stalinist functionaries. Memorial plaque in Wólka Wygonowska The unit led by Rajs (\\"Bury\\") departed for the neighbouring village of Wólka Wygonowska. Some farm buildings were set ablaze for refusal to provide assistance. Two local men were shot dead while they were running away from the soldiers: Jan Zinkiewicz and Stefan Babulewicz. Many year later, Zinkiewicz's daughter rationalized that her father ran to save his farm equipment from burning, and that he was not fleeing from them. =Massacre in Puchały Stare= On the following day of 30 January 1945 the command of NZW PAS Brigade arrived in Krasna Wieś village where they arranged the exchange of horse-drawn carriers. Eye-witness Włodzimierz K. from Jagodniki later testified that they arrived in Krasna Wieś ahead of others. Most of the partisan group fell behind. The new coachmen were ordered to wait for them but instead, took their horse-drawn carriages and run away. They were chased through the forest by the platoon led by \\"Modrzew\\", caught around Puchały Stare village, arrested, taken away in two groups, and executed as traitors. Years later, the exhumations conducted by the authorities in Puchały on 27 April 1951 revealed that 27 farmers have been killed there and buried in two shallow graves. In 1997 the number was raised to 30.Romuald Rajs \\"Bury\\". Żołnierz wyklęty i morderca - Andrzej Zdanowicz, Gazeta Współczesna, 12/03/2011 The subsequent 2005 investigation by IPN revealed – based on new evidence – that purported eye-witness of the massacre, Prokop Iwacik, lied in his postwar testimonies, because he could not have possibly been there. Officer \\"Modrzew\\" (\\"Larch\\" in English) was killed on 16 February 1946; and his true identity remains unknown. =Assault on Szpaki–Zanie= At the end of January 1946 the soldiers of the 3rd Brigade came to Zanie, Podlaskie Voivodeship, to requisition food. One of the partisans, Kazimierz Borkowski, was struck with an axe to the head by a farmer who refused to give in. Rajs, who had already received information in Hajnówka, that ethnic Belarusians who lived in Szpaki–Zanie served as Volksdeutsche under Nazi Germany, gave an order for the pacification of the two villages. During his postwar interrogations Rajs informed that the actual order of burning down Zanie, Szpaki and Końcowizna in retaliation for hostile attitude towards NZW, came from his superior Florian Lewicki nom de guerre \\"Lis\\" (\\"Kotwicz\\"), regional commandant of NZW (real name, Jan Szklarek). The NZW PAS unit consisting of three platoons of about 30 men led by \\"Rekin\\" (Chmielowski), \\"Wiarus\\", and \\"Bitny\\" (J. Boguszewski), was sent to Szpaki–Zanie on 2 February 1946. Rajs was not present. He went with his command to Końcowizna village, where no-one was killed. According to postwar interrogation of Kazimierz Chmielowski (\\"Rekin\\"), the NZW troops were fired upon by the locals in Zanie. Later report by the Special Commission from Bielsk Podlaski confirmed that a submachine gun with ammunition was found in one of the burned out buildings. A dozen farmhouses were set on fire and 36 men singled out for collaboration with the enemy were executed by the platoon led by \\"Rekin\\". The names of the men to be shot have been secretly obtained by the Armia Krajowa Obywatelska from Bielsk County. Subsequently, both \\"Wiarus\\" and \\"Bitny\\" (along with \\"Modrzew\\") were killed in action on 12 February 1946 in Gmina Ełk. Chmielowski (\\"Rekin\\") is said to have attacked other villages in gmina Kleszczele as well, where some farmhouses where burned. According to Rajs, Chmielowski did it on his own accord, although Chmielowski himself insisted during questioning by the communist interrogators that bullets were fired up into the air. Notably, as many as five alleged pacification actions by \\"Rekin\\" were fabricated by the UB interrogators, since the village of Mostek never existed in the Bielsk County as revealed by the IPN investigation. Trial On 17 November 1948, Romuald Rajs was captured in Karpacz by Urząd Bezpieczeństwa while on vacation. A month later, his co-conspirator Chmielowski was arrested on 13 December 1948. They were tried in a show trial held at the Białystok movie theatre \\"Ton\\", and charged with membership in AK and NZW aiming to overthrow the communist government of Poland, coupled with armed assaults on the Polish Army and the Red Army, the assassination of MO functionaries, attacks on the UB security outposts, the railway guard, as well as assassination of civilians during forced requisitions of property, and possession of assault weapons. Individually, Romuald Rajs was also charged with desertion from the Polish Army. They were executed on 30 December 1949 without material evidence of alleged civilian atrocities, which were obtained by the communist authorities well over a year later, in the spring of 1951. Rajs denied his guilt of the massacres. He was executed on 30 December 1949 in the Białystok prison at the age of 36 along with Lieutenant Kazimierz Chmielowski. Commemoration Memorial and tomb of the murdered coachmen in Bielsk-Podlaski In 1970, a memorial plate was installed in Zanie to commemorate the victims of the massacre. The burial place of most of the victims were not confirmed until the 1951 exhumations. Three more bodies were identified by the IPN pathologists in 1997. After the fall of communism, a Committee of the murdered coachmen family members was created, the victims' remains were reburied in Bielsk Podlaski. Official commemoration ceremonies are being held at anniversaries of the tragedy in Zaleszczany and Bielsk Podlaski. Leaders of the Belarusian minority in Poland view the 1946 massacre as an important traumatic event in post-war history. According to Oleg Latyszonek, a Polish historian of Belarusian ancestry, the massacre led to the Belarusian minority growing more loyal to the Polish communist regime of that time. Some journalists have commented that Polish nationalists attempt to rehabilitate Romuald Rajs as a part of promotion of supression and continuous abuse of Human Rights by the right-wing governments of Kaczynski brothers. In 1995, the Military Court of Warsaw nullified the 1948 death penalty given to Rajs. His family received a compensation from the Polish state. On February 2, 2012, on the anniversary of the 1946 massacre, the Polish Sejm has introduced a Day of Commemoration of the Cursed soldiers on 1 March. The families of the victims of the massacre have not received any compensations. A thriller by Polish novelist, Katarzyna Bonda (pl) – who has Belarusian roots – titled Okularnik (Glasses-Wearer), part of her detective series about a fictional profiler Sasza Załuska in today's Poland, is inspired by the 1946 Massacres of villages in Podlachia. The book received considerable coverage by the media in Belarus without being translated into Belarusian. In 2012, the Monument to Orthodox inhabitants of Białystok who were killed and went missing in the years 1939–1956 was erected in Białystok to commemorate Orthodox Christians of the Białystok region who perished during the anticommunist insurrection in 1946. In 2020, all victims of the massacres were canonised by the Polish Autocephalous Orthodox Church in a ceremony in Zaleszany, at a monastery whose hegumenia came from a family of survivors. The Divine Liturgy was attended by Archbishops Abel (Popławski), Grzegorz (Charkiewicz) and Bishop Paweł (Tokajuk).

Also in: Life Romuald Adam Rajs was born in the village of Jabłonka, Podkarpackie Voivodeship under the Austrian Partition. He graduated from high school in Sanok, in the newly reborn sovereign Poland. In 1934 Rajs graduated from the School for Non-commissioned Officers in Konin and took the parachute course in Biedrusko near Poznań. With the rank of Corporal he was assigned to the 85 Infantry Regiment in Nowa Wilejka, Wilno Voivodeship, and in 1936 joined the 13 Infantry Regiment of the Polish Army. In 1938 he was transferred to the cavalry reconnaissance platoon of the 85 Infantry Regiment. =World War II= the Church in Turgiele During the September campaign of 1939 Rajs, and his Regiment, fought the invading Germans near Łowicz with the Polish Prusy Army (Armia Prusy) under Gen. Stefan Dąb-Biernacki. His unit was defeated on 15 September in the area of Lublin. On 17 September Soviet Union invaded Poland from the east. The men of his regiment were disarmed by Belarusians in the area of Bereza Kartuska. Rajs relocated to Wilno. He joined the Polish resistance movement, serving with the Union of Armed Struggle (ZWZ), and the Wilno branch of Armia Krajowa for two years. Since 1943 he was a commander of the 1st company of AK Wilno Brigade. He fought both Nazi Germans and the Lithuanian collaborators. In July 1944 Rajs took part in Operation Ostra Brama against the German occupation of Wilno (now Vilnius, Lithuania). He was awarded Order Virtuti Militari for his heroism. During the Red Army advance into occupied Poland his commanding officer was arrested by the NKVD. Rajs took over the command of his battalion, and led them out to safety in the area of Puszcza Rudnicka forest. Under the Soviet military control the AK partisans were routinely disarmed. Thousands of them were arrested and sent to the Soviet Gulag. In October 1944 Rajs travelled to Białystok and under an assumed identity, joined the Związek Patriotów Polskich, controlled and directed from Moscow. From January 1945 he led the LWP platoon in the State Forest Defence Battalion near Hajnówka. In May 1945 he contacted the AK Major Zygmunt Szendzielarz – an avid anti-communist – who was recreating the already disassembled 5th Wilno Brigade of Armia Krajowa in order to oppose the Soviet occupation of Białystok. Rajs joined Szendzielarz with 29 soldiers under his command, and on 9 May 1945 became the leader of the 2nd Squadron in the 5th Brigade of AK. The executive order to disband AK entirely came from Gen. Leopold Okulicki on 18 January 1945. The 5th Brigade refused to carry it out. The shifting of the borders of Poland and the annexation of eastern half of the Second Polish Republic by Joseph Stalin was ratified by the new communist authorities in postwar Poland on August 16, 1945. See also: The process of expulsions of Poles and Belarusians kicked into full swing. Remaining in Puszcza Białowieska and still growing in numbers, the 5th Brigade led by Szendzielarz fought a successful battle against the units of the Red Army, the pro-Soviet Polish People's Army, and the MBP security forces in around Miodusy-Dworaki village in Siemiatycze County on 18 August 1945. Nevertheless, faced with overwhelming concentration of the enemy forces, Major Szendzielarz ordered the dissolution of the 5th Brigade on 7 September 1945. Rajs refused to surrender. = National Military Union = 3rd Wilno Brigade in Turgiele.

Rajs was promoted to the rank of Captain and on 16 September 1945 became leader of the PAS Special Forces (Pogotowie Akcji Specjalnej) within NZW Białystok. The process of unification of smaller underground units, commanded by Kazimierz Chmielowski (\\"Rekin\\") in the area of Wysokie Mazowieckie County until December 1945, resulted in the gathering of the largest anti-Soviet partisan group in the region, engaging in skirmishes with the communist commandos of MBP, KBW and MO. The area of the Bielsk County was especially dangerous for the underground to operate in, because the MBP field units and the NKVD received information and logistical help from the local members of the former Communist Party of Western Belarus and the Communist Party of Poland in existence before the war started. In early January 1946 NZW headquarters called a meeting of local commanders. Rajs was given leadership of partisans enrolled by Chmielowski (\\"Rekin\\"). His unit, consisting of 228 soldiers, was renamed as the 3rd Wilno Brigade of the NZW PAS.

Notably, as many as five alleged pacification actions by \\"Rekin\\" were fabricated by the UB interrogators, since the village of Mostek never existed in the Bielsk County as revealed by the IPN investigation. =Arrest and execution= The 3rd Brigade of NZW PAS, led by \\"Bury\\" and \\"Rekin\\", was attacked on 16 February 1946 near the village of Gajrowskie by communist special forces equipped with armoured vehicles. Most partisans managed to escape the encirclement, with considerable losses. It was the biggest battle fought by them with the NKWD, UB, KBW and MO thus far. The next battle took place on 30 April 1946 near Czochanie-Góra in which 25 partisans were killed and 12 captured. On 9 August 1946 near Różyńsk Wielki two more officers died. In October 1946 Rajs split his group into three smaller, independent units, which were dispersed across three separate counties of the newly-formed Białystok Voivodeship. He received permission from the NZW regional headquarters to take a vacation. Rajs went to Karpacz, where he was captured by the Urząd Bezpieczeństwa on 17 November 1948. A month later, his co- conspirator Chmielowski was arrested on 13 December 1948. They were charged with membership in AK and NZW, aiming to overthrow the communist government of Poland, coupled with armed assaults on the Polish Army and the Red Army, the assassination of MO functionaries, attacks on the UB security outposts, the railway guard, as well as assassination of civilians during forced requisitions of property, and possession of assault weapons. Individually, Romuald Rajs was also charged with desertion from the Polish Army. They were executed on 30 December 1949 without material evidence of alleged civilian atrocities, which were obtained by the communist authorities well over a year later, in the spring of 1951. Posthumous history The communist courts ordered the exhumation of the two graves near Puchały Stare on 27 April 1951. No medical doctor and/or pathologist was present at the dig. The official report of the exhumation listed 22 skeletal remains found in one mass grave, and 5 in the second one. The remains were laid in 3 coffins and transported to Klichy village nearby, where they were buried in the Catholic cemetery. None of the persons who took part in the 1951 exhumations was later questioned. In 1995, almost 50 years after the fact, the Military Court of Warsaw posthumously nullified the death penalty received by Romuald Rajs. By the time of the post-communist research by IPN (which took place in 1997, and again in 2002), none of the participants of the original exhumations were still living. In their own investigation which ended in 2005, the Institute of National Remembrance analysed documents and testimonies of the 1949 show trial, and interviewed a total of 169 persons. Among the individuals questioned by the IPN were families of victims as well as former soldiers of the 3rd Brigade of NZW. The IPN investigation established that the original testimony by Prokop Iwacik had no grounds in reality because he could not have been there; his own son testified that Iwacik went into hiding for three days. The subsequent description of terrific murders in Puchały Stare contradicted one of the key tenets of forensic science; the fracturing of bones was produced by bullets and not by blows as alleged. It was Iwacik who claimed that ethnic Belarusian carriers were singled out for the execution in Puchały, but according to statement by Michał T. the carriers were selected for the exchange based on quality of their horse-drawn carriages alone. Among the many child witness reports collected by the IPN there were also testimonies confirming that local farmers were among the assailants. Maria K. from Zanie testified that her mother was killed by a man from a neighbouring village, known to her brother.

Tunnicliffe (born 27 February 1968) is a British special make-up effects designer, writer, and director. He has performed make-up effects in all the Hellraiser films since Hellraiser III: Hell on Earth, wrote Hellraiser: Revelations, and wrote and directed Hellraiser: Judgment. His other make-up credits include Candyman, Wishmaster, the Dracula 2000 series, the Pulse series, and Feast.  Career  Tunnicliffe started out performing special make-up effects. After collaborating with Bob Keen on make-up effects for writer-director Anthony Hickox's Waxwork II: Lost in Time (1992), he joined them again for Hickox's next project, Hellraiser III: Hell on Earth (1992). Special effects technician Kevin Yagher, when selected to direct Hellraiser: Bloodline (1996), contacted Tunnicliffe to perform the special effects on that film. Tunnicliffe was surprised Yagher was not performing the effects work himself, but Yagher believed Tunnicliffe's experience with the prior film would be valuable. Tunnicliffe returned for Scott Derrickson's Hellraiser: Inferno (2000) and Rick Bota's Hellraiser: Hellseeker (2002). He again collaborated with Bota in the next two sequels, both released in 2005. In Hellraiser: Deader, he also directed the second unit and had a cameo appearance. In Hellraiser: Hellworld, Tunnicliffe performed special effects, make-up effects, and collected the Hellraiser memorabilia used in the film. Tunnicliffe appeared in the film as a Cenobite and, briefly, without make-up near the end. In Hellraiser: Revelations (2011), he wrote the script for director Víctor García. He wrote and directed the tenth Hellraiser sequel, Judgment. In addition to his work on the Hellraiser films, Tunnicliffe has worked with Clive Barker on Candyman (1992) and Lord of Illusions (1995). Tunnicliffe has also worked with Patrick Lussier on several films, including the Dracula 2000 series, My Bloody Valentine 3D (2009), and Drive Angry (2011). Other franchises include Pulse (2006) and its sequels, Mimic 2 (2001) and Mimic 3: Sentinel (2003), and Scream 4 (2011).

It was founded in 1925 at Virginia Polytechnic Institute, by agriculture teachers Henry C. Groseclose,\\"Future Farmers to Meet Aug. 6-9: 1,000 Young Virginians Will Compete for Honors at Blacksburg\\". The Washington Post. 3 August 1929. p. 18. Walter Newman, Edmund Magill, and Harry Sanders as Future Farmers of Virginia. In 1928, it became a nationwide organization known as Future Farmers of America. In 1988 the name was changed to the National FFA Organization, now commonly referred to as FFA, to recognize that the organization is for students with diverse interests in the food, fiber, and natural resource industries, encompassing science, business, and technology in addition to production agriculture. Today FFA is among the largest youth organizations in the United States, with 669,989 members in 8,630 chapters throughout all 50 states, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. FFA is the largest of the career and technical student organizations in U.S. schools. The organization holds a congressional charter under Title 36 of the United States Code. Overview The National FFA Organization is a youth leadership organization that makes a positive difference in the lives of young people by developing their potential for premier leadership, personal growth, and career success through agriculture education. The FFA Motto is Learning to Do, Doing to Learn, Earning to Live, Living to Serve. FFA functions within the three-circle model of agricultural education as a student leadership organization that complements a student's classroom/laboratory instruction and supervised agricultural experience program. FFA members can compete in Career Development Events (CDE) that cover job skills in everything from communications to mechanics. Some events allow students to compete as individuals, while others allow them to compete in teams. These competitions can happen at a local or district level, state level, and on the national level. Students are supervised by agricultural education teachers in cooperation with parents, employers, and other adults who assist individuals in the development and achievement of educational and career goals The official colors of FFA are National Blue and Corn Gold. FFA structure United States Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack (3rd from right) stands with five former National FFA Officers in 2011. FFA is represented at several different levels across the nation; FFA administration may change from state to state. The basic levels are the national level, serving all of the United States of America, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands; the state level, serving an individual state association; and the chapter level, serving a school or set of schools in an area. By definition, there can be three types of chapters at the secondary level, they are middle for middle school, junior for ninth grade and senior which can be either tenth through twelfth or ninth through twelfth depending on the school. Other levels include districts, sub districts, sections, regions, areas, and federations. FFA was created to serve high school students and has moved into middle schools where membership may begin as early as age 12, allowing members to become active earlier and stay active longer. Each chapter is chartered as part of the state association and national organization. Collegiate chapters exist as well. Most states hold FFA conventions at least once annually, where members gather to compete, be recognized for awards, attend leadership workshops, debate organizational issues in a delegate process, and more. Nationally, the National FFA Convention & Expo is held once a year in the fall. It was held in Kansas City, Missouri, from 1928 to 1998. The convention moved to Louisville, Kentucky, in 1999 before moving again in 2006 to Indianapolis, Indiana. Louisville again hosted the national convention from 2013 to 2015. FFA announced in July 2015 that the national convention would be hosted in Indianapolis each year from 2016 to 2024. Officers of FFA As FFA is a student-led organization intended to serve youth around the nation, it elects officers from its own diverse membership to certain levels of FFA. With these basic constitutional officers a basis of parliamentary procedure is completed during meetings and banquets; each officer during these procedures will stand and recite their office level and what it is stationed by, and why the particular position is stationed as so. Typical officer roles are: =Constitutional officers= * President — Stationed by the rising sun, a token of a new era in agriculture; presides over meetings * Vice President — Stationed by the plow, the symbol of labor and tillage of the soil; presides over meetings in the absence of the president * Secretary — Stationed by the ear of corn, to keep a record of all meetings and correspond with other secretaries wherever corn is grown and FFA members meet * Treasurer — Stationed by the emblem of George Washington, to keep an accurate account of receipts and disbursements just as Washington kept his farm accounts, carefully and accurately * Reporter — Stationed by the Flag, strives to inform the public in order that every man, woman, and child may know that FFA is a national organization that reaches from the state of Alaska to the Virgin Islands and from the state of Maine to Hawaii * Sentinel — Stationed by the door, to ensure the door is open to all, care for the meeting room and paraphernalia, strives to keep the meeting room comfortable as well as assists the president in maintaining order * Advisor — Stationed by the owl, the time honored emblem of knowledge and wisdom =Others may include= * Parliamentarian — Stationed by a copy of Robert's Rules of Order * Historian — Stationed at the scroll or chapter scrapbook * Student Advisor — Stationed by the owl or the key * Executive Committee/Executive Board Each officer is an agriculture student and holds responsibilities needed to serve. Officers are elected each year by members at the respective level. =National officers= At the national level, the organization has student-held positions of president, secretary, and vice president for each of the four administrative regions (Eastern, Southern, Central, and Western). Official FFA dress Secretary of State Mike Pompeo with Iowa FFA students in 2019 Odessa Oldham, of Casper College in Wyoming, explained her role in the National FFA Organization to the United States Department of Agriculture, as part of its Native American Indian Heritage Month celebration in Washington D.C., in November 2011. =FFA jacket= The most recognizable symbol of the organization is the blue corduroy jacket that is worn by FFA members. The back of the jacket features a large FFA emblem underneath the name of the member's state. The name of the local FFA chapter, district, region, or area is embroidered below the emblem. The front of the FFA jacket features a smaller FFA emblem on the left chest and the FFA member's name and sometimes, if applicable, office and year on the right chest. FFA members are required to wear the jacket as part of official dress while participating in all official organization activities. The FFA jacket was created to be worn by the Fredericktown Band of the Fredericktown FFA Chapter by Dr. Gus Lintner. It was adopted in 1933. The color of the jacket's corduroy has ranged from shades of blue to shades of purple through the years. In 2004, the National FFA Organization worked with a supplier in North Carolina to set a new standard for the blue corduroy by using samples from archived FFA jackets. The jacket's color standardization was accompanied by a restoration of the embroidered FFA emblems and fit corrections led by Clemson University's Apparel Research Center. The improved FFA jacket, produced in both Van Wert, Ohio and South Vietnam, was first made available in August 2005. Currently, all lettering, embroidery and finishing of FFA jackets is completed by Universal Lettering Company in Van Wert, Ohio. =Elements of FFA official dress= FFA members are required to wear official FFA dress while participating in official organization activities. The National FFA Organization recently updated its bylaws, stating that members may choose to identify however they choose in regards to official dress, in order to include transgender as well as gender non-conforming individuals within the organization. For females, official dress consists of a black skirt (black slacks may be appropriate for travelling and outdoor activities), a white collared blouse, an official FFA blue scarf, black dress shoes with closed heel and toe, black nylon hosiery, and an official FFA jacket zipped to the top. Male official dress includes black dress pants, a white dress shirt, an official FFA tie, black dress shoes with closed heel and toe, black socks, and an official FFA jacket zipped to the top. =Awards and pins= FFA members earn metal pins that signify achievement within the organization. These pins can be placed on the front of the FFA jacket, however, official guidelines state that no more than three pins may be worn at one time. The pins are to be placed beneath the FFA member's name on the right chest and can recognize highest degree, highest office, and/or highest award in that order from left to right. Two exceptions exist within pin placement guidelines. When an FFA member earns a State FFA Degree or American FFA Degree, the award keys should be worn above the name on right chest or attached to the FFA jacket with a standard key chain, and no other pins should accompany these. Traditions Former FFA emblem in use until February 2015. FFA has many traditions and trademarks identifying it as an agricultural education organization: The FFA Motto: Learning to Do, Doing to Learn, Earning to Live, Living to Serve. The FFA Mission: The National FFA Organization is dedicated to making a positive difference in the lives of students by developing their potential for premier leadership, personal growth, and career success through agricultural education. The Official FFA Colors: National Blue and Corn Gold (worn on the Official FFA jackets). The FFA Emblem: Cross section of the ear of corn: represents unity. Wherever you live in the United States, corn is grown everywhere. Rising Sun: signifies progress. It represents that tomorrow will always bring a new day. Plow: signifies labor and tillage of the soil. It also shows the historic foundation of our country's strength. Eagle: symbolizes freedom and our ability to explore the new agriculture world. Owl: represents knowledge. Long recognized for wisdom and knowledge. Agriculture Education and FFA: symbolizes the combination of learning and leadership. The FFA Creed: The creed was written by Erwin Milton \\"E.M.\\" Tiffany of Lyndon, Kansas It was written in 1928 and adopted at the 3rd National FFA Convention. It was revised at the 38th and 63rd National FFA Conventions by the assembled delegate body. It is recited by new members to the organization to reflect their growing belief in agriculture and agricultural education. The FFA Creed also must be memorized and recited to earn the Greenhand Degree. > I believe in the future of agriculture, with a faith born not of words but > of deeds – achievements won by the present and past generations of > agriculturists; in the promise of better days through better ways, even as > the better things we now enjoy have come to us from the struggles of former > years. I believe that to live and work on a good farm or to be engaged in > other agricultural pursuits, is pleasant as well as challenging; for I know > the joys and discomforts of agricultural life and hold an inborn fondness > for those associations which, even in hours of discouragement I cannot > deny.'' I believe in leadership from ourselves and respect from others. I > believe in my own ability to work efficiently and think clearly, with such > knowledge and skill as I can secure, and in the ability of progressive > agriculturists to serve our own and the public interest in producing and > marketing the product of our toil.''

Press of Mississippi, 2002. p297 Later in his career, Craig became well known for introducing African American musicians to the stage. For example, in January 1915 he featured Roland Hayes in Hayes' premier New York shows.Brooks, Christopher A., and Robert Sims. Roland Hayes: The Legacy of an American Tenor. Indiana University Press, 2014. p37 Craig was famous for a number of annual musical concerts. His first annual Christmas reception occurred in 1880 and continued into the early 1900s. Similarly, in 1880 he presented his first Annual May Festival which also continued into the 1900s. Possibly the most well renowned annual concert was his pre-lenten reception which took place at Palm Garden in New York and continued into the 1910s. Craig was at the front rank of musicianship among African-Americans and New Yorkers. His work frequently interpreted classical composors with \\"exceptional feeling and fidelity\\" and was important in shaping the musical tastes of African-American in New York city. His abilities stretched beyond classical composition and his orchestra was in great demand for dance programs. Family and death Bertie Toney-Craig in 1909 Craig married Bertie Toney-Craig. They had two children. Bertie died May 16, 1919.

She has been described as one of the \\"pioneers in the mapping of archaeological data\\". Early life and education Chitty was born on 20 March 1893 at Lewdown, Devon, England. She was the eldest child of the Reverend James Charles Martin Chitty (1865–1938) and Gwen Ethlin Georgiana Chitty (née Jones; 1861–1933). One of her two younger brothers was the archaeologist and priest Derwas Chitty. In 1899, James Chitty was appointed Rector of Hanwood, and so the family moved to Shropshire. She was educated at home, before attending the Shrewsbury School of Art between 1910 and 1915. Career Chitty had intended to continue her artistic studies, but chose instead to train as a secretary in order to contribute to the war effort during the First World War. She then worked at the General Post Office in London for a short period of time, before serving as a member of the Women's Land Army in her home county of Shropshire for the rest of the war. The Women's Land Army was a civilian organisation created so that women, nicknamed the \\"Land Girls\\", could replace men working on farms who had been called up to the military. After the end of the war, Chitty returned to the family home. Her father was made Rector of Yockleton, also in Shropshire, in 1920. During this time she developed her interest in archaeology and particularly in prehistoric artefacts. In 1924, she was appointed the Ordnance Survey's honorary correspondent for archaeology in Shropshire. In 1926, she also became the local contact for the Ancient Monuments Board. Having met Harold Peake, during 1927 she was tasked with \\"drawing bronze implements for the British Association\\". Around this time, she began to create an analytical card index of \\"national and local archaeological periodicals and other literature\\"; this would become an important database for professional archaeologists and students. Her artistic training meant that she was asked by Cyril Fox to draw the maps for his book The personality of Britain (1935); however, these were not acknowledged as her work until the third edition which was published in 1938. In 1938, Chitty's father died and she moved in with her brother, Derwas Chitty, who was the then Rector of Upton, Berkshire. She managed his household until he married fellow archaeologist Mary Kitson Clark in 1943. She then moved by herself, returning to the family's house in Pontesbury, Shropshire. She once more became the local archaeological expert, having been appointed the \\"Chief Correspondent for Shropshire Ancient Monuments Department\\". She \\"drew artefacts, researched and mapped find sites, published reports, and helped to improve local museum collections\\". She also turned once more to indexing and was asked by the Cambrian Archaeological Association to do so for its Archaeologia Cambrensis. Published in 1964, the index has been described as the \\"best index for this particular publication\\". In addition to the indexes she produced, Chitty wrote and published 146 articles in scholarly journals. These were mainly artefact reports on single objects, but she also expanded upon incomplete or incorrect early publications concerning Bronze Age hoards. Later life In old age, Chitty retained an interest in archaeology, and attended many of the activities (including lectures and excursions) of the learned societies of which she was a member. She developed hypothermia in January 1979, and died on 8 February 1979 at the Hillside Rest Home, Church Stretton, Shropshire. She is buried in the Pontesbury Cemetery in Shropshire. Honours In 1939, Chitty was elected a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London (FSA). In 1957, she was awarded an honorary Master of Arts (MA) degree by the University of Wales. In the 1956 New Year Honours, she was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in recognition of her work as \\"Chief Correspondent for Shropshire Ancient Monuments Department\\". In 1972, a Festschrift was published in Chitty's honour. It was titled Prehistoric Man in Wales and the West: Essays in Honour of Lily F. Chitty and edited by Frances Lynch and Colin B. Burgess.

Early life Rallis attended the University of Minnesota, where he played for the Minnesota Golden Gophers football team between 2008 and 2012. After graduating college, he attended a tryout camp with the Miami Dolphins but was not signed to a contract. In October 2013, Rallis attended a WWE tryout after contacting Jim Ross. Professional wrestling career =WWE= Training and NXT (2014–2019) Rallis signed a developmental contract with WWE in early 2014 and began training at the WWE Performance Center. He made his professional wrestling debut on December 18 at a NXT live event in Tampa, Florida under the ring name Digg Rawlis. He made his televised debut on the May 27, 2015, episode of NXT, working as an enhancement talent alongside Elias Samson in a defeat to Blake and Murphy. Rawlis made further occasional televised appearances as an enhancement talent during 2015, losing to The Hype Bros and Samoa Joe. In August 2015 he adopted the new ring name Riddick Moss, a tribute to former NFL player Randy Moss. In October 2016, Moss began teaming with Tino Sabbatelli, (calling themselves the God Gifted Athletes) with the two competing in the 2016 Dusty Rhodes Tag Team Classic where they were defeated in the first round by TM61 on the October 12 episode of NXT.

There's a sexy swagger to Timberlake's onstage personae that never reads as cocksure, largely because of the lavish attention he pays to his band and dancers... They all look like there's no place they’d rather be, despite it being the end of a grueling two year tour. In an era when machines are largely responsible for the beats that drive pop music, the reverence Timberlake shows for actual instruments is worth endearing. Still, there's no mistaking Timberlake as ring leader.\\" Brian Tallerico of the Roger Ebert website gave the film three-and-a-half out of four stars, and wrote \\"Demme opens his fantastically entertaining concert film by introducing us to the backup players and musicians who have supported the pop star on this two-year tour, but make no mistake, this movie is about the entertainer at its center. While Demme's camera never forgets to allow the other partners in pop to share time, he always comes back to Timberlake, one of the most purely enjoyable musicians around which one could center a concert film. His energy is infectious and his joy about what he's been blessed to do for a living is contagious\\". On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 100%, based on 14 reviews, with an average rating of 8.1/10.

Romans and later Italians brought their monumental and vernacular architecture north over the Alps, meeting the Germanic and German styles coming south and French influences coming east. Additionally, Swiss mercenary service brought architectural elements from other lands back to Switzerland. All the major styles including ancient Roman, Romanesque, Gothic, Renaissance, Baroque, Neoclassical, Art Nouveau, Modern architecture and Post Modern are well represented throughout the country. The founding of the Congrès International d'Architecture Moderne in La Sarraz and the work of Swiss-born modern architects such as Le Corbusier helped spread Modern architecture throughout the world. The relative isolation of villages in the Alpine foothills, the Alps and the Jura mountains as well as different languages led to great diversity in the vernacular style. Due to differing traditions, climate and building materials, villages in each region are distinctly different. The Swiss chalet style, which was popular in the 19th century represents only one of a number of traditional designs. Today, due to historic preservation laws and tourism, large and small communities have retained many of their historic core buildings. Since 1972 the Swiss Heritage Society has awarded the Wakker Prize to encourage communities to preserve their architectural heritage. Ancient architecture Reconstructed stilt houses at Wauwil Some of the earliest known buildings in Switzerland were prehistoric stilt houses which were built by the Pfyn, Horgen, Cortaillod and La Tène cultures between 4000 and 500 BC. A number of these early buildings have been rebuilt near the sites where the ruins were discovered. Roman columns at Nyon Following the defeat of the Helvetii at the Battle of Bibracte of 58 BC, over the next decades much of Switzerland was incorporated into the Roman Empire. The principal Roman settlements in Switzerland were the cities of Iulia Equestris (Nyon), Aventicum (Avenches), Augusta Raurica (Augst) and Vindonissa (Windisch). Evidence has also been found of almost twenty Roman villages (vici) established in the 1st to 3rd century AD, as well as hundreds of villas of varying sizes built in the western and central part of the Swiss Plateau. The Legio XIII Gemina, was based in the permanent camp of Vindonissa (Windisch) and Aventicum (Avenches) was the capital of the Helvetii. Under pressure from internal and external forces, the Roman Army retreated and Switzerland became a border province in the 4th century. Nyon and Augusta Raurica were permanently abandoned during the 4th century, the stones of their ruins serving to fortify Geneva and Basel.Ducrey, p. 104. Aventicum never recovered from its pillages: Ammianus Marcellinus noted in around 360 that \\"the city was once very illustrious, as its half-ruined buildings attest.\\"Ducrey, p. 101. There are a number of excavated or rebuilt Roman sites in Switzerland. Some of the ruins of Roman settlements were later incorporated into houses, churches and city walls. All four of the major Roman cities have some relics of the Roman era. Augusta Raurica has parts of the amphitheater, aqueduct, the main forum and a theater. At Avenches the eastern gates and a tower, a thermal bath, the 16,000 seat amphitheater and temple ruins are still visible. At Nyon, the Roman ruins were lost until their rediscovery in the 18th century, which included the amphitheater and basilica. At Windisch the legionaries camp, an amphitheater and an aqueduct are all visible. Ancient indigenous architecture includes rock shelters called \\"splüi\\", grotti and other anonymous architecture using rock. Pre-Romanesque Saint John Abbey The Pre-Romanesque period is considered to stretch from the emergence of the Merovingian kingdom in about 500 to the beginning of the 11th century Romanesque period, though there is considerable overlap. During the early centuries of this period, the area that would become Switzerland was sparsely populated and almost nothing remains of any buildings from the period between 500 and the late 8th century. During the Carolingian Renaissance of the 8th and 9th centuries, many new monasteries and churches sprung up across Western Europe. Carolingian architecture borrowed heavily from Early Christian and Byzantine architecture and helped lead to the Romanesque style in the following centuries. To begin expanding their power into the deep forests and isolated mountain valleys, the Carolingian kings established several monasteries in Switzerland. One well preserved example of this style in Switzerland is Saint John Abbey, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, which was probably founded around 775 either on orders of Charlemagne or his Bishop in Chur. Many of the frescoes in the chapel are from the first half of the 9th century.UNESCO list accessed 12 October 2016 Another well known example of Carolingian architecture is the World Heritage Site Abbey of St. Gall which, while it was rebuilt in the Baroque style between 1755 and 1768, is based on the much older Carolingian monastery. The Abbey library of Saint Gall contains around 2,100 manuscripts from the 8th to the 15th centuries including the Plan of St. Gall, the only surviving major architectural drawing from the 6th to the 13th centuries. The Plan is a drawing of a proposed, but never built, Benedictine monastery. Romanesque architecture Model of the first church at Schaffhausen Some of the defining characteristics of Romanesque architecture is solid walls with few, small, semi-circular, paired windows, groin vaults and in religious architecture rows of columns that separate the nave from the aisles. In the 11th and 12th centuries, architecture in Switzerland can be roughly divided into three zones of influence, the Lombards in the south, Burgundy in the west and Germanic in the north and east, though there is significant overlap. The Lombard and Burgundian craftsmen experimented with barrel and groined vaults and carved capitals and friezes. In the Germanic parts of Europe, the ecclesiastical Romanesque style often included an apse on both the eastern and western ends of the nave, such as was shown in the Plan of St. Gall. The western apse was often flanked by two symmetrical, square towers which may include a westwork. Interior of Romainmôtier Priory church showing the Romanesque massive pillars and groined arches. When the Cluniac reforms spread through Switzerland in the late 10th and 11th centuries, it triggered a wave of church and monastery construction. All five Bishops in the area (Basel, Chur, Geneva, Lausanne and Sion) built Romanesque cathedrals, which included a full range of Romanesque and later Gothic elements. Romainmôtier Priory and Payerne Priory were both daughter houses of Cluny and were built in the Cluniac inspired Romanesque style. Romainmôtier was built by Lombard trained craftsmen by Odilo of Cluny around the end of the 10th century and has remained generally unchanged since then. The central nave features pillars with simply carved capitals and a groined ceiling. The cathedrals at Basel and Constance and the monasteries at Schaffhausen and Einsiedeln were all built with two symmetric square towers flanking the main portal like Cluny. Though all four of these examples were later rebuilt in other styles, the Romanesque floor plan is generally still visible. The Grossmünster in Zurich also shows Lombard elements despite being firmly in the Germanic zone. In addition to church and monastery construction, a number of Romanesque forts and castles were built throughout the country side. In German Switzerland wooden forts were replaced by stone towers, though in the French and Italian areas stone castles had remained common since the Roman era. These new castles featured a large, multi-story tower with thick, heavy walls. The central tower was then surrounded by a ring wall with towers and a gate house. As long-distance trade increased, the castles were placed along rivers and mountain passes to collect tolls and regulate movement. The Counts of Savoy built castles with square ring walls and towers on the corners such as Grandson and Yverdon. The Counts of Zähringen built large donjon like residence towers such as Thun Castle. The Counts of Kyburg built their castles with massive stones, visible in Kyburg Castle. Gothic architecture Originating in 12th-century France and lasting into the 16th century, its characteristics include the pointed arch, the ribbed vault (which evolved from the joint vaulting of Romanesque architecture) and the flying buttress. Today, the style is known mainly from numerous Gothic churches and cathedrals scattered across Europe. In Switzerland many Romanesque churches and monasteries were built in the bishop's seat or were supported by the bishops. In contrast, Gothic churches were often built in growing towns and cities as a symbol of their wealth and power. The newly founded mendicant orders built Gothic churches, plague houses and hospitals for much the same reason. By the late Gothic era a number of smaller Gothic parish churches were being built across the country. The style spread quickly into French-speaking Switzerland with the construction of Lausanne Cathedral beginning around 1170–90. The rose window (1210) and the statue decorated portal (1230), had come from France and in the following centuries would be widely copied throughout Switzerland. Around 1215, the Gothic upper part of Geneva's Cathedral was completed on the Romanesque lower part. From there Gothic spread gradually throughout the region driven by trade and the growing wealth of the mendicant orders. Between 1270 and the 14th century the Franciscans built Gothic churches or monasteries in Lucerne, Fribourg and Basel, the Dominican Order built two in Basel along with complexes in Bern, Zurich and at Königsfelden Monastery and the Augustinians built one in Fribourg. As the population grew during the 13th to 16th century, a number of new parishes were established. For example, around Zurich in the period between 1470 and 1525 over half of the approximately 100 parishes had a new Gothic church. Many of these new churches included a polygonal choir, lit with large windows and topped with a ribbed roof. The basilica nave had smooth walls and was topped with a flat roof. Many of these new parish churches included rich stained glass windows, some of which are still in place today. A French trained school of fresco painters developed in Waltensburg/Vuorz and decorated churches throughout Graubünden with Gothic frescos. After the 1356 Basel earthquake, the damaged choir of Basel's cathedral was rebuilt in a Gothic Rayonnant style. The towers and west façade were rebuilt in Gothic style during the 15th century. In 1421 construction began on the Bern Minster, one of the most important late-Gothic buildings in Switzerland. Its size and ornate design were a testament to the growing wealth and power of the new city-state. Throughout Zurich, Graubünden and Valais a number of new Gothic parish churches sprung up throughout the 15th and 16th centuries. However, in Inner Switzerland, the only new construction was the parish church of St. Oswald in Zug. In contrast to the ornate and distinctive Gothic churches, Gothic secular buildings tended to be understated and include only a few Gothic elements. Wealthy traders and patricians built houses with pointed arch windows or other Gothic decorations. The city halls of newly powerful cities such as Bern, Fribourg and Basel include a few Gothic elements (the ceiling in Bern, the star-ribbed vaulting in Fribourg) but lack a unified motif. Renaissance architecture The Renaissance style spread into Switzerland around the 16th century, reaching Ticino earlier than the rest of Switzerland. Renaissance style places emphasis on symmetry, proportion, geometry and the regularity of parts as they are demonstrated in the architecture of classical antiquity and in particular ancient Roman architecture, of which many examples remained. Orderly arrangements of columns, pilasters and lintels, as well as the use of semicircular arches, hemispherical domes, niches and aediculae replaced the more complex proportional systems and irregular profiles of Gothic buildings. As the Renaissance spread north from Italy, many churches in Ticino were decorated or rebuilt in the new style. In 1517, the Cathedral of Saint Lawrence in Lugano was rebuilt with a massive Renaissance façade. The façade of the Church of Pietro e Stefano in Bellinzona was begun in the Renaissance style, but completed in Baroque. A third major Renaissance work in Ticino is the church of S. Croce in Riva San Vitale. S. Croce was built in the late 16th Century and could be argued to represent either the late Renaissance or early Baroque. North of the Alps, mostly secular buildings were built in the Renaissance style. The first Renaissance buildings were in Basel in 1556, but were built by master craftsmen from Ticino. This was followed by the Ritter'sche Palast and town hall in Lucerne and a town hall in Zurich. The Munot in Schaffhausen and the fortifications near Bellinzona are the only two large Renaissance structures in Switzerland. The Munot was built in 1564–89 on a design of Albrecht Dürer, while the fortifications were built in the 15th century by Milan to defend against the Swiss and were later used by the Swiss to defend against Milan. Baroque architecture Baroque was a reaction to the changes of the Counter-Reformation within the Catholic Church, and often followed the expansion of the new reform orders, the Jesuits and the Capuchins. It first entered Switzerland from Italy in the Graubünden following the destruction of the Thirty Year's War. Some of the features of the style included broader naves and oval shapes in churches, pear shaped domes, fragmentary architectural elements, dramatic use of light, rich colors and ornaments, large ceiling frescoes, trompe l'oeil illusions and a façade that often included a dramatic projection. By the mid to late 17th century, there were a number of master craftsmen families from Roveredo, San Vittore and surrounding communities in Graubünden, who led construction projects throughout Europe. To help repair the damage of the Bundner Wirren and the Thirty Year's War, Graubünden craftsmen built numerous Capuchin hospices throughout the Canton before spreading out throughout Switzerland. New parish churches, monasteries, pilgrimage churches, chapels and roadside shrines were built across the country by both local and foreign craftsmen. In addition to religious buildings, hundreds of country manors and city houses along with town halls, hospitals, granaries and fortifications were all built in the new style. Since a key part of the Baroque style was the use of colors, realistic paintings and frescos and statues, many projects now included specialized artists who finished the exterior and interior as part of construction. Both local and foreign artists were active in Switzerland leading to rapidly spreading ideas. North of the Alps, each area had local families who specialized as sculptors, plaster workers and wood carvers. As they learned of the new style they incorporated its aesthetics into the numerous new churches. In the early 17th century, artists from Ticino began to travel to Rome to learn the Baroque style of painting. Some of them, such as Giovanni Serodine from Ascona and Pier Francesco Mola from Coldrerio, remained in Rome, while others returned to Ticino to work. As the Baroque style spread, it was taken up by artists north of the Alps as well. Some of the most notable examples of Baroque include the church at Arlesheim, the Jesuit Church in Lucerne, Pfäfers Abbey, Disentis Abbey, Rheinau Abbey, Einsiedeln Abbey and the Abbey of Saint Gall. Neoclassical architecture Neoclassicism was a style that grew out of the neoclassical movement of the mid-18th century to around 1850. The style was based on a return to Classical architecture and the Vitruvian architectural principles. It often included pillars supporting pediments and other geometric shapes such as cubes, cylinders and circles. During the mid to late 18th century, Switzerland was a haven for poets, artists, authors, philosophers, revolutionaries and architects. In Zurich, the German speaking poets and authors Johann Jakob Bodmer, Johann Jakob Breitinger, Johann Kaspar Lavater, Salomon Gessner and Johann Heinrich Füssli wrote letters and shared ideas with their counterparts in Germany. In Geneva, Voltaire and Rousseau developed philosophies that influenced governments and revolutionaries throughout Europe. In Coppet, Madame Germaine de Staël led an influential salon of Parisian exiles. In Italy Swiss artists were exposed to both classical art and architecture as well as Neoclassical works. The ideas of Classicism, Romanticism, Humanism and Sturm und Drang, among others, flooded into the country. At the same time, the foundation of the Helvetische Gesellschaft in 1761 helped develop Switzerland's national identity and unify the country. The idea of a shared foundation of Republicanism (the Landsgemeinde), pastoral life in alpine meadows and the legend of William Tell were all part of the Classicism interpreted in Switzerland. Beginning in the 1760s many skilled architects, builders and artists from Ticino relocated to Imperial Russia. Over the following decades entire families worked to build many of the buildings in the Russian Empire's two capitals of St. Petersburg and Moscow. Only a few religious buildings were built in Neoclassical style, but one of the largest is the Cathedral of St. Ursus in Solothurn. The majority of classicist buildings were government, business or mansions for the wealthy. One interesting example of neoclassical sculpture is the Lion Monument in Lucerne, based on the design of Bertel Thorvaldsen. It commemorates the Swiss Guards who were massacred in 1792 during the French Revolution. The monument uses nature to honor Swiss heroes, both elements of Classicism. During this period the traditional Swiss chalet, a small house tucked away on a high alpine meadow, began to spread outside Switzerland. The chalet first appeared in Jean-Jacques Rousseau's writings where it spread to France and then throughout Europe. The Swiss chalet style became a symbol of a simple, pastoral life built on democracy, freedom and a connection with nature. The wide variety of local styles and building materials was reduced to a wooden cottage with a gently sloping roof and wide, well-supported eaves set at right angles to the front of the house. At first, chalets appeared in the gardens and forests of wealthy European aristocrats, before spreading to spa resorts and other tourist destinations. By the second half of the 19th century, the chalet was a symbol of Switzerland and the word became common throughout the country. The design was well suited to be partially factory built and several companies manufactured chalet kits, which were shipped throughout Europe. Art Nouveau Interior of the La Chaux-de-Fonds crematorium Art Nouveau was a style of art, architecture and decoration that was popular from the 1880s until about 1914. It was inspired by natural forms and shapes and featured whiplash lines and flowing shapes. It was a \\"total\\" art style embracing architecture, fine art, interior design, and the decorative arts, furniture, textiles, jewellery, glass and metal art, ceramics and mosaics. In French Switzerland it was known as Art Nouveau after Siegfried Bing's gallery Maison de l'Art Nouveau in Paris. In German Switzerland it was known as Jugendstil after the magazine Jugend in Munich, while in Italian Switzerland it was the Liberty style after the London department store Liberty & Co. Art Nouveau was brought to Switzerland by designers from across Europe. The style took hold in the industrial cantons, but also appeared in mountain and spa resorts, which catered to foreign visitors. While a few complete Art Nouveau buildings are scattered across the country, the industrial watch-making city of La Chaux-de- Fonds was the centre of Art Nouveau in Switzerlabd. One of the leaders of this style in La Chaux-de-Fonds was Charles l'Eplattenier, who helped develop the local Style Sapin or \\"Pine Tree Style\\", so called due to its intense study of nature and natural shapes. L'Eplattenier designed the town's crematorium and the Musée des Beaux-Arts de La Chaux-de-Fonds (Beaux-Arts Museum of La-Chaux- de-Fonds). Heimatstil Villa Fallet, Le Corbusier's first commission, an example of Heimatstil and Art Nouveau At the same time as Art Nouveau was spreading into Switzerland, a branch of Modern architecture known as Heimatstil or Heimatschutzstil was developing in Germany and German Switzerland. In contrast to Art Nouveau, the Heimatstil was a reaction to industrialization and urbanization and wanted to return to traditional living. This style focused on using traditional elements in modern buildings, while preserving historic buildings and cityscapes, traditional rural living and agriculture. Particularly in Switzerland the image of the Alps, alpine herding and agriculture became a key part of the movement. Each region of Switzerland began to incorporate local traditional materials and designs into modern houses, apartment buildings, hotels, schools and even industrial buildings. Heimatstil architects included Nicolaus Hartmann in Graubünden, Armin Witmer- Karrer in Zürich, Karl Indermühle in Bern, Alphonse Laverrière in Lausanne und Edmond Fatio in Geneva. In La Chaux-de-Fonds, René Chapallaz and his better known pupil Le Corbusier built several buildings that connected Heimatstil and Art Nouveau, including Villa Fallet which was Le Corbusier's first commission. Out of a desire to preserve the traditional, the Swiss Heritage Society was created on 1 July 1905 and by 1910 had over 7,000 members. The Society published a monthly magazine which included examples of \\"good\\" and \\"bad\\" architecture, which reinforced the use of traditional designs. Later they led political campaigns against hydroelectric projects and highways and in 1962 were able to include protection of natural and architectural heritage in the Swiss Federal Constitution. Since 1972, the Heritage Society has awarded the Wakker Prize to recognize a community for exceptional preservation work. Modern architecture Modern architecture is a group of styles of architecture which emerged in the first half of the 20th century and became dominant after World War II. It was based upon new technologies of construction, particularly the use of glass, steel and reinforced concrete; and upon a rejection of the traditional neoclassical architecture and Beaux- Arts styles that were popular in the 19th century. The first school of architecture in Switzerland was the ETH Zurich Faculty of Architecture (ETHZ), which opened in 1855. The Zurich school trained architects quickly found work across the country and the world, designing private and public buildings. While the school initially focused on classical architecture, in 1915 Karl Coelestin Moser, an early leader in the Modern movement, was appointed a professor at ETHZ. In 1927, he designed St. Antonius Church in Basel, which was the first concrete church in Switzerland. In the 1920s, Hans Benno Bernoulli built the Wasserhaus housing development, a novel cooperative settlement outside Basel. Following the model of the Deutscher Werkbund, in 1913 the Schweizerischer Werkbund (SWB) was established in Zurich which helped spread Modern architecture to German-speaking Switzerland. Additionally, one of the founding members of the SWB was the painter Charles L'Eplattenier, who returned to Yverdon-les-Bains and founded a French sister organization known as L'Œuvre (OEV). Both organizations encouraged close cooperation between artists, architects, designers and industry, though they differed in their approach to mass production and traditionalism. Both organizations continued to publish journals and influence design into the 21st century, though in 2003 the OEV was absorbed into the SWB and became a regional chapter. One of the most influential Modern Swiss architects was Charles-Édouard Jeanneret, known as Le Corbusier. Le Corbusier studied art under Charles L'Eplattenier and René Chapallaz in La Chaux-de-Fonds and was initially influenced by his teachers' involvement in Art Nouveau, Heimatstil, and L'Œuvre (OEV). He was a member of OEV for a few years before leaving in 1918. In the 1920s he developed a style that made use of reinforced concrete to create a weightless, open space with non-weight bearing facades that could be freely designed and decorated. In the 1940s he began working on urban planning and designed large, concrete modular buildings for offices and apartments, culminating in the design of the Chandigarh Capitol Complex in Chandigarh in the newly formed Indian state in the 1950s. Two of Le Corbusier's buildings in Switzerland, the Immeuble Clarté and Villa Le Lac are part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site \\"The Architectural Work of Le Corbusier, an Outstanding Contribution to the Modern Movement\\". Under the leadership of Swiss architects including Le Corbusier, Hélène de Mandrot and Sigfried Giedion, the Congrès International d'Architecture Moderne (CIAM) was organized in La Sarraz in 1928. Over the years that the CIAM was active, they formalized the architectural principles of the Modern movement and developed principles of urban planning that spread throughout the world. After World War II, Modern architecture became the dominant style throughout the country. At the same time it began to divide into many different forms and regional styles. In Ticino, a group of architects including Tita Carloni, Luigi Snozzi, Bruno Reichlin, Fabio Reinhart and Mario Botta developed a style based on Functionalism and Rationalism and incorporating contrasts often with geometric designs and using local materials.Universal Lexikon-Neue Tessiner Architektur accessed 15 November 2016 The Graubünden Movement consists of a number of Swiss architects who build modern structures that blend into the local villages. One of the most famous is Peter Zumthor, who builds simple, down to earth buildings with minimal use of resources. Other Graubünden Movement architects include Valerio Olgiati, Andrea Deplazes and Gion A. Caminada. Vernacular architecture Map of building types used in European farmhouses. Switzerland contains regions that include three of the five broad types. Traditional Swiss farm and village house design depended on a number of factors including the local climate, type of agriculture, materials available, local tradition and location. Each region in Switzerland developed their own style of vernacular architecture to meet these factors. Migrations such as the spread of the Walser into Valais, the spread of Germanic culture into the Romansh regions of Graubünden and the Swiss invasion of Ticino allowed mixing of different traditional styles. The growth of alpine transhumance, were cattle summered in high alpine meadows and wintered in the valleys, required different designs for housing. Until the end of the Early Middle Ages most farms consisted of several separate buildings, each with a specific purpose. Beginning in the 11th century many of the out-buildings began to be combined into a single multi-purpose farm buildings. Farm houses now often contained living quarters, larders, stalls and feed storage under a single roof, but isolated by walls. The kitchens were generally chimney free until the 17th century, though in some poorer areas chimneys remained uncommon into the 19th century. However, using stone ovens or fireplaces to heat rooms became common by the 14th century in the northern Alpine foothills and Alpine valleys. External decoration became increasing visible on both wood and stone buildings after 1500. Façade decoration reached its peak in the 17th and 18th centuries before becoming less common and simpler in the following centuries. =North- west and Jura= In western Switzerland and the Jura mountains most houses were built of stone due to limited timber supplies. However, in northern Switzerland and the Bernese Mittelland plentiful wood meant that most construction was either all wood or wooden with a stone foundation. In both regions, by the 15th century, the local style had evolved into a multi-story, multi-purpose byre-dwelling with animals, fodder, storage and living quarters under one roof. Houses in the high Jura mountains were built with small windows to protect them from winter wind and snow, while those in the more temperate Swiss Plateau usually had lighter walls and larger windows.Ballenberg Museum-house 111 accessed 12 October 2016 Shallowly sloping shingle roofs were replaced with ones with a steeper, tiled roof beginning in the 16th century. Other farmhouses remained thatched until the introduction of fire insurance in the 19th century after which they gradually disappeared. In the Bernese Oberland, the Stöckli, a residence for the owner's aging parents, became a common sight in the 19th century. =North-east and eastern= In the north-east along the Rhine river, half-timbered construction was imported from southern Germany and gradually spread into the eastern Middlelands. Other houses were built with stacked plank construction, such as the example from Wila below.Ballenberg Museum - Eastern Middlelands accessed 12 October 2016 Despite the different building materials, multi-story byre-dwellings developed in north-eastern and eastern Switzerland around the same time as they did in the west. In the 16th century restrictions on building and the rise of the home textile industry (the Putting-out system) led to the creation of the Flarz, a complex of smaller apartments created by expanding existing buildings, in the Zurich Oberland. =Alpine foothills= In the foothills of the Alps cattle breeding and dairy farming were common after the second half of the 13th century, which led to a different style. Unlike the more northern byre-dwelling, here the house and barn remained separate. Generally, they were each built as simple block structures made of heavy, square beams. The gable ends often have a windows and are protected by large eaves. In the Bernese Oberland the gable ends are often richly decorated. The design remained basically unchanged from the 12th century until the 19th, and is still built today. There is no clearly defined border between the byre-dwellings of the Swiss Plateau and the separate structures of the foothills so both designs may be present in a single village. =Valais= In Valais the entire valley was originally French speaking until the 13th century when upper valley was settled by German speaking colonists. This led to differing architectural styles as well as extensive borrowing from the other culture. In the French speaking part, stone construction is much more common, while in the German speaking area, wooden beam styles dominate. However, in the Val d'Illiez region the houses are generally wooden, but with a distinctive roof ridge that projects much further forward than the bottom of the roof. =Ticino= The modern Canton of Ticino was an Italian province conquered by the Old Swiss Confederation in the 15th century. The local architecture is more similar to that of northern Italy, though each small, isolated valley developed their own style. The southernmost parts of the Canton the villages are small and compact while the farms are isolated, sprawling stone and wood complexes that developed over centuries as apartments, storage and production buildings were added. In the northern part, narrow alpine valleys limit the size of fields and villages. Northern Ticino was conquered and administered by Uri, Schwyz and Nidwalden. These foreign overlords brought the wooden block construction from the Alpine foothills into Ticino. In the last 200 years stone construction has replaced the earlier wooden structure in most villages in Ticino.Ballenberg Museum - Ticino accessed 12 October 2016 =Graubünden= Following the destruction of the local Bündner Wirren (part of the Thirty Years' War) in the 17th century, many of the houses in Graubünden had to be rebuilt. The new houses were built of stone, often on top of or surrounding an earlier wooden building. In the Engadin valley they built stone byre- dwellings, typically with a Sulèr, a wide passage through the residential section into the hay storage section. The kitchen, dining and storage rooms were branched off the Sulèr. The upper story included a large hall known as the Stuva süra as well as bedrooms. The basement housed the stables. Many of the houses were decorated with sgraffiti.

It was built as an entertainment venue by Tivoli Gardens-founder Georg Carstensen but was converted into a theatre in 1848. It closed in 1937 and the building was demolished in 1960. History =Originas= Built by Georg Carstensen, founder of Tivoli Gardens, Casino was originally envisioned as a \\"Winter Tivoli\\" with bazaar, promenade concerts and soirées. Carstensen financed the project through the sale of shares. In November 1845, he had raised 200,000 Danish rigsdaler. The building was designed by H. C. Stilling who had also worked for Carstensen during the establishment of Tivoli Gardens. The entertainment venue opened on 22 February 1847. =The theatre= The entertainment never gained popularity in its original form and was soon converted into a theatre. The first play premiered on 26 December 1848. The Casino Theatre catered to a broader audience than the Royal Theatre at Kongens Nytorv. It was a place where common people went, often with their children. Its repertoire consisted of comedies, revue vaudevilles and operettas. Revue as Danish theatre genre was founded with Nytårsnat 1850. Productions included Hans Christian Andersen's Meer end perler og guld and Ole Lukøje as well as comedies by Jens Christian Hostrup and Thomas Overskou. =Political meetings, carnivals and concerts= Ball in the Casino Theatre, 1859/60 Carnival in the Casino Theatre in 1870 Casino is associated with the Casino Meetings, two public political meetings which took place during the so-called March Revolution in March 1848, culminating in the adoption of the Constitution of Denmark. The first meeting took place on 11 March 1848 at the initiative of the national liberal leaders Hvidt, H. N. Clausen and Tscherning, attracting approximately 2,300 participants. The occasion was news about the political demands made by Schleswig-Holstein at a political rally in Rendsborg. The second Casino Meeting, which took place on 20 March, resulted in the adoption of a resolution written by Orla Lehmann. The next day, approximately 15,000 people marched to Christiansborg where Christian VII had just dissolved his government. New political meetings took place in Casino on 29 August and 28 September 1854, resulting in the foundation of an association for the defence of the Constitution. Another political meeting took place in the Casino Theatre in 1863, leading to the fatal decision that Schleswig should be incorporated into Denmark. The Casino Theatre was also used as a venue for balls, concerts and a series of carnivals. Edvard Grieg's Piano Concerto in A minor was for the first time performed on 3 April 1859 in the Casino Theatre. =20th century= Fritz Petersen took over the position as theatre director in 1904. The Casino Theatre closed in 1937 as a result of the economic crisis of the 1940s and the growing popularity of motion films. The theatre reopened for a farewell show with scenes from its most popular productions on 1 April 1939. The building was converted into a warehouse. It was demolished in 1960.

As a sophomore, he posted averages of 0.5 points and 1.5 rebounds in 28 games, recording 8.4 minutes per contest. His 1.4 blocks per game were a team high. In August 2012, he was dismissed from the team for failing to meet eligibility requirements.

It has rough, tessellated bark on the trunk and branches, lance-shaped adult leaves, flower buds in groups of seven, creamy white flowers and barrel-shaped to urn-shaped fruit. Description Corymbia stockeri is a tree that typically grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. It has thick, soft, scaly to flaky, reddish bark on the trunk and branches. Young plants and coppice regrowth have elliptic to oblong, later lance-shaped leaves that are glossy green on the upper surface, paler below, long and wide. Adult leaves are glossy green on the upper surface, paler below, lance-shaped, long and wide on a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged on the ends of branchlets on a branched peduncle long, each branch of the peduncle with seven buds on pedicels long. Mature buds are pear-shaped to oval, long and wide with a rounded operculum. Flowering has been observed in February and the flowers are creamy white. The fruit is a woody barrel-shaped to urn-shaped capsule long and wide with the valves enclosed in the fruit. Taxonomy and naming The blotchy bloodwood was first formally described in 1987 by Denis John Carr and Stella Grace Maisie Carr who gave it the name Eucalyptus stockeri and published the description in their book Eucalyptus II - The rubber cuticle, and other studies of the Corymbosae. The type specimens were collected by Geoffrey Stocker near Mutchilba in 1973. In 1995, Ken Hill and Lawrie Johnson changed the name to Corymbia stockeri, publishing the change in the journal Telopea. The specific epithet (stockeri) honours the collector of the type specimens. In 2002, Anthony Bean described two subspecies in the journal Austrobaileya and the names have been accepted by the Australian Plant Census: * Corymbia stockeri subsp. peninsularis (K.D.Hill & L.A.S.Johnson) A.R.Bean (previously known as Corymbia hylandii subsp. peninsularis) is a smaller tree with non- scurfy buds and fater dull adult leaves than those of the autonym; * Corymbia stockeri (D.J.Carr & S.G.M.Carr) K.D.Hill & L.A.S.Johnson subsp. stockeri. Distribution and habitat Subspecies stockeri grows in woodland on stony ridges with little soil and is only known from the Stannary Hills west of Atherton. Subspecies peninsularis is more widespread than the autonym and grows in forest and woodland on river levees and gently-sloping hills, and is found from some of the Torres Strait Islands south to the Palmer River on Cape York.

The current winner is West Alabama, who won 38–17, on September 23, 2017. North Alabama leads the all-time series, 52–18–1. The 71 previous meetings mark the most games each team has played against another school and the 52 wins of North Alabama are also its most against an opposing institution. History North Alabama and West Alabama first met in 1949 and have played every year. West Alabama is the only program that North Alabama has faced in every season since the Lions restored their football program in 1949, after a 21 year long hiatus since 1928. =Gulf South Conference: 1970–2017= North Alabama and West Alabama have been in the same conference since 1970, and were both founding members of the Mid-South Conference in 1970 and their current conference, Gulf South Conference a year later. The Lions and Tigers have played ever since 1970 for 49 match ups. In fact, the Lions and Tigers even played twice in the regular-season in 1986. In 2011, the Lions and Tigers met in the regular-season and post-season. West Alabama upset North Alabama in both 2002 and 2004 in Livingston, and in 2009 in four overtimes in Florence when the Lions were ranked No. 1 in the nation. That was West Alabama's first win in Florence since 1987. The Tigers were led in that game by former North Alabama head coach Boby Wallace. Bobby Wallace has coached at both schools, coaching at North Alabama from 1988–97, West Alabama from 2006-10 and returning to the Lion's from 2012-16. The 2017 season will likely be the last for the rivalry for the foreseeable future, following UNA's announcement that it would upgrade its athletic program to NCAA Division I, joining the ASUN Conference for non-football sports in 2018 and eventually the Big South Conference in football.

Fats first achieved success with his cover version of the Hank Ballard song \\"Tore Up\\" in 1962, which established him as an in-demand session and touring musician. He is also remembered for his collaboration with blues guitarist Bernie Pearl, a partnership that resulted in four albums. Biography Born in McDade, Louisiana, a small community 40 miles from Shreveport, Blackston, the eldest of 13 children, was raised on a cotton farm by his grandparents. Blackston casually played harmonica since he was four years-old, and credited Sonny Terry as the foremost influence on his style of playing. Bored with the farming lifestyle, in 1946 Blackston relocated to Los Angeles where he lived with his father, and worked for a manufacturing company. After an automobile accident in 1954 temporarily left him jobless, Blackston began avidly practicing his harp skills; recalling how he knew \\"a guy by the name of Cleveland Weller that plays guitar and he invited me out to his house to play on a Saturday night with him. So I went out there. He gave me a mike and an amplifier and I started blowing through that mike and amplifier and I would hear all my mistakes, and so then I went down town next day bought me a amplifier and a mike and so I went and practised for four months\\". Intent on avoiding the lack of preparation from his first public performance, Blackston formed a band known as the Houserockers, and rehearsed for two years, mastering a repertoire of over 200 songs. Blackston and his band started out at the Tango Club, quickly becoming a popular live fixture on the Los Angeles blues circuit as a result of their energetic stage act and Blackston's knack for penning humorous, but relatable, songs. Jamming with some of the city's most accomplished harmonica players, including George \\"Harmonica\\" Smith, Johnnie Dyer, and Harmonica Slim, Blackston's association with his contemporaries, particularly Slim, led to the adaption of his stage name, Harmonica Fats. In 1962, while Fats was collaborating with pianist Henry Strogin, he demoed the Hank Ballard tune \\"Tore Up\\", a frequently requested song of which Fats had modified the lyrics. Fats re-recorded the song with session musicians, and released the single, backed by his original composition \\"I Get So Tired\\", on Skylark Records. It became an immense regional success, bubbled under the Billboard Hot 100 at 102, and established Fats as an in- demand touring musician. Skylark also distributed Fats' follow-up effort, \\"Mama, Mama Talk to Your Daughter for Me\\"; however, despite its popularity, it was the last recording by Fats issued for five years. Fats recorded more singles in the late-1960s, including \\"My Baby Didn't Come Home\\", \\"The Birds and the Bees\\", and \\"Long Cool Summertime\\", none of which, however, managed to replicate the success Fats had with \\"Tore Up\\" or \\"Mama, Mama Talk to Your Daughter for Me\\". Regardless of his commercial flops, Fats thrived as a guest musician for acts such as Sam Cooke, Lou Rawls, Bobby Darin, Tina Turner, and Etta James, among others. By the mid-1970s, Fats significantly lessened the extent of his touring to California after accepting a position with Clorox. Through Blind Joe Hill, Fats met Bernie Pearl, an electric blues guitarist who led a house band at the Ash Grove, in the early-1980s, and, although the two did not initially strike a partnership, by 1986 Fats became a permanent member of Pearl's group. In 1989, Fats and Pearl released the live album Live at Cafe Lido, which captured Fats' on-stage enthusiasm and magnetism. The demand for the album prompted the two to establish Bee Bump Records and release their first studio album, titled I Had to Get Nasty, in May 1991. Per Pearl's suggestion, the duo recorded acoustically on their final two albums, Two Heads Are Better and Blow, Fat Daddy, Blow!. Fats died on January 3, 2000; he was 72 years-old.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2014. In 1977 it had been listed as a contributing property in the Motor Townsite. with History John Thompson, James Crosby, and J.P. Dickinson formed a partnership to establish a town, a mill, and other business ventures along the Turkey River at a place known as Hastings Bottom. The new town was named Motor. They spent $50,000 constructing the mill and $40,000 on equipment and other buildings. Stone for these structures was quarried from the bluff above and it was lowered in cable cars that ran on wooden rails. Skilled German stonemasons from nearby Communia were hired to construct the tall, six-story gristmill. Legend has it that there were four of them and each worked on a different wall. Each tried to outdo the others in order to display his own craftsmanship, which is why three walls are composed of rounded stone while the fourth wall was laid with square cut stone. The stone faces on the north side are flat because the investors intended to build a woolen mill there, but they could not find investors to build it. The mill was completed in 1869, and it was operational by the following year. The mill ground barley, oats and rye for livestock feed; wheat and buckwheat into flour; and corn into cornmeal. Barrels were made in the nearby cooperage to ship the flour and corn meal. But the mill couldn't overcome difficulties beyond its control. Chinch bugs destroyed area wheat crops and all the mills in the area competed for fewer raw materials. A narrow-gauge railroad planned to serve the community was washed out, and a flood in 1883 washed out the dam. The mill's investors never recouped what they put into it, and the partnership dissolved. The district court auctioned the property in 1891. Louis Klink bought the townsite in 1903. He sold the mill's machinery and he used the buildings for his farm operation. The property remained in the family for 80 years. The Clayton County Conservation Board acquired the property in 1983 and converted into a park.

She is best known for her abstract paintings and Formica and Plexiglas sculptures. She lives and works in Toronto.  Early life and education  Dault was born to Gary Michael Dault, an art critic, and Margaret Crawford, who is an art teacher. She attended McGill University, Montreal, and received a BA in Art History in 2001. After having worked as an art critic for The National Post and other publications, she attended Parsons, the New School for Design, New York, and received MFA in Fine Arts in 2008.  Work  Sculpture Dault has been making sculptures that are all called Untitled with a number since she made Untitled No.1 in 2008 for her thesis show for Parsons. Untitled sculptures are made with industrial materials, such as Formica and Plexiglas, and they are built without glue or screws. Sculptures are fabricated strictly on site without any pretreatment of materials. Each of them is also titled with a date and time stamp to reflect the amount of time it took for Dault to construct the sculpture. The stamp also reflects new iteration in case of reinstallation. Painting The use of various hand tools and the idea of removal is fundamental in Dault's paintings. She often paints layers of patterns and then scrapes the top monochrome layer to reveal the patterns underneath. Scraping is done with unique tools, such as door handles, combs created from a sheet of rubber, and plaster tools for home decoration.  Exhibitions  Dault has had solo exhibitions internationally at Contemporary Art Gallery, Vancouver, Canada (2015); Marianne Boesky Gallery, New York (2015); China Art Objects Galleries, Los Angeles, CA (2014); Galerie Bob van Orsouw Zurich, Switzerland (2013); White Cube Bermondsey, London, UK (2012).

A large number of her paintings may be found at the , where a retrospective was held in 2008.  Biography  She was born to a Jewish wine and hops merchant who had been converted to Protestantism. Anna herself became a convert to Catholicism at an early age. In 1900, she went to the artists' colony in Dachau, where she became a pupil at the private school of Hans von Hayek. After that, she studied at a private school in Karlsruhe and completed her basic studies at the Damenakademie in Munich, operated by the , an association of women artists, where her instructors were Max Feldbauer and Julius Diez. In 1906, she went to the Netherlands to work a bit more with Hayek. Two years later, she participated in an anatomy course taught by Franz Marc. One of the few photographs of her was taken at that time, with Marc and his future wife . In 1910, she graduated from the Königliche Kunstgewerbeschule München. For a time, she worked as a private drawing teacher in Munich then, together with her friend, Elisabeth Troll, established her own school. In 1919, 1920 and 1922, she participated in exhibitions at the Glaspalast. A major solo exhibition was held in Berlin in 1927. In 1933, following the Nazi seizure of power, she was forced to close the school. Despite having suffered from rheumatism for many years, she was assigned to work in a mattress factory. As a Jew, she was not allowed to use public transportation, so she had to walk from her home on the west side of the city to Haidhausen and back every day.

Thirty-two of the Tombs of the Nobles at Aswan were uncovered in her excavations and for many years were known as the \\"Cecil Tombs\\". She was one of the few English women to have held a peerage in her own right. The black crowned crane, balearica pavonia ceciliae was named in her honour. Early life Mary Rothes Margaret Tyssen-Amherst, known as \\"May\\" to her family, was born on 25 April 1857 in Didlington Hall near Swaffham in west Norfolk, England to Margaret Susan (née Mitford) and William Amhurst Tyssen-Amhurst (1835–1909) (which was changed to the surname Tyssen-Amherst in 1877). Descending of wealthy Flemish traders, the Tyssen family acquired estates in Hackney and Norfolk, leading to a wide circle of friends and monetary influence. Her father, was a collector of books and antique artefacts, with a strong interest in Egyptian antiquities. He had large collections of books and manuscripts, many on the history of bookbinding and printing, and his collection of artefacts was at one time the third largest in England. May's mother was known for her wood carving skill, with her handiworks adorning Didlington Hall, as well as her needle skills, as an amateur surgeon. Her maternal grandfather, Admiral Robert Mitford, besides serving in the Royal Navy, was a naturalist who had studied engraving techniques and illustrated birds. As did her six younger sisters, May studied at home, learning painting, music and domestic arts, as well as horsemanship. The sisters were also taught the importance of childhood education, caring for the poor and sick and the need to tend to building institutions which fostered the health and welfare of society. From a young age, she was interested in the collections on Egypt, spending hours in the museum which her father had built in one wing of the house. In 1871, her parents took her with them on her first trip to the country, which was just opening up to tourism. They travelled in the private car of Ottoman Khedive, Isma'il Pasha, rather than by rail and stayed in Shepheard's Hotel, making excursions to the pyramids, Saqqara, and Suez. May sketched birds, rode on donkeys and ponies, and, in addition to touring and camping, attended a performance of Aida at the Khedivial Opera House and roamed the gardens and rooms of Inji Hanimefendi's palace. In 1891, Howard Carter and his father Samuel visited Didlington Hall to study the artefacts at the estate's museum. The two were known for their illustrations and drawings and were acquaintances of the family. Lady Margaret, who was impressed by young Howard's talent, assisted in arranging an apprenticeship for him from the Egypt Exploration Fund, as a tracer of drawings and inscriptions. =Peerage= In 1892, May's father, who by then had served several terms as member of the House of Commons became the 1st Baron Amherst of Hackney. As he had no male heirs, a special remainder granted that May (now known as Lady William Cecil) would succeed him as the 2nd Baron (i.e. Baroness) to pass the title on to her male heirs. In 1909, when her father died suddenly, Lady William Cecil succeeded him suo jure under the special remainder previously attained, as the 2nd Baron(ess) Amherst of Hackney, but his residual estate had been reduced to £341, as most of his personal collections and estate had been sold to pay off debt, when he was defrauded by his solicitor. Career =Archaeology and Cecil Tombs= Despite that it was unusual for women to participate in archaeology at the time, in 1901, encouraged by Howard Carter, Lady William Cecil began excavations at Qubbet el-Hawa near Aswan. Her family was wintering in the area and while exploring on the west bank of the Nile had discovered what she thought might be an ancient cemetery. Carter, who in 1899 had been appointed by the Antiquities Service as one of two European Chief Inspectors and in charge of excavations in the Nile Valley south from Qus to the Sudanese border, came to see the find the following day. He arranged for permits to excavate and provided an inspector and workers to assist in the dig. She kept a diary of the details of the expedition in which multiple tombs were found, as well as wooden anthropoid coffins of the Saite Era. Though the entire necropolis was infested with termites, Tomb 21 yielded two burial boxes. The male's coffin disintegrated when it was touched, but the female's coffin remained intact and was removed. The exterior was painted in yellow and devoid of any inscription. The mummy was covered with a blue network of beading. A coarse blue glaze was used on the winged scarabs and Amenti gods depicted on the canopic jars. The sole adornment of the mummy was a one inch by half inch opaque green stone. Lady William's diary recorded that the names found in the tomb were Bao-bao, daughter of Pawebas and Shepentanefet and her brother Waher. She also reported remnants of a former burial, which may have been the tomb of Shepentanefret. In all, Lady William Cecil uncovered thirty- two tombs at the site which became known as the \\"Cecil Tombs\\", and were later called the Tombs of the Nobles or Qubbet el-Hawa. Her discovery of the tomb of Heqata was described as a small chamber, with two earthenware pots and containing a square coffin upon which were a bow and some arrow tips, as well as three walking sticks. Inside the coffin, on a trellis-shaped frame filled with grids of dirt, lay the mummy of Heqata. The mummy was full of weevils, but was encased in seven layers of finely woven cloth. Though there were no artefacts found with the mummy, the exterior wrapping was painted white about the face with a painted necklace. In many of the tombs, Lady William reported that they appeared to be re-used, and her finds suggest the artefacts came from a diverse range of dynasties. The excavations proved successful and though Carter took \\"some of the best things\\", both he and Gaston Maspero were pleased with the endeavour. =Author= Returning home, Lady William Cecil published her findings \\"Report on the Work Done at Aswan\\" in the Annales du Service des Antiquités de l'Égypte in 1903. In December, 1903, Lord and Lady William Cecil attended Princess Henry of Battenburg to return to Egypt, having been members of her household for many years. Her second season was not as productive and her work was overshadowed by a discovery made on Elephantine Island of a papyrus engagement contract. The document, in Aramaic script, contained important descriptions of the fortress and city of Aswan in the era of Artaxerxes I and Darius II and Lady William worked diligently with Howard Carter and others to try to get it published. In 1904, she published Bird Notes from the Nile, which she offered for sale to benefit the parish church of St Mary's Church in Scarborough, North Yorkshire. The book inspired the black crowned crane, balearica pavonia ceciliae to be named in her honour. Other charitable works Lady William supported included the Children's Invalid Aid Fund; London's Queen's Hospital for Children, for which she was one of only two women directors; and the ambulance and hospital works of the Order of Saint John of Jerusalem, for which she also served as a Lady Justice. Lady William and her husband spent the next several years travelling, visiting Australia in 1905. =Lady-in-waiting= In 1906, they were in Madrid, where Lady William served as the only English lady-in-waiting attending Victoria Eugenie of Battenberg, Princess Henry's daughter, when she became Spanish queen. That same year at the request of the Empress Dowager Cixi, Lord and Lady William Cecil went with an English committee to help organise schools for Chinese girls. They returned with Princess Henry and her entourage to Spain the following year, as well. =World War I= During World War I, Lady Amherst participated in projects to raise funds for various war works, including an exhibition of her own paintings of Egyptian scenes at the Dudley Galleries and a fundraiser at the Royal School of Needlework. Her son and heir, The Hon. Captain William Amherst Cecil was killed at the Battle of the Aisne on 16 September 1914. She was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1919 for her charitable works with several governmental offices dealing with sanitation and health. Personal life On 2 September 1885, May married Colonel Lord William Cecil (1854–1943), son of the 3rd Marquess of Exeter. The couple had four sons: *William Cecil (1886–1914), who was killed at the Battle of the Aisne on 16 September 1914. He is buried at Soupir Communal Cemetery. *Thomas James Cecil (1887–1955) *John Francis Amherst Cecil (1890–1954), who married Cornelia Vanderbilt, daughter of George Washington Vanderbilt II, and had issue, including William Amherst Vanderbilt Cecil *Henry Mitford Cecil (1893–1962) =Death and legacy= Barely a month after her own mother died, Lady Amherst died on 20 December 1919 in London. The coffin of Bao-bao was sold upon her death via a sale organised by Sotheby's in June 1921 to Albert M. Todd. In 1932, Todd presented the piece to the Kalamazoo Public Museum. The Sotheby's sale was described as \\"the most important sale of Egyptian antiquities ever held in England\\" to that point in time and included 917 lots of Egyptian artefacts and 47 lots of cuneiform tablets and other objects. Lady Amherst's journal on her first trip to Egypt is part of the records kept in Biltmore House in Asheville, North Carolina. Her notes and letters have been useful references for other archaeologists in tracking provenance of objects which were part of the family collections and because the tombs she inspected have not fully been subsequently explored.

U.S. House of Representatives  Krishnamoorthi was sworn into office on January 3, 2017, stating, \\"I will continue to focus on the middle class and our commitment to ensure that hard work is rewarded.\\" While Krishnamoorthi attended President Donald Trump's January 2017 inauguration, he said he did so in part \\"because I want President Trump to look at the crowd and Congress and see on day one that he will be strongly opposed if he continues to pursue policies that hurt working families.\\" The day before the inauguration, Krishnamoorthi was included in a list featured in The Guardian of \\"up-and-coming leaders of the Trump resistance in Washington.\\" The day after the inauguration, Krishnamoorthi told a crowd of more than 250,000 at the Chicago Women's March, \\"Today's march was about people from every walk of life coming together to declare their support for the rights of women and all Americans. Women's rights are human rights. A loud chorus of voices including mine will speak up for the rights of women and all Americans to make a better life in this country.\\" Later that week, Krishnamoorthi delivered a speech on the House floor in opposition to a Trump administration decision to block an Obama administration policy that would have reduced mortgage costs for lower and middle-income families by hundreds of dollars per year. Krishnamoorthi closed his remarks by referencing Trump's campaign slogan, saying, \\"the Trump administration's order to make mortgages more expensive will not strengthen our economy. It will not create jobs. And it will not make America great again. But it will make life harder for working families.\\" = Job training and workforce development = In June 2017, the House unanimously passed the Thompson-Krishnamoorthi Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act, which would overhaul the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act and provide more flexibility to states. In November 2017, Krishnamoorthi and GT Thompson co-led a letter to the Senate education committee with 235 fellow members of the House urging them to take up the legislation. = Defense of state and local tax (SALT) deduction = During the tax reform debate in Congress, Krishnamoorthi spoke out numerous times against the proposed elimination of the state and local tax (SALT) deduction and its impact on working families in Illinois. In October 2017, he sent two letters about the proposed deduction, one to Illinois Governor Bruce Rauner alongside fellow Illinois members Foster and Luis Gutierrez and one to the Chair and Ranking Member of the Ways and Means Committee, urging them to preserve the deduction. = Environmental issues and green technology = The first piece of legislation Krishnamoorthi introduced as a member of Congress was H. Res. 85, a resolution expressing the commitment of the House of Representatives to continue to support U.S. pledges made in the Paris Climate Agreement. In introducing the resolution, Krishnamoorthi cited rising global temperatures and the need for the U.S. to address both the threats posed to the country and the economic potential of green technology. = Health care = During a January 2017 floor debate in the House of Representatives, Krishnamoorthi argued against repealing the Affordable Care Act. Citing his experience running small businesses, Krishnamoorthi said, \\"repealing without replacing the Affordable Care Act would devastate our economy and harm millions of middle-class families. Within the 8th district of Illinois, we could lose upwards of over $550 million from our economy and over 4,000 jobs. I know firsthand how important health coverage is to workers and to business. Without the protections of the Affordable Care Act, we will see fewer entrepreneurs take the risk of starting a business and fewer workers take the risk of working for a start-up.\\" In September 2017, Krishnamoorthi co-led a letter to the Department of Health and Human Services with Oversight and Government Reform Committee Ranking Member Elijah Cummings requesting documents and information related to the decision to schedule outages of HealthCare.gov during the 2017 open enrollment period. = Presidential pardons = In July 2017, Krishnamoorthi introduced the Presidential Pardon Transparency Act, which would require that all presidential pardons be disclosed to the public within three days of being granted. The legislation followed reports that Trump was consulting senior aides and the White House counsel about his ability to pardon associates, family members, and himself. = Trump administration security clearance issues = In October 2017, Krishnamoorthi questioned the director of the National Background Investigations Bureau about the number of mistakes made in Senior Presidential Advisor Jared Kushner's security clearance during a hearing by the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. In response to repeated questioning about whether he could recall \\"if there has ever been an applicant having to submit four addenda detailing over 100 errors and omissions being able to maintain their security clearance once those errors have been identified,\\" Director Phalen said that he had never seen that level of mistakes. = Immigration and Trump administration's travel ban = On January 28, 2017, Trump's executive order placing restrictions on people entering the U.S. from seven Muslim-majority countries caused 18 travelers arriving at O'Hare International Airport to be detained and questioned by federal officers, including a family of legal permanent residents and their 18-month- old baby, who held U.S. citizenship. Krishnamoorthi arrived at O'Hare within hours to speak to immigration officials but was told they were unavailable. While joining a protest at the airport Krishnamoorthi said of the detentions, \\"They applied legally, they've been vetted and they've been here, in many cases, for decades, and they were detained by their own country at the airport. So many of our businesses rely on green card holders. How are we supposed to attract these people if they think they'll be detained at the airport if they go abroad for a wedding, or just to show their baby to relatives?\\" In a WGN radio interview the next morning, Krishnamoorthi denounced Trump's immigration initiative, calling it the \\"worst executive order you could draw up to unify the country.\\" On November 16, Krishnamoorthi co-led a letter to the Department of Homeland Security, alongside Democratic Caucus Chairman Joe Crowley, Luis Gutierrez of Illinois, Adriano Espaillat of New York, and 60 Democratic cosigners, about the postal services delays that caused hundreds of DACA renewal applications to arrive after the October 5 deadline. The Department later reversed its position and announced that it would allow those affected to resend their applications. = Accountability in federal contracting = In his capacity as a member of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, Krishnamoorthi has raised concerns over the Whitefish Energy contract with the Puerto Rican government to rebuild the island's electrical grid and the no-audit clauses in its contract. In October, Krishnamoorthi wrote to the Chair and Ranking Member of the Oversight and Government Reform urging them to convene hearings on the contract and the full scope of anti-auditing language in all government contracts. =Armenia–Azerbaijan conflict= In October 2020, Krishnamoorthi co-signed a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo condemning Azerbaijan’s offensive operations against the Armenian-populated enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh. =Committee assignments= *Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence Subcommittee on Intelligence Modernization and Readiness (INMAR) Subcommittee on Strategic Technologies and Advanced Research (STAR) *Committee on Oversight and Government Reform Subcommittee on Economic and Consumer Policy, Chair Subcommittee on the Environment Source: =Caucus memberships= *New Democrat Coalition *Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus *Congressional Solar Caucus Electoral history Personal life Krishnamoorthi's wife, Priya, is a doctor.

Combining elements of historical and supernatural fiction and drawing on a range of writing styles, the author describes it as a work of \\"genetic mythology\\". Published in 2016, Jerusalem took a decade to write. The novel is divided into three Books, \\"The Boroughs\\", \\"Mansoul\\", and \\"Vernall's Inquest\\".  Overview  The story develops over centuries, set in the Boroughs, the most ancient neighbourhood in Northampton. The colophon states that the book is based on a true story; it concerns a large collection of characters: some mythical, some fictional, and some historical. Along with his family's oral traditions, life experience, and ideas (such as eternalism) that he had explored in other writings, Moore's research sources included a collection of interviews entitled “In Living Memory — Life in ‘The Boroughs,’” published by the Northampton Arts Development in 1987, as well as old Kelly's directories. A key narrative arc culminates in 2006 with an exhibit of paintings by one of the characters, Alma Warren, who is indicated by the author portrait and its caption, present on the book's jacket, to be a stand-in for Moore. Several events in the story are retold with different characters as the focaliser, with the writing style adapted to the focal character's inner voice, in a way that unites otherwise disconnected narrative threads. The book includes chapters in the style of Samuel Beckett, James Joyce, as well as a chapter written in verse, while the entire second Book is somewhat in the style of a children's novel (a \\"savage, hallucinating Enid Blyton,\\" according to Moore in a 2008 interview with the BBC). The novel's title is a reference to And did those feet in ancient time by William Blake, which was set to music and given the title \\"Jerusalem\\" by Hubert Parry. Prominent themes include \\"poverty, wealth, history, the evolution of English as a visionary language\\" as well as \\"madness, ghosts, and the confusion of dreams, visions, memories, and premonitions.\\" After the death of Moore's editor Steve Moore (no relation), he worked with three editors on the book, Donna Scott, author of Best of British Science Fiction 2016, writer and cultural Historian John Higgs and writer Alistair Fruish. In the acknowledgements section of the book, Moore credits Fruish with supplying information that allowed him to reveal \\"the gas street origins of free market capitalism and the industrial revolution\\" in the book.  Editions  The UK and US editions differ: the Knockabout edition is 1,180 pages long and is set in a small point size, whereas the Liveright edition is set in a larger point size and consequently is 1,266 pages long, and features a different author photo on the jacket. Alongside the one-volume hardcover first edition, Jerusalem was simultaneously released in a 3-volume slipcased paperback edition, and as an unabridged audio book narrated by Simon Vance, published by Recorded Books, Inc.http://www.recordedbooks.com/title-details/9781501931697 The front cover (or, respectively, the slipcover for the 3-volume paperback edition) depicts several key scenes and characters from the novel in the form of a diorama. Each of the three Books begins with an epigram and photographic illustration (comprising cover illustrations for the slipcased volumes).

The popularity of its heroine continued long after the book was published, with some writers publishing accounts of Fanny Campbell as if she were real.  Plot Fanny Campbell, the protagonist, is a young woman who lives in Lynn, Massachusetts in the 1770s. She has a childhood sweetheart named William Lovell, who becomes a sailor. After his first voyage, Lovell asks Campbell to marry him. She says yes and will marry Lovell when he returns from his second voyage. In 1775, just before the American Revolution, William and 10 other Americans are seized and put in irons by the captain and crew of the British ship the Constance, which sets sail for Cuba. Fanny decides to rescue her fiancé by dressing as a man, calling herself Channing, and signs on as a deckhand on the Constance. On board the ship, rumors begin to circulate that the captain's going to take the entire crew to England and force them to join the British Navy. Fomenting a mutiny, Campbell helps spread these rumors and then takes command of the Constance, turns the ship and its crew into pirates, and continues onto Cuba. After she's freed her fiancée and the other prisoners, Campbell asks Lovell to promise not to reveal that she's actually a woman. On the way to Cuba, they encounter the British barque the George, whose captain senses something is amiss and orders his crew to open fire. Despite the superior firepower of the George, Campbell and her crew manage to win the battle, capturing the enemy ship and taking it along with them. The two ships stop briefly in Cuba, then capture another British sloop whose crew informs her that Great Britain and the American colonies are at war. The crews of both ships, except for 4 men, decide to join the Americans and become privateers, fighting against the British. Eventually the Constance and the George sail back to Massachusetts, landing at Marblehead because British troops have occupied Boston. Fanny Campbell and William Lovell travel back home to Lynn. They marry and have papers drawn up that commission them as privateers. William returns to sea to privateer throughout the Revolutionary War, but Fanny stays home to take care of their children. She continues however to shoot, ride and practice her sailing, keeping her cutlass in the closet of their home.Maturin Murray Ballou, \\"Fanny Campbell, The Female Pirate Captain: A Tale of The Revolution\\", E.D.

Her > features were after the Grecian school, with a coral lip that would have > melted an anchorite. Where Fanny got those eyes from, heaven only knows, > they rivaled a Circassian's. Nature seems to have delighted her with every > gift it might bestow. Her teeth were regular and white as pearls, and her > hair was a very dark auburn, worn parted smoothly across her brow, and > gathered in a modest snood behind her head, while it was easy to see by its > texture that if left to itself, it would have curled naturally.

The first one went on the air October 8, 1933; the third one's last broadcast was June 26, 1938. The name applied to all three apparently was derived from Fleischmann's Yeast, which sponsored all three programs. Format =1933–1935= Run dates: October 8, 1933 – June 30, 1935 Joe Penner starred in this version, along with Ozzie Nelson and Ozzie's future wife, Harriet Hilliard. Penner's role led to the program's having an alternate unofficial title, The Joe Penner Show. Hal Erickson, in his book, From Radio to the Big Screen: Hollywood Films Featuring Broadcast Personalities and Programs, wrote, \\"Though bearing the name The Baker's Broadcast when it debuted over NBC-Blue on October 8, 1933, it was The Joe Penner Show all the way so far as the public was concerned.\\" Ozzie Nelson led the orchestra for the program, and Harriet was the singer. The Penner-Nelsons combination ended when Penner \\"abruptly exited The Baker's Broadcast, upset over the sponsor's refusal to freshen up the writing and alter the format.\\" Kliph Nesteroff, in his book, The Comedians: Drunks, Thieves, Scoundrels, and the History of American Comedy, wrote about Penner's version of the show, \\"The style of his program was juvenile but undeniably popular ....\\" Among the contributions this program made was bringing to a national audience Mel Blanc, the virtuoso of voices who later had his own program and was featured on other old-time radio programs. Ben Grauer was the announcer, and Hal Raynor was a writer for the program. =1935–1937= Run dates: October 6, 1935 – June 27, 1937 The Nelsons, who were married two days after this version began, continued as co-stars, with Penner replaced by Robert Ripley. Ripley's role led to the use of the alternate unofficial title Believe It or Not (which was used for other radio programs that featured Ripley). Neal Thompson, in his book, A Curious Man: The Strange & Brilliant Life of Robert \\"Believe it Or Not\\" Ripley, called the Ripley version of The Baker's Broadcast \\"one of America's favorite shows, in league with the top-ranked shows of Jack Benny and Bing Crosby.\\" John Dunning in his reference work, On the Air: The Encyclopedia of Old-Time Radio, wrote that the Nelsons \\"were young and attractive, and their music — lighthearted and melodious — was what America wanted in the Depression. Ben Grauer continued as the program's announcer. =1937–1938= Run Dates: October 3, 1937 – June 26, 1938. For its final series, The Baker's Broadcast not only changed hosts but moved from New York City to Hollywood. Former athlete and comics artist Feg Murray became the new host, while the Nelsons continued to provide music. Dunning wrote: \\"Feg Murray hosted and Ozzie helped with interviews. This never generated much excitement: it failed after a single season.\\" Once again, Grauer was the announcer.

It is native to Curaçao and Aruba of the Netherlands Antilles, but has also been introduced to Klein Curaçao. It is generally common (at least on Curaçao), and is particularly common in densely vegetated gardens in the capital Willemstad. It is found in dry tropical shrubland at all elevations in its range, but is uncommon in habitats without larger trees. It can often be seen on rocks, the walls of buildings or tree trunks; at various heights but often relatively close to the ground. It is a member of the A. chrysolepis species group. In A. lineatus, males reach about in snout-to-vent length and the females about . It is overall light brownish with a dark-edged pale lateral stripe on each side, and typically several light bars on the body and tail. It has an orange-yellow dewlap with a blackish spot; the dewlap is significantly larger in males than in females. It is the only known species of anole where the dewlap is asymmetrically coloured, being deeper orange on one side and yellower on the other. In almost three-quarter of all individuals the left side is the most yellow. The colour difference between the two sides is indistinct in only a minority of the females.

His major themes are his indigenous Samoan heritage and his fa'afafine gender identity. McMullin has been creating literary and artistic works for over 35 years, and has received numerous awards, fellowships, and grants. He works in a variety of literary styles and visual art modes. In his adult life, he has spent time in Los Angeles (where he worked for many years), and now live with his partner in Laguna, California, and Hudson, New York. Childhood and education McMullin was born in Japan into a military family, and spent his toddler years in Germany, before moving to American Samoa as a young child where he was raised on Tutuila Island in the villages of Maleola and Leone. }} He is of Samoan and Jewish-Irish descent. His childhood home on Samoa has been described as \\"a traditional Samoan fale roundhouse with coral stone flooring and sugarcane thatching, brought up making indigenous siapo barkcloth painting by his great- grandmother Fa'asapa.\\" He received his MFA from Claremont Graduate University and his BA from University of California, Irvine. He spent much of his professional career in television, film, and theater, before leaving those industries to focus on poetry and his own art. He has taught both poetry and painting at the University of the South Pacific, for the California Arts Council, for the American Samoa Arts Council and the American Samoan Humanities Council. Gender and heritage McMullin's indigenous heritage and queer identity are central to his artistic work, as both themes and sources of inspiration. In a 2013 interview, when asked which non-artist most influences his work, he replied: \\"My old man, my boyfriend, usually in bed after yadda yadda, looking out the windows at the hills of Laguna, California where we are. It's moments like that I'm back in Samoa again, my soul is; and ideas come easily, like mangoes hitting a tin roof in the rain.\\" McMullin identifies as fa'afafine, a Samoan third gender for which there is no exact English translation, but which is often described as a man who lives as a woman. McMullin generally uses male pronouns, including on his own website. Describing fa'afafine in an artist statement introducing his poetry and photography for the USC Cinema journal Spectator, McMullin writes: McMullin, in an artist's statement in June 2016, said \\"Often, not always, but often my work looks at sexuality and the body. The body as memory, a key to our historical presences, to my own story and my oratory. There is a great cleft and an eternal return to the past, but the past is only a way to continue the journey into the future. A looking back as a way of setting the sale toward whatever my own indigenous futurism defines.\\" McMullin has written personal narratives reflecting on both his gender and indigenous identity. In a 2011 essay for the Amerasia Journal he explores what it means to be Fa'afafine, both from a personal and historical context.McMullin, Dan Taulapapa. Fa'afafine Notes: On Tagaloa, Jesus, and Nafanua. Amerasia Journal 37:3 (2011). Accessed online Oct 11 2016 at https://www.academia.edu/2919623/_Faafafine_Notes_poetic_essay_Published_in_Amerasia_Journal_Transoceanic_Flows_Volume_37_Issue_3_Editor_Keith_Camacho_2011_ In an essay for The Poetry Foundation blog, McMullin says \\"Identity is not something we claim, it is something that claims us.\\" Creative works =Writing= McMullin's poetry and essays have been primarily published in anthologies focused on LGBTQ or Pacific Island indigenous literature. McMullin's first full-length poetry collection, Coconut Milk (2013) was named in the American Library Association's Over the Rainbow top-ten overall category. McMullin's more experimental poetry, such as his poetry published in Poetry Magazine in 2016, often blends the boundaries between poetry, visual poetry, and visual art. For instance, his poem \\"The Doors of the Sea\\": Before the publication of Coconut Milk, McMullin had already been widely published, and his solo collections included a poetry chapbook, A Drag Queen Named Pipi (2004) from Tinfish Press and a children's book My Name is Laloifi (2005). =Visual art= McMullin began making visual art around 2004 while living in Apia Samoa. Around 2011 or slightly earlier, he began to explore the concept of the cultural appropriation of Samoan art and culture, or Tiki Kitsch as it is sometimes called. Much of his work since that time has been influenced by this shift.Pacific Arts Association. Featured Artist: Dan Taulapapa McMullin, Tufuga Valiata, Notes on Painting. PAA Website. Accessed Oct 11 2016 http://www.pacificarts.org/Blog_dan_mcmullin In a 2012 artist statement McMullin writes: In addition to painting, McMullin also does a significant amount of work in sculpture, collage, installation and photography. McMullin's work has been featured in over a dozen solo exhibits – including installations at the American Museum of Natural History in New York (2016) and at the De Young Museum in San Francisco (2010) – and in over 50 group exhibitions across the United States. In a 2010 interview as artist in residence at de Young, McMullin discussed the physical make up of his works, as well as how the many media in which he works organically influence each other: =Film= Of McMullin's three short films Sinaela has received the most acclaim, and has been shown at film festivals internationally including Australia and New Zealand. It was filmed on a hand held camera in American Samoa, and draws on the fairy tale Cinderella as well as a Samoan proverbial tale (a fa'agogo). Since Sinaela, McMullin also made the films ULA: The Garland which was shown in 2011 in New Zealand at the Pacific Art Summit as a work in progress, and 100 Tikis, a short film on the theme of cultural appropriation.

He is a regular producer at the annual Edinburgh Fringe Festival and responsible for several of its most notable productions including Twelve Angry Men in 2003, The Odd Couple in 2005 and Morecambe in 2009 – which transferred to London's West End and won a Laurence Olivier Award for Best Entertainment.  Personal life  Masterson was born in Hampstead, North London, to Carlo Libinick Mastroianni and Marian Mastroianni (née James). He attended Hadley Wood Primary School, Christ's Hospital School, Horsham. He then went on to Cardiff University where he obtained a Joint honours degree in Biochemistry and Chemistry. After graduating in 1982, he emigrated to Los Angeles, California where he took his first salaried job in Hotel & Restaurant Management with Hilton Hotels where he served, among other celebrities, O. J. Simpson and Nicole Brown Simpson and André the Giant. He returned to the UK in 1989 and continued his professional career after studying for a year at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art (LAMDA). In October 1998 his met Brigitta Scholz, a German actress/model living in Paris and they married in January 1999. Their first child, Indigo Scholz-Mastroianni, was born in September 1999. Their second child, Tallulah Scholz-Mastroianni, was born in June 2005. The family resides in London.  Professional life  In 1984, his great uncle, the actor Richard Burton, died and Masterson (then Mastroianni) was persuaded to attend an acting class. He enrolled at UCLA's Extension Drama Programme for two semesters before auditioning and winning his first leading role in the Equity Waiver musical The Wonderful World of Waiver! His first professional job was understudying the roles of both Mick and Aston in The Caretaker at the LA Theatre Center. After performing in a number of plays in Los Angeles including The Elephant Man by Bernard Pomerance, The Yorkshire Tragedy a disputed Shakespeare), City Gents by Ron Hart The Private Ear & The Public Eye by Peter Shaffer he returned to London to study at LAMDA – The London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art – on the Postgraduate Course, graduating in 1990. After a number of collapsed projects, he self-produced his first solo work – The Boy's Own Story by Peter Flannery in 1991, and toured to various schools and other small arts venues around the UK including the Chelsea Centre Theatre where he was seen by a major casting director who cast him in Cyrano de Bergerac with Robert Lindsay and Julian Glover. This played at the Theatre Royal, Haymarket in London's West End for nine months, during which Masterson committed Under Milk Wood by Dylan Thomas to memory for his 2nd solo performance. Under Milk Wood officially premiered at The Traverse Theatre in Edinburgh in February 1994 and was such a critical success that he was invited to present the show at the Assembly Rooms during the 1994 Edinburgh Fringe Festival. During this period, he also directed a one-man show about the life of his great-uncle Richard Burton – Playing Burton by Mark Jenkins (playwright) starring the Welsh actor Josh Richards which also garnered much critical acclaim. Both Under Milk Wood and Playing Burton achieved great success at the 1994 Edinburgh Fringe, that they were invited to play at the Riverside Studios, and from there, both shows toured around the UK for several years. The success of his solo Under Milk Wood led to his adapting another great British classic for solo performance – Animal Farm, by George Orwell, which premiered at the Traverse Theatre on Burns Night (25 January) 1995 and thence at the Assembly Rooms at the 1995 Edinburgh Fringe Festival, where the entire run sold out prior to its opening performance. Both Animal Farm and Under Milk Wood toured extensively domestically and internationally for several years including major tours all over India (1996) and New Zealand (1997). In 1996, Masterson directed a production of The House of Correction by Norman Lock for the Edinburgh Fringe and presented it at the Pleasance where it received a Stage Award for Best Actress* for Beth Fitzgerald. In 1997, Masterson presented a Kiwi production The Ballad of Jimmy Costello with Tim Balme at the Assembly Rooms where he also presented Playing Burton, Bye By Blackbird by Willard Simms and Shylock by Gareth Armstrong.

The episode was written by co-executive producer Robert Hull and directed by Eagle Egilsson. It was first broadcast on October 10, 2016. In the episode, Gordon is now looking for Jervis Tetch, planning on using his sister, Alice, to find him. Bruce and Alfred go after Five, who is now impersonating him and is with Selina. The mayoral race day arrives and Cobblepot is ready to win the public's vote but Nygma discovers how he got there. The episode received positive reviews, with critics praising the political storyline and Samuel's performance. Plot In the interrogation room, Alice (Naian Gonzalez Norvind) explains to Bullock (Donal Logue) that Tetch (Benedict Samuel) held her captive and after escaping, she fled to Gotham where Hugo Strange locked her up. However, Bullock is adamant in believing her as she killed her landlord. Tetch is revealed to be operating on an abandoned amusement park, planning on using it to bring Alice and then kills the owner as it's a \\"private affair\\". The election day arrives in Gotham and despite Cobblepot's (Robin Lord Taylor) delight, Butch (Drew Powell) and Nygma (Cory Michael Smith) conflict about their involvement. Barnes (Michael Chiklis) has Lee (Morena Baccarin) test Alice's blood to find out her condition. Alice explains to Lee that Tetch is an expert with the mind and those who get affected by him, will die. Gordon is walking on the street when suddenly, the sounds near him show the same rhythm of Tetch's hypnosis and steps on the street to be hit by a truck when he is saved at the last moment by a man. Bruce (David Mazouz) and Alfred (Sean Pertwee) find that the car was towed in the Narrows, deducing that Five is with Selina (Camren Bicondova). Selina leaves Five for a moment to rob a bar but she is captured and nearly has a finger cut off when Five arrives and uses his strength to take them down. When seeing his scars, she discovers his identity. While stitching his wound, Five kisses her. During one of Cobblepot's press conferences, Nygma notices Butch giving an envelope with money to a campaign official. He checks the envelope and decides to let the man go but Butch tells his men to follow Nygma. Cobblepot knows this but does not want to risk his campaign. When Nygma tricks him with a little girl, Cobblepot tells him to stay out of his campaign. Gordon goes with Barbara (Erin Richards) to find Tetch, discovering he took some wrestlers. Tetch finds the known wrestlers, \\"The Terrible Tweeds\\" and subjects them to his hypnosis. Gordon talks with Alice, who states that the resembling of the ticking will trigger him and that she has been under control of him for years where he put thoughts on her head. Tetch has the Tweed Brothers attack the GCPD, prompting Gordon to escape with Alice. However, Tetch uses his ticking in Gordon to catch Alice and escaping. He is saved of shooting himself by Barnes, who knocks him down. The Young Tweed Brother (Ari Barkan) is arrested and detained at the GCPD. Bruce and Alfred find Five but Five confronts Bruce about not knowing what to want and decides to leave them and Selina forever by jumping from the rooftop and running off in the streets. Gordon wakes up handcuffed in the hospital room, where Lee is watching over him. Gordon confronts her about moving on but she justifies what she did, stating that Mario was always there for her when needed. With two of the brothers dead, the young Tweed brother is interrogated by Bullock who gets him to reveal where Tetch has taken Alice by threatening to destroy his fallen brothers' masks. Bullock frees Gordon and takes him to the amusement park, where Tetch has been injecting Alice to sustain her blood to infect a fountain to create more monsters. Gordon and Bullock arrive but Tetch again uses the ticking to control Gordon. Remembering Lee's words on moving on, Gordon frees himself from the hypnosis and shoots at the two Tweed brothers. Tetch tries to control Alice, but when she attempts to escape, she accidentally falls from the floor and is fatally impaled. Tetch escapes, heartbroken. While waiting the election results, a furious Butch holds Nygma at gunpoint, discovering that he took away the officials' money and the campaign is now ended. Cobblepot decides to have him killed until he finds that he has won the elections and lets him live, seeing that the people really wanted him. He is sworn as mayor and names Nygma his Chief of Staff, to his surprise. Five is intercepted by Kathryn (Leslie Hendrix), who is now planning on using him as Bruce and has him sedated and captured. While inspecting the scene, Barnes is accidentally touched by Alice's blood, causing his eyes and veins to change. Production =Development= On September 2016, it was announced that the fourth episode of the season will be titled \\"New Day Rising\\" and was to be written by co-executive producer Robert Hull and directed by Eagle Egilsson. =Casting= Jessica Lucas, Chris Chalk, and Maggie Geha don't appear in the episode as their respective characters. In September 2016, it was announced that the guest cast for the episode would include Naian Gonzalez Norvind as Alice Tetch, and Leslie Hendrix as Kathryn. Reception =Viewers= The episode was watched by 3.42 million viewers with a 1.1/3 share among adults aged 18 to 49. This was a 7% increase in viewership from the previous episode, which was watched by 3.19 million viewers with a 1.0/3 in the 18-49 demographics. With this rating, Gotham ranked second for FOX, behind Lucifer but beating Lucifer in 18-49 demographics, fourth on its timeslot and eight for the night behind Scorpion, Timeless, Dancing with the Stars, 2 Broke Girls, Kevin Can Wait, The Voice, and The Big Bang Theory. The episode ranked as the 68th most watched show on the week. With Live+7 DVR viewing factored in, the episode had an overall rating of 5.24 million viewers, and a 1.8 in the 18–49 demographic. =Critical reviews= \\"Mad City: New Day Rising\\" received positive reviews from critics. The episode received a rating of 100% with an average score of 8.5 out of 10 on the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes. Matt Fowler of IGN gave the episode a \\"good\\" 7.3 out of 10 and wrote in his verdict, \\"Oswald got fast tracked into the Mayor's office while Bruce's cloneboy made a move on Selina - which then seemed to light a fire under Bruce regarding his feelings for her. It was all somewhat disposable save for the focus on Jim Gordon's underlying self-loathing and how it caused Hatter's suicide trigger to stick with him. That was a really cool way to draw Jim's brokenness out into the open for discussion - and maybe resolution.\\" Erik Kain of Forbes wrote, \\"Another good episode in a slow-burning season. I'm still not a huge fan of New Gordon (nobody seems to be in Gotham either) and I miss some of the Good Cop vs. Corrupt City tension from earlier seasons. In fact, I miss that a lot though I'm not sure how to get it back. I also miss the more buddy- cop focused episodes with Gordon and Harvey taking center stage together. Harvey (and by extension Donal Logue) feels a bit wasted lately.\\" Nick Hogan of TV Overmind gave the series a star rating of 4.0 out of 5, writing \\"That said, the rest of the episode was well-balanced and structured. Even though I was apprehensive about the Bruce Clone saga when it first began, I was satisfied with the way it turned out in the short term. Not to mention I saw it coming a mile away when the cronies behind Wayne Industries turned out to be behind clone Bruce. I always enjoy watching Bruce with Selina, too, if for no other reason than David Mazouz and Camren Bicondova are two of the best young actors on television today.\\" Sage Young of EW stated: \\"Everyone just wants to be wanted. Love is in the air on Gotham, in its best and worst forms. Jim and Lee are struggling to find what comes after it. Penguin seeks out the adoration of the masses. One lonely clone of Bruce Wayne comes to understand that he's missed out on the most bittersweet facet of the human experience. And if Jervis Tetch's love won't be returned willingly, he'll have to force it.\\" Lisa Babick from TV Fanatic, gave a perfect 5 star rating out of 5.0, stating: \\"Wow. Just wow. There was so much that happened on Gotham Season 3 Episode 4, I'm not even sure where to begin. It's going to be interesting to see how this story plays out. Bruce better hurry and grow up, because if the Court of Owls have their way, Bruce's days are numbered.\\" Vinnie Mancuso of New York Observer wrote, \\"Listen, I'm not here to heavily analyze the fact Gotham – a Batman prequel that once devoted an entire episode to balloon- themed murder – is pulling off a surprisingly deep (and oddly tender) look at modern day America, and a person running for office not because he wants to serve but because he's an applause-fueled carnival barker that feels 'wanted' for the first time, but... well here we are. Sometimes you have to tip your hat, even when it's mad.\\" MaryAnn Sleasman of TV.com wrote, \\"'New Day Rising' also gave us a truce on the Jim/Lee/Mario love triangle front and a surprisingly sweet resolution to the Bruce/Fake Bruce/Selina drama. They are far from over, given that we've barely scratched the surface of Mario's (James Carpinello) mob connections and Fake Bruce was conveniently picked up by Bruce's nemesis on the board of directors/secret Court of Owls loony, to most likely be programmed in whatever crime against humanity popped up to replace Indian Hill.\\" Kayti Burt of Den of Geek gave the episode a 3 star rating out of 5 and wrote, \\"'New Day Rising' brought a tragic conclusion to the current Mad Hatter/Alice arc, let us get to know Doppel-Bruce just a little bit more, and elected a new mayor of Gotham.

The film stars Paul Rudd, Patton Oswalt, Hannibal Buress, Kate Micucci, Riki Lindhome, John Ennis and Mike Judge. The film received a one night only special screening on December 6, 2016, before being released on video on demand by Samuel Goldwyn Films on January 6, 2017, and on DVD and Blu-ray on February 7, 2017 by Sony Pictures Home Entertainment. Plot The story of two best friends, aspiring screenwriter Elliot (Patton Oswalt), and aspiring actor John (Paul Rudd), who was kicked out of acting school, whose dreams of super-stardom have fizzled and have been fired from every job they've ever done. After John's disastrous interview with celebrity Brett Anderson (Reid Scott), he and Elliot make a pact to become famous before their 30th birthday in 24 hours. In their first attempt they get beaten up by a homeless man named Archie (Mike Judge) after trying to get a check back from him when they found out the camera only filmed their feet and in their second attempt they get rescued from a fire, Elliot by an old woman. After an interview is denied, John concludes that it's not fame they want; its infamy. Elliot and John attempt to hack a company using the names \\"deadly jester\\" and \\"fist of satan\\" but the owner, Marvin Masterson (Paul Scheer), retaliates by using his \\"reverse-screw-driver\\" to delete all of John's pornography and melt Elliot and John's computer. John later decides to go on a killing spree in order to get more attention. Elliot is reluctant to help John with this, but eventually decides to do it, saying to him that he can't do it alone. They buy chloroform to use to kill their elderly neighbor, but John has second thoughts. Elliot and John then discover that while in disguise, during one of their previous attempts at fame, they became witnesses to a robbery and are now being called the \\"mystery witnesses\\". The two go on TV to tell everyone they are the \\"mystery witnesses\\", and quickly become a full media sensation with the help of Sally and Linda (Kate Micucci and Riki Lindhome), two girls who work at a mall and whom the boys flirt with. However, when brought to the police station soon after, they are informed by Detective Donahue (John Ennis) that the man who had committed the robbery and was arrested is actually a relative of the member of a Cleveland crime syndicate. As such, the two are now being forced to go to the witness protection program to make sure that his family members won't find and kill them. Desperate not to throw their life away, the two run away from the station. Elliot and John go to Sally and Linda's apartment to get away from the cops and come up with an idea to kill the mystery witnesses. Elliot and John go to the Nerd King (Hannibal Buress), the overweight owner of a collectible store and a trade partner for tools they had used in their fame attempts up to that point, and using a rare collectible action figure, are able to get help from him to fake the deaths of the \\"mystery witnesses\\". After it is done by the two, they return to Sally and Linda's apartment to find it filled with the press. However, the two are arrested for running away and are put in the witness protection program, but they are able to say their goodbyes to Sally and Linda. In the end, John and Elliot are seen working at a diner and wearing fake mustaches. They smile knowing that they have finally gotten what they wanted: fame.

Walker explains, \\"I have been a huge fan of Metalocalypse, Superjail!, and a lot of the cartoons that are on Adult Swim, especially the stuff done by Titmouse, Inc.. I would watch Metalocalypse and the little bird logo would come up at the end and chirp and I’d think, 'Who are these lunatics?' We set up a meeting with Titmouse and gave them the script. I was expecting Chris and Shannon Prynoski, who created and run Titmouse, to just say, 'No, this is a stupid idea.' But they said yes, and we went from there. I was super excited that Chris was interested in overseeing the making of it as a feature. Once he said yes he also said yes to directing it, which was great because I’m a huge fan of his.\\" Release The film premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival on April 14, 2016.

Road & Track Magazine. CBS Publications. pp. 92H. April 1981 Issue, Vol. 32 No. 8. In the early 1970s Mr. Seltzer assisted Le Grand Race Cars in developing a new Formula-Ford, the Mk 13B, and a new B-Sports Racing car, the Mk16. His experience in building and racing cars during this period led him to think about designing and building a street sports car kit that would far outperform the majority of kit cars of the time which were mostly Volkswagen based and so were under-powered and had poor handling characteristics. 1980 Willow with removable top in place, Chatsworth, CA 5-21-81. Eric Seltzer with wife Melinda, '79 Willow, Los Angeles Auto Expo, L.A. Convention Center, May 11, 1979. In early 1977 Mr. Seltzer began the design process for what was to become the Willow Sports Car Kit. It took the next two years to complete the design of the frame and body, build body molds, build frame fixtures to reproduce the multi-tube steel frames, and make the kit ready for sale to the public. Mr. Seltzer got the name Willow from Willow Springs Raceway in Rosamond, California, a track that was known for favoring light weight, good handling cars over heavier cars with more horsepower. The first Willow brochure in 1979 described the vehicle: “The Willow Sports Car Kit is designed for the individual who is looking for a two-seat sports car that has been engineered from the frame up, without compromise, for total performance. All suspension and drivetrain components have been selected for their design superiority and durability. The Willow’s body design, along with its spirited performance and handling, create the excitement of “Can Am” and European sports car racing, while at the same time offering comfortable seating for two and reliability of components. The Willow is a totally unique automobile, there is simply no other car from a kit car builder that can offer the engineering and design features that the Willow has. Compare and decide for yourself.” Seltzer Motor Industries had three kits available for building a Willow: Stage I, Basic Kit; Stage II, Completion Kit; and Stage III, Suggested Additional Parts. To build a complete Willow all three kits had to be purchased, although Stage III was optional if the builder wanted to supply their own drivetrain and suspension.Editor, publication (1982), The Complete Guide to Kit Cars, Replicars, & GT Conversions, Auto Logic Publications, Inc., p.64, Willow by Seltzer Motor Industries, 5th Anniversary Edition, May, 1982. 1980 Willow, body removed showing transverse mid-engine & rugged space-frame, 8-7-80.

It was the first new train to consist entirely of dome cars, which were the brainchild of GM vice president and Electro-Motive Division (EMD) general manager Cyrus Osborn, who conceived the idea while riding in either an F-unit or a caboose in the Rocky Mountains in Glenwood Canyon, Colorado. After GM built a 45-foot (14 m) scale model of the train for $101,772 and displayed it to 350 officials from 55 different Class I railroads in 1945, the Train of Tomorrow was built by Pullman-Standard between October 1946 and May 1947. The train consisted of four cars: a chair car (Star Dust), a dining car (Sky View), a sleeping car (Dream Cloud), and a lounge-observation car (Moon Glow), all featuring \\"Astra-Domes\\". It was pulled by a largely stock EMD E7A. Its dining car, Sky View, was the first dome diner to be built and the first diner of any kind with an all-electric kitchen. The train was constructed with low- alloy, high-tensile steel and Thermopane glass for its domes and windows. Although GM never publicly stated the total price of the Train of Tomorrow, contemporary sources estimated it at between $1 million and $1.5 million. After being christened at a dedication ceremony in Chicago on May 28, 1947, the Train of Tomorrow embarked on a barnstorming tour of the United States and Canada that lasted for 28 months, covered , and visited 181 cities and towns. During its tour, the train was ridden or toured by over 5.7 million people, and was seen by an estimated 20 million people. After its tour was completed on October 30, 1949, the train was sold to the Union Pacific for $500,000, and its four cars were put into service between Portland and Seattle on June 18, 1950. The cars were retired from service between 1961 and 1965, and all but one were eventually scrapped. Moon Glow sat in a scrap yard for almost two decades before being discovered by the National Railway Historical Society (NRHS), who purchased and transported it to the Ogden Union Station Museum, where it is undergoing restoration.  Background  Astra-Dome The Train of Tomorrow's direct antecedents were the original American lightweight passenger trains, most notably the Burlington's original Pioneer Zephyr (1934), the Santa Fe's lightweight Super Chief (1937), and the Illinois Central's Panama Limited (1942). The Burlington's construction of the first modern dome car in 1945 also preceded the construction of the Train of Tomorrow. Ralph Budd was one of the first people to see the sketches of the Train of Tomorrow's Astra- Dome cars, and was inspired by them to create the first modern dome car for the Burlington in 1945, two years before the Train of Tomorrow was unveiled. Prior to the Burlington dome, there were a number of precursors: T. J. McBride of Winnipeg received a patent for a dome sleeper in 1891, Coeur d'Alene Railway & Navigation Company chief engineer R. C. Riblet designed an electric dome car at roughly the same time, the Canadian Pacific Railway built four observation dome cars based on McBride's design between 1902 and 1906 (which were in service only until 1909), and the Wichita Falls and Southern Railroad build a \\"combination parlor-coach-baggage-observatory-dome car\\" in the 1930s. The Train of Tomorrow was also a response to over seven years of a relative lack of development and construction of railroad equipment caused by World War II. Even during the first half of 1947, all American railroads combined ordered fewer than 100 new passenger cars, according to Robert R. Young. In contrast, by the end of 1948, after the beginning of the Train of Tomorrow's promotional tour, there were over 1,800 passenger cars on order, although some of them had been ordered as early as 1944, but had not yet been delivered.  Genesis and design  The Glenwood Canyon dome car monument after being moved to the Colorado Railroad Museum According to multiple sources, the Train of Tomorrow's dome cars were the brainchild of GM vice president and EMD general manager Cyrus Osborn, who conceived the idea while riding in an F-unit in the Rocky Mountains in Glenwood Canyon, Colorado. According to Osborn himself, however, it was actually a similar ride in the \\"cupola of the caboose that gave me the idea.\\" After Osborn was reassured by EMD engineers that a dome car that would not be more limited in height clearance than a caboose could be built, he turned his idea over to Harley Earl and the General Motors (GM) Styling Section in Detroit. The Styling Section then collected feedback on contemporary passenger car design from its designers and railroad passengers before committing to a design process anticipated by Earl to take 90 days and cost US$25,000, which resulted in 1,500 sketches and 100 final design ideas. Burlington's Silver Dome After the final design ideas were derived from the sketches, GM's Styling Section began building a scale model of a four-car train (each car was long), built of metal, plastic, and wood and featuring 175 painted clay figures of people and even tiny details such as dinner knives and cigarette packs. The dining car alone featured 1,100 objects. After being completed, the model was unveiled in a former Cadillac showroom in Oak Park, Illinois, where it was displayed with a custom-built Western mountain scene backdrop illuminated with stage lighting. From February 21 to June 23, 1945, the model was shown to 350 officials from 55 different Class I railroads, most notably Ralph Budd of the Burlington, who was so moved by the display that he almost immediately ordered the passenger car Silver Alchemy (No. 4714) be converted into a dome and renamed Silver Dome. By November 1945, the model had cost $101,772, more than four times its budget, but before the Train of Tomorrow made its debut, 49 dome cars were on loan with the Budd Company alone. GM allowed any carbuilder to freely use its designs without licenses or royalties, as it \\"saw the program not only as a research project to stimulate interest in new car design and construction but also as a way to encourage railroads to order new cars with GM railroad-related products on-board.\\" After being revised, the model was repeatedly displayed at auto shows and other GM exhibitions through 1955, including at Chicago's Museum of Science and Industry and at Motorama, before last being seen in Cincinnati in 1955 at a ceremony honoring Osborn.  Development and construction  Technical features Design of the Train of Tomorrow began in 1944, as a collaboration between General Motors (GM) and Pullman-Standard. According to author Brian Solomon, the train \\"was strictly intended as an innovation showcase, and...the automotive manufacturer had no interest in building its own passenger trains.\\" According to a contemporary Life magazine article, its development cost approximately $1.5 million. GM had no less than five of its divisions involved with the train: the Electro-Motive Division (EMD) built its E7A locomotive, the Detroit Diesel Division and the Delco Products Division collaborated on the train's generating equipment, the Frigidaire Division built its air conditioning system, the Hyatt Bearings Division built its anti-friction, journal-box bearings, and GM's Styling Division concentrated on its interior design. GM did not, however, foray into the field of building passenger railroad cars, until its introduction of the Aerotrain a decade later. According to authors Gary Dolzall and Stephen Dolzall, the train was intended to be the \\"ultimate train for the postwar era\\" and an \\"embodiment of the latest passenger train design\\". Author Frank Richter termed it the \\"latest state-of-the-art in passenger trains\\", while fellow author William L. Bird described it as \\"GM's traveling exhibit of Diesel-powered passenger comfort\\". According to GM president Harlow Curtice, the Train of Tomorrow was an experiment in both design and mechanics, similar to its automotive concept cars such as the Le Sabre, XP-300, and Y-Job. GM's Executive Committee formally committed to building the Train of Tomorrow in fall 1945. After soliciting proposals from multiple car manufacturers, GM signed a contract with Pullman-Standard on November 6, 1945. The cars were all to be built to Association of American Railroads (AAR) standards, but GM did not supply Pullman-Standard with blueprints or specifications for building the cars, instead concentrating on their interior design. EMD did supply inspectors to Pullman-Standard who had the power to approve or reject changes to the design and workmanship in the construction of the cars, however. After creating a final set of drawings, specifications, and full-scale wooden mockups, Pullman- Standard made arrangements with the War Production Board to obtain steel for the train, but settled for flat glass instead of curved glass, because the latter was still required for the American war effort. GM also decided not to charge royalties on the use of the dome car concept by any car builders. Construction of the Train of Tomorrow began in October 1946, and took until May 17, 1947. The Train of Tomorrow consisted of four cars: a chair car (Star Dust), a dining car (Sky View), a sleeping car (Dream Cloud), and a lounge- observation car (Moon Glow), all featuring \\"Astra-Domes\\". The domes on the Train of Tomorrow each measured in length, in width, and in height, and sat 24 people apiece. The domes were made with Thermopane glass, developed by Libbey- Owens-Ford, and consisted of a plate-glass exterior layer and a shatterproof interior layer with a pocket of air between to provide thermal and sound insulation. The Thermopane glass was also resistant to heat and glare-free. The low profile of the domes allowed them to operate on most mainlines, including those with low clearances, such as on the Boston & Albany. Like the dome windows, the rest of the windows in the train were made of Thermopane and \\"designed for maximum viewing of the passing scenery.\\" They ranged in size from for sleeping car Dream Cloud's roomettes to in Dream Cloud's two drawing rooms and the chair car Star Dust. Including the domes, the total height of the cars \\"from rail to roof\\" was . Each car measured in length, and weighed when unloaded. Each of the cars was built using low-alloy, high-tensile steel, and constructed using the welded-girder technique. The trucks on the train's passenger cars were developed from locomotive trucks, with outside-mounted swing hangers spaced apart (instead of the typical practice of mounting them apart on the inside of the trucks) and rolling bearing journal boxes, which helped to improve truck alignment, smooth the train's ride, and reduce body roll on curves from to . The Train of Tomorrow had a blue-green and silver livery described by author Keith Lovegrove as having an \\"astral theme\\", consisting of a \\"wide belt of stainless steel wrapping the midriff of the predominantly dark-blue train\\". The blue-green exterior paint was a high-gloss enamel Dulux paint produced by DuPont, and the train's underframe was painted black. All the cars on the train featured Seamloc carpet made by Goodall Fabrics, in a palette of colors known as \\"Araby\\" (consisting of the colors Araby Peach, Dove Taupe, Jade, Lido Sand, Persian Rose, Silver Grey, and Turquoise). The hard flooring and wall covering materials used were Es Es and V-Board, both plastic products created by the United States Rubber Company, in the colors blue, brown, coral, gray-blue, gray-green, gray-tan, green, purple, and red. The train's interior paint was a semigloss from DuPont, its pull-down shades were manufactured by the Adams and Westlake Company and matched to the exterior colors of the train, while its \\"decorative but nonfunctional drapes\\" were supplied by Goodall Fabrics and backed with sateen from Lusskey, White, and Coolidge. The train featured couch seats from Haywood-Wakefield in chair car Star Dust and all of its domes except that of dining car Sky View; they were of tubular metal construction with sponge rubber seat and back cushions that could both rotate and recline, and each also had movable footrests and armrests with ash receivers. Those in the chair car had high backs, while those in the domes had low backs that measured only from the seat cushion to the top of the headrest. The Train of Tomorrow featured numerous additional amenities, including Diesel auxiliary power units (head-end power) on each car, an all-electric kitchen, fluorescent light fixtures throughout the train, a public address system, and even a radiotelephone, which during demonstrations placed a call to the ocean liner RMS Queen Elizabeth while at sea. Each car on the train also had a and a air conditioning unit. In all, the train could carry a capacity of 216 passengers. It measured in overall length, and weighted a total of when unloaded and roughly when fully loaded. GM never publicly stated the total price of the Train of Tomorrow, although contemporary sources estimated it at between $1 million and $1.5 million. = EMD E7A locomotive no. 765 = EMD E7A locomotive no. 765 The Train of Tomorrow was pulled by a largely stock EMD E7A that was given road number 765 because it was built for order number 765. It featured two , V12 GM Diesel engines mated to direct current (DC) generators that powered traction motors on each of the locomotive's trucks, which both had three axles. In total, the locomotive was rated at , and could operate at . The prime movers had a power range between 275 and 800 rpm. Behind the prime movers, the locomotive had a steam generator used to heat passenger cars. The cab of the E7A featured two swivel chairs, one for the engineer and the other for the fireman, and controls purposely designed to be similar to those used on steam locomotives. The cab was also soundproofed and heated during the winter. The locomotive measured in length and weighed when fully loaded. Its exterior featured the GM logo on its side, \\"set in a graphic representation of a shooting star\\", and another GM logo with the words \\"Train of Tomorrow\\" on its nose. According to author Ric Morgan, it was \\"just a standard Diesel locomotive\\" aside from these unique graphics and cosmetic corrugated stainless steel added to match the exterior design of the cars. It had a skirt on its front with doors providing access to the front coupler. According to Pullman-Standard public relations consultant E. Preston Calvert, Pullman-Standard built the shell for the locomotive, and while GM encouraged it to build more shells in the future, \\"it did not want to get into locomotive building.\\" While still unfinished, the locomotive was publicly displayed at the Fisher Ternstedt plant in Cleveland on April 25, 1947, just a month before the beginning of the Train of Tomorrow's tour. = Chair car Star Dust = Chair car Star Dust Chair car Star Dust (Pullman plan number 7555) seated 72 passengers. It provided seating on three levels, including in its Astra-Dome and three semiprivate rooms beneath the dome in addition to on its main level. Its two main level sections, the forward coach section and the rear coach section, seated 16 and 12 passengers each, respectively. The dome sat 24 people, while two of the three semiprivate rooms could accommodate 7 while the third could seat 6. The seats in the car could rotate, allowing them to face the direction of travel or allow two pairs of seats to face each other, allowing families to interact with each other during a trip. The semiprivate rooms were separated from the passageway by shoulder-high partitions, while these three rooms were divided from each other by fluted (or ribbed) glass called Securit Linex Glass that, while it transmitted light, provided some privacy by impairing the ability to see through it. The first and third semiprivate rooms each had two pairs of chairs and a couch that could accommodate three people, while the second contained two of the three-person couches instead. Under the stairway of the dome, the car contained various supplies and necessities, including a water cooler, a coat locker, and a jump seat for the porter. The car had a set of men's and women's lavatories at either end, with the pair at the vestibule end being complemented by men's and women's dressing rooms. Also at the vestibule end, the car had luggage compartments on both sides of the aisle that could be accessed from either inside or outside the train. = Dining car Sky View = Dining car Sky View Dining car Sky View (Pullman plan number 7556) could accommodate 52 people in three different dining rooms. It sat 24 in its main dining room, 18 in its dome, and 10 in its reserve private dining room beneath the dome. It was both the first dome diner to be built and the first diner of any kind with an all-electric kitchen. At its front end, the car featured the crew's toilet, an icemaker, and food storage accessible from the kitchen. The kitchen covered roughly the first third of the car, and it entirely constructed of stainless steel and featured a pan floor made of the anti-slip material Martex. The kitchen featured a wide array of electric appliances, including a frozen food locker, a General Electric (GE) broiler, a GE garbage disposal unit, three GE ranges, a Hobart dishwasher, a hot table, a water heater, a Hotpoint fry kettle, a KitchenAid mixer, three ovens, plate warmers, and Pullman-Standard refrigerators with mechanics made by Frigidaire. The kitchen also featured long counter spaces, a pastry board, a sink, and storage lockers. Under the dome, and adjoining to the kitchen, was the car's pantry, where salads and desserts were made and where the waiters picked up food for passengers. The pantry also featured a dumbwaiter that connected to the dining room in the dome. Also beneath the dome was the reserve private dining room, a small dining area designed to accommodate small groups or families. It had two tables with two-person benches on either side, as well as two loose chairs that could be added to the ends of the tables to give each a capacity of five people, or ten for the entire room. In the dome, an off-center aisle allowed for four-person booths on one side and two-person booths on the other. At the front end of the dome was a waiter's station that included the dumbwaiter along with a Cory coffee warmer, an ice well, a refrigerator, a sink, and a toaster. At the base of the staircase to the dome was the steward's room as well as a locker for supplies and a desk. The main dining room also featured an off-center aisle, dividing square tables with four chairs on one side from triangular tables with two chairs on the other. The rear end of the car included a crew locker, an electrical locker, and a linen locker. = Sleeping car Dream Cloud = Sleeping car Dream Cloud Sleeping car Dream Cloud (Pullman plan number 4128) accommodated passengers in two drawing rooms, three compartments, and eight duplex roomettes, and also had 24 seats in its dome. It could sleep 20 passengers if all its beds were filled. All of its berths were mounted lengthwise in regards to the car. At the front of the car was a general use toilet. Next came drawing room E, which featured a large sofa facing the window that folded down into a bed at night, two more upper berths that folded down from the walls, and two chairs near the window. The drawing room also had a small lavatory known as an \\"annex\\". The next room, drawing room D, was a mirror image of drawing room E, although the two were decorated differently. Under the dome roughly in the center of the car were the three compartments, which each had (like the drawing rooms) a window-facing sofa. Compartment C had two lower berths and a single chair, as well as a sanitary column in the corner with a lid-capped \\"hopper\\" (toilet) and a fold-down sink. Similarly to drawing rooms E and D, compartments C and D were mirror images of each other, again the only difference being in terms of decor. Compartment A shared its layout with compartment C, although during the Train of Tomorrow's tour it was used as the train's office. The dome in the car was similar to the other domes on the train, although all of its seats were reserved for passengers booked on Dream Cloud. Behind the staircase to the dome was the porter's section, containing a seat and a folding upper berth as well as an annunciator to alert the porter to sleeping car passengers requesting service and supplies such as a first aid kit. Behind the porter's section were the car's eight duplex roomettes, consisting of two upper roomettes and two lower roomettes on each side of the aisle. The lower roomettes were at floor level, while their upper counterparts were two steps above. The roomettes each featured a seat, a small one-person sofa, a sanitary column with hopper like the ones in the compartments, and one berth. Upper berths were slightly larger than lower berths, and the former had berths that folded out of the wall while the latter had pull-out sliding berths that were stored under the adjacent upper roomette. At the end of the car were two lockers that held clean linen and soiled linen as well as folding chairs and tables. After being constructed, Dream Cloud was taken to Altoona, Pennsylvania, and subjected to jacking, load, and squeeze testing. = Lounge-observation car Moon Glow = Lounge-observation car Moon Glow Lounge-observation car Moon Glow (Pullman plan number 7557) could accommodate 68 people in its dome, rear observation lounge, and two cocktail lounges. Half of the seats in the car were movable, enabling passengers to adapt its seating to their needs. The first of the three lounges on the car, at its forward end, was called the upper lounge, the second, which was located under the dome, was called the lower lounge, and the rear lounge at the end of the car was called the observation lounge. The front end of the car also housed a men's and a women's lavatory. The upper lounge featured a bar, a large sofa, built-in seats, three booths with Formica tabletops, and smoking stands also capable of holding beverages. The lower lounge also featured a built-in sofa and chairs, but they were finished with honey-colored leather that complemented the dark green carpet to give it \\"the appearance of a bar in a private club.\\" Unlike the upper lounge, the lower lounge did not have any windows. The lower lounge also featured a bar created by Angelo Colonna that contained a refrigerator and an ice cube maker, glassware cabinets, and a cigar and cigarette humidor. Like in the kitchen in the dining car, the bar's floor was a \\"metal pan\\" finished in anti-slip Martex. Both of these lounge areas were separated from the passageway by half- wall partitions. The dome of Moon Glow, like the domes in the chair car and sleeping car, accommodated 24 people. At the base of the stairs to the dome was a built-in writing desk area, which contained cubicles for writing supplies, the public address system, an intratrain telephone, and a \\"train-to- shore\\" radiotelephone that could be operated whenever the train was within of the 30 largest metropolitan areas in the United States. The radiotelephone was powered by a six-volt battery similar to automotive batteries that was mounted under the car, and it used an \\"piano wire\\" antenna mounted to the roof, both of which were supplied by Illinois Bell. The observation lounge at the end of the car had an oval-shaped appearance, with a rounded end in its ceiling lighting cove matching the rounded shape of the end of the car. The observation lounge included nine movable lounge chairs, as well as three sofas: two kidney-shaped ones (seating two and three people, respectively) that could also be moved, and a third large, curved, built-in sofa. The sofas and chairs were turned toward the windows while the train was in motion, but during tours they were turned inward. There was a table in front of the built- in sofa, and smoking stands throughout, like those in the other lounges. The windows in the observation lounge were large, and almost appeared to be pillarless, but small pillars were hidden behind drapes. The windows also had shades. The very end of the observation car contained a \\"cockpit area\\" with built-in end tables and built-in seats, and (hidden behind a door) a back-up and signal valve that could be used to control the train while it was being operated in reverse.  Operation  = Testing and dedication = The Train of Tomorrow made its first test run on the Monon Railroad, between Chicago and Wallace Junction in Indiana. The train also made its official debut on the Monon on May 26, 1947, carrying company officials, members of the media and invited guests from Dearborn Station in Chicago to the French Lick Springs Hotel in French Lick, Indiana. After spending the night at the hotel in French Lick, and hosting 758 people who toured the train while there, the train and its passengers returned to Chicago the next day. The train's public debut also served as a shakedown of sorts, with several brake tests being made on the return journey. The return to Chicago was marred by a collision with an automobile at a grade crossing, although it resulted in no injuries and no serious damage to the locomotive. On May 28 the Train of Tomorrow was dedicated at a ceremony held at the Palmer House Hotel that featured Chicago mayor Martin H. Kennelly and GM's Charles F. Kettering, Cyrus Osborn, and Alfred P. Sloan. Approximately 1,000 GM and Pullman-Standard executives, businessmen and politicians attended the ceremony, during which Kettering's granddaughter, Jane, christening the train with a bottle of champagne. Following this ceremony, GM opened the train to the public at Soldier Field between May 29 and June 1, during which around 50,000 people saw it. = Demonstration tour = The Train of Tomorrow departed on its demonstration tour on June 2, 1947, barnstorming the United States and Canada for 28 months and covering , despite the tour initially being slated to last only 6 months. In the words of author Brian Solomon, the intention of the tour was to \\"promote Diesel-electric technology and new concepts in passenger railroading\\". According to Dolzall and Dolzall, the chief purpose of the Train of Tomorrow's tour was to generate public interest and to sell orders for GM Diesel-electric locomotives and Pullman-Standard passenger cars. The tour was made possible by volunteers and employees of GM, its various divisions, Pullman-Standard, and the various railroads over which the train ran, and it was dependent on advance agents to coordinate logistics and public relations personnel to promote the train. The barnstorming tour included special runs for the press, tours for groups of children as well as the general public, and open houses at GM plants for employees and their families. GM employees on the tour were accommodated in local hotels, while the Pullman crew staffing the train itself slept in a remodeled heavyweight Pullman-Standard car nicknamed the Blue Goose that accompanied the Train of Tomorrow. Pullman was responsible for staffing the train as well as cleaning and maintaining it, while EMD was in charge of supervising its maintenance. On a typical day on the road, the train was cleaned and prepared during the morning, then local VIPs (such as politicians) and GM executives were invited to have lunch on the train's dining car, and public tours would begin at 1 or 2 pm and run until 9 pm. During tours, the public would typically enter the train through the rear of lounge-observation car Moon Glow and exit through chair car Star Dust. Throughout the tour, the train's interior was decorated with anthuriums, rare flowers that were sourced from a single florist and flown in. On June 3, 1947, the Train of Tomorrow departed on its \\"1st Eastern Tour\\", stopping for multiple days in Detroit, Michigan; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; Atlantic City, New Jersey; Baltimore, Maryland; Atlanta, Georgia; Louisville, Kentucky; Cincinnati, Ohio, Dayton, Ohio, and Oxford, Ohio, before returning to Chicago on August 11. On August 20, it departed on its \\"2nd Eastern Tour\\", stopping for multiple days at Cleveland, Ohio, and Buffalo, New York, before August 31. Between September 1 and September 8, it visited Eastern Canada for the first time when it was exhibited at the Canadian National Exhibition in Toronto and visited McKinnon Industries in St. Catharines, Ontario. On September 8, the train reentered the United States, and stopped for multiple days in Rochester, Syracuse, and Albany, New York; Boston, Massachusetts; New York City, New York; and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, before returning to Chicago on October 17. From October 24 to 26, the train was exhibited at the EMD plant in La Grange, Illinois, but on October 25 it made a trip to Ann Arbor, Michigan, for an Associated Press trip to the football game between the University of Minnesota and the University of Michigan. On October 27, the train departed on its \\"Western Tour\\", spending multiple days in Omaha, Nebraska; Denver, Colorado; Salt Lake City, Utah; Oakland, San Francisco, and Los Angeles, California; Portland, Oregon; and Seattle, Washington, before the end of the year. On December 16, the train made a \\"celebrity run\\" between the Californian cities of Glendale and Saugus, with Eddie Bracken, Gordon \\"Wild Bill\\" Elliot, Jean Hersholt, Herbert Marshall, Joan Leslie, Art Linkletter, Walter Pidgeon, Ginger Rogers, and Ann Sothern on board. On December 28, in the lead-up to the 1948 Rose Bowl, the train took the Michigan Wolverines football team on a trip, also from Glendale to Saugus, before picking up the Michigan Marching Band in San Francisco and returning with them to Glendale the following day. On January 1, 1948, the Train of Tomorrow took the USC Trojans football team from Santa Barbara to the Rose Bowl. In early January, the train resumed its Western tour, stopping for multiple days in San Diego, California; Phoenix, Arizona; El Paso, Dallas, San Antonio, Fort Worth, and Houston, Texas; New Orleans, Louisiana; Miami, Tampa, and Orlando, Florida; Montgomery, Alabama; Memphis, Tennessee; Little Rock, Arkansas; Oklahoma City and Tulsa, Oklahoma; Wichita and Topeka, Kansas; Kansas City and St. Louis, Missouri; Minneapolis–Saint Paul, Minnesota; Milwaukee, Wisconsin; and Des Moines, Iowa, before returning to Chicago on May 10. On January 11, between Phoenix and Albuquerque, New Mexico, the train was given permission by Santa Fe to try to attain its maximum speed, which the crew clocked at , although the locomotive's speedometer only registered . On February 2, the train met the original Freedom Train in Waco, Texas. Upon arriving in Tulsa, on March 24, it was welcomed by members of the Otoe tribe. After a \\"shopping period\\" in May, the Train of Tomorrow resumed touring on May 30, stopping for multiple days in Danville and Anderson, Illinois; Indianapolis, Indiana; and Grand Rapids, Lansing, Flint, and Saginaw, Michigan, before returning to Chicago for the Chicago Railroad Fair on July 19. On July 16, the train visited the only automobile dealership on its itinerary, Lee Anderson's Chevrolet showroom in Lake Orion, Michigan, just north of Detroit. Between July 20 and September 24, the train was put on display at the Chicago Railroad Fair. On September 25, the train left for touring again, spending days in Detroit and Pontiac, Michigan; Toledo, Warren, Columbus, Dayton, and Elyria, Ohio; Buffalo, Lockport and Elmsford, New York; Framingham, Massachusetts; Meriden and Bristol, Connecticut; and Baltimore, Maryland, before arriving in St. Louis for servicing at the Pullman shops there on December 14. On January 15, 1949, the Train of Tomorrow departed on its \\"Southeastern Tour\\", spending multiple days in Wilmington, Charlotte, Raleigh, and Portsmouth, North Carolina; Columbia, Spartanburg and Charleston, South Carolina; Augusta and Macon, Georgia; St. Petersburg, Tallahassee, and Pensacola, Florida; Nashville and Chattanooga, Tennessee; Huntington and Wheeling, West Virginia; Lexington, Kentucky; Elmira, Binghamton, and Poughkeepsie, New York; Scranton, Pennsylvania; Providence, Rhode Island; Manchester, New Hampshire; Portland, Maine; Worcester and Springfield, Massachusetts; Hartford, Connecticut; Canton and Akron, Ohio; Fort Wayne, South Bend, and Evansville, Indiana; Springfield and Peoria, Illinois; and Davenport, Iowa, before arriving in St. Louis on June 9 for a \\"shopping period\\" before the 1949 Chicago Railroad Fair. On January 17, it set a new speed record between Detroit and New York City, reaching a top speed of and completing the trip in 12 hours, 114 minutes faster than the previous fastest time. Between June 25 and October 2, the train was displayed at the Chicago Railroad Fair. It made its second trip to Eastern Canada between September 22 and October 30, visiting London, Ottawa, Oshawa, Toronto, Hamilton, St. Catharines, Stratford, Chatham and Windsor, Ontario, as well as Montreal, Quebec City and Sherbrooke, Quebec. On October 30, the last trip of the tour took the train from Windsor through Detroit back to Dearborn Station in Chicago, from where its first public trip departed, where it was serviced before being placed in temporary storage. In total, while on tour the Train of Tomorrow visited 181 cities and towns, covered over , was ridden or toured by over 5.7 million people, and was seen by an estimated 20 million people. Various sources estimate the cost of the tour as $1-2 million. = Sale and revenue service = GM initially intended to sell the Train of the Tomorrow to the highest bidder in 1947, after completing its originally planned six-month tour. On October 17, 1949, Osborn received a memorandum suggesting that GM ask for $950,000 for the whole train, including the locomotive, as GM was very keen to sell the whole train as a unit, with any amount offered over the asking price being donated to charity. On October 21, Osborn sent a letter to 29 railroad presidents offering them the opportunity to buy the train. Due to the short length of the Train of Tomorrow and its lack of an identical second train (which would be needed to effectively run an overnight service), purchasing the train was not practical for many railroads, many of which also simply did not have enough capital to make such a purchase. While Osborn's letter asked for all bids to be made to EMD by December 1, the train remained unsold by that date. On March 18, 1950, in an internal memorandum to the railroad's Executive Committee, Union Pacific president A. E. Stoddard recommended purchasing the train for $500,000 and spending another $100,000 on refurbishing it and miscellaneous costs, with the intention of putting it into service between Portland and Seattle. According to the memorandum, GM had received a number of bids for the train but was willing to sell it for $500,000, which according to Morgan meant that \\"either all the bids were lower or the other bidders were after individual pieces of the equipment and EMD decided not to sell cars individually.\\" On March 21, the Union Pacific Executive Council officially approved Stoddard's proposal to buy the train. After taking delivery of the Train of Tomorrow in April 1950, the Union Pacific repainted the exterior of the train in its livery, refurbished the entire interior and mounted a large taillight to the roof of Moon Glow, the lounge-observation car. In May, the train went on a tour of the Union Pacific system with an emphasis on the Pacific Northwest, as the railroad had already decided that the train would be put into service between Portland and Seattle. On June 18, it began service as part of Train 457, which departed Portland northbound at 8 am and arrived in Seattle at 1:05 pm, laying over there for nearly four hours before departing southbound as Train 458 at 5 pm and arriving in Portland by 9:30 pm. The entire consist of Train 457 and Train 458 was typically three EMD E7 locomotives, a mail-baggage car, five or six chair cars (which could each accommodate 44 passengers), a parlor car, a through sleeper car for the City of Portland, and then the four dome cars from the Train of Tomorrow together at the rear of the train. Throughout the existence of Train 457 and Train 458, numerous adjustments were made to their schedules and times, beginning with a shortening of the route to 3 hours and 59 minutes by August 13. In 1950, a round-trip fare cost $6.84, and the fare for the same trip in the parlor car or a reserved seat in the sleeping car Dream Cloud cost $15.65 ($2.64 cheaper than a round-trip flight between the two cities on a Douglas DC-6, according to a contemporary magazine). In March 1956, the Union Pacific renumbered three of the cars (all but the sleeper Dream Cloud), while in December 1958 dome observation car Moon Glow was reclassified as a dome lounge car and, in 1959, had its rounded end cut off and squared for use in mid-train service, typically next to the dining car as a convenient place for passengers to wait for a table. In February 1961, dining car Sky View was the first Train of Tomorrow car to be retired, followed by sleeping car Dream Cloud in February 1964, chair car Star Dust in November 1964, and Moon Glow in March 1965. Although initially noted as \\"vacant but not dismantled\\" by the Union Pacific, all four cars were eventually sold to McCarty's Scrap Yard in Pocatello, Idaho. The EMD demonstrator locomotive that originally pulled the Train of Tomorrow was renumbered 988 by the Union Pacific and put into general service, separated from the four dome cars it toured with. It was sent back to EMD in 1965 and either rebuilt as an EMD E9A that was subsequently renumbered 912 or traded in on a new E9A; the records of EMD and the Union Pacific do not clearly indicate which occurred.  Fate and legacy  E9A and painted in a New York Central livery, at the Danbury Railway Museum While Star Dust, Dream Cloud, and Sky View were ultimately scrapped in 1964 at McCarty's Scrap Yard in Pocatello, Moon Glow survived. In 1969, after purchasing the lot next to McCarty's Scrap Yard and opening Henry's Scrap Metals on it, Henry Fernandez purchased Moon Glow from McCarty's for $2,500, without knowing its history or the story of the Train of Tomorrow. He intended to restore it and convert it into an office, although it would sit unrestored on his property for 18 years. After members of the National Railway Historical Society (NRHS) discovered it while on a fan trip to the Union Pacific shops and yard in Pocatello in June 1980, they asked Fernandez to donate the car to them, but he refused. After learning the history of the car, Fernandez placed a high value on it when asked about a sale or donation by the NRHS for a second time in June 1981. In 1984, after he decided to close his scrap yard due to difficulties with the Internal Revenue Service, Fernandez authorized the sale of the car to the Promontory Chapter of the NRHS for $138,000 on December 27, 1984, which was finalized on February 1, 1985. Shortly thereafter, the Ogden Union Station Museum agreed to take possession of Moon Glow and restore it. The car was first moved to a siding behind an insulation company in Pocatello, about from Henry's Scrap Metals, in February 1987. In early 1988, the Union Pacific moved Moon Glow from Pocatello to Ogden, Utah, via flatbed car. Between 1991 and 2001, the car was moved to various locations in and around Ogden for storage and a variety of refurbishment, which included sandblasting, the application of primer paint, and replacement glass for its windows that were purchased with $125,000 granted by the Utah State Legislature. In December 2004, the Sci Fi channel film Alien Express was in part filmed in Moon Glow; the car was cleaned and temporarily furnished by the film crew, which also paid $4,000 to the Ogden Union Station Foundation to use the car.

(producer) in a cameo appearance in Aambala music teaser video  Production  = Development = In August 2013, Aadhi, the lead singer of Hiphop Tamizha (HHT) revealed that he had been signed as lead for a full-length feature film based on HHT which was expected to released by the mid of 2014. He also stated that there was a search for a suitable director to helm the spec script. During October 2016, a 90–second teaser was released on HHT's official YouTube channel, as news emerged that the film being titled as \\"Meesaya Murukku\\" produced by N. Ramasamy and Hema Rukmani for Thenandal Studio Limited, who green lit the project within five minutes of his narration and insisted him to perform as lead actor, after being impressed with his video song on Jallikattu, \\"Takkaru Takkaru\\". Apart from debuting as actor in a full-length role, Adhi also serves as writer and director besides composing the score and writing lyrics for the film. In the press meet before release of the film, Sundar C confirmed that it was partly biographical of Adhi's life. The film's title is derived from a phrase Adhi's father would often tell his son: \\"Thothalum jeythalum, meesaya murukku\\" (win or lose, always twirl your moustache). Adhi has stated that while Meesaya Murukku is \\"predominantly based on real incidents\\", such as his five friends from the film and the character Sudhakaran being based on real people, certain liberties were taken to make the film commercially viable. The film depicts Adhi and Jeeva as having been childhood friends, whereas in reality, the duo met via Orkut in 2005, when they were teenagers. = Casting = As revealed in 2013, Adhi continued to be lead actor and chose Aathmika to pair for him, after coming across her Facebook profile. The film also features Vivek and Vijayalakshmi in supporting roles, where the former plays the father of Adhi's character. The film features a mostly new cast and crew as per Adhi's wishes, with being Vivek the only established actor. = Filming = Though pre- production began in August 2013, the film, as of October 2016, was reported to have completed 45 days of shoot with two songs left to be shot. Filming ended by early November 2016.  Music  Adhi composed the music of the film. A promotional song, \\"Sait Ji\\", was released in late 2016. Although it became a viral hit on YouTube, Sundar C. received a legal notice from Ashok G Lodha of Shri All India Shwetamber Sthanakwasi Jain Conference. Lodha objected to the words \\"Sait Ji\\", meaning \\"affluent trader\\", and demanded that they be removed from the song, feeling it was \\"a classic example of abuse of the (Jain) community in the name of creativity and art.\\" Sundar C obliged, and had the words removed not only from the song, but also from the finished film, and the word Saitji was replaced by Great ji. The YouTube video itself was deleted later.http://newstodaynet.com/entertainment/hip-hop-removessaitji-song-youtube  Release and reception  Meesaya Murukku was released on 21 July 2017 to positive reviews. Sify stated, \\"Meesaya Murukku is a decent debut directorial and heroic outing from Adhi, the film clicks mainly because of the real life connect.\\". The film grossed 12.0 million from 147 shows during its first week. Baradwaj Rangan of Film Companion wrote, \\"Meesaya Murukku could have been a celebration of Tamil-ness [...] But the film, frustratingly, settles into an uninspired chronicle of college life: ragging, lusting for biriyani, cultural events, and romance [...] Meesaya Murukku has a few moments, but it’s neither an effective romance nor a convincing coming-of-age drama.\\"  Remake  The film was remade in Kannada as Padde Huli (2019).

As of a USGS study on water quality in 2010, one major concern was that nitrates present in the water were exceeding the 10 mg/L standard for drinking water in 17% of the sampled wells. An additional concern was that pesticides like atrazine were often present in the water, but so far they have been detected at concentrations meeting human health standards.Frans, Lonna M., Michael G.

Areas of the plateau with high surface irrigation have less concern over groundwater depletion due to reinfiltration of excess water into the aquifer system.

After a brief period of training and reconsolidation, the regiment was attached to \\"Task Force Linden\\" under the command of General Henning Linden in early December to prepare for combat. On 24 December 1944, the Task Force (TF) entered combat in the vicinity of Strasbourg, relieving the 36th Infantry Division of the Texas Army National Guard and became engaged in minor skirmishing with the Germans until the advent of major battle. Operation Nordwind On 31 December, the Germans launched a major offensive in north- eastern France, called Operation Nordwind, and managed to gain ground against the Seventh United States Army, and the First French Army. In order to cut off the American held town of Haguenau, the Wehrmacht needed to encircle the position in a pincer move. However, their offensive would grind to a halt once they reached the positions of the 42nd Infantry Division. On the night of 24 January 1945, the second to last day of the German counterattack, the 222nd Infantry Regiment would see its first major combat in the face of a determined and experienced enemy. The G.I.'s were dug in in fighting positions in the Ohlugen Forest looking towards the Forest of Haguenau, where thick foliage and a dense low-lying fog both concealed their positions and obscured the Germans' movements. Facing the green Americans of the 222nd Infantry were elements of the 25th Panzergrenadier Division, the 47th Volksgrenadier Division, and the 7th Fallschirmjäger Division. Colonel Luongo, the commander of the 222nd, spread out his soldiers across five major defensive positions from west to east; a series of hills to the west, in Neubourg, Mill d'Uhrbruck, the Ohlungen Forest, and the town of Schweighausen to the east. The arrival of the Germans was heralded by loud taunts and oaths sent across the line to intimidate the waiting Americans, and the assault began at 1800 with an artillery barrage first on Schweighausen, then eventually the whole regimental line. The barrage included artillery guns and Nebelwerfer rockets, and was very effective despite the darkness of the night. During the first hour of the barrage, nearly all the 222nd’s phone lines were knocked out and their radios proved to be ineffective in the woodland. Supporting American artillery was ineffective, and the Battalion HQ for the 1st (1-222) and 2nd (2-222) Battalions had to be moved after receiving accurate fire. E Company 2-222, made first contact with enemy ground troops at 2015, when the Germans charged across the firebreak that separated their two positions. Heavy machine-gun and mortar fire from the US positions halted the attackers, and the CO of E Co (Lieutenant George Carroll) counterattacked and drove the Germans back. This reprieve was short-lived and the Panzergrenadiers attacked the E Co positions once again near the Mill d'Uhrbruck, and overwhelmed the defenders. First Lieutenant Richard Break gathered the remnants of E Co and attempted three counterattacks to regain the position, but these were repulsed. K Co of 3rd Battalion (3-222) was hit with artillery on its right flank and its 2nd Platoon was left with only 22 men under the command of Sergeant Chambers. Their Platoon leader was missing, and was cut off from reinforcement. The position was attacked by a company of Germans and was overrun, and the surviving G.I.'s were forced to make a painfully slow retreat by crawling though a ditch. Only 11 men escaped to the K Co command post at Neubourg. The regiment was heavily engaged all across its line, and during the fighting, First Lieutenant Carlyle Woelfer, the CO of K Company, managed to capture a German officer with valuable maps detailing their offensive plan. The officer and another prisoner were put on an M8 Greyhound of the 813th Tank Destroyer Battalion for transport, but soon began signalling for other German soldiers to come to their rescue. Three Germans popped out and killed PFC Edmund Sheppard, but were in turn killed by Woelfer. At this point in the battle, E Co was weakened and their right flank was exposed due a shifting of troops to protect the left, so the Germans took advantage of this development and attacked through the woods. E Co men were forced to retreat back to Schweighausen, after Germans swarmed their dugouts from multiple directions. First Lieutenant Merrill, leader of the 2nd Platoon, F Co, withdrew the soldiers he could to the outskirts of Schweighausen to regroup for a counterattack on the Ohlungen Forest, which was now occupied by the Germans. The six men guarding Merrill’s left flank were overrun and never seen again. The center of the 222nd Infantry's line had been shattered; E Co was cut off, and K and F Companies were mauled. First Lieutenant Carroll, CO of E Company, decided his position was indefensible, and he led his men back to their original positions during a brief lull in the battle around 0230, fighting off groups of enemy along the way. For the rest of the night, the 222nd fought to contain the breakthrough. The right of the line, at Schweighausen, continued to hold. The strongest attack on the town came from the west, when Fallschirmjägers moved up through the Haguenau Forest and came down through the wedge that had been driven between Companies E and F. The Heavy weapons platoon from H Co, under Second Lieutenant Klare Moyer, was sent to plug the gap. This platoon, along with elements of F and G Companies, counterattacked until they were forced back by artillery fire. A few hours earlier, at 2000, MAJ Downard ordered G Co to attack the Germans, but they strayed from their assigned route and stumbled upon an unexpected German position. The fusillade began suddenly, but would last for a long time. The startled Americans reeled from the initial barrage, but soon charged into the fray and captured the enemy positions, from which they poured fire into the German flanks. After five hours, CPT Palmes ordered a tactical withdrawal. This engagement cost G Co 4 dead and 19 wounded, and inflicted 67 German dead. Although they failed to accomplish their initial objective, they did a great deal to stem the German advance on Schweighausen. Meanwhile, in Neubourg, K and L Companies fought a bitter struggle with the advancing Germans that eventually resulted in Hand-to-hand combat. During this combat, Privates Franklin Van Nest and Joe McGraw engaged in a hand-to-hand struggle with a pair of Germans, and Van Nest (a big man) wielded a knife as large as a Roman short sword. Despite winning this brief encounter, the Germans wounded the two Privates with grenades. Companies I and M were heavily engaged in the west defending against the breakthrough. The Volksgrenadiers were less than aggressive in their assaults and machine-gun fire effectively halted their advance. 1-222 was alerted to move at 2050, in order to sweep the Panzergrenadiers and the Fallschirmjägers out of the Ohlugen woods. B Co was sent to the Mill d'Uhrbruck shortly after midnight but became pinned down in an hour long engagement in the forest. They eventually advanced into the enemy and took the position at the cost of 8 killed and 15 wounded, but inflicting 50 German killed. At 1030 in the morning of 25 January, reinforcements arrived to assist the beleaguered defenders. The 314th Infantry Regiment of the 79th Infantry Division arrived to relieve the 222nd. The veterans of the previous night’s action greeted the newcomers with silent gratitude. I Co, off to the north side of the road, and K Co, to the south of the road, looked on as the men of the 314th shoved off into the woods toward the Mill d’Uhrbruck to do battle with the Germans. The 222nd Infantry regiment took a mauling, but held their ground, and received the Presidential Unit Citation for defeating the German onslaught, and bringing an end to Operation Nordwind. Engagements in Germany After the furious engagement of 24–25 January 1945, TF Linden rejoined the rest of the 42nd Infantry Division and went on the offensive into Germany. The regiment moved with the division near their old positions by Haguenau and began patrolling and attacking through the Hardt Forest on 14 February. The men broke through the Siegfried line and advanced rapidly, clearing out many cities and towns on their way. On 1 April 1945, the 42nd Division, including the 222nd Infantry Regiment, captured Wertheim am Main, and crossed the river there. They captured Würzburg after a sharp engagement from 2–6 April. Schweinfurt was captured next after hand-to-hand combat in the city from 9–12 April. Fürth fell to the advancing 222nd next on 18–19 April. Dachau On 29 April, Brigadier General Henning Linden and his aide, First Lieutenant Cowling arrived in Dachau and were heading to rendezvous with the 222nd Infantry for the push into Munich. They were informed that just off the main road was the Dachau Concentration Camp. According to their Official Reports, dated 2 May 1945, prior to finding the camp, they discovered a railroad track with 30-50 boxcars all stacked with emaciated dead bodies. Their party proceeded to the Camp and as they approached the main gate a German Leutnant along with another German soldier and a Red Cross worker approached with a white flag and said they wished to surrender the camp. Linden officially accepted the surrender of the camp in the name of the Rainbow Division for the United States Army. He sent Cowling into the camp for an inspection and he sent another officer to the 222nd to bring back two companies as soon as possible. At the time there were over 30,000 prisoners at the camp. After Dachau was liberated, the US Seventh Army took over the administration of the camp. A team of Army doctors and other military personnel was formed as Displaced Persons Team 115 to take care of the prisoners and they arrived on 30 April with truckloads of food and medical supplies. On 2 May, the 116th Evacuation Hospital arrived, followed by the 127th Evacuation Hospital, to give medical aid to the sick prisoners. Private Carl Segrave from Broken Arrow, Oklahoma, a 19-year-old soldier in the 222nd, spoke to the Tulsa World about what he saw there. In an article published on 11 November 2008, Segrave told Manny Gamallo about what he witnessed; \\"The stench of rotting cadavers. The boxcars filled with the emaciated dead. The storage rooms filled with stacks of recently gassed innocents. The ghastly crematoriums. And the piles upon piles of human ashes. When he saw that, Segrave remembered, he developed a sincere hatred for the Germans. 'I didn't hate them before that, not even during the fighting. We were invading their homeland, so you expected them to defend their country. But this. ,' he said, shaking his head in disgust as he sat in his easy chair at his Broken Arrow home.\\"citation needed - from \\"Tulsa World\\" newspaper article The regiment continued its advance into Germany, and reached Salzburg, Austria at the End of World War II in Europe. Occupation On 14 May, the 42nd Infantry Division moved into the Austrian region of Tyrol and relieved the 36th Infantry Division and was itself eventually relieved by the 20th Armored Division. The 222nd set up checkpoints and road blocks throughout the countryside to halt the escape of German soldiers, SS troops, and Nazi Party officials into the mountains. Roads and trails were patrolled for stragglers and holdouts, but relations with the civilians were not hostile. On 8 July, the 42nd Division moved to the vicinity of Salzburg and conducted similar occupation duties, relieving the 101st Airborne Division. On 9 August, K Co of the 222nd traveled to Vienna, and had the privilege to serve as the Honor guard for General Mark W. Clark. By 2 September, the majority of the 222nd had also moved into Vienna, and in October, soldiers from the 66th Infantry Division who didn't have enough points to go home were transferred to the 222nd Infantry. The regiment served in the occupation of Austria, before its return to the United States, and its deactivation at the end of January 1947.

The brand is founded in 2013 by the Vietnamese Canadian businessman Thanh Le and Thai Nguyen, the professional shoe cobbler in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. Veritas Bespoke has invented a new approach to the traditional shoe-making method: creating bespoke last from 3D scanning technology used in orthopedics footwear. In July 2013, Veritas Bespoke opened its boutique in Calgary. Two years later, Thanh and Nguyen opened their first store in Vietnam at 56 Le Thanh Ton Street, District 1, Ho Chi Minh City  History  In the summer of 2012, Thanh Le, a chemical engineer with an MBA degree met Thai Nguyen, a cobbler, in Calgary. The two men shared the interest in shoe crafting and it was not long before the idea of creating custom-fit shoes that last long. The duo spent days tracking down full-grain leather in France and Italy, and especially, the 3D technology used in making orthopaedic shoes They invented a new bespoke making method . After continuous research, they found out that a virtual and accurate model of the foot created by a 3D scanner used in orthopaedics can be used to build custom-made shoes for individual. Although the process costs much time and effort, it ensures to make shoes that fit like a glove. Using a 3D scanner, a shoemaker can create a bespoke last based on your foot to make the footwear, which is called it ‘functional shoes’ since it will prevent bunion and callus. This new method takes only 3–4 weeks to make a pair of bespoke shoes, instead of 3–6 months in traditional bespoke making method At Veritas Bespoke, prices for bespoke shoes begin at US$1,400 with each added layer of customization priced separately. Apart from bespoke lines, they also have Ready-to-wear (RTW) and Made-To-Order (MTO) shoes according to customer personalization. For MTO, the finished product will be delivered within 2–4 weeks  Present operations  In July 2013, Thanh and Nguyen opened their first store, named Veritas, in Calgary. In July 2015, they opened their first store in the heart of Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. Local people now can find high-end shoes made from the pioneering 3D foot scanning technology, full-grain leather imported from France and Italy. Veritas Bespoke usually uses Goodyear welting for both RTW, MTO and bespoke lines, also offers custom made service like patina, carving, and lifetime shoe care guarantee for all purchases.

Adams wrote this book, a meditative reflection on medieval culture, well after his historical masterpiece, The History of the United States of America (1801–1817). Whereas the latter is a serious academic work of history, Mont Saint Michel and Chartres is far more whimsical, a playful meditative reflection on medieval culture. It was published privately in 1904, originally intended simply for his nieces; in 1913, it was made more widely available when published with the support of the American Institute of Architects. Despite having a far less serious intent than his earlier historical writings, Mont Saint Michel and Chartres has garnered high praise: for example, Maurice le Briton said, “Mont-Saint-Michel and Chartres is undoubtedly Adams's greatest work; though not apparently related to his earlier writings, this inspired work of poetry is the crowning achievement of his severe and somber historical oeuvre.” A few years after Adams published Mont Saint Michel and Chartres, he published his most famous work, the Education of Henry Adams in 1907. Raymond Carney has said of this pair of works: “Taken together they may be read as Adams’ spiritual autobiography—two monumental volumes in which he attempts to bring together in a vast synthesis all of his knowledge of politics, economics, psychology, science, philosophy, art, and literature in order to attempt to understand the individual’s place in history and society.” Carney, frontespiece Style Superficially, the book is framed as a travel journal. “Preceding the title page of the first edition of Mont Saint Michel and Chartres, Henry Adams placed the heading ‘TRAVELS—FRANCE.” ... But it would be hard to imagine a more misleading description than to call it a tour guide.”Carney, p. ix Adams uses the metaphor of tour throughout the book, and refers to the readers as “tourists,” but the tour is less one of a landscape and more one of a worldview. While Adams clearly knows a great deal of history of the period, his aim is not further historical investigation, but rather an almost poetic understanding of that worldview. He wrote: “All these schools had individual character, and all have charm; but we have set out to go from Mont Saint Michel to Chartres in three centuries, the eleventh, the twelfth, and the thirteen, trying to get, on the way, not technical knowledge; not correct views on either history, art, or religion; not anything that can possibly be useful or instructive; but only a sense of what those centuries had to say, and a sympathy with their ways of saying it.”Adams, p. 397 Plan The first chapter treats the cathedral of Mont Saint Michel: its architectural history as well as what the cathedral and its patron represented for the people of that time. The second chapter concerns the great medieval epic Le Chanson de Roland, a poem which, Adams argued, “expressed the masculine and military passions of the Archangel”Adams, p. 370 represented by that first cathedral. Most of the central section of the book, Chapters V – XIII, contains an extended analysis of the Chartres Cathedral, including the architecture and the royal patrons who supported various features. Through much of this, he speaks of the Virgin as a queen whose preferences are expressed in the cathedral, in each chapter extending the analogy further. By chapter XIII, Adams demonstrates how central worship of the Virgin was to the religion of the time: “True it was, although one should not say it jestingly, that the Virgin embarrassed the Trinity; and perhaps this was the reason, behind all the other excellent reasons, why men loved and adored her with a passion such as no other deity has ever known ...”Adams, p. 596 The last three chapters take up purely philosophical topics. Chapter XIV focuses on the turbulent career of the gifted scholar Peter Abelard. Chapter XV, focuses on the mystics, principally the poet Adam of St. Victor and St. Francis of Assisi. In the final chapter, he focuses on St. Thomas Aquinas, drawing an extensive comparison between the Church Intellectual that Aquinas built and the Church Architectural that the mason had built. “St. Thomas’ Church was the most expressive that man ever made, and the great gothic cathedrals were its most complete expression.”Adams, p. 695 Ultimately, Adams regards Aquinas as a “great artist.”Adams, p. 692 References Bibliography * Adams, Henry.

The are specialized detective units of the Prefectural police headquarters (PPH) of Japan, mandated for critical incidents including crime investigation and even SWAT operations.  History  In the 1960s, the increase of serious criminal cases such as kidnapping, aircraft hijacking, piracy and bombing became a serious problem in Japan. The kidnapping case of Yoshinobu Murakoshi, a four- year-old child, raised significant questions to solve these kind of cases. In this case, Hachibē Hiratsuka, a detective assigned to the case, was able to apprehend the suspect, but it was too late to save the victim. It became clear that traditional criminal investigation systems were sluggish and outdated for these new-style, rapid-tempo, and sometimes lethal cases. As a response to these problems, the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department (TMPD) established the SIT unit within their Criminal Investigation Bureau in 1964. These detectives were well acquainted with new technology and special tactics to track and capture the criminals quickly and accurately. At the beginning, the name \\"SIT\\" came from an acronym of its romanized Japanese unit name, , but later, the origin of its name as an acronym of its English nickname, Special Investigation Team, was added afterwards by misunderstanding from an officer who is fluent in English. This idea achieved a great success that in 1970, the National Police Agency (NPA) requested the establishment of these kind of units for other Prefectural Police forces throughout Japan. These detectives also became responsible for intervening and rescuing when hostages were in danger. In 1992, TMPD strengthened the SWAT capability by incorporating several SAP operators into its SIT.  Organization  = Structure = All unit are established in the of each Prefectural police headquarters (PPHs). These units are generally local-based, so organizations (including their unit names) and equipment are varied. Among them, the Special Investigations Team (SIT) of the TMPD and the Martial Arts Attack Team (MAAT) of the Osaka PPH are the first units to be created and still the most prominent units nationwide even now. In the First Criminal Investigation Division of the TMPD, the following units are assigned for special criminal investigation activities: *      Of all these units, Units One and Two are in charge of hostage cases and especially known as \\"SIT\\". As of the early 2000s, there were over 60 detectives in total for these seven units, and about 30 detectives with Unit One and Two alone. On the contrary, some rural PPHs assign only one or two detectives to these offices, so in case of SWAT operations, these units can be reinforced by detectives of , first responders for initial criminal investigations. When these rural PPHs were faced with critical incidents requiring a special investigation, the NPA ordered the TMPD or Osaka PPH units to dispatch advisers to the relevant PPH customary. And later, this custom evolved into the as a formal institution of the NPA, being made up of experienced detectives selected from across the country. These detectives usually work at their respective PPHs, but they may be dispatched to other PPHs to provide advice to the local commander as needed. The Task Force also conducts research on special investigations, such as participating in training at the Federal Bureau of Investigation of the United States, and regular joint training sessions are held to disseminate its outcomes. And the SIT of the TMPD has also received advice on SWAT operation from the Far East Field Office of the Naval Criminal Investigative Service in Yokosuka. = Capabilities = For manhunt missions, detectives of these units are well acquainted with many technique and technology such as telephone tapping, stakeout, surveillance, and crisis negotiation. And in order to restrain violent criminals quickly, they also have tactical capabilities. In addition to standard service handguns (.38 Special caliber revolvers such as New Nambu M60, or .32 ACP caliber semi-automatic pistols such as SIG Sauer P230), some units are equipped with large 9×19mm Parabellum caliber semi-automatic pistols (Beretta 92 Vertec, for example) and pistol-caliber carbines (Heckler & Koch MP5SFK, semi-automatic variant of MP5K with foldable stock). They also use non-lethal weapons such as FN 303 or BGL-65. Counter-terrorism operations are the affairs of the operators of the Security Divisions, such as Special Assault Teams (SAT) or Anti-firearms squads, so these SWAT-capable detectives are mandated for critical incidents except terrorism. However, in some rural but well-versed Prefectural Police like Aomori, these detectives can form a counter-terrorism task force together with uniformed officers and riot specialists. = List of SIT or similar units in the published range = * Special Investigation Team - Akita, Iwate, Ibaraki, Miyagi, Fukushima, Tochigi, Shizuoka, Aichi, Mie, Fukuoka, Nagasaki, and Tokyo * Martial Arts Attack Team - Osaka * Assault Response Team - Chiba * Special Tactical Section - Saitama * Special Investigation Section - Kanagawa * Technical Special Team - Aomori * Hostage Rescue Team - Hiroshima * Martial Attacking Rescue Section - Ehime  References  = Books =  * *  See also  * Research and Intervention Brigade - Similar units of the French National Police Category:Law enforcement in Japan Category:Special forces of Japan ","title":"Special Investigation Team"},{"id":"51969426","text":"Elma Soiron (8 June 1918 in Acomb, Yorkshire – May 2016 in London) was an English actress, who was best known for playing Madame Dubois in \\"The Path of Duty\\", the fourth episode of the first series of the British television series, Upstairs, Downstairs (31 October 1971), and Madame Huguot in \\"A Patriotic Offering\\", the first episode of the fourth series, first broadcast on 14 September 1974 on ITV.

It is based on the 1974 novel of the same name by Lois Duncan. The film was released on August 17, 2018 with a limited release in theaters and a direct-to-VOD, by Summit Entertainment. Plot Kit Gordy (AnnaSophia Robb), a difficult young girl, is sent to the mysterious Blackwood Boarding School when her delinquent behavior becomes too much for her school to handle. When she arrives at Blackwood, Kit meets eccentric headmistress Madame Duret (Uma Thurman) and the school's only other students, four teenage girls with similar behavioral problems (Veronica, Ashley, Sierra, and Izzy, respectively). Technology is rarely used, and the girls can only phone their families in the domineering presence of the headmistress. The girls attend a variety of creative and intellectual classes, which begins to draw out unknown talents in the girls. Sierra is the first to show a troubling obsession with her work, losing sleep, refusing to eat, and going into odd trances while creating amazing works of art. Ashley writes beautiful poetry and stories that deeply disturb her. Kit and Izzy slowly begin to experience the same bad side effects, saying it was like someone else was using their bodies. Only the belligerent Veronica shows no progress, much to Madame Duret's annoyance. During art class Kit notices that all of Sierra's paintings are signed \\"TC\\" and searches the school's library for answers. She realizes that Sierra is recreating paintings by the deceased artist Thomas Cole, and that the others are producing work from other dead genuises. Kit convinces Veronica to search the restricted areas of the school, where they come across old student records and more information on the people possessing the girls. When Madame Duret discovers Veronica alone she chains her up in an unused part of the school, explaining that the students are not merely vessels for the dead, but donors, unknowingly sacrificing themselves to be used to continue the careers of famous minds, whom she is able to commune with and channel into the girls' bodies. Kit calls the police and confronts the headmistress about everything. By now Sierra has already died from overwork, and Ashley jumps to her death to stop the possession taking over completely. While struggling to free Veronica, Kit knocks over some candles, and fire quickly spreads throughout the old building. Izzy succumbs to the beauty of the flames, leaving only Kit and Veronica to escape. Madame Duret is eventually possessed by her former pupils and consumed by the fire. Kit passes out and meets her deceased father, who convinces her to stay and live. She wakes up in the back of an ambulance with her mother by her side.

The geological deformation explains the location of earthquakes, volcanoes, fissures, and the shape of the island. Iceland is the largest landmass (102,775 km²) situated on an oceanic ridge. It is an elevated plateau of the sea floor, situated at the crossing of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and the Greenland-Iceland-Faeroe Ridge. It lies along the oceanic divergent plate boundary of North American Plate and Eurasian Plate. The western part of Iceland sits on the North American Plate and the eastern part sits on the Eurasian Plate. The Reykjanes Ridge of the Mid-Atlantic ridge system in this region crosses the island from southwest and connects to the Kolbeinsey Ridge in the northeast. Iceland is geologically young: all rocks there were formed within the last 25 million years. It started forming in the Early Miocene sub-epoch, but the oldest rocks found at the surface of Iceland are from the Middle Miocene sub-epoch. Nearly half of Iceland was formed from a slow spreading period from 9 to 20 million years ago (Ma). The geological structures and geomorphology of Iceland are strongly influenced by the spreading plate boundary and the Iceland hotspot. The buoyancy of the deep-seated mantle plume underneath has uplifted the Iceland Basalt Plateau to as high as 3000 meters. The hot spot also produces high volcanic activity on the plate boundary. There are two major geologic and topographic structural trends in Iceland. One strikes northeast in Southern Iceland and strikes nearly north in northern Iceland. The other one strikes approximately west-northwest. Altogether they produce a zigzag pattern. The pattern is shown by faults, volcanic fissures, valleys, dikes, volcanoes, grabens and fault scarps.  Deformation of Iceland  The geological deformation of Iceland is mainly caused by the active spreading of the mid- oceanic ridge. Extensional cracks and transform faults are found perpendicular to the spreading direction. The transform-fault zones are also known as fracture zones. These fracture zones allow large volumes of lava to be erupted. On the surface of Iceland, linear volcanic fissures formed along the rifts and appear in a swarm-like pattern. They are connected by fracture zones, forming the volcanic zones. = Plate boundary deformation zone = Crustal movements have created two plate boundary deformation zones between the major plates, the North American Plate and the Eurasian Plate. In northern Iceland, the width of the deformation zone is about 100 km wide. It accumulates strain which come from rifting episodes and larger earthquakes. In southern Iceland, the block located along the plate boundary is identified as a microplate and is named the Hreppar Block. The deformation zone is relatively small since it has no significant evidence of active deformation, earthquakes or volcanism. The northern boundary of the block is linked to the Central Iceland Volcanic Zone (CIVZ), where diffuse volcanism occur. The southern boundary of the block is termed the South Iceland Seismic Zone, where strike-slip earthquakes can occur. = Transform fault zones = There are two major and active transform faults zones striking west-northwest in northern and southern Iceland. Two large fracture zones, associated with the transform faults, namely Tjörnes and Reykjanes Fracture Zones are found striking about 75°N to 80°W.  Bookshelf faulting  thumbFig 2. Bookshelf faulting mechanism: The transform fault is induced by strike-slip motion (sinistral movement) that is transverse to the fault zone. The blocks between the faults are slightly rotated afterwards, moving in a dextral movement. Stress is built up during the spreading movements at the plate boundary. The accumulated stress in transform fault zones is released during strike-slip earthquakes. The transform fault is induced by strike-slip motion that is transverse to the fault zone. The blocks between the faults are slightly rotated afterwards. A diagram (fig.2) is shown to illustrate this phenomenon. Since the rotation of the blocks is similar to a line of books leaning on a bookshelf, it is termed \\"bookshelf faulting\\". Bookshelf faulting is an indicator of the young geological history of the fault zones. It is common in the Reykjanes Fracture Zones.  Other evidence  Besides bookshelf faulting, the presence of the Icelandic fault zones are supported by seismological evidence. In Iceland, deformation usually concentrates over a zone of finite width. Thus, earthquakes usually occur along the active fracture zones between ridge crests. Most earthquake activity in Iceland is focused in the transform faulting zones near the north and south coast.  Tjörnes Fracture Zone  The Tjörnes Fracture Zone (TFZ) is a tectonically complicated area. It connects the North Iceland Volcanic Zone (NVZ) and the southern end of the Kolbeinsey Ridge. This 50 km wide fracture zone is characterised by seismic activity, crustal extension and transform faulting. The volcanic fissure swarms of the Northern Volcanic Zone are connected to the southern end of Tjörnes Fracture Zone. For example, its southeast end is connected to the Krafla fissure swarm. The main structural components of the Tjörnes Fracture Zone can be divided into three parts which trend from northwest to southeast, the Grímsey seismic zone, the Húsavík-Flatey fault zone and the Dalvík seismic zone. The Tjörnes Fracture Zone shows a huge spatial difference in seismic activity. For example, the westernmost part of the Tjörnes Fracture Zone shows seismic activity, but a few larger earthquakes (>M=5.5) also appear in the zone. The complexity in the Tjörnes Fracture Zone can be generally explained by the magmatic processes and plate motions. The velocity of the divergent plate motion, estimated to be 18.9 mm/year ±0.5 mm/year, is strongly affected by the Icelandic mantle plume underneath central Iceland. Volcanic activity can be found in the Dalvík seismic zone and southern tip of the Kolbeinsey Ridge.  South Iceland Seismic Zone  The South Iceland Seismic Zone (SISZ), also known as the Reykjanes Fracture Zone (or Zones), is 75 to 100 km wide, and strikes northeast to southwest in southwestern Iceland. There are several approximately 40 km right lateral offsets of the ridge crest. The offsets create a transform fault zone connecting the Eastern Volcanic Zone and the Reykjanes. There is a significant change in the age and lithology of the volcanoes in a north-south direction near Reykjanes peninsula due to bookshelf faulting. Bookshelf faulting is common in the South Iceland Seismic Zone. Since the transform motion in the South Iceland Seismic Zone is left-lateral, right-lateral faulting would occur and rotation of blocks would appear counterclockwise. The sequential occurrence of major earthquakes in the South Iceland Seismic Zone provided evidence of bookshelf faulting. Within a single event, earthquakes begin in the eastern part of the South Iceland Seismic Zone with larger magnitudes and end up with smaller magnitudes in western part of the zone. In the transform fault zones of Iceland, earthquakes usually occur on small scales (micro-earthquakes) due to plate straining and pore fluid pressure. A large amount of pore fluid pressure migrates from the brittle- ductile transition zone (~10 km) to the lithostatic boundary at 3 km depth. Large scale seismic activity is triggered if the pressure cannot pass through the transition zone. Small scale earthquakes are also released locally in or above the migration path. In 2000, a large earthquake (M=6.6) occurred in the South Iceland Seismic Zone. During this event, small scale earthquakes concentrated narrowly and linearly around the transform fault planes.Stefánsson, R., Guðmundsson, G. B., & Roberts, M. J. (2006).

Thus, with the same method, small scale earthquakes are also used to identify fault planes in the Tjörnes Fracture Zone. = Volcanic rift zones = Location of the volcanic rift zones and main volcanoes.  Rift jump model  The evolution of the Icelandic volcanic rift zones can be explained by the rift jump model. Synform folding is expected to occur at the active rift axis. However, distinctive reversals in dip directions are found in south-western Iceland which indicate an anticline. It is believed that the relative positions of the Icelandic hot spot and the active rift spreading axis have changed with time. Assuming the Icelandic mantle plume is stationary, the spreading axis must have changed position. The spreading axis migrates westward at a rate of 0.3 cm/year. After the active spreading axis has moved away from the plume, the mantle plume would adjust the position of the axis and forms a new rift closer to its centre. The migrated axis would gradually become extinct. There are three major volcanic zones in Iceland, which are the Northern, Eastern and Western Volcanic Zones (NVZ, EVZ, WVZ). The volcanic rift zones cross the island from southwest to northeast. Each zone consists of 20–50 km wide belts and is characterised by active volcanoes, numerous normal faults, a high temperature geothermal field and fissure swarms. The currently active zones are the Northern Volcanic Zone and Western Volcanic Zone. The Eastern Volcanic Zone will eventually take over the Western Volcanic Zone according to the rift jump process.  Northern Volcanic Zone  The 50 km wide Northern Volcanic Zone (NVZ) is composed of five volcanic systems arranged zigzag-like along the mid-Atlantic plate boundary. It shows quite low seismic activity. The volcanic activity is confined to the Krafla central volcano and its associated fissure swarms. The Krafla central volcano is not distinctive within the volcanic rift zone. Fissure swarms of the Krafla spread away from the magma chamber and magma flows along the swarms to the north and south of the volcano. Eruptive fissures within the fissure swarms are most common within 20–30 km distance from the central volcanoes. Fractures within the fissure swarms are common at up to a distance of 70–90 km from the central volcano. Fractures within the fissure swarms are generally subparallel to each other. Irregular fracture patterns are found where the Húsavík transform fault meets the fissure swarms, which indicates interaction between the fissure swarms and the strike-slip faults.  Eastern Volcanic Zone  The Eastern Volcanic Zone (EVZ) is located in south-east Iceland. It connects to the South Iceland Seismic Zone and NVC in its western and northern end respectively. Seismic activity focuses in the Vatnajökull Glacier area which is the accepted location of the Icelandic hot spot. Deformed structures, including northeast trending eruptive fissure swarms and normal faults, can be found in Eastern Volcanic Zone.Þórarinsson, S., Sæmundsson, K., & Williams, R. S. (1973). ERTS-1 image of Vatnajökull: analysis of glaciological, structural, and volcanic features. Long hyaloclastite ridges, formed by subglacial eruptions during the last glacial period, are distinctive structures in the Eastern Volcanic Zone. Compared with Western Volcanic Zone, eruptive fissure swarms and hyaloclastite ridges are generally longer in the Eastern Volcanic Zone. During the past glacial period, a huge volume of basaltic eruptions occurred, producing the long volcanic fissure swarms. The Eastern Volcanic Zone is geologically young, as mentioned above, the Eastern Volcanic Zone will eventually take over the Western Volcanic Zone according to the rift jump process model.  Western Volcanic Zone (WVZ)  The Western Volcanic Zone is located to the north of the South Iceland Seismic Zone, where its northern end connects to the Langjökull area. It has been the active propagating rift in the last 7 million years. Volcanic fissures and normal faulting are common features in the southern part of the Western Volcanic Zone. In the northern part of the Western Volcanic Zone, normal faulting is still common but volcanic fissures become less dominant. Shield volcanoes are also observed in this zone. Þingvellir Graben is clear evidence as proof of divergent plate movement in Iceland. It shows a clear extensional feature.

If a ship makes long, slow rolls and takes time resuming a vertical position, it is referred to as crank, cranky, crank-sided, tender, or tender-sided. If the ship snaps back to its vertical position when heeled, it is called ʻstiff.ʼ Stiffness refers to a ship's power to stand up to her canvas, and will offer great resistance to inclination from the upright, when under sail. Although stiff is considered good in the case of many ships, there are extreme cases in which the vessel will be too stiff and resist the tendency to heel under wind pressure, which may cause damage to masts, rigging, and structure. According to Arthur Nelson, “most new Tudor ships were affected slightly on completion, one way or the other.\\" The reason a ship may be crank cannot be summarized as one precise, underlying cause, but rather as anything that may affect the relationship of the centre of buoyancy and the centre of gravity to each other; essentially, anything that affects the ship's stability. The stability of a ship will at any moment depend: *on her external form and proportions *on her immediate comparative displacement and depth of immersion *on the momentary distribution of her weights, as affecting the position of her ʻcentre of gravityʼ The summation of all the weights is an important aspect of the stability of a ship. Fixtures, fittings, masts, rigging, crew, ballast, etc., will affect a ship's stability based on their individual movements about the centreline of the ship. These weights will exert a downward force on the vertical centreline (imagining a line drawn through the centre of the ship and the metacentre is the point in the middle). The centre of the submerged part of the hull acts as an upward force on the vertical centreline, and so these two forces have to be balanced with the sea at the waterline of the ship when it is at rest. By looking at the various weights, distributions and contributing factors that may effect its buoyancy, remedies can be attempted to solve what has affected the ship's stability. In the case of the Gresham Ship (1574), furring was the chosen method to solve its crankness.  References  * Wagstaffe, Cate. 2010. Furring in the light of 16th century ship design.

Shmuel Erlich (born July 11, 1937 in Frankfurt) is an Israeli psychoanalyst, organizational consultant and psychologist of clinical psychology. Since 1990 he has been professor of the Sigmund Freud Chair at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. In 2005 he became emeritus. Erlich is one of the spiritual fathers of the Nazareth-Conferences. Education and career Almost two years after Shmuel Erlich's birth, at the end of 1938, his parents left Nazi Germany because of the political developments and the growing threat to the German-Jewish family and went to Palestine with their son. They arrived there at the beginning of 1939. Shmuel Erlich grew up in Tel Aviv. From 1954 to 1971 he lived in the United States where he completed his psychological training. After his return to Israel he has been residing in Jerusalem. He speaks German, English and Hebrew. Austen Riggs Center Shmuel Erlich studied psychology at the City College of New York (CCNY) where he graduated in 1959 with a Bachelor's degree. In 1965 he received his doctorate in clinical psychology at New York University (NYU). From 1965 to 1967 he was granted a post-graduate scholarship from the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) which made it possible for him to do research in clinical psychology at the Austen Riggs Center in Stockbridge, Massachusetts. Already certified as a clinical psychologist, he received another certificate in 1971 in which the American Board of Professional Psychology (ABPP) elected him as the best in his profession. That same year he was certified by the Israel Psychological Association as a Supervisor for Psychotherapy and Psychodiagnostics. In 1972 he became lecturer in clinical psychology at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. In 1983 he completed his training as psychoanalyst at the Israeli Institute of Psychoanalysis, initially receiving the basic membership in the Israel Psychoanalytic Society (IPS) and in 1985 the so-called full membership. Since 1987 he has been a training analyst. In 1985 he was a founding member of OFEK, the Israeli Association for the Study of Groups and Organizational Processes. After Eric Miller had led the first two conferences of OFEK, Erlich became director of the following four. From 1993 to 1997 he was Chairman of the Education Committee of the Psychoanalytic Institute and of the Professional Society in Israel. From 1999 to 2002 he was President of IPS. Psychiatric Hospital Eitanim In 2000 Shmuel Erlich took over the chairmanship of a working group in the European Psychoanalytical Federation (EPF), a position he held until 2006. This working group focuses on the relationship between psychoanalytic knowledge of the inner experience and its connection to the exterior reality. In 2003 the International Psychoanalytical Association (IPA) nominated him as the regional representative for Europe of the newly constituted Board of Representatives, a position he held until 2015. From 2005 to 2011 he was chairman of the Education Committee in the IPA. In 2010 he wrote the \\"Letter from Jerusalem\\" for the International Journal of Psychoanalysis as part of an initiative of the journal with which various psychoanalytic societies could introduce themselves to the international professional audience. As a co-founder of the Nazareth-Conferences he has been part of the so-called staff since 1994, a position he maintained in subsequent conferences under the auspices of Partners in Confronting Collective Atrocities (PCCA). In 2012 Erlich was Director of the first European Conference of the PCCA which took place at Kliczków Castle in Poland with the title European Perpetrators and Victims - Then and Now. The second European Conference took place in 2014 and a third one in 2016. In addition to his academic career Shmuel Erlich has been a senior psychologist at the Psychiatric Hospital Eitanim near Jerusalem. There he has set up a ward for young people which he has led for 15 years.  Work and research  The focus of Shmuel Erlich's scientific interest and work is psychoanalytic theory and its applications, including psychotherapy and the exploration of identity. Specifically, it deals with the impact of external trauma – particularly in connection with terrorist attacks – as well as with research of organizational processes. = Organizational consultations = With his organizational consultations Shmuel Erlich wants to contribute to a deeper understanding that organizations have of themselves, their structures and power relationships, allowing them to become aware of the role of possible corruption and regressive processes. According to Erlich, this awareness could lead to changes of all of these phenomena. He believes that this is true for any organization, including psychoanalytic training institutes, as well as German institutes, which call him occasionally, as a supervisor or as lecturer. = Groups in conflict = Shmuel Erlich directs special attention to conflicts in which members of different national groups are entangled with each other. In order to explore these conflicts, he uses the method of the so-called Group Relations Conferences. They are based on the model of the so-called Leicester Conferences which were developed at the Tavistock Institute in London. The aim of such conferences is to help participants develop the ability to take on responsibility of various social roles. To this goal Erlich still feels committed, organizing conferences for different groups in conflict or being involved in their organization. According to Shmuel Erlich, these Group Relation Conferences are intended to close the gap which usually exists between the view of one's own inner world – experiences, fantasies, and the like – and the outer world of reality. To achieve this goal, a psychoanalytic and a social systems theory approach are combined. Through these conferences a place for conscious experience of a previously perceived role and the possible development of a new one is created. The aim here is to understand hostility as something that originates not only through the experience of external reality, but is also constructed by the inner reality. With his method Erlich wants to encourage people to think rationally in emotionally-charged situations in order to gain a deeper understanding of how social and political events influence one's mind and soul. Edward R. Shapiro evaluates Erlich's efforts in his review: = Psychoanalysis = In his psychoanalytic work Shmuel Erlich was initially dedicated to the study of the mental and emotional experience of young people and later researched in detail how experiences are processed.  Youth  After he had created the ward for young people at the Psychiatric Hospital Eitanim, Shmuel Erlich remained there for fifteen years. This gave him opportunities to study the quality of experiences of young people and adolescents. For example, the “Role of Denial in Adolescence” interested him. He suggested “to consider the development crisis of adolescence through the use of denial”. In his psychoanalytic work Shmuel Erlich was not only interested in individual cases, but also how they are embedded in their environment and political reality. This is demonstrated in a case study which describes the reactions of young people to the assassination of former Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin.  Processing of experiences  Shmuel Erlich's scientific interest was directed early on to the question of how people process their inner mental and emotional experiences. He describes in detail what he means by such an experience. It is constituted by the perception of external and internal realities, as well as by the conscious and the unconscious and it is then mentally organized. Erlich views the data of the external reality, which people absorb with their senses, at one pole, and the structured experience of their inner world at the other pole. In between the poles he describes a consolidation process. This process is both innate and “socially constructed”. Through this process, Erlich says, sensations are continuously “absorbed, digested, assimilated, and structured.” This process, which is described by Erlich as “Experience Modalities”, largely eludes conscious awareness and voluntary control. The process has a major influence on the way in which people view themselves and also how they organize their relationships with their fellow human beings and their environment. He describes two ways of relating that are very different from each other. They are similar to what Winnicott calls modes of “Being and Doing”. If people find themselves in “Doing Mode”, their opposite partner is seen as separate and independent, and the relationship is based on “cause and effect, dominated by purpose and aim, direct and chronological”. In contrast to the \\"Doing Mode\\" Erlich describes the mode of \\"Being\\" in which the boundaries between the self and the opposite partner fuse together. In the experience of the person who is in this mode, boundaries no longer exist. According to Erlich, this can lead to numerous conflicts in interpersonal relationships, and there can also be considerable difficulties in processing losses.

In 1656 he married and they had one child; in 1660, after his wife's death, he married again; their son born in 1661 died soon after birth. He taught himself mathematics, astrology, Latin and French. From 1663 he lived in Baldwins Gardens, where he taught astrology and mathematics, and received clients. By the 1670s he had a flourishing practice. In 1669 Coley published Clavis Astrologiæ Elimata; or a Key to the whole Art of Astrology, new filed and polished. It was well received. A second and enlarged edition was published in 1676; it was dedicated to Elias Ashmole, and included a tribute by William Lilly. In 1672, following the success of Clavis, he published the first number of his almanac, and it appeared annually until his death. William Lilly's amanuensis Coley acted as William Lilly's amanuensis from 1677, when the latter was stricken with the illness of which he eventually died. The editor of Lilly's Autobiography tells us: \\"His judgments and observations for the succeeding years till his death were all composed by his directions, Mr. Coley coming to Hersham the beginning of every summer, and stayed there till by conference with him he had despatched them for the press; to whom at these opportunities he communicated his way of judgment and other 'Arcana. Lilly constantly makes reference in his works to Coley's merit as a man and as a professor of mathematics and occult science. On his death in 1681, Lilly bequeathed to him his almanac Merlini Anglici Ephemeris, or Astrological Judgment for the Year, which had reached its thirty-sixth year of publication; from 1681 it was issued by Coley \\"according to the method of Mr. Lilly.\\" After Lilly's death, Coley continued to publish his predictions, as for instance, The great and wonderful Predictions of that late famous Astrologer, William Lilly, Mr. Partridge, and Mr. Coley concerning this present year 1683. Coley attained considerable distinction as a mathematician: we are told by his almanac that he taught \\"arithmetic, vulgar, decimal, and logarithmical, geometry, trigonometry, astronomy, navigation, the use of the celestial and terrestrial globes, dialling, surveying, gaging, measuring, and the art of astrology in all its branches,\\" at Baldwins Gardens. He corrected and enlarged Joseph Moxon's Mathematics made easy (London, 1692), and also William Forster's Arithmetic, or that useful art made easie (London, 1686). Coley died in London on 30 April 1704.

He is currently contracted with South Australia. Cricket career Cormack first made his name in Australia's Under-19 National Championships, in which he was the leading wicket-taker with 21 wickets and a bowling average of 16.57. He started playing for South Australia in the Futures League in the 2015–16 season and was named in Australia's squad for the 2016 Under-19 Cricket World Cup, though Australia pulled out of the tournament in Bangladesh due to security concerns. Cormack was given a rookie contract with South Australia for the 2016–17 season and was named in the state's squad for the 2016–17 Matador BBQs One-Day Cup. He made his List A debut on 12 October 2016 against New South Wales. He was thrown in the deep end when the team's captain, Callum Ferguson, decided he would open the bowling after New South Wales won the toss and chose to bat first. Making the task more daunting was the fact that four of New South Wales' top six batsmen had represented Australia in international matches. Despite the difficult task presented to him, Cormack impressed with bowling figures of 1/42 from 10 overs, taking the key wicket of New South Wales captain Moises Henriques. After the one-day tournament, Cormack spent the rest of the season playing for South Australia in the Futures League and also played for a South Australia XI in a tour match against the touring South Africans. Cormack was chosen to be a part of Australia's National Performance Squad in 2017 and his rookie contract with South Australia was renewed for the 2017–18 season. South Australian coach Jamie Siddons was excited ahead of the season of the prospect of Cormack playing a few games for the team because of his ability to bowl a doosra, a ball which spins in the opposite direction to his normal delivery. He played four matches for the Redbacks during the 2017–18 JLT One-Day Cup and was selected to play for a Cricket Australia XI in a tour match at Adelaide Oval against the touring England Test team.

Robin Nelson Dudding (7 December 1935 – 21 April 2008) was a New Zealand literary editor and journalist who founded the influential literary journal Islands (1972–1988). He was also editor of the literary journals Landfall (1966–1972) and Mate (1957–1966), and publisher of a number of novels and poetry and essay collections. He has been called the “most gifted and significant literary editor” of his generation, having given many New Zealand writers their first prominent outlet.  Background  Dudding was born in Hastings in the Hawke’s Bay, son of Ernest, a baker, and Winifred (née Hinton) a schoolteacher. He attended Hastings High School, where he developed an interest in writing and literature.  Career  Dudding was a cadet reporter at the Hawke's Bay Herald-Tribune from 1952 until moving to Auckland in the mid 1950s. He joined the Auckland Star, after a short time working as a freelance “seagull” labourer on the wharves. In 1959 he left the Star to train as a primary schoolteacher. While still a reporter, Dudding fell in with the Auckland literary set, whose gatherings revolved around the Queen’s Ferry pub in the central city. In 1957 he took over the co-editorship, and then full editorship, of the magazine Mate, whose first edition had been edited by the poet Kevin Ireland. Contributions to Mate 2 included Barry Crump’s first published story, as well as writing by Maurice Gee, Frank Sargeson and Ireland. Mate was produced from Dudding’s home in Torbay on Auckland’s North Shore, and he supported his unpaid literary endeavours and his growing family with full-time work as a reporter, and later teacher. In 1966 Dudding moved to Christchurch to take over the editorship of literary journal Landfall from founder Charles Brasch, and to be general editor of the Caxton Press. In 1972 he was fired from Caxton and founded his own magazine, Islands, once again supporting literary editing with other work, including freelance editing, teaching and gardening. The magazine was swiftly recognised as the “pre-eminent literary periodical of the 1970s”, and was published by Dudding, with occasional pauses, until 1988. There were 38 issues in all. From the mid-1980s Dudding wrote the Bookmarks column for the New Zealand Listener and was later a subeditor for the magazine. In 2003 he was guest editor of the annual online anthology Best New Zealand Poems.  Awards and prizes  In 1976, an issue of Islands was devoted to the Ian Wedde novel Dick Seddon’s Great Dive, which won the 1977 Book Award for Fiction. The following year, Dudding published Kevin Ireland’s poetry collection Literary Cartoons, which won the 1979 Book Award for Poetry. Dudding was awarded Auckland University’s first Literary Fellowship in 1979. In April 2008 he was awarded an honorary doctorate for literature by Auckland University, but died of emphysema two days before the ceremony. His award was received on his behalf by his family.  Personal  Dudding married Lois Yvonne Miller in 1958. They had five daughters and a son. He was an enthusiastic gardener and chicken breeder. He was a heavy smoker until his late 50s. In November 2016 Victoria University Press published a memoir about Dudding by his journalist son Adam Dudding, entitled My Father's Island, which is shortlisted in the general non-fiction category of the Ockham New Zealand Book Awards.

Biography Born on the island of Jersey, Campbell was a sporty child who progressed through youth competitions to compete internationally in athletics for Britain. As a middle-distance runner Campbell competed in the 400 meters and 800 metres. He reached the second round of the 400m in 1968 and broke the British record in qualifying for the 800m in 1972, though running with an injury he did not progress out of the first round. He also competed for England at the 1970 and 1974 Commonwealth Games. He subsequently answered an advert calling for trialists for the British bobsleigh team and, having successfully competed in these, was selected for the 1976 four-man bob team, where Britain finished 13th.

He is a member of the People's Democratic Party and was the party's candidate for House of Representatives in 2015. Early life Oduoye was born (October 6, 1970) in Ibadan to the family of Late Senator & Chief (Mrs) Simeon Olasunkanmi Oduoye of Ikirun in Ifelodun Local Government Area of Osun State. The Senior Oduoye was military governor of Niger and Ebonyi States between 1996 and 1999. He retired as an Assistant Inspector General in the Nigerian Police in 1999. He also represented Osun Central Senatorially District in the Nigerian Senate from 2003 to 2007. Kayode Oduoye attended INRI Experimental Nursery and Primary School, Onireke, Ibadan; St.Richard's Catholic Primary School, Jericho, Ibadan, and the famous Government College, Ibadan (GCI) where he sat for his West African School Certificate Examination in 1988. Career Oduoye gained admission to study Law at the Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, in 1989; however, because of the unrest in the institution that year, he, like many \\"Jambites\\" of that time, did not resume academic work until 1990. From OAU, he received a Second Class Upper grade in Law in 1995 and also finished as the best foreign student in the Master of Law class at the University of Buckingham, United Kingdom, in 1998. He majored in International Trade and Commercial Law. Upon his return to Nigeria from his overseas studies, Oduoye set up ShalomKay Group. The company is involved in telecommunication, energy, oil and gas. Politics Oduoye's foray into politics began in 2001, but because of the circumstance of his father's involvement in the politics as well, Kayode did not seek any political position at that time. However, he was actively involved in the youth mobilization activities for his father's successful senate bid in 2003. Nevertheless, in 2015 he contested for a seat in the House of Representatives to represent the constituents of Ifelodun/Odo- Otin/Boripe Federal Constituency of Osun State. Based on the feelers from his party agents which indicated the election was skewed to favour his opponent, Oduoye was persuaded by his numerous supporters to challenge the results of the election at the Election Tribunal. On 16 December 2015, the Court of Appeal in Akure upheld the decision of the trial Tribunal led by Justice A.G. Kwajaffa and finally resolved the case against him. Personal life Oduoye is married to the popular Nollywood actress Mosunmola Filani-Oduoye. The marriage was solemnized at Graceville Chapel, Ikeja, on 29 April 2012 following a traditional wedding that took place 19 February 2012 in Ibadan. It is believed that his father, who died 21 March 2014, left a large sum of money to him, and critics cite that as the source of his philanthropic contributions. Philanthropy Oduoye sprang into prominence as a result of his philanthropic activities. He is widely accepted in his ancestral home of Ikirun, nay Osun State . According to an Osun-based Agunbe Advocacy Group, as reported by a national newspaper Dailypost: > ‘’Kayode Oduoye(Superkay) is a man who can represent us adequately.

History  Koreana was initially launched as an English-language magazine in the fall of 1987. The first Japanese edition was issued the following year, and in 1993, soon after South Korea and China established diplomatic relations, the Chinese edition was introduced. The Spanish and French editions followed soon, and as the hallyu (Korean Wave) began to spread at the turn of the new millennium, Koreana responded to the rising global interest in Korean culture by launching Arabic, German, Indonesian, and Russian editions. With the emergence of digital media, Koreana further broadened its relationships through webzine and e-book services. Most recently, Vietnamese and Korean editions were made available as webzines to further diversify the channels of intercultural communication with netizens around the world. Koreana has dealt with a broad spectrum of Korean arts and culture, ranging from Paleolithic relics to contemporary media and installation art; from the splendid royal court culture of the Joseon Dynasty to today’s street art and fashion, from literature to film and various other cultural genres. In doing so, the magazine has helped people around the world to appreciate the universality and distinctiveness of Korean culture and also contributed to the mission of the Korea Foundation: “Connecting People, Bridging the World.” Koreana is distributed to universities, libraries, museums, research centers and various other cultural and art institutions in about 150 countries. = Anniversaries = During a reception celebrating the publication of Koreana's 100th issue in 2012, Mark C. Minton, President of the Korea Society, declared, “There is no better publication on Korean culture and the arts. The articles are extremely informative and the photographs are beautiful.” In 2017, Koreana marked its 30th anniversary by publishing a first-ever Korean language print issue (see inset photo). The quarterly's past and current issues are freely accessible online as webzines. Alternatively, readers from around the world can subscribe for one to three years and have the magazine mailed to them.

The man was not known to the authorities in Pakistan and his fingerprints did not match any on record in Pakistan, the UK or other countries. No evidence linking him to missing persons cases was found. Wimberry Stones also known as \\"Indian's Head\\", where the body was found. At 9:04 am on 11 December the unidentified man travelled by London Underground train from Ealing Broadway station to Euston station in London and then to Manchester Piccadilly. He walked to the moor on the afternoon of 11 December, from Greenfield, where he made enquiries at the Clarence pub about walking to Wimberry Stones. He was seen alive shortly after sunset (3:59 pm), by two Royal Society for the Protection of Birds staff, near the site at which his body was found the following day. Wimberry Stones is a rock feature known locally as \\"Indian's Head\\" overlooking the reservoir. It was the site of a fatal aeroplane crash in 1949. Investigating detectives surmised the man may have been Stephen Evans, a survivor of the crash but it was discounted after the BBC worked out, based on the 1949 report and the police statement, that he worked at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine and contacted him. He then contacted Greater Manchester Police to confirm he was still alive.\\"Police investigating Greenfield moors death mystery go global for answers\\" \\"Cops have ruled out that the smart dressed man could be one of two child survivors as one, Michael Prestwich, later died in a train accident while Stephen Evans has contacted police this week.\\" http://saddind.co.uk/18580-2/ {accessed March 8th 2017} Identification In January 2017 the body was identified as 67-year-old David Lytton, who had flown into Heathrow Airport from Lahore in Pakistan on 10 December 2015. He was identified from photographs from a passenger list and was picked up on CCTV in London. Greater Manchester Police reported that his identity had been confirmed as a result of a DNA match with a relative and said that Lytton \\"was a bit of a loner\\" and that \\"he liked his own company\\". His family was informed and a full inquest was scheduled for 14 March 2017. On 31 January 2017 The Times reported that Lytton had lived in Streatham, south London, from the 1980s, until he moved to Pakistan in 2006. Former neighbours said he was a croupier who had once worked as a train driver for London Underground and after being made redundant from the casino had taken in lodgers, one of whom was of Pakistani appearance.Tomlinson, Hugh and Simpson, John: \\"Saddleworth Moor's mystery man died as quietly as he lived\\", The Times, 31 January 2017, p 21 The article reproduced personal information from Lytton's passport, showing a London birthplace and a birth date of 21 April 1948. The passport was issued on 8 September 2006 and would expire on 8 September 2016. The article reported that Lytton had arrived in Lahore on 6 October 2006, leaving almost six months later for Dubai. He returned to Lahore after four days, on 31 March 2007. The following November he left again, but there was no record of his returning. Further details emerged in articles in The Guardian during February 2017. On 4 February, it was reported that Lytton's long-term girlfriend, also from Streatham, had helped him through bouts of depression, he had a brother and had changed his surname following a family feud. (His change of name explained previous reports that no one named David Lytton had been born in London on 21 April 1948.) On 9 February The Guardian gave his former name as David Lautenberg and revealed that he had family living in England, including a brother living in North London. His parents were also identified as Sylvia and Hyman Lautenberg. Sylvia Lautenberg's family was of Jewish descent, had emigrated from Poland to England in about 1901, and had lived in or near East London.

Release and reception  Mahamaya was released on 16 October 1944, and distributed by South India Pictures. Although the film was acclaimed by critics for the acting by Kannamba and Chinnappa, audiences at that time did not accept the story because it shows a king going after another person's wife. Therefore, the film did not do well at the box office.  References   External links  * Category:1940s Tamil-language films Category:1944 films Category:Films directed by T. R.

It has a single erect, hairy leaf and one or two cream-coloured flowers with reddish-brown tips. Description Caladenia bicalliata subsp. bicalliata is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and which occurs singly or in small clumps. It has a single erect, very hairy, linear to lance-shaped leaf, long and wide. The inflorescence is a raceme, high with one or two flowers, each flower long and wide. The dorsal sepal is about long and abruptly narrows about one-third of its length from the base. The lateral sepals and petals are cream or greenish- cream, much shorter than those of the similar C. abbreviata and C. evanescens and have reddish-brown tips. The lateral sepals are less than long and thread- like for about half their length and the petals are about the same length and gradually taper to a thread-like tip. The labellum is egg-shaped, about long, wide and white with red stripes. The edge of the labellum is serrated and there are two rows of white-tipped calli along its centre. Flowering occurs from August to early October, however the flowers are often open for only one or two days and sometimes self-pollinate and do not open at all. Taxonomy and naming Caladenia bicalliata was first formally described by Richard Rogers in 1909 but in 2001 Stephen Hopper and Andrew Brown described two subspecies, including subspecies bicalliata and the description of the two subspecies was published in Nuytsia The specific epithet (bicalliata) is a derived from the Latin bi- meaning \\"two\\", callus meaning \\"a callus\\" and -atus indicating possession, referring to the two pairs of rows of calli on the labellum. Distribution and habitat Limestone spider orchid occurs in a narrow coastal strip, growing in calcareous soil between Kalbarri and Esperance in Western Australia and along the south-east coast but sometimes up to inland in South Australia.

It has smooth, greenish grey to white bark, rough at the base of older trees, egg-shaped, heart-shaped or lance-shaped adult leaves, flower buds in groups of three or seven, white flowers and urn-shaped or shortened spherical fruit. Description Corymbia torelliana typically grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. It has smooth greenish grey to white bark, although older specimens often have rough, tessellated, greyish bark on the lower trunk. Young plants and coppice regrowth have heart-shaped to egg-shaped or elliptical leaves that are glossy green on the upper surface, paler below, long and wide. Adult leaves are arranged alternately, paler on the lower surface, egg-shaped to heart-shaped or lance-shaped, long and wide on a petiole long. There are many small oil dots visible to the naked eye. The flower buds are arranged on the ends of branchlets on a branched peduncle long, each branch of the peduncle with three or seven buds that are sessile or on pedicels up to long. Mature buds are oval, long and wide with a rounded, conical or slightly beaked operculum. Flowering occurs from August to November and the flowers are white. The fruit is a woody urn-shaped or shortened spherical capsule long and wide with the valves enclosed in the fruit. Taxonomy and naming Cadaghi was first formally described in 1877 by Ferdinand von Mueller who gave it the name Eucalyptus torelliana and published the description in his book Fragmenta phytographiae Australiae. The type specimens were collected near Trinity Bay by Eugene Fitzalan. In 1995, Ken Hill and Lawrie Johnson changed the name to Corymbia torelliana, publishing the change in the journal Telopea. The specific epithet (torelliana) honours \\"Count Luigi Torelli\\", who proposed using water-loving eucalypts to reduce the incidence of malaria by drying out marshes. Distribution and habitat Corymbia torelliana grows in wet sclerophyll forest, on rainforest margins and as an emergent in rainforest. Its natural range is from Cooktown to Ingham and inland as far as the Windsor Tablelands. It has been used as a fast-growing garden and landscaping tree and has established itself beyond its natural distribution. Ecology Cadaghi has become naturalised beyond its native range in south-eastern and central Queensland. It is regarded as a weed in south-eastern Queensland where it grows as a weed on roadsides, waterways, disturbed sites and waste areas. Its dense canopy often inhibits the growth of understorey species, affecting the composition of native forests in subtropical areas. The sticky resin from the fruiting capsules of this species is collected by the native stingless bee Tetragonula carbonaria, clogging the honeycombs and sometimes sealing the hive entrance and killing the bees inside. Conservation status This eucalypt is classified as of \\"least concern\\" under the Queensland Government Nature Conservation Act 1992. Use in horticulture Cadaghi is a fast growing tree that has been used as a street and garden tree further south than its natural range, including in inland towns such as Narrabri, Chinchilla and Cunnamulla. Its dense canopy of large leaves can provide shade in these places. A sooty fungus that often grows on the tree can discolour objects underneath it. Large branches can sometimes break off and there are serious environmental problems caused by this species in coastal and near-coastal areas. Less invasive alternatives include brush box (Lophostemon confertus), Moreton Bay ash (Corymbia tessellaris) and Queensland maple (Flindersia brayleyana ).

It is located on the banks of the Yelenka River. Population: History Golymki is known as a settlement since 1908, when it was made by a merger of five villages. The names of the four of them were Golynki, Glinyany, Skorokhody, and Ukhabnoye; the name of the fifth village is unknown. The settlement belonged to Orshansky Uyezd of Mogilev Governorate. In 1919, Mogilev Governorate was abolished, and Orshansky Uyezd was included into Gomel Governorate. In 1920, the uyezd was included into Vitebsk Governorate, and shortly the area was transferred to Smolensky Uyezd of Smolensk Governorate. On 12 July 1929, governorates and uyezds were abolished, and Rudnyansky District with the administrative center in Rudnya was established. The district belonged to Smolensk Okrug of Western Oblast. On August 1, 1930 the okrugs were abolished, and the districts were subordinated directly to the oblast. On 27 September 1937 Western Oblast was abolished and split between Oryol and Smolensk Oblasts. Rudnyansky District was transferred to Smolensk Oblast. Between 1941 and September 1943, during WWII, the district was occupied by German troops.

In 1919, she became the first woman to graduate with full technical competence in architecture from the Norwegian Institute of Technology (NTH). Until the Second World War, she ran her own practice in Oslo where she designed private homes. After the war, she contributed to reconstruction projects, especially in Troms County in northern Norway. Biography Born in Kristiania (now Oslo), Sand was the daughter of the lawyer August Nicolai Sand (1852–1940) and his wife Constance, née Hirsch, a schoolteacher. After matriculating from high school, she was admitted to the Norwegian Institute of Technology in 1915 where she was the first woman to receive a full architecture diploma in 1919. After working on military projects for several months, she joined August Nielsen's firm in Oslo. In 1928, she opened her own office which she ran until 1940, designing private homes, apartment buildings and summer houses for Oslo and the surroundings. They were usually in the Functionalist style. In the post-war period, Sand was one of the main contributors to the reconstruction of properties destroyed in the northern area of Troms where she was based from 1952 to 1966. Sand's home on Mellomveien in Tromsø While in Troms during 1952, she designed an experimental house for herself at Mellomveien 130 in Tromsø. The Kirsten Sand house (Kirsten Sand huset) is situated on the southeast side of Tromsø, approximately 2.5 km south of the city centre. Typically for Sand, the layout is centred on a large kitchen which forms part of the open living-room area. It is closely connected to a laundry room and pantry with outdoor firewood storage within easy reach. It was therefore unnecessary for the house to have a cellar and could thus be built at a reasonable cost. It was also particularly suited to the needs of a housewife or female occupant. It was built as a demonstration of a light wooden platform construction. It was imperative during the reconstruction effort in the aftermath of World War II to use as few and light materials as possible. Once completed the house was open to the general public several Sundays on a row. It is a relatively small and simple house with two floors and an attic. At the northern end is a one story extension containing storage rooms. Brown corrugated fibre cement sheeting covers the two roofs and the wooden cladding is ochre with blue window surrounds and frames. To the east the house has a smaller extension with large windows and exit to the garden as well as two other characteristic bay windows. Kirsten Sand lived in the house until 1994. In 2017 this house was declared a protected landmark by the Tromsø municipality. Later life In 1965, Sand was honoured with the King's Medal of Merit (gold). On the occasion of her hundredth birthday, she became an honorary member of the Norske arkitekters landsforbund, the national association for architects in Norway, \\"for her strong commitment to housing design and her huge contribution to reconstruction work in northern Norway\\". Kirsten Sand died in Tromsø. She is buried in a family grave in Cemetery of Our Saviour in Oslo. References External links *\\"Kirsten Sand.

Mode of life These creatures are engaged in all sorts of harmful and damaging activities and ruin everything around them, quickly trying to make a mess. In Belarusian folklore it is said that Zlydzens are sometimes drawn to the homes of individuals who want to become rich quickly and of greedy owners. Zlydzens play their nasty tricks in groups because, like many other small and harmful creatures, they are cowards and are afraid to act alone. When the owner leaves the house, Zlydzens emerge from their shelter and make a mess. They damage utensils, pour milk from pitchers; pans fly around the house. Cries of Zlydzens are heard all around the village. Zlydzens are always engaged in all sorts of harmful and damaging activities, and are constantly making a mess.Цыбулькин В. В., Сивальнёв А.

Under the TX brand, Timex marketed a line of quartz watches -- debuting in Europe in late 2006 and in the US in June 2007. They were noted for a proprietary microprocessor-controlled, multi-motor, multi-hand technology that enabled a range of specialized complications atypical to non-digital, analog watches -- an array of functions either not possible or highly impractical in a mechanical movement. Marketed under the Technoluxury trademark, Timex discontinued the TX Watch Company and its brand in 2011 -- migrating its multi-motor, multi-hand technology to the Timex Intelligent Quartz (IQ) sub- brand in 2012. Technology TX Multi-motor, multi-hand, microprocessor- controlled movement with multiple complications TX watches were engineered in Pforzheim, Germany over a five-year period, to six sigma standards. Movements were manufactured by the Timex Group in the Philippines and the watches were styled at the Timex Design Centre in Milan, Italy -- formerly the Giorgio Galli Design Lab, which the Timex Group had purchased in 2007. The TX technology used miniaturization and patented technology in a quartz movement -- with digital sensors and microprocessors driving independent motors and dial hands, typically four independent motors and six hands. The four motors operated independently with the primary motor operating four central hands (minutes, hours, seconds and a fourth function, which varied per watch model) and the other three bidirectional stepper motors enabling a range of possible complications. The range of functions included world time for 24 global cities; regatta countdowns over five, three and one-minute durations; depth gauge; electronic compass with magnetic declination compensation; perpetual calendar; altimeter; tide; temperature and flyback chronograph (with the ability to stop the chronograph at each lap to note the lap time). As an example, on the flyback chronograph, the movement's microprocessor could instruct the motor to regulate and position the hand for two distinct functions, with the upper sub-dial able to act as the hour gauge for the chronograph, as well as the hour indicator for the second time zone. The chronograph was capable of both 'per second' increments, as well as 1/5 second increments, the latter giving the illusion of the 'sweeping' movement of a mechanical movement. Instead of conventional (metal) bearings, movements used plastic bearings, requiring neither oil nor grease lubricants for their internal operation. Where lubricants degrade and harden over time, damaging the movement, plastic bearings are designed to run \\"dry\\" -- providing optimal internal operation without lubricants and without degradation or hardening. The microprocessor-controlled movements provide a maintenance-free operation, bench tested for over 87,000 hours (40 years) without interruption. Marketing TX timepieces were marketed under the Technoluxury tagline -- as wrist instruments rather than watches -- offering 'innovative technology and affordable luxury' and marketed primarily to a 25–45 years old male demographic. Marketed globally, initially in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Germany and Poland, TX offered numerous models across fifteen numbered 'series' and more than seventy models (color and band variations) -- with a price range in Europe of €245 to €545 in Europe and in the United States from $375 to $626 -- at the time, “the highest price yet for a Timex-developed product,” according to Herb Doscher, TX's U.S. brand manager. In the U.S., watches came with a two-year warranty. =Models= *300 Series - Perpetual Calendar (2006, ten models) *310 series - Classic Perpetual Calendar (2010, _ models, Baselworld) *400 Series - Perpetual Weekly (2009, five models) *500 Series - World Time: (2006, nine models, 24 cities, winter/summer hand) *510 Series - World Time Continental (2009, four models, tonneau case) *530 Series - World Time Airport Lounge (2009, six models, globe-embossed dial) *550 Series - World Time Sport (2009, seven models) *600 Series - Pilot Flyback Chrono (2009, 2010, four+ models, titanium case, dual time zone) *610 Series - Classic Flyback Chronograph (2010, _ models, Baselworld) *650 Series - GT Fly- Back Chronograph (2010, Baselworld) *730 Series - Sport Flyback Chrono (2009 four models, bracelet, stopwatch, dual time zone compass) *770 Series - Flyback Chrono (2009, seven models, stopwatch, dual time zone compass) *800 Series - Linear Chronograph (2009, nine models, patented 30 minute linear hand) *810 Series - Classic Linear Chronograph (2010, Baselworld _models, double curve K1 hardened crystal) *830 Series - Linear Duo Chronograph (2009, three models, tonneau case) TX perpetual calendar watches provide accurate day, month and date until 2100, account for short months and leap years, and require no adjustment on months with less than 31 days. They also feature retrograde dials, where a hand moves, for example from day to day (of the week) and then back to the original position after Sunday. TX chronographs feature a flyback function, a hand that moves (e.g., to indicate the time) along a segment of a circle, can be stopped independently and then springs backward to its starting position when it reaches the end of the scale. The flyback also has the ability to stop the chronograph at each lap to note the lap time. The chronograph continues to run and will “fly-back” to the proper current reading for the total time being measured. =Design features= Design features varied per model, including: * Hands treated with super- luminova luminescent pigment for low-light legibility * Flush or curved (per model) sapphire crystals with back-applied anti-reflective coating * Stainless steel bracelets with solid end links (SELs); silicone or leather straps with deployment buckles * Screw-down crown (e.g., (300, 500, 600 series) * Signed, enameled or engraved crown with 'TX' logo * Bi-directional rotating, ratcheted bezels * E6B 'whiz wheel' circular slide rule * Circumferential tachymeter * Date window, or exposed date indicator * Sculpted, three dimensional dials * Dial guilloché * Engraved casebacks * Premium case materials (e.g., 316L stainless steel, titanium) and finishes (e.g., PVD, ion plating 0.3 – 0.5 mic Tic ). Discontinuation During the period in which The Timex Group fielded the TX Watch Company, it had expanded to include the design and manufacture a range of watches (at the time: Vincent Berard, Versace, Versus, Valentino, Salvatore Ferragamo, Guess, Helix, Nautica, Mark Ecko, Avirex, Timex, TX, Acqua, and Carriage) and had expressed confidence in TX's potential. “TX not only demonstrates our commitment to technological and design leadership, it also shows our determination to penetrate new market segments within the industry,” said a Timex representative. “This is just the beginning.” By 2011, Timex Group global chief operating officer Kapil Kapoor announced The Timex Group was terminating the brand -- and moving its six-hand, four-motor technology to its Timex brand. Intelligent Quartz (IQ) When the Timex Group migrated the microprocessor-controlled, multi-motor, multi-hand technology to its Timex brand in 2012, it created a sub-collection marketed as Intelligent Quartz (IQ). The line employed the same movements and capabilities from the TX brand, at a much lower price-point and without many of the distinguishing luxury features associated with the higher-end brand, e.g., the sapphire crystals and stainless steel or titanium casework. The Intelligent Quartz line debuted at the BaselWorld international timepiece exposition in March 2011, for model year 2012.

History The Albany and West Lodge Bassets was formed with the amalgamation of the Albany Bassets and the West Lodge Harehounds. =The Albany Bassets= In 1955 members of the Basset Hound Club formed a working branch to \\"foster the hunting instinct inherent in every Basset Hound\\", initially all members of the club were encouraged to enter their pet Basset and see if it could work with a nucleus of kenneled hounds. In 1973 this pack was renamed the Albany Bassets and was registered with the Masters of Basset Hounds Association. The Albany remained a part of the Basset Hound Club until 2002 when they withdrew their support and the Albany became a subscription pack. In 2002 the hunt outcrossed their Kennel Club registered hounds with working stock to produce a greater working ability, as they felt the Kennel Club standard hounds were becoming too heavy and cumbersome. The aim of the hunt's outcrossing was to produce lighter more agile hounds that could work for longer over rough ground. =The West Lodge Harehounds= The West Lodge Harehounds was initially formed in 1928 by Sir Douglas Ritchie as a private beagle pack with subscriptions being taken from 1934. The pack was disbanded in 1941, but was reformed with basset hounds in 1950. At the time of their amalgamation, the West Lodge Harehounds comprised a pack of three-quarter Bassets, one-quarter Harriers, along with some Grand Basset Griffon Vendéens in the pack. =The Albany and West Lodge Bassets= In 2006 the two packs amalgamated. Today the hunt seeks to breed working Bassets with chests at least from the ground, that can hunt for four hours twice a week. Hunt country The Albany's original country extends from Stamford in the south, Bourne in the north, Melton Mowbray in the west and Spalding in the east, and lies within the boundaries of the Cottesmore Hunt. The West Lodge's country runs from the northern outskirts of London to Biggleswade and Longstowe in the north, bounded by Harlow and Royston in the east, and Hatfield and Stevenage in the west. Its country lies within the boundaries of the Cambridgeshire with Enfield Chase and the Puckeridge Hunt.

He invented the hydraulic crane and overhead travelling crane. He founded several companies including the Vauxhall Iron Works, which later evolved into Vauxhall Motors, and the huge British engineering firm Brown Brothers. Life He was born on 4 May 1841 in Edinburgh the eldest son of Robert Brown, a bricklayer living at 86 Canongate,Edinburgh and Leith Post Office Directory 1841-2 and his wife, Marion Betts. He was educated at the High School in Edinburgh. From around 1855 he was apprenticed as an engineer with the North British Railway based at St Margaret’s Yard in Edinburgh. He took evening classes at the Watt College (later Heriot Watt) winning prizes in Natural Philosophy (Physics) and Dynamics. He then went to Manchester for two years to study Sciences and began specialising in hydraulics. He is first listed as an \\"engineer\\" living back with his parents in Edinburgh in 1861. In 1862, living in Stockport, he took out a patent for the improvement of steam engines and boilers. In 1863 he purchased a former brewery in Vauxhall in London and created the Vauxhall Iron Works. In 1863 he invented an overhead travelling crane, which was successfully used to construct Blackfriars Bridge over the River Thames in central London. In 1870 he received an unusual contract to install a steam-powered hydraulic system for launching ships within Hamburg Docks. This was largely constructed in the newly founded Rosebank Iron Works due to its proximity to a railway line. This huge L-plan foundry wrapped around Rosebank Cemetery. This was renamed Brown Brothers in 1885 and became one of Scotland’s largest foundries. The complex was demolished around the year 2000. From the mid 1870s his interests began to drift towards marine engineering. He then invented the combine hydraulic/steam starting engine, common in all steamships thereafter, and the highly innovative steam-tiller (a forerunner of all power-steering devices). Around 1872 he invented the telemotor a mechanism allowing removal of most of the complex gears and chains between the control room and the engine on steamships. In 1874 he invented the Steam accumulator. He used this device to power further odd creations to load and unloads cargoes using steam-power. He provided the steering gear for both the SS Lusitania and RMS Mauretania (the world's largest ship from 1906 to 1911). In 1881 he resettled in Edinburgh living at 1 Rosebery Crescent in the city’s West End.Edinburgh and Leith Post Office Directory 1882-3 In 1884 he went into partnership with William F. King to create King, Brown & Co, electrical engineers based at the Rosebank Works in Leith.https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge- core/content/view/S0370164600026651 The Rosebank Works had been established by David George Brown (his brother) in 1872. The company was renamed Brown Brothers around 1900 and specialised in major ship components. https://www.gracesguide.co.uk/Brown_Brothers_and_Co He died at home, 19 Douglas Crescent, in Edinburgh’s West End on 13 May 1906. He is buried with his wife in the north-west section of the Victorian extension to Dean Cemetery. The inscription on the stone, \\"no more pain\\", implies a prolonged illness before death. Brown Brothers continued after his death, doing important engineering works, including building the world's first tanks for World War One.Edinburgh Timeline 1917 Family In 1869 he married Anna Maria Pilliner of Jamaica (1848–1906), at Toxteth Park.

The people have made it easy for ALH. Adamu Idris to rule them for currently 57 years by uniting themselves. The history of Bashar have been tapped from different sources as expressed below. Nomenclature The Yangkam (Yaŋkam) people have been called ‘Bashar’ or ‘Basherawa’ (the Hausaised name for the people) in almost all the literature (Greenberg 1963; Williamson 1971; Benue-Congo Comparative Wordlist; Hansford et al. 1976; Gerhardt 1989; Crozier & Blench 1992). The correct name of the Bashar language and people is Yàŋkàm, plural aYaŋkam+. Although Yangkam has nearly disappeared as a language, the populations who formerly spoke it are likely to retain Basherawa and Basheranci as their name for the people and language as long as they retain a separate identity. Location and settlements The Yangkam live in a region west of Bashar town, 25 km north from Jarme on the Amper-Bashar road, Kanam LGA, in Plateau State. Yangkam is spoken in some four villages, Tukur, Bayar, Pyaksam and Kiram [CAPRO also mentions Gambam and Kwakkwani, but this was not confirmed]. There are many hamlets around Bashar town in Wase local Government whose populations are ethnically Yangkam but who no longer speak the language. In the two main cartographic sources, Hansford et al. (1976) and Blench and Crozier (1992) it is located quite inaccurately. Section gives its correct location, and it should appear in a map correctly sited in the Millennium edition of the Ethnologue (Grimes, forthcoming). Language status Crozier and Blench (1992) give a figure of 20,000 speakers of the language located in and around Bashar town, some 50 km east of Amper on the Muri road. This estimate turned out to be entirely erroneous. The Bashar people seem to have been heavily affected by nineteenth century slave raids, perhaps by the Jukun as well as the Hausa. They were converted to Islam and a relatively powerful centre was established at Bashar. At the same time they began to switch to speaking Hausa, while still retaining their Bashar identity. In the region of Bashar town today, there are just two old men who remain reasonably fluent in the language, in the village of Yuli, some 15 km northwest of Bashar. However, it turns out that at the time of the raids, the population split into two and another group sought refuge in Tukur. However, even here Yangkam is only spoken by people over fifty and all the young people speak Hausa. The local estimate of the number of fluent speakers is 100, and falling every year. There seems to be no likelihood that Yangkam will be maintained as speakers are quite content with the switch to Hausa, while remaining proud of their historical identity. Yangkam history The earliest account of Yangkam history is in Ames (1934:). A Hausa history of ‘Bashar’ is in circulation in Bashar town but this has so far not been translated. CAPRO (ined.) contains a recent version of the Bashar narrative. Yangkam say they are descendants of the Badar who migrated from the east (Saudi Arabia?) fleeing forcible conversion. The Badar passed through the Sudan where they met with the Kanuri and together they moved to Birni Gazargamu. When the Gazargamu kingdom fell, the people moved to Borno where they settled with the Kanuri, Bolewa, Bade, and Bura in the present Borno State. The Kanuri went to settle at Dikwa, the Bolewa went to Fika, the Bura went to Biu and the Bade to the Gashua area. The Yangkam and Jukun people decided to move away from Borno. The Jukun went to establish Kwararafa, but the Yangkam people went to the Kaltungo area of the present Bauchi State. When they moved away from the Kaltungo area they went to settle at Kwakwani and later to the foot of Wase rock in Plateau State. They were there until they made peace with the Emir of Bauchi, Yakubu, during the reign of Tartar. When Tartar made peace, Yakubu Bauchi asked Madaki Hassan to stay in the Wase area with the Yangkam people. Soon after Hassan got to Wase, the Yangkam were faced with many conflicts. It is said that though the Yangkam gave Madaki Hassan and his people a place to stay, and room to farm, he did not respect them and sold their children as slaves. So the Yangkam people moved away from Wase rock to Ganuwa. Shortly after reaching Ganuwa, Tartar, the chief of Yangkam, died. A message about his death was sent to Bauchi to inform Emir Yakubu, who sent his condolences to the Yangkam and urged them to appoint the son to succeed the father. He said the son should come to Bauchi for the turbaning. When the Yangkam people were preparing for the installation of the new chief, they agreed among themselves that when they reached Bauchi they should accept Islam as their religion. When the turbaning ceremony was over, the people told Emir Yakubu about their interest in becoming Muslims. Yakubu was very happy and gave them an Islamic flag, the sword and other symbols of Islam for them to take back home. This is the genesis of Islam among the Yangkam people, and today it is difficult to find a Yangkam man identifying with any other religion than Islam. In fact, Bashar town is known in its neighbourhood as an Islamic town. Bashar and Wase towns have produced many prominent Islamic scholars. The son of Tartar was recognised by the Yangkam people as the first chief to be turbaned by the Fulani. His name was Karo and he was succeeded by Yamusa. But during the reign of Abubakar the people left Ganuwa to settle in Gwaram, south of the present Yangkam town, because of wars (yakin Kalumbu). After ten years Abubakar founded the present Bashar town, in the area that they are still occupying. Abubakar was succeeded by Muhammadu Lamlam, then followed a series of short reigns. At present Usman Idris, also known as Hakimin Bashar, rules, subject to the king of Wase. The chief among the Yangkam is known as the Rekna Bashar. The Yangkam ruling clan is known as Argando while the kingmakers include the Madakin Bashar, Kuyanbaba Bashar, Mansu Bashar and the Imam (Islamic religious leader) of Bashar. Yangkam culture Before the Yangkam people embraced Islam, their traditional customs and religion were closely related to those of the Boghom people. Before marriage, the suitor had to serve the in-laws in the farm, give a hand-woven white cloth (alikyala), do building and roofing and give animals as bride-price. Yangkam burial rites were like those of the Boghom. They used to remove the skull of the deceased for observation after three months. Naming and circumcision rites were formerly similar with those of the Boghom, although today all these rites are performed according to Islamic laws. The Yangkam have the same name as the Boghom for the Supreme Being, Bappi, as well as formerly having masquerades and shrines. But today these have fallen into disuse since conversion to Islam. Although Christianity was brought to Yangkam in 1968, by Mr. Bala Abdu, a COCIN evangelist, they rejected it. When some non- Yangkam residents accepted the gospel, the chief was reluctant to give them land to built a place of worship.

It is a distinctive 2-1/2 story wood frame structure with elaborate Queen Anne styling. Its asymmetrical massing is covered by a multicolored slate roof that features iron cresting and numerous gables. A central tower rises to a third story, covered by a cross-gabled roof. The walls are finished mainly in clapboards, with pilastered corners and peaked window surrounds. A single- story porch wraps around two sides, with elaborate turned posts, gables and Stick style arched woodwork. The interior retains equally elaborate decorative elements original to its period of construction. with The house is the largest and most elaborately decorated in the small community. It was built about 1892 for Sheldon Boright, a Canadian immigrant who was a prominent local businessman. The house is based on a pattern published by Palliser & Palliser of Bridgeport, Connecticut in its 1878 Palliser's American Cottage Homes. It was apparently also the design for George Palliser's own home in Bridgeport, which no longer stands, and appears on the cover of the book.

The Court concluded that Federal Parliament had the power to implement the Treaty of Versailles under the defence power and to delegate that implementation to the Governor-General. Higgins J also saw it as a valid exercise of the external affair power. Background The Treaty of Versailles was signed for Australia by the Prime Minister W M Hughes and Minister for the Navy Joseph Cook 28 June 1919.. The Parliament passed the Treaty of Peace Act 1919 to give the Government power to give effect to the treaty. The Act consisted of just one page and the operative terms were that: > 2\\\\. The Governor-General may make such regulations and do such things as > appear to him to be necessary for carrying out and giving effect to the > provisions of Part X. (Economic Clauses) of the said Treaty. 3\\\\. The > regulations may provide for the punishment of offences against the > regulations, by the impositions of the following penalties :- :(a) If the > offence is prosecuted summarily-a fine not exceeding Five hundred pounds or > imprisonment for any term not exceeding twelve months; or both; :(b) If the > offence is prosecuted upon indictment-a fine of any amount or imprisonment > for not more than seven years, or both The Governor-General made the Treaty of Peace Regulations, which made extensive provisions, including regulation 20 which set out how the property of German nationals was charged for payments in respect of the claims of British nationals, including subregulation (5) which provided that the Minister for Trade and Customs could make an order vesting the property in the Public Trustee. Joseph Roche and the other plaintiffs (\\"the Executors\\") were the executors of the estate of Joseph Kronheimer, who had died in Victoria in 1914. Max Kronheimer and the other defendants were German nationals who were beneficiaries under the estate (\\"the German beneficiaries\\"). The executors asked the Supreme Court of Victoria for advice as to their duties as executors. The German beneficiaries argued that the Treaty of Peace Act 1919 was invalid. Hood J referred the questions to the High Court pursuant to sections 18 and 40A of the Judiciary Act 1903. Section 51 of the Australian Constitution gives the Commonwealth Parliament the right to legislate with respect to : :\\"(vi) the naval and military defence of the Commonwealth and of the several States, and the control of the forces to execute and maintain the laws of the Commonwealth\\"; and :\\"(xxix) external affairs\\". Legislative powers of the Parliament. =Submissions in the High Court= The German beneficiaries were represented by Owen Dixon who argued that the defence power did not include a power to make war or to terminate it by a treaty of peace. The external affairs power was limited to matters relating to affairs external to the Australia and did not enable laws to be made as to matters within Australia. The delegation of the legislative power was invalid \\"Just as the Constitution does not permit the judicial power of the Commonwealth to be vested in any tribunal other than the High Court and other Federal Courts,.. so the vesting of the legislative power in any other body than Parliament was prohibited.\\" Further regulation 20(5) was invalid as it purported to confer judicial power upon the Minister. The Executors did not argue in the High Court. Instead the contradictors were the Public Trustee and the Attorney- General (Cth). Sir Robert Garran, the Solicitor-General appeared for the Attorney-General and argued that the Treaty of Versailles was made by the King and as such was binding throughout the British Empire. The defence power included legislating with respect to the termination of war and the Act was also valid under the external affairs power. The Act was a declaration of intention to give effect to Part X of the Treaty of Versailles and the Executive was left to fill in the details. The decision of the High Court The Court announced its decision on 23 March 1921 that the Treaty of Peace Act and the Treaty of Peace Regulations made under the Act were valid, and delivered its reasons on 2 June 1921. =Knox CJ, Gavan Duffy, Rich and Starke JJ= The joint judgement held that it was the intention of the legislature to enable the Governor-General to enforce the provisions of Part X of the Treaty of Versailles within Australia, and, if he thought it necessary for that purpose, to make any of such provisions part of the statute law of Australia. The defence power was not onfined to military operations but extends to every measure of defence, including the termination of hostilities by the imposition of terms of peace and the enforcement of those terms. The delegation of power to the Governor-General was consistent with the decision of the High Court in Farey v Burvett.. The order of the Minister was not an exercise of judicial power. =Higgins J= In a separate judgment Higgins J upheld the Act and Regulations under the external affairs power, holding that it was difficult to say what limits (if any) can be placed on the power to legislate as to external affairs. Further the severe punishment of an enemy was valid under the defence power as being reasonably regarded as a deterrent against future attacks. The vesting order was not an exercise of judicial power as it was not the result of a judicial finding as to rights but an order in defiance of admitted rights. Significance After his elevation to the High Court, Dixon J said that Roche v Kronheimer decided that: > a statute conferring upon the Executive a power to legislate upon some > matter contained within one of the subjects of the legislative power of the > Parliament is a law with respect to that subject, and that the distribution > of legislative, executive and judicial powers in the Constitution does not > operate to restrain the power of the Parliament to make such a law.. The decision continues to be cited for the proposition that the Parliament can delegate legislative power to the Governor-General. Thus in the Tasmanian Dams case, Deane J stated while \\"a general delegation to the Executive of the legislative power to give effect to the Convention may be thought undesirable, there is strong authority to support the view that it is not, for that reason, beyond power\\". The judgment of Higgins J has been identified by the High Court as a significant step in the growth of the external affairs power, supporting the proposition that the external affairs power enabled legislation giving domestic effect to the provisions of an international treaty..

Gameplay The game combines the farming elements of Story of Seasons with the creature collecting and battling mechanics of Pokémon.  Development  Ooblets was developed by a two-person indie game development studio composed of artist/programmer Rebecca Cordingley and designer Ben Wasser, since 2016. The game was due to be published by Double Fine, but following that company's acquisition by Microsoft in June 2019, the Ooblets developers announced that they would instead self-publish the title. On August 1, 2019, it was announced that Ooblets would be an Epic Games Store exclusive. In the announcement by Glumberland's Ben Wasser, he included what he felt had been joking language related to criticisms of the Epic Games Store, calling those who threatened to pirate Epic Games Store exclusives \\"immature, toxic gamers\\", but that the situation was \\"nothing to get worked up about\\". The announcement then led to large numbers of threatening and abusive messages being sent to the developers as well as misinformation being spread via platforms like Reddit. Wasser had not expected the community to react to the message that way, and tried to clarify Glumberland's position of needing Epic's support rather than any attempt to spurn the gaming community.

Family history  Born in Bombay, Aniceto was the youngest of 14 children, two of them girls. His father was John Christopher Nazareth of Pomburpa, a small tourist resort, known for its warm and cold springs; and mother Umbelina Vaz of Uccaçaim, Goa. Both parents played the violin. Three of his siblings chose the religious life, Stephen and Aniceto as diocesan priests and Edvige as a Salesian Sister. His parents encouraged and did everything to educate their children in the world of music. Their gifts always included music sheets, recorded music, a better piano and other musical instruments. Aniceto regularly accompanied his brothers to concerts, movies and the All India Radio and other studios to make recordings. His mother took him daily for Mass which was then in Latin.  Early life and musical background (1938- 1956)  As was the custom in colonial times in the city of Bombay (now Mumbai), Aniceto's formal education started only by age six. Following his admission test at St. Xavier's High School Fort, he was directly assigned to Std IV. His drill teacher asked him to play Marches at the calisthenics class. At the age of 7, he gave his first classical piano recital at a school function, playing Fritz Kreisler's Liebesfreud and for an encore a Brazilian Samba, Tico Tico. He also played the organ at church services in school and in his parish of St John the Evangelist, Fort. He passed the audition for All India Radio and played for the Children's Hour, as well as for contests relayed through Radio Ceylon. Aniceto Nazareth had no formal musical training, but was a keen listener of the great Classical Masters and studied their chords and progressions. He was also influenced by the extraordinary accompaniments to simple hymns played by Victor Paranjoti, Peter Andrade, Ethel Athaide at the Holy Name & St Thomas Cathedrals. They set the standard for him in church music and his future publications. He learnt the art of arranging music for equal voices, by listening to his older brothers sing. Thus he grew into music thanks to the background in which he lived, playing back what he listened to and later writing his own compositions which were accepted by publishers both in India and abroad.  Seminary years (1956-1966)  After graduating at 18 in Medical Biology from St Xavier's College, he joined the Seminary at Parel which later moved to its present location at the Diocesan Seminary at Goregaon. Here, Aniceto completed his studies in Philosophy and Theology in 1966 and was finally ordained on 21 December 1966, by Valerian Cardinal Gracias. These were momentous years for the Church, with the Second Vatican Council (11 October 1962 to 8 December 1965) and the New Documents which followed and Pope Paul VI visit to India for the 38th International Eucharistic Congress (December 1964). At the Congress, during the visit of Pope Paul VI, Aniceto Nazareth while still a seminarian, served as organist and music arranger for the huge Gregorian and polyphonic choir assembled under the baton of Fr. J.B. Fernandes, founder of the Newman choir. (Choir Picture) The Eucharistic Congress was followed by the composition and publication of appropriate chants in keeping with the recommendations of Vatican II in which Br. Aniceto Nazareth played a major role. He assisted Fr. Jean Mercier, in printing and distributing a series of musical scores for new hymns titled Sing a New Song, followed by a word publication With Joyful Lips and another abridged version, Celebration.  Pastoral ministry (1966 to date)  His pastoral ministry at St. Francis Xavier church Vile Parle was short- lived as he was soon called upon by Cardinal Gracias to teach liturgy and music at the seminary. His grounding in new revised post Vatican II Liturgy came from his Licentiate Studies at Sant Anselmo's, Rome. When he returned to Bombay, it was his task to educate people on the new shape of the liturgy. He revived the Archdiocesan Liturgy Committee [ALC] and was its Secretary for 30 years. As of 2016, he was still on the Board of Censors for Music in English. The need of the hour were text books on the study of liturgy. So Aniceto compiled his own notes based on his study, which were later published as low priced books simple enough for all to understand. On the Mass he published \\"Proclaim\\" on the Liturgy of the Word as well as \\"Crumbs from the Master’s Table\\" on essential Interior attitudes at the Table of the Eucharist. Next on the list was a study on the Liturgical Year, \\"The Presence of Jesus in Time\\" and one on Liturgical Music, \\"Let’s Sing the Paschal Mystery\\" (March 2005) which from its very cover page told cantors not to \\"sing\\", unless they had something \\"relevant and appropriate to sing\\" for the celebration of the Mass. Within a few years there were an increasing number of people who were eager to be educated on the new shape of the liturgy. Ministers of the Word and of Holy Communion were now organized and trained. Cantors and choirs began to understand that they were not performers but prayer leaders. The Basic Liturgy Course ensured that there were now trained lay people who could help teach the topics that came under the umbrella of Liturgy, while the books and Vatican II Documents like Sacrosanctum,Concilium served as reference guides. This coincided with the new thrust in the archdiocese towards involving the laity in the ministry of the church.  Liturgical choir – the PROCLAIMERS  Post Vatican II, with the new emphasis on congregational singing, questions were raised about the need for a choir. It was in this context Aniceto started a Liturgical choir the PROCLAIMERS. As part of its training, the choir focused on the new Liturgy; and sang in five voices instead of the customary 4 voices. The fifth voice sang the melody on a key convenient to the congregation, thus encouraging the participation of the assembly. The choir encouraged the participation of the assembly at workshops they gave in 88 churches in the city and in 19 other towns in India. In a sense Aniceto Nazareth led a Liturgical Renewal of the music ministry. He believed that choirs can help people sing and should not be shut down. Instead they should provide an accompaniment to the congregation, just as an organ does. The Proclaimers under the direction of Aniceto Nazareth were called upon to sing at several Diocesan gatherings like the Episcopal Ordination of Bishops Agnelo and Percival and the felicitation of Archbishop Ivan Dias who was elevated as Cardinal.  Retirement  Post retirement, in his new role as Parish Priest, he has been taking liturgical and classical music directly to his congregations. Placed in charge of training for the Revised Missal by Cardinal Oswald Gracias, he and his Team helped introduce it to the churches of Mumbai in 2011. His new Masses are based on themes from the great Masters - the Gloria based on the slave chorus from Nebuchadnazar by Verdi and an entire Mass based on Handel. The people's parts are kept easy to learn and sing.

It is a parasitic castrator of the common periwinkle Littorina littorea. Unlike many trematode species it encysts on hard surfaces and not inside a second intermediate host. Free-living cercariae are released from the snail hosts to encyst on hard surfaces, generally the shells of bivalves. The release is encouraged by warmer temperatures and increased light intensity. Encystment on bivalves is most successful when they enter the mussel with the inhalation current first. They then actively emerge, using their suckers and then encyst on the shell. If the bivalve is then eaten by a bird P. acanthus will be transmitted to the definitive host. Survival and successful encystment can be reduced by the presence of epibionts, such as the barnacle Semibalanus balanoides, on the shell. Castration of the snail molluscan host can result in a decline in host numbers and, in turn, can lead to more ungrazed algae, with corresponding increases in invertebrate populations and a greater diversity of smaller Littorina snails. The increased numbers of small prey items makes the affected rocky coasts more attractive to birds such as the purple sandpiper and Eurasian rock pipit. This is likely to facilitate transmission of P. acanthus to its definitive host.

The program is funded by the Heinz Nixdorf Stiftung. History In spirit of the entrepreneur Heinz Nixdorf (1925 – 1986), the Heinz Nixdorf Foundation set its goal to strengthen creativity and entrepreneurship of the young generation and allow it to gain market knowledge of the Asia-Pacific region. This is how the Heinz Nixdorf Program came into existence with the aim to promote Asia-Pacific related work experience for young aspiring managers holding German citizenship, managed by the Deutschen Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH. Target and Scope of the Program The Heinz Nixdorf Program, which promotes Asia-Pacific related work experience for young aspiring managers with German citizenship, organizes internships of four to six months length in the following eight Asian countries.Heinz Nixdorf Program * People's Republic of China (PRC) * India * Indonesia * Japan * Malaysia * South Korea * Taiwan * Vietnam The scholars gain Asian market knowledge by way of practical work experience in local enterprises. The program provides insights into the local economy and working environment to young and aspiring managers, which would otherwise be hard to obtain. Organization In 1994, when the program was initiated, the Carl-Duisberg Gesellschaft e.V. took on the implementation of the program. In 2002, the responsibilities to manage the program were transferred to Internationale Weiterbildung und Entwicklung gGmbH (InWEnt) as part of a merger with Deutschen Stiftung für internationale Entwicklung (DSE). The Internationale Weiterbildung und Entwicklung gGmbH (InWEnt) merged again and contributed the Heinz Nixdorf Program into the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH. Target Group The Heinz Nixdorf Program mainly targets young professionals and graduates of business and technical majors that hold German citizenship. High potential undergraduates are also taken into consideration as long as they earn at least one academic degree prior to their departure to their host country. In general, the applicants are younger than thirty years, have at least 6 months of practical work experience and a proof of good English language skills (TOEFL, IELTS or Cambridge Certificate).

Nowadays, the COC continues to defend its official recognition by the International Olympic Committee (IOC). History The first Olympic Committee of Catalonia was founded in 1913 in order to participate in the 1916 Olympic Games of Berlin, but only existed during a brief period. In 1922 it was founded the Sports Confederation of Catalonia, seen as heir to the now defunct Catalan Olympic Committee and was chaired by Joan Ventosa i Calvell. The Confederation did not use the word \\"Olympic\\" because of the reluctance of the IOC to recognize an entity outside of international institutions. In 1923, however, it received the Olympic Cup in recognition of its work in promoting sport. However, during the dictatorship of Primo de Rivera (1923-1930) the Confederation lost most of its functions. In 1987, shortly after the election of Barcelona as host city of the 1992 Summer Olympics, it was created the Association for the Olympic delegation of Catalonia, which established in 29 May 1989 the Olympic Committee of Catalonia. After decades frozen and forgotten, in October 2016, during the process of self-determination of Catalonia, its directive council met in order to approve new statutes of the organization, as the originals were still the ones of 1989, clearly obsoletes. The goals of this changes are: restore the activities of the COC, adapt it to legislative changes in international sport of recent decades and prepare it for eventual international recognition in case of independence of Catalonia.

John Heinz III, Lincoln Kirstein, as well as three U.S. presidents. In 1986 he was inducted into the Interior Design Hall of Fame, and in 2010 Architectural Digest named him one of the world's top 20 designers of all time.  Early life and education  Mark Hampton was born in Indianapolis and raised by parents Mark Hampton Sr. and Alice (née Burkert) Hampton in Plainfield, Indiana. As a child, he spent time with Paul Hadley, designer of the Indiana State Flag, who was also a former instructor at the Herron School of Art and Design. Hampton showed early inclinations toward an artistic life, and by the time he was twelve years old, he considered himself a designer. He credited his success to making an early career choice. His early influences were Le Corbusier, Billy Baldwin, Frank Lloyd Wright, and Phillip Johnson. Hampton graduated from DePauw University in 1962, and attended the London School of Economics as an exchange student for one year. At his parents' request, he attended law school at the University of Michigan for one year before deciding to move to New York to attend the New York University Institute of Fine Arts. Hampton was awarded a Ford Fellowship by the Ford Foundation. He and Duane (Flegel) Hampton married in 1964, and raised two daughters, actress Kate Hampton and interior designer Alexa Hampton.  Career  While in England in 1961, Hampton met mentor and long-time friend David Nightingale Hicks. Hampton would later open an office for Hicks' firm in New York City. Hampton also worked for Sister Parish from 1962-3, and then from 1969-1975 at the design firm McMillen, Inc. under Eleanor Stockstrom McMillen Brown. He opened his own design firm, Mark Hampton LLC, in 1976. During his career he designed for a wide array of offices, hotels, clubs, railroad cars, airplanes and boats. Hampton did interior design work for Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, and designed Christmas decorations at the White House for President Jimmy Carter in 1977. He also worked for President George H.W. Bush and First Lady Barbara Bush, for whom he provided interior design services at the White House (in the Oval Office and executive residence), Camp David, the Bush family's vacation home in Kennebunkport, Maine, their retirement house in Houston, Texas, as well as the George Bush Presidential Library and Museum in College Station, Texas. Hampton, Scott Salvator and Mario Buatta redesigned Blair House, which serves as the president's guest house. He and Kaki Hockersmith worked with First Lady Hillary Clinton in 1998 to renovate the State Dining Room at the White House. Hampton collaborated with Paula Rice Jackson to renovate the American Academy in Rome's historic Villa Aurelia.[1] In addition to interior design commissions, Hampton licensed his designs in fabrics, trimmings, and furniture. He produced fabric designs for Kravet and a line of fabric trimmings for Scalamandre. In 1988 Hampton began designing a line of furniture for the Hickory Chair company, which produced 250 reproduction furniture styles designed by Hampton at the time of his death. The brand continued its partnership with Mark Hampton, LLC until 2018. His weekly column for House & Garden were later compiled in the book Mark Hampton on Decorating. He was a member and trustee of the American Academy in Rome. The Academy awards a prize in his honor every year. He was a member of the American Society of Interior Designers and a member of the Committee for the Preservation of the White House. = Style = Hampton was uninterested in being known for a personal style, however his style has been described as \\"tailored and classical.\\" As his career evolved, he moved from modern, minimalist style to more traditional aesthetic. Hampton considered himself an Anglophile, and was best known for British decor at the height of his career, with an affinity for \\"English country house colors, Oriental rugs, floral chintzes, eighteenth- and nineteenth-century antiques, both English and American, and botanical and architectural prints.\\" Hampton has been called \\"the Cary Grant of design . . . an urbane and articulate man, and impeccably dressed.\\" In 1991 he was listed on the International Best Dressed List. Hampton was socially gifted and a thoughtful friend who created watercolor sketches for those he cared about. His watercolor of the White House's Green Room were featured on President Reagan's and the First Lady's holiday greeting card in 1983. = Philosophy = Hampton believed that \\"interior decoration is not just about buying things, but helping people with how to use things of beauty.\\" He preferred to work with clients who had their own collections and personal tastes, bringing them into the design, rather than imposing his specific designs on a space. Hampton said that \\"a room should look great and reflect the owner at the same time. An ideal room walks off with the people.\\"  Publications   Further reading   References   External links  * Category:American interior designers Category:People from Hendricks County, Indiana Category:DePauw University alumni Category:New York University Institute of Fine Arts alumni Category:1940 births Category:1998 deaths Category:People from Plainfield, Indiana ","title":"Mark Hampton"},{"id":"51972784","text":"Montres CIMIER SA is an independent Swiss watch manufacturer whose headquarters is in Biel, Switzerland. CIMIER produces mechanical watches as well as quartz watches.  History  The origin of CIMIER goes back in 1924 when the mukesh watchmaker Joseph Lapanouse founded his company LAPANOUSE SA in Hölstein and sold his watches first under the brand REGO and later CIMIER. Since the beginning, Joseph Lapanouse specialised in manufacturing pin-pallet watches, called Roskopf. In the 1950s, the company, that became in the meantime LAPANOUSE-CIMIER SA, industrialized the first pin-pallet escapement chronograph sold at 21 million pieces during its lifetime. At the end of the 1960s the annual production reached 1.5 million pieces and the company employed over 500 people in Bubendorf. In the 1970s, the watch industry experienced the quartz crisis. The number of mechanical watches sold was drastically reduced. CIMIER developed and industrialized its own quartz movement. However, the number of pieces produced did not reach the threshold of profitability. As a result, in 1985, the Swiss manufacturer decided to temporarily cease production. In 2003, the brand CIMIER was reborn through the company which has the same name. In 2010, CIMIER opens the Watch Academy. The concept allows customers to create and build their own watch in Cimier's workshop. The customer can choose between several manual movements and an automatic movement.

The defiance campaign was launched here in 1952, this was the first mass anti-apartheid campaign led by Nelson Mandela as volunteer-in chief of the African National Congress.Completed in 1976, the Plaza was built to accommodate Indian traders evicted by the apartheid government from the main trading street, 14th Street as well as other streets including the eastern and western boundary street, Delarey and Krause streets of Pageview, Fietas.http://www.orientalplaza.co.za/Tourist-Info.php?pid=88 History Red Square or Freedom Square was an open community square in Fordsburg. During the 1940s and 1950s it was a political meeting place particularly popular with the Communist Party and the site for numerous defiance campaigns and gatherings.http://www.southafrica.net/za/en/articles/entry/article- southafrica.net-fordsburg In 1952, leaders of the African National Congress sent an ultimatum to the apartheid government to repeal all unjust laws. The Defiance Campaign was launched when the government failed to comply. On 6 April 1952, the 300 year anniversary after Jan van Riebeeck and the first European settlers arrived at the Cape, thousands marched to and gathered at Red Square from various locations and outlying towns. The Defiance Campaign was launched at the square by James Moroka, president of the ANC and Yusuf Dadoo, head of the South African Indian Congress, together with many other African, Indian and Coloured leaders. They protested against the unjust and oppressive laws and called for volunteers to defy them. This culminated in groups of defiers who protested non-violently and offered themselves for arrest. Volunteers included Nelson Mandela, Yusuf Dadoo, Walter Sisulu, Ahmed Kathrada and many more who all defied apartheid laws in Johannesburg and other main city centres. Mandela, working with Maulvi Cachalia also actively worked to mobilise volunteers for the campaign. This marked the beginning of non- racial co-operation in the resistance against apartheid and led to the drafting and adoption of the Freedom Charter in 1955. Forced removals were enforced in the nearby suburb of Pageview (Fietas), destroying the existing vibrant commercial 14th Street and other streets. The Oriental Plaza was built as a compromise between the Johannesburg City Council and the Department of Community Development in the 1970s, in an attempt to reluctantly address the loss of the evicted Indian traders. In the process a substantial part of Fordsburg’s urban fabric including the Red Square was demolished. The Red Square still however holds social, cultural and historical significance.

The above mentioned legislative obligation established by Article 2 of the Convention [= obligation to annul all legislation which is in violation of the Convention] is also aimed at facilitating the work of the Judiciary so that the law enforcement authority may have a clear option in order to solve a particular case. :However, when the Legislative Power fails to set aside and / or adopts laws which are contrary to the American Convention, the Judiciary is bound to honor the obligation to respect rights as stated in Article 1(1) of the said Convention, and consequently, it must refrain from enforcing any laws contrary to such Convention. :The observance by State agents or officials of a law which violates the Convention gives rise to the international liability of such State, as contemplated in International Human Rights Law, in the sense that every State is internationally responsible for the acts or omissions of any of its powers or bodies for the violation of internationally protected rights, pursuant to Article 1(1) of the American Convention. :124. The Court is aware that domestic judges and courts are bound to respect the rule of law, and therefore, they are bound to apply the provisions in force within the legal system. But when a State has ratified an international treaty such as the American Convention, its judges, as part of the State, are also bound by such Convention. This forces them to see that all the effects of the provisions embodied in the Convention are not adversely affected by the enforcement of laws which are contrary to its purpose and that have not had any legal effects since their inception. :In other words, the Judiciary must exercise a sort of “conventionality control” between the domestic legal provisions which are applied to specific cases and the American Convention on Human Rights. To perform this task, the Judiciary has to take into account not only the treaty, but also the interpretation thereof made by the Inter- American Court, which is the ultimate interpreter of the American Convention.\\" References Category:Inter-American Court of Human Rights cases ","title":"Almonacid-Arellano et al v.

With a budget of €1 billion, it represents a new form of joint, coordinated research initiative on an unprecedented scale. Through a combined academic- industrial consortium, the research effort covers the entire value chain, from materials production to components and system integration, and targets a number of specific goals that exploit the unique properties of graphene. There are some critics of this and similar initiatives, arguing that excessive funding of graphene-related research and innovation is disproportional to estimates of industrial potential. Goal The Graphene Flagship is tasked with bringing together academic and industrial researchers to take graphene from the realm of academic laboratories into European society in the space of ten years, thus generating economic growth, new jobs and new opportunities for Europeans as both investors and employees. History In 2009, the European Commission identified the need for Europe to address the big scientific and technological challenges of the age through long-term, multidisciplinary R&D; efforts. One of the first European Future and Emerging Technologies (FET) Flagships, the Graphene Flagship was founded in October 2013. The Graphene Flagship was initially implemented as a Seventh Framework Programme under the auspices of the European Commission's Directorate General for Communications Networks, Content and Technology (DG Connect). Now the consortium will fall under FP7's successor research and innovation framework, Horizon 2020. The second FET Flagship, The Human Brain Project, is charged with revolutionizing the future of neuroscience. In May 2016 the EC has announced the third FET Flagship, Quantum Technologies Flagship, which will become a key part of the data and computing Infrastructure which underpins the European Cloud Initiative, as part of the Commission's strategy to digitize European industry. Organisation The Graphene Flagship is coordinated by Chalmers University of Technology based in Gothenburg, Sweden. Director of the Graphene Flagship is Professor Jari Kinaret, leader of the Condensed Matter Theory group at Chalmers’ Department of Applied Physics. Vice-Director of the Graphene Flagship is Professor Vincenzo Palermo, who holds a joint position as research director of the National Research Council of Italy, and research professor at Chalmers University of Technology. The operative management is handled by the Director and a Management Panel which is chaired by the Science and Technology Officer, Prof. Andrea C. Ferrari from the University of Cambridge, and includes the Flagship Director, the Head of Innovation and the five Division Heads. Strategic decisions are taken by the Executive Board which includes the members of the management panel and ten members elected by the General Assembly of all 150 partners. The Strategic Advisory Council (SAC) consists of world-renowned scientific and industrial experts, including four Nobel laureates. Its key tasks are to advise on strategic research decisions and issues pertaining to handling and protection of intellectual property whilst also facilitating contacts to related national and international research programs and acting as ambassadors for the Graphene Flagship. The Chairman of the Strategic Advisory Council is Professor Sir Andre Geim, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK. The Graphene Flagship is divided into 20 work packages, 15 focusing on specific science and technology topics, and five dedicated to innovation and operational/management functions. The work packages are grouped into six divisions to enhance collaboration and communication. One of the Divisions is housing the partnering projects. Funding The Graphene Flagship is divided into two separate phases: a 30-month ramp-up phase under the 7th Framework Program (October 1, 2013 – March 31, 2016) with a total European Commission funding of €54 million, and a steady state phase under the Horizon 2020 Program with expected European Commission funding of €50 million per year. During the FP7 phase the flagship was implemented as a combination of two instruments, a Collaborative Project, Coordination and Support Action (CP-CSA), and a European Research Area Network Plus (ERANET+), while in H2020 the flagship is being implemented as a single instrument. In FP7, the CP-CSA was funded by the EC according to standard FP7 financing schemes, and the ERANET+ was funded jointly by the EC and the member state funding organisations. In H2020, the single instrument is being funded jointly by the EC and the member states.

Boy Scouts from the Netherlands Indies at the World Scout Jamboree in the Netherlands (1937) Scouting came to Indonesia in 1912, as a branch of Dutch Scouting. After 1916 it was called the Nederland Indische Padvinders Vereeniging (Netherlands Indies Scout Movement). Other Scouting organizations were established by the Indonesia Scouts in 1916.
