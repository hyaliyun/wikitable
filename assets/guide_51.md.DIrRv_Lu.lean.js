Civil Engineering Practice: Spring/Summer 2001  History  Industrial Revolution = ASME Historic Landmark In light of the industrial revolution, the widespread use of water powered mills, and the need for higher and higher efficiencies, Professor George I. Alden of WPI saw the need for a new lab. The Hydraulic Testing Lab at WPI was established in 1894 on the site of an old woolen mill donated to the institute by Stephen Salisbury III. It was the third of its kind in the US. The first two instruments obtained for the lab, a wooden framed structure only 90' by 40', were a copper-lined weigh tank on a Fairbanks scale from the Philadelphia Centennial Exposition, and a 36\\" by 16\\" Herschel Venturi flow meter from the 1893 Chicago Columbian Exposition. These state of the art instruments were used by students to conduct experiments on the efficiency of full sized turbines, measure flows and head loss, and test a hydraulic ram.WPI Course Catalog 1895 In 1908 a wooden rotating boom was constructed on one of the ponds on the property to test large hydraulic equipment including current meters. In 1911 it was replaced by a steel boom which was used for the same purpose and eventually to test airplane propellers; it is now an ASME Historic Landmark.http://www.asme.org/Communities/History/Landmarks/Alden_Research_Laboratory.cfm = Mid-Century = Alden contributed to the war effort in the 1940s through studies of the physics of the entry of projectiles into water. Early high speed photography equipment was developed for use with strobe lights to document the effect of projectile shape on entry stability in large glass sided tanks.The Role of Contributions of Hydraulic Testing Labs: Part II, World War I to World War II. George Hecker, Albert Feron, Bruce J. Pennino. Civil Engineering Practice: Fall/Winter 1999 During the 1950s, the increase in power use demanded expansion of generation capacity and led to increased use of physical models for solving problems with circulating water systems, including the use of hydro-thermal modeling to meet water quality requirements. This need resulted in the construction of 10 large test sheds to house these models. Physical models were applied to various flow problems such as pump intakes, emergency core cooling sumps, riverine problems, etc.http://www.aldenlab.com/index.cfm/About/History = Incorporation = In 1986 the Alden Hydraulic Lab became Alden Research Laboratory and was incorporated as an entity separate from WPI. Since that time Alden has added on to its original Hydraulic and Calibration Groups and formed its Environmental, Numeric, Air and Gas,The Role of Contributions of Hydraulic Testing Labs: Part IV, Modern Power Plant Studies. George Hecker, Albert Feron, Bruce J. Pennino. Civil Engineering Practice: Fall/Winter 2000 and Field Service Groups.  Major Innovations  In recent history, Alden's team of engineers have worked on several influential projects including: *The design and testing of the Alden/NREC Fish Friendly Turbine *And the writing of EPRI's \\"Wet Stack Design Guide\\" \\"Wet Stack Design Guide\\" (EPRI TR-107099)  Acquisition of the Redmond, Washington Laboratory  Alden acquired AECOM's hydraulic engineering and modeling laboratory in Redmond, Wash., and hired the associated staff on August 18, 2012. Combining the modeling talents and fisheries knowledge of Alden staff with the 34 years of hydraulic modeling and fisheries engineering experience of the AECOM hydraulic engineering and modeling operation, Alden created the largest commercial hydraulic engineering laboratory system in North America. The Redmond laboratory was formerly known as the \\"ENSR hydraulics lab,\\" and became part of AECOM in 2005 when AECOM acquired ENSR. Charles \\"Chick\\" Sweeney, P.E., started the independent hydraulic modeling laboratory in 1978. The hydraulics lab had been a leader in the optimization of hydraulic structures and fish passage systems associated with hydroelectric power generation, working especially closely with federal agencies and hydroelectric power utilities in the Pacific Northwest. Additionally, the group has helped municipal utilities to ensure proper performance of pump stations and water conveyance systems. Capabilities include physical hydraulic modeling, 1-D and 2-D numeric modeling, 3-D computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling, fisheries and hydraulic engineering design, and field services. Alden had been expanding geographically in recent years, having opened up an office in Fort Collins, Colo., in 2009, and establishing a presence in Portland, Ore., in 2011. This addition was a major milestone in an ongoing effort to better serve clients in the U.S. and internationally  Alden Today  Alden continues to be an acclaimed leader in solving flow-related engineering and environmental problems. The firm has 100 employees and over 120,000 sq feet of indoor lab space on a 32-acre campus in Holden, MA, and an additional 25,000 square feet of laboratory space in Redmond, WA. Alden provides engineering, physical and computational flow modeling along with environmental and flow meter calibration services.

It was last assigned to the 321st Missile Group at Grand Forks Air Force Base, North Dakota, where it was equipped with the LGM-30G Minuteman III Intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), with a mission of nuclear deterrence. The squadron was first activated in 1942 as the 448th Bombardment Squadron and was equipped with North American B-25 Mitchell medium bombers. After training in the United States, it deployed to the Mediterranean Theater of Operations, serving in combat until 1945. The squadron earned a Distinguished Unit Citation for its actions. After the war, it returned to the United States and was inactivated. From 1947 through 1949, it served in the reserve, but does not appear to have been fully manned or equipped. The squadron was activated in Strategic Air Command in 1953 and served with Boeing B-47 Stratojets until inactivating in 1961. it was activated at Malmstrom in 1965 as the 448th Strategic Missile Squadron. HistoryWorld War II= Activated in mid-1942 as a North American B-25 Mitchell medium bomber squadron, trained by Third Air Force in the southeastern United States. Deployed to the Mediterranean Theater of Operations, being assigned to Twelfth Air Force in Algeria in early 1943. In North Africa, the squadron engaged primarily in support and interdictory operations, bombing marshalling yards, rail lines, highways, bridges, viaducts, troop concentrations, gun emplacements, shipping, harbors, and other objectives in North Africa. The squadron also engaged in psychological warfare missions, dropping propaganda leaflets behind enemy lines. Took part in the Allied operations against Axis forces in North Africa during March–May 1943, the reduction of Pantelleria and Lampedusa islands during June, the invasion of Sicily in July, the landing at Salerno in September, the Allied advance toward Rome during January–June 1944, the invasion of Southern France in August 1944, and the Allied operations in northern Italy from September 1944 to April 1945. Inactivated in Italy after the German Capitulation in September 1945. Reactivated as part of the reserve in 1947 and then inactivated in 1949 due to budget cuts. =Strategic Air Command= Was reactivated in 1959 as a Strategic Air Command Boeing B-47 Stratojet squadron . Trained in air refueling and strategic bombardment operations with the B-47. in 1961, the squadron began transferring its B-47s to other SAC wings and became non- operational as part of the phaseout of the B-47. =Intercontinental ballistic missile squadron= On 1 September 1965 the 446th Strategic Missile Squadron was organized as a SAC LGM-30F Minuteman II intercontinental ballistic missile squadron. It became operational on 7 December 1966, with a complement of 50 missiles. Participated in \\"Project Long Life II\\", a unique reliability test in which modified Minuteman missiles were fueled to travel a few hundred yards. The first launch from a silo occurred on 19 October 1966 and was declared unsuccessful. Nine days later, a second attempt also failed. A third attempt under \\"Project Giant Boost\\" occurred in August 1968 and again proved unsuccessful. From December 1971 to March 1973, converted to LGM-30G Minuteman III missiles. These missiles represented a significant technological advancement, having multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles (MIRVs). Coordinating the missile changeover required complex planning and execution. With the restructuring of the Air Force and the disestablishment of Strategic Air Command (SAC) in the early 1990s was reassigned to Air Combat Command in 1992 and then under Air Force Space Command in 1993. In March 1995, the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Commission selected the 321st Strategic Missile Wing for inactivation. Squadron was ordered to securely transfer its alert responsibilities to the 341st Missile Wing at Malmstrom Air Force Base, Montana. Maintained nuclear alert until inactivated in 1997, nearly 40 years after it went on alert.

Career  Cassel was a Professor of Information Technology at Humber College in Toronto, Ontario from 1968 to 1998. In 1968, after arriving at Humber from IBM, he developed the college's first Computer Programming program, which is still part of the curriculum. During this time he specialized in computer programming and application software courses. He was a founding member of the Information Systems department in 1968 where he was department head for 10 years. During his tenure at Humber Cassel developed numerous courses and was active in curriculum development for the School of Business and later for the School of Information Technology. He developed one of the first online interactive courses at Humber for Microsoft Access using WebCT. WebCT became a significant tool for developing and delivering distance learning for the college. Cassel was a computer programmer and system analyst with IBM Canada from 1961 to 1968. He received an undergraduate degree in Computer Science from York University in 1975 and was accepted into the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education at the University of Toronto for a Master of Education program, completing the first year of the two-year program. At this point writing college textbooks began to require his full attention. In 1972 his first book, Programming Language One, was published by Reston Publishing Company of Reston, Virginia, a subsidiary of Prentice Hall Inc. Thus began a long period of textbook writing for college programs across North America.

Life and career  Balcombe began rock climbing in the English Lake District in the 1920s as a Boy Scout. Balcombe continued his love affair with the Lakeland crags during an early posting to Reading, Berkshire, by joining a mountaineering group which later became the Tricouni Club. Balcombe was one of the most technically gifted rock climbers of the early 1930s, pioneering three Lakes climbing routes (Buttonhook HVS, Engineers Slabs, VS and Central Buttress Direct Finish HVS) that were technically far ahead of their time during a two-week period in 1934.http://footlesscrow.blogspot.co.uk/2011/10/two-weeks-in-june-graham- balcombe-and.html In 1936 Balcombe lead a party of German climbers on a visit to the Lake district in what was to be his last significant contribution to the activity. Balcombe worked for the Post Office as a telecommunications engineer where he met Jack Sheppard. The pair became rock climbing partners and while based in Bristol became interested in the caves of the Mendip Hills, particularly Swildon's Hole which they believed connected to the Cheddar Caves.Graham Balcombe, Alpine Journal Vol. 83 No. 327 (1978) At the time, the limit of exploration was a flooded underwater passage or \\"syphon\\" (sump). Various attempts were made pass this obstacle, at first using explosives and then by diving. Initial attempts were unsuccessful and Balcombe's attentions moved to Wookey Hole where standard diving dress was used to explore upstream from the limit of the Show Cave at Chamber 3 as far as the Seventh Chamber.Balcombe, F.G.; Powell, P.M.; The Log of the Wookey Hole Exploration Expedition 1935 private publication (1935) During the Second World War, Balcombe was stationed in Harrogate, North Yorkshire, where he continued to develop his diving equipment, which was put to use at local sites such as Alum Pot, Keld Head and Goyden Pot. After the war Balcombe co-founded the Cave Diving Group in 1946. He ran operations from his base in London and remained involved in cave diving up to his retirement from the activity in 1957. During his later life, Balcombe was made Honorary President of the Cave Diving Group, a role which he shared with Sheppard. His memoirs were published posthumously in 2007.

At the time of the 2001 Nepal census it had a population of 4844 people with 2457 male population and 2387 female population. Toponymy The name of the village of Jhorahat is formed from jhora, which means \\"forest\\", and hat, which means \\"bazaar\\". The name is perhaps an indication that the place was settled by cutting down a forest present there hundreds of years ago. Economy Farming is the main source of income for people in Jhorahat, and it is an agricultural trade centre, being situated along a secondary road between Biratnagar and the east-west highway. Being only about 5 km from the outskirts of Biratnagar, some residents of the area work as laborers in factories in Biratnagar or some in higher ranks in various firms and government offices. There are some brick kilns in the countryside east of Jhorahat. Large haat or Bazaar is organised every Monday and Friday. This complements a number of much smaller haats held in surrounding villages.

Importance of date Although not the date of formal, complete independence from France, 18 December marks the founding of the Republic and creation of the Presidency of the Republic of Niger, following the constitutional changes of the French Fifth Republic, and the elections of 4 December 1958 held across the French colonial possessions. Nigeriens consider this date to be the founding of their national institutions. Between 18 December 1958 and 3 August 1960, Niger remained a semi-autonomous Republic within the French Community. Commemoration Since 1958, the 18th has been an historic anniversary, widely commemorated, but not a national festival. In 2005, the government of the Fifth Republic of Niger declared the 18th a national holiday, in conjunction with the 3 August Independence Day.Niger: Début des festivités marquant le 50ème anniversaire de la proclamation de la république . Xinhua News. 12 December 2008. The 18th is celebrated in Niger with official festivals and appearances of political leaders, as well as public parties and festivities. It is a public holiday, in which government offices and many businesses close. The 50th anniversary celebrations were held in 2008, centered not in the capitol, but in the regional center of Tillabéry, and surrounded by sports, musical and arts competitions, the construction and opening of new buildings, a National Youth Festival, and other public festivities. Since the beginning of this national festival in 2006, the official commemorations have always taken place at Regional capitals. Zinder was chosen for 2006 (the 48th anniversary) and again in 2018, Tahoua for 2007 and again 2017, Agadez for 2016, Maradi for 2015, Dosso for 2014, etc.Le saviez-vous ? LE WASSAN KARA.

Ahmed, who was a key link between British recruits and al-Qaeda leaders, was responsible for setting up a terrorist cell in Manchester and contacting one of the terrorists responsible for the failed London bombings of 21 July 2005. Early life Ahmed was born in Rochdale in Greater Manchester and moved to the Kashmir area of Pakistan at the age of seven or eight. At the age of 18, Ahmed was arrested by Indian forces after allegedly fighting as a member of the Harkat-ul-Mujahideen and was held in an Indian jail for seven years without charge; during this time Ahmed was also allegedly tortured. While incarcerated, Ahmed received money from Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh, who later allegedly had Daniel Pearl murdered. Ahmed was eventually released in 2001 and he subsequently visited the UK for a brief period of time before returning to Pakistan. He returned to the UK again in 2005. Al-Qaeda and British intelligence In 2005, surveillance by British intelligence revealed a diary in Ahmed's possession (located in his luggage at the time) containing al-Qaeda contacts, with some contact details written in invisible ink. Included in the contact list were the personal details of Abu Hamza Rabia, who was later killed in Pakistan on 30 November 2005, during a US/Pakistani joint operation. Traces of explosives were also found on Ahmed's rucksack. Following his arrest, Ahmed was initially held in a secret Pakistani prison facility, where he claims he was tortured alongside Hassan Ghul.Testimony of Rangzieb Ahmed A second confrontation with the UK authorities occurred in 2007 when Ahmed was captured at London's Heathrow Airport following his arrival from Pakistan. On this occasion, he was charged with \\"directing the activities of an organization which was concerned in the commission of acts of terrorism\\", \\"possessing three books containing information which would be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism\\", and \\"possession of a rucksack containing traces of an explosive, in circumstances which suggested it was for a purpose connected with terrorism\\". In December 2008, Ahmed was convicted in the UK of \\"directing the activities of an organization which was concerned in the commission of acts of terrorism\\". Such a finding of guilt meant that Ahmed was the first member of al-Qaeda to be convicted for directing terrorism in the UK. He was sentenced to life imprisonment and has been directed to serve a minimum of ten years before he is considered for parole.Al Qaida terrorist jailed for life Torture controversy On 7 July 2009, David Davis, a British Member of Parliament (MP), accused the UK government of \\"outsourcing torture\\". Davis contended that the UK government allowed Ahmed to leave the UK and enter Pakistan (even though they had evidence against him upon which he was later convicted), that Pakistani Inter-Services Intelligence detained and questioned Ahmed under torture, and that British intelligence and police agencies had full knowledge of this. Davis further accused the UK government of trying to gag Ahmed by preventing him from coming forward with accusations after his imprisonment following his return to the UK. Davis stated that there was \\"an alleged request to drop his allegations of torture: if he did that, they could get his sentence cut and possibly give him some money. If this request to drop the torture case is true, it is frankly monstrous. It would at the very least be a criminal misuse of the powers and funds under the Government's CONTEST strategy, and at worst a conspiracy to pervert the course of justice.\\" Appeal Quashed During the appeal hearing in 2010, Rangzieb Ahmed's QC, Joel Bennathan, claimed he was beaten and had three of his fingernails pulled out with pliers over the course of three days - and that the UK was \\"complicit\\" in acts of torture. He argued that the trial judge should have halted the proceedings against him as an abuse of process. Ahmed's allegations were rejected at his appeal hearing, his appeal dismissed and his application to have his case be heard by the Supreme Court turned down. On 25 February 2010 Lord Justice Hughes ruled that Ahmed's conviction by the jury was safe. He supported the trial judge's original findings: \\"...that torture had not been demonstrated to have occurred, and had been demonstrated not to have occurred before the sole occasion when Rangzieb said he had been seen by British officers.\\" On the suggestion of outsourcing torture by British authorities the trial judge had found \\"simply no evidence that they had assisted or encouraged the Pakistani detainers to detain him unlawfully or to ill-treat him in any way, whether amounting to torture or not\\".BBC News :Terror boss Rangzieb Ahmed loses conviction appeal https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-12580780 25 February 2011 The Guardian: Terrorist who alleged torture in custody loses appeal https://www.theguardian.com/law/2011/feb/25/terrorist-torture-britain- pakistan-complicity-appeal 25 February 2011 Ahmed has since applied to have his case reviewed by Strasbourg.Telegraph: Terrorists seek a safe haven in Strasbourg https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/telegraph- view/9499232/Terrorists-seek-a-safe-haven-in-Strasbourg.html 26 Aug 2012 References Category:Living people Category:British al-Qaeda members Category:English people of Pakistani descent Category:English Islamists Category:Islamic terrorism in England Category:Muslims with branch missing Category:Kashmiri militants Category:Kashmiri Islamists Category:People from Rochdale Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:British torture victims Category:People imprisoned on charges of terrorism Category:Prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment by the United Kingdom Category:English people of Mirpuri descent Category:Kashmiri Muslims Category:English emigrants to Pakistan ","title":"Rangzieb Ahmed"},{"id":"20758546","text":"Sijuwa is a part of Ratuwamai municipality in Morang District in the Kosi Zone of south-eastern Nepal.

IFF claims to be the UK's only interfaith film festival and has the tagline \\"Faith in Film\\". IFF exists to encourage filmmakers throughout the world to make films about the subject of faith, irrespective of their own personal world views. The Festival creates events and spaces where such films can be displayed, discussed and celebrated. It welcomes participants from all faith backgrounds and none and focuses particularly on young filmmakers. In doing so it wants to make positive contributions to understanding, respect and community cohesion. IFF organises an awards ceremony to reward film of excellence and relevance to the objectives of each prize. IFF is not a religious organisation: it is a Community Interest Company that allows space for discussion, learning and screening films. The Festival welcomes filmmakers and other participants of all faiths and none to take part. IFF continues to expand into new areas of work outside the Festival itself: expansion of awards; education events; Insight Annual Lectures; workshops; curation projects; and participation within other film festivals and other relevant events to screen an Insight strand. History1st Insight Film Festival= Venue, Nexus Arts Cafe Manchester (2007) The Festival was launched in 2007 as an initiative of religious and education television producer John Forrest with the support and encouragement of the Centre for Screen Studies at the University of Manchester, through the personal involvement of Dr David Butler and other media practitioners from the Centre. The initial idea of IFF was to publicise an invitation to make a film about faith, with a prize of £1000 attached alongside a seminar event to discuss faith in the context of film. Response exceeded expectation and convinced the organisers to run an expanded event in Manchester in 2009. =2nd Insight Film Festival= Venue, Zion Arts Centre, Manchester, now called Z-arts (2009) The 2nd IFF was a larger event than the inaugural gathering, which meant that the Festival moved to a larger venue, which remains the IFF's home in Manchester. The main innovation was the introduction of an awards ceremony that presented an award for the best film submitted to the festival (see Awards section). The 2nd IFF was the first to encourage filmmakers around the world to submit their work to a judging panel that considered the merits of quality and relevance to the theme of the films entered into the show. =3rd Insight Film Festival= Venue, Z-arts, Manchester (3–4 December 2011) More than 300 delegates attended the 3rd IFF, again held at Z-arts. The Festival in 2011 saw the introduction of the Insight Annual Lecture (\\"see Lecture section), now a key part of the Festival's remit. The Festival comprised two days of screenings, workshops and discussions. The programme included a preview of a UK feature, viewings of over 50 short films from across the globe. The 3rd IFF managed and judged nine awards, which resulted in nine winning film entries and seven special commendations (see Awards section for full list of winners) =4th Insight Film Festival= Venue, Z-arts, Manchester (15–17 March 2013) The 4th IFF comprised three days of screenings, workshops and discussions, including presentations of short films from all over the world. Filmmakers from a total of 64 countries submitted their work for consideration for awards. On 15 March 2013 Insight held their first ‘Education Day’, an exclusive daytime event for local schools. At a special awards ceremony on 17 March 2013, winning films were announced in a range of categories, including the prestigious Coexist Award that bestows a cash prize of £1000 to the film that best depicts the ‘uniting of faith’ across the world’s religions (see Awards section for full list of winners) Awards This section gives details of the prizes awards at each IFF, the members of the judging panels, the names of prize-winning filmmakers and those given special commendations, and the titles of the winning films: =1st Insight Film Festival= The inaugural event introduced an award with a prize of £1000 for the best film about faith.

It is possible for foreign bodies to enter the from the mouth, or from the rectum. The objects most commonly swallowed by children are coins. Meat impaction, resulting in esophageal food bolus obstruction is more common in adults. Swallowed objects are more likely to lodge in the esophagus or stomach than in the pharynx or duodenum. Diagnosis If the person who swallowed the foreign body is doing well, usually an x-ray image will be taken which will show any metal objects, and this will be repeated a few days later to confirm that the object has passed all the way through the digestive system. Also it needs to be confirmed that the object is not stuck in the airways, in the bronchial tree. Image:Bolletjes.jpgAbdominal X-ray showing small packages of cocaine swallowed by a trafficker.

Treatment Most objects that are swallowed will, if they have passed the pharynx, pass all the way through the gastrointestinal tract unaided. However, sometimes an object becomes arrested (usually in the terminal ileum or the rectum) or a sharp object penetrates the bowel wall. If the foreign body causes problems like pain, vomiting or bleeding it must be removed. Swallowed batteries can be associated with additional damage, with mercury poisoning (from mercury batteries) and lead poisoning (from lead batteries) presenting important risks. Endoscopic foreign body retrieval is the first-line treatment for removal of a foreign body from the alimentary tract. Glucagon has been used to treat esophageal foreign bodies, with the intent that it relaxes the smooth muscle of the lower esophageal spincter to allow the foreign body to pass into the stomach. However, evidence does not support a benefit of treatment with glucagon, and its use may result in side effects.

It sits off the coast of Canacona. It is part of Goa, although the nearest land is part of Karnataka state. It extends over and has no resident population. It was part of the Portuguese Estado da Índia until 1961. The island is south of Goa, about from the coast. The island is home to the Portuguese-built Anjediva fortress, which houses the shrines of Our Lady of Brotas and São Francisco de Assis. The island is connected to the mainland by a breakwater and is part of INS Kadamba Naval Base, on the outskirts of the city of Karwar and is under the direct jurisdiction of the Indian Navy. Etymology The island's name seems to have been derived from local goddess Ajadurga Devi, whose invocation is believed to have led to its Konkani language name of Anjadip. Another theory points to words from Malayalam and Tamil language as the origin. Anji div corresponds to the fifth island and Anjediva belongs to an archipelago of five coastal islets, supporting that theory. The others are Kurnagal, Mudlingud, Devgad and Devragad. Geography  The island lies approximately 1.8 km from the district of Uttar Kannada. It is 4 km south of Karwar (once Baticala, or the kingdom of Garsopa, in Portuguese times) and about 87 km south of what once was called the city of Goa. Covering only 1.5 square kilometers, the island is 1.3 km long and 300 meters wide, on average. The only regular presence is members of the Indian Navy. Occasionally, other visitors and fishermen come across the island. In the nineteenth century, some 200 people had permanent settlements there. HistoryOrigin= The island appears to have been described by Ptolemy. Archaeological research found pillars, worked stones and pottery dating from the eleventh and twelfth centuries CE in the artistic style of the Kadambas and Chalukyas. They are likely remnants of the Aryadurga goddess' Devi temple. Vasco da Gama claimed the island as Portuguese crown territory on September 24, 1498 during his first trip to India. Fort Anjediva The Portuguese presence on the island began with the landing of D. Francisco de Almeida on September 13, 1505, who ordered the building of a fortress, which was destroyed seven months later. The Afonso de Albuquerque attack, which culminated in the conquest of Goa in 1510, was launched from Anjediva. The island was unoccupied until 1661 when the English settled there, waiting for the treaty of July 23 to be complied. This treaty eventually yielded them Bombay, which was transferred among the colonial powers in 1665. =English presence= The English presence came when Viceroy Antonio de Melo e Castro refused to hand Bombay to the British following the marriage of Charles II to Catherine of Braganza, in which the city formed part of her dowry. Ships transported the English troops, commanded by the Earl of Marlborough and accompanied by future Governor-general Sir Abraham Shipman, sought shelter from the monsoons. Shipman, along with many officers and soldiers, eventually died due to the climate and poor housing, so harsh that of the initial force of over 500 men who arrived in 1565, only 191 men survived to leave the island. With the departure of the British in 1665, the island was vacant until the Marathas raids (led by Sambhaji in 1682) forced the Portuguese to rebuild the fort. The work was ordered by viceroy Francisco de Távora, Count of Alvor, as recorded by a plaque placed on the fortress. In addition to the Anjediva Fort, the island was defended by other forts. Military barracks were constructed. A church dedicated to Our Lady of Brotas was built, along with a chapel dedicated to Our Lady of Sorrows (Nossa Senhora das Dores) and St. Francis of Assisi. A large tank for drinking water supplied water to the barracks and ships. The present church of Our Lady of Brotas was built in 1729 at the site where Pedro Alvares Cabral landed on August 22, 1500. He was then in command of the second Portuguese expedition of India and attended a Thanksgiving Mass celebrated by Friar Henrique de Coimbra, in the presence of eight Franciscan friars. It was the first mass celebrated by the Portuguese in India. =Refuge= During the Portuguese occupation in the eighteenth century, the island sheltered Christians and Hindus of the mainland coastal border. The invasion of the realms of Bednore and Soonda by the Muslim forces of Tipu Sultan created the new potentate of Khodadad by seizing the throne of the Maharajas of Mysore. The island then reached its highest development, and in 1768 it had a governor with staff and 350 soldiers. In 1856, the island was hit by a major epidemic, attributed to a cemetery near the source of water that supplied the population. Once the cemetery was transferred to the island's north side, living conditions improved significantly. The population that had meanwhile settled in Boca de Vaca in Panjim no longer wanted to return. In 1954 relations between Portugal and India had started to deteriorate. Retired military personnel then settled on Anjediva. Following allegations of incursions by Indian forces, the Portuguese placed a military detachment on the island. Links with Goa were maintained, but in the monsoon season, the island was isolated. In 1960, at the initiative of governor- general General Vassallo e Silva, the Church of Our Lady of Brotas and the Chapel of St. Francis of Assisi were restored along with the island's barracks. Portuguese–Indian relations Coat of arms of Portuguese India (1935–1951) On November 24, 1961, just before the invasion of Portuguese India by the Republic of India, Anjediva was the scene of an incident when an Indian passenger ship, the Sabarmati, was fired upon by the Portuguese military garrison, injuring a crew member and killing a passenger. The Portuguese government had argued that the naval area on the island had been invaded. Although this was already in preparation, the incident contributed to the outbreak of Operation Vijay, which culminated at the end of Portuguese rule in Goa and its incorporation into the Indian Union. Recognizing the strategic importance of Anjediva, the island was occupied on December 22, 1961, in a military action that cost the lives of seven Indian soldiers remembered in a monument there. This reduced the civilian population to four persons: two elderly women, a man and a child along with 30 Goan and Portuguese soldiers. After 1961, the population of about 200 fishermen who frequented Anjediva migrated to the mainland. The island remained abandoned until 1982, when, at the initiative of a local priest, the church was restored and pilgrimages resumed. Indian rule Martyr's Memorial Following an agreement in 1987 between the Goa government and the Indian Navy, the island became part of the Naval Base of Karwar in 1991. It is known as INS Kadamba or \\"Seabird\\". The base is projected to become one of the largest naval bases in Asia. This action, taken by Ravi S. Naik, who was, at the time, the chief minister of Goa, was strongly challenged, as the island was considered part of Goa's historical heritage. Construction of the base included the installation of a 1,800 meter-long breakwater connecting the northeast tip of the island to the tip of Binaga on the mainland, which allowed for road access. The island celebrate the annual feast of Our Lady of Brotas, held on February 2, and the Feast of the Hermitage St. Francis of Assisi, held on 4 October. In 2016, the Indian Parliament announced that Project Seabird at Karwar was a sensitive project, wherein people could not be allowed to access it freely. This created a local problem. Thereafter, it was impossible to grant permission to celebrate feasts at Anjediva Island in Goa. Geography The island is located west of Karwar, Karnataka and is surrounded by the Arabian Sea. Culture The island is known for its annual feast of Our Lady of Springs (Nossa Senhora das Brotas) on 2 February and Feast of the Chapel of St. Francis D’Assisi on 4 October.

It is a weekly newspaper published every Wednesday and once competed with another newspaper called the Leitrim Post which was forced to close in 2009 during the economic crash. History The Leitrim Observer was founded by the Mulvey family in 1889 and was bought by Pat Dunne, for a rumoured sum of £150 some time before 1910. The paper has experienced a very varied and colourful history. The Black and Tans made the paper their first stop when they came to Carrick-on-Shannon during the War of Independence and badly burned the premises, destroying a lot of the early files of the paper. In those times the local news pages were printed at the paper's works in Carrick-on-Shannon, while the \\"international\\" news pages were printed elsewhere, and of course, the front page was already devoted entirely to advertising. During Pat Dunne's internment in Ballykinlar, Co. Down, his sister Liza ran the paper for a time. Not many people know that at one point the paper was printed on a Thursday and it was only when the war started in 1939 that this had the effect of bringing the paper's publishing day back a day to a Wednesday, in order to meet the Dublin train which was reduced to running on a once weekly basis. The paper was brought initially by canal to Carrick and about one and a half bales of the paper would be enough for that week's paper. Each paper was folded by hand and it was not until the early 1950s that the first folding machine was introduced. In 1947 a major blizzard in the West of Ireland brought everything to a standstill including the Observer. It was a few days late that week as the storm had knocked out all electricity in the area and made transport impossible. Down the latter part of the 20th century the paper moved from hot metal printing to the use of linotype machines. The third linotype machine to be bought for the paper had to be lowered from a four story building in Cork city before it could be transported back to Leitrim. Another milestone in the history of the paper was the massive investment for the Observer of an electronic photo-engraving machine, only the second of its kind in Ireland, which set Pat Dunne back £5,000. Pat Dunne died one Sunday afternoon in 1968, which saw the end of an era for the Observer. However, his nephew, Greg then took over the running of the company, re-organising the paper and spending £10,000 on a Reel Fed Flat Bed printing machine from London and a Duplex machine which enabled the paper to introduce \\"spot\\" colour occasionally. In later years another Pat Dunne, son of Greg, took over as managing director of the paper. The Leitrim Observer is one of the few provincial papers that can boast full computerisation with everything from the newsroom, to advertising, to photographs, processed through state of the art technology. This modern advancement has also resulted in full page make-up on computers with the pages then sent for printing in Northern Ireland. In September 1998 Scottish Radio Holdings purchased the Leitrim Observer for £1 million. UK-based group Johnston Press later purchased the Leitrim Observer in June 2005. The paper is currently owned by Iconic Newspapers, which acquired Johnston Press's titles in the Republic of Ireland in 2014. Circulation According to ABC, circulation declined to 6,273 for the period July 2012 to December 2012, this represented a fall of 9% on a year-on-year basis.http://www.ilevel.ie/media-blog/print/102470-regional- newspapers-abc-circulation-july-dec-2012 References Category:1889 establishments in Ireland Category:Carrick-on-Shannon Category:Newspapers published in the Republic of Ireland Category:Publications established in 1889 Category:Weekly newspapers published in Ireland ","title":"Leitrim Observer"},{"id":"20758883","text":"Mount Julian is a peak located at the southern end of Maligne Lake in Jasper National Park, Canada.

San Francisco Hornblower Hybrid  The San Francisco Hornblower Hybrid is a catamaran, with a fully enclosed main deck, and covered roof deck. In 2008 the vessel was acquired by Alcatraz Cruises, a subsidiary of Hornblower Cruises. The vessel, which was previously a commercial diving boat, underwent a retrofit, repower and refurbishment operation, at a cost of USD 4 million. In addition to its main power train, which consists of Tier 2 marine diesel engines, the Hornblower Hybrid uses power generated by two ten-foot-tall twisted Savonius wind turbines and a photovoltaic solar array covering the awning on the top deck. That supplementary power is converted and stored in batteries which power the navigation equipment, lighting, and electronics on board. Excess power can be stored in the main propulsion battery banks. The ship was presented as the first passenger boat in the US to use both wind and sun power. The drive system allows the captain to monitor the energy needs of the vessel and select the most appropriate power sources. For example, when the boat is idle at the dock, the engines may shut off so that the motors may run on energy stored in the battery banks. The vessel also contains a number of other environmentally friendly materials. The carpeting contains post consumer recycled materials, is recyclable and meets the US Green Building Council LEED criteria for recycled content. A significant portion of the interior signage is printed on Plyboo, a composite material made from sustainable sources and containing no harmful chemicals. The lighting throughout the vessel is LED. The ship was mentioned among the Workboat Significant Boats of 2009 list. It was a finalist in the Sustainable Shipping awards.  New York Hornblower Hybrid  Two years after the introduction of the San Francisco vessel, Hornblower Cruises subsidiary Statue Cruises announced works on a second ship. The New York Hornblower Hybrid was completed on October 26, 2011. In addition to using solar power, wind power, and low- emission diesel, the New York Hornblower Hybrid also runs on hydrogen fuel cells, making it the first hydrogen hybrid ferry in the world. The Hybrid is 168 feet long by 40 feet wide and designed to carry 600 passengers. It features two Helix wind 5-kilowatt wind turbines, a 20 kilowatt solar array, LEED certified carpets, LED lighting, and an interior made partly of recycled and sustainable materials.

The engagement was one of several between rival frigate squadrons contesting control of the French island base of Île de France, from which French frigates had raided British trade routes during the war. The action came in the immediate aftermath of the Battle of Grand Port, in which four British frigates had been lost, and just four days after a fifth British frigate had been captured and subsequently recaptured in the Action of 13 September 1810. In consequence of the heavy losses the British force had suffered, reinforcements were hastily rushed to the area and became individual targets for the larger French squadron blockading the British base at Île Bourbon. HMS Ceylon had been despatched by the British authorities at Madras after the Battle of Grand Port to reinforce the remains of the squadron under Commodore Josias Rowley on Île Bourbon. Searching for Rowley off Île de France, Ceylon was spotted by French Commodore Jacques Hamelin who gave chase in his flagship Vénus, supported by a corvette. Vénus was faster than Ceylon, and although Captain Charles Gordon almost reached the safety of Île Bourbon, he was run down and forced to engage the French ship during the night, both frigates inflicting severe damage on one another before the wounded Gordon surrendered to the approaching corvette. As dawn broke, Rowley's flagship HMS Boadicea arrived, recaptured Ceylon, drove off the corvette and forced the battered French flagship to surrender, capturing Hamelin. This was the last ship-to-ship action in the region before the successful invasion of Île de France in December 1810: without Hamelin the French squadron, short on supplies and low on morale, did not contest British control of the region and failed to even attempt to disrupt the invasion fleet. Background The French Indian Ocean island bases of Île de France and Île Bonaparte had been ideal positions from which French cruisers could raid the valuable trade routes from Britain to India since the start of the war in 1803.Gardiner, p. 92 However, it was not until 1808 that the French authorities spared a significant force to operate from the region, providing a squadron of four frigates under Commodore Jacques Hamelin. In 1809 and early 1810, these frigates operated with impunity along British trade routes, capturing seven valuable East Indiamen, a number of smaller merchant ships and several small warships.Gardiner, p. 93 In response, the British admiral at the Cape of Good Hope, Albemarle Bertie, provided a small force of British warships to blockade the islands under Commodore Josias Rowley. Rowley knew that it would be almost impossible find and defeat the French ships out in the wider ocean with his limited resources, but he was able to limit French effectiveness by attacking their bases, raiding Saint Paul harbour in 1809 and capturing Île Bonaparte in 1810, renaming it Île Bourbon.Clowes, p. 458 In August 1810, a squadron of four of Rowley's frigates, making up the majority of the forces under his command and led by Captain Samuel Pym, were despatched to Île de France to blockade Grand Port on the south-eastern coast.Macmillan, p. 31 The arrival of a French squadron under Captain Guy-Victor Duperré on 20 August prompted Pym into ordering an inadequately planned attack on the harbour on 23 August and two of his vessels were wrecked on the reefs that protected the harbour entrance. Pym was unable to withdraw his remaining ships and the entire squadron was lost, leaving Rowley with only his flagship HMS Boadicea and two small brigs to conduct his campaign against six large French frigates.Macmillan, p. 37 Urgent reinforcements were requested, as French ships under Captain Pierre Bouvet blockaded Île Bourbon. The first ship to arrive was HMS Africaine under the Captain Robert Corbet. In the Action of 13 September 1810, Corbet engaged Bouvet's two frigates alone and was defeated, dying of his wounds shortly after the battle.Clowes, p. 467 Rowley in Boadicea was able to recapture Africaine later in the day, but the frigate was severely damaged and unable to provide any reinforcement to the British squadron. Bouvet retired to Grand Port several days later for repairs, and thus was not on blockade duty on 17 September when HMS Ceylon arrived. Ceylon was an unusual ship, constructed by the Honourable East India Company (HEIC) in Bombay as an East Indiaman merchant ship designed to operate as a 32–gun frigate during wartime. In 1805 she was purchased by the British government and commissioned into the Royal Navy for service in the Indian Ocean. In 1810, her commander was Captain Charles Gordon, who had been ordered to sail to Rowley's aid when word of the losses suffered at Grand Port reached Madras. In his haste to depart, Gordon had been unable to obtain any Royal Marines, whose place was taken by 100 men of the 69th Regiment and the 86th Regiment from the Madras garrison. Also embarked was General John Abercromby and his staff, who were to lead a planned assault on Île de France.Taylor, p. 322 Pursuit Gordon arrived off Port Napoleon on 17 September, hoping to find Rowley maintaining the blockade off the port in Boadicea. Rowley was however off Île Bourbon, sparring with Bouvet's frigates, and therefore Gordon only found Hamelin's squadron in the harbour. This force consisted of the frigates Vénus and Manche with the corvette Victor. Recognising that he was heavily outnumbered, Gordon sailed westwards towards Île Bourbon to meet with Rowley and pass on the location of Hamelin's squadron.Clowes, p. 468 French lookouts on shore spotted Ceylon but mistook her for a troopship due to her unusual construction. The sighting was rapidly passed on to Hamelin, who immediately gave chase with Vénus and Victor.Woodman, p. 290 At 14:00, Ceylon spotted Hamelin's ships in pursuit and her crew increased their efforts to escape, mistaking Victor, which carried three masts, for a larger ship and therefore considering themselves significantly outnumbered. As night fell, Gordon slowed Ceylon by shortening sail in the hope of meeting Vénus (which had outdistanced Victor) alone. However, the French flagship also slowed to allow the corvette to catch up and so Gordon increased sail once more, leading Hamelin southwest towards Île Bourbon. Battle At 00:15 on the morning of 18 September, Vénus caught up with Ceylon, which began firing on the larger French frigate as she passed. Hamelin, recognising that his vessel had the advantage in size and weight of shot, did not wait for Victor but attacked immediately, passing Ceylon and tuning across her bows to open a raking fire. For an hour the frigates exchanged broadsides, until 01:15 when Hamelin, who had realised that he was fighting a warship not a troopship or East Indiaman, dropped back to effect repairs after suffering damage to his rigging.James, p. 308 Ceylon was more severely damaged than the French ship and when Hamelin returned at 02:15, her repairs were not complete, preventing her escape. The battle began again, both frigates suffering serious damage in the second encounter. By 03:00, Vénus had lost her mizzenmast and two topmasts, while Ceylon had lost all of her topmasts, which had destroyed much of the ship's rigging as they fell.Brenton, p. 473 (Brenton's account was roundly attacked by William James for the quality of its research, and is only used where it agrees with other sources) With both ships now unable to manoeuvre, the action continued at close range until 04:00, when Vénus was able to haul herself away to await the arrival of Victor.Clowes, p. 469 The French corvette had been struggling to catch up during the night and did not arrive until dawn approached, revealing the flagship in a damaged state and the British vessel even more stricken. Sailing directly at Ceylon, the corvette was able to manoeuvre around the frigate and place herself in a raking position, from which her cannon could cause heavy damage and casualties to Ceylon without reply. Rather than have his ship destroyed, the wounded Gordon surrendered (although it is not clear whether Victor opened fire or not before the British surrender). Victor's men boarded Ceylon and Gordon and his officers, including Abercromby, were taken to Vénus as prisoners of war.James, p. 309 As dawn broke and visibility cleared, the sailors on Ceylon, Vénus and Victor realised that they were within sight of Saint Denis on Île Bourbon, and thus vulnerable to counterattack from Rowley's flagship Boadicea. Despite hasty repairs, neither Ceylon nor Vénus were seaworthy by 07:30, when British lookouts on the island spotted the three ships and sent word to Rowley. Within ten minutes, Rowley was at sea, taking 50 volunteers from Africaine to augment his crew. Hamelin made desperate efforts to limp back to Île de France, ordering Victor to tow Ceylon, but progress was slow and strong winds, which did not help the dismasted Ceylon and Vénus, repeatedly broke the tow rope.Macmillan, p. 39 During the day, Boadicea continued to close until Victor was forced to abandon Ceylon and sail in support of Vénus at 15:30.Taylor, p. 323 As soon as the French prize crew was removed, Lieutenant Philip Fitz Gibbon, the remaining officer on Ceylon, rehoisted British colours and assumed control of the ship. This allowed Boadicea to sail past the recaptured frigate and engage the French ships directly, reaching Vénus at 16:40. Hamelin recognised that the battered state of his flagship meant that he would not be able to adequately defend against Rowley's attack and ordered Victor to take news of his defeat back to Port Napoleon. Readying his ship for a token action, Hamelin fired at Boadicea as she came up but was forced to surrender within ten minutes. Aftermath With the assistance of HMS Otter, which had followed Boadicea from Saint Denis, Rowley was able to return his prize and the battered Ceylon to Île Bourbon without significant difficulty. British casualties had been relatively minor for such a difficult engagement, Ceylon suffering 10 men killed and 31 wounded and Boadicea just 2 wounded. French losses were also comparatively light, with only 9 dead and 15 wounded on Vénus and none at all on Victor.James, p. 311 Rowley repaired Ceylon and restored Gordon in command. Vénus was also repaired, and entered British service as HMS Nereide to replace the Nereide lost at Grand Port.Woodman, p. 291 Nearly four decades later the battle was among the actions recognised by the clasps \\"BOADICEA 18 SEPT. 1810\\", \\"OTTER 18 SEPT. 1810\\" and \\"STAUNCH 18 SEPT. 1810\\" attached to the Naval General Service Medal, awarded upon application to all British participants still living in 1847. With the British squadron bolstered and the French commander and best frigate in British hands, the campaign stalemated. The French were no longer able to repair or maintain their ships due a lack of naval stores on Île de France, and so remained in port and prepared for the inevitable invasion.James, p. 324 Rowley meanwhile was busy preparing troops, stores and his squadron for the coming attack, which was led by Admiral Bertie in November 1810.James, p. 325 The French squadron made no attempt to disrupt the invasion forces and were captured intact in their harbours. Bertie was credited with the final defeat of Île de France and was made a baronet as reward for the successful campaign, sending Rowley back to Britain with despatches.Bertie, Sir Albemarle, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Stephen Howarth, (subscription required), Retrieved 20 December 2008 A court martial, held on HMS Illustrious in the aftermath of the invasion cleared Gordon of any blame in the defeat of his ship, although historian William James criticised Gordon's assumption during the battle that Victor was a French frigate rather than a much smaller corvette, and identified discrepancies between Gordon's published account and the ship's log.James, p. 313  Notes  References    * Category:Naval battles of the Napoleonic Wars Category:Conflicts in 1810 Category:September 1810 events Category:1810s in Réunion ","title":"Action of 18 September 1810"},{"id":"20758974","text":"Paul N.

Family life  Pravind Jugnauth married Kobita Ramdanee in 1992 and is the father of three daughters: Sonika, Sonali and Sara.  Start of political career  Pravind Jugnauth officially joined the MSM in 1990. 2000 to 2005 As Minister of Agriculture from 7 September 2000 to 7 October 2003 (under MSM-MMM government), Jugnauth reformed the sugar sector by diversification with production of ethanol, agricultural rhum, special sugars, electricity generation from bagasse and other high value added products. Besides production costs were significantly reduced in response to a drop in the protected sugar price under the Sugar Protocol with the European Union. He also negotiated a package for workers under the Voluntary Retirement Scheme which enabled around 8000 workers to retire with cash compensation exceeding 2.5 billion rupees and around 825 arpents of land worth 3 billion rupees. Jugnauth also encouraged hydroponics and other modern methods of agricultural production as well as agricultural biotechnology research. He created a National Agricultural Biotechnology Institute and Food Technology Laboratory in Mauritius and later launched the Small Planters Welfare Fund. The fund caters to the welfare of planters and their families and provides crop insurance schemes designed to financially support planters whose crops are affected by unfavorable weather conditions. As Finance Minister from 7 October 2003 to 5 July 2005, Jugnauth reduced taxes on thousands of commodities. He increased subsidies on basic commodities and gave salary compensations well above inflation rates in two successive years. He launched a project to make Mauritius a Duty Free Island. 2005 to 2009 In June 2005 Prime Minister Paul Berenger dissolved the Parliament in preparation for the 2005 General Elections. The Labour-led Alliance Sociale won a total seat of 38 against the MSM-MMM alliance which obtained only 24 seats. Pravind Jugnauth was defeated in his constituency, received 48% of vote and was not elected. Paul Berenger became Leader of the Opposition made up of MSM (14 seats) and MMM (10 seats). In 2006 MP Ashok Jugnauth left the MSM party and formed a new party following a dispute with Pravind Jugnauth regarding leadership of the party. At that time Pravind was not an elected member of Parliament but still held leadership of the MSM. Nando Bodha the general secretary of the MSM became Leader of the Opposition after the MSM-MMM alliance split up due to Pravind Jugnauth's disapproval of Paul Berenger's request to make Rajesh Bhagwan the Opposition Chief Whip. In 2007 two members of MSM (Joe Lesongard the party's president and Sekar Naidu) left the MSM and swore allegiance to Berenger who became Leader of the Opposition. 2009 By-Elections Ashok Jugnauth (half-brother of Sir Anerood Jugnauth and uncle of Pravind) had been elected as MSM member of parliament in Constituency No.8 Quartier Militaire and Moka. But he had to resign in November 2008 as the British Privy Council upheld the guilty verdict that the Supreme Court of Mauritius had issued in 2007 following charges of electoral bribery during the campaign leading to the 2015 General Elections. Thus by-elections had to be held in 2009. Ashok Jugnauth stood as a candidate with the support of MMM. The Labour Party supported Pravind Jugnauth who then announced his candidacy in the 8th constituency. On 2 March 2009, Pravind Jugnauth won the by-elections. His victory paved the way for the next alliance (Labour Party-MSM) during the 2010 general elections. 2010-2014 In 2010, MSM formed a coalition known as Alliance de L'Avenir or Ptr-MSM-PMSD by joining forces with the Mauritian Labour Party and Mauritian Social Democrat Party. The coalition won the May 2010 elections. On Navin Ramgoolam's advice, President Sir Anerood Jugnauth then appointed Jugnauth Vice Prime Minister & Minister of Finance as of 11 May 2010. On 26 July 2011 Jugnauth and all other MSM ministers resigned due to the scandal known as the MedPoint Affair. In 2014, following the resignation of Paul Berenger as Leader of the Opposition, President Kailash Purryag appointed Jugnauth to the office. Jugnauth served as Leader of the Opposition from September to December 2014. 2014-2017 He was appointed as Minister of Information Technology following the Alliance Lepep's victory. On 21 January 2017 Aneerood Jugnauth announced that he will be resigning as Prime Minister due to poor health and that he will be succeeded by his son Pravind Jugnauth. 2017-2019 On 23 January 2017 he was chosen by his party MSM to lead the National Assembly. This triggered the ruling coalition partner Parti Mauricien Social Démocrate to leave the government and join the Opposition. Pravind Jugnauth served as Prime Minister of Mauritius during the second half of the Alliance Lepep's mandate which concluded with general elections in November 2019. 2019–present Following the victory of the Alliance Morisien (coalition of MSM-ML-MAG parties) at the 2019 General Elections Pravind Jugnauth was elected as Prime Minister for a five-year mandate. Recognition and awards Pravind Jugnauth was honored Doctor from the University of Buckingham with an Honoris Causa in 2005. In 2017 he has awarded the Pravasi Bharatiya Samman by the President of India. Controversies In 2010, the PTR-MSM-PMSD government acknowledged the need to create a specialized centre for geriatric care. Thus the cabinet of Ministers approved the purchase of the existing MedPoint Private Clinic which was owned by Dr Krishnan Malhotra and Mrs Shalini Devi Jugnauth-Malhotra. The latter is the sister of then Minister of Finance Pravind Jugnauth and daughter of then President Sir Anerood Jugnauth. The objective was to convert the hospital into a specialised centre. On 22 July 2011 following an investigation by the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC), then Minister of Health Maya Hanoomanjee was arrested by the ICAC Police and the government chief valuer was suspended from his duties. Pravind Jugnauth was also arrested on charges of \\"conflict of interest\\". This became known as the MedPoint Affair. On 30 June 2015 Jugnauth was found guilty under Article 13 of the Prevention Of Corruption Act 2002 (PoCA). He was sentenced by the Intermediate court of Mauritius for 1 year of imprisonment. However, he appealed to the Supreme Court of Mauritius and won his appeal. The prosecution appealed to the Privy Council, but the prosecution appeal was unsuccessful.

The Kremnica Mint (Slovak: Mincovňa Kremnica, Hungarian: Körmöcbányai pénzverde) is a state-owned mint situated in Kremnica, Slovakia. The predecessor of current Mincovňa Kremnica, š. p. (štátny podnik = state company) was established in the Kingdom of Hungary in 1328, and for nearly seven centuries it has continuously been producing mint articles. History Kremnica Mint was established in 1328 when Kremnica () was promoted to a free royal town by the Hungarian King Charles Robert of Anjou; the mint issued several kinds of coins early on, of which the most successful was its ducat. Kremnica ducats were well known because of their good quality and were considered the hardest currency in Central Europe. Available historical records report that 21.5 million ducats were minted at the Kremnica Mint throughout its history. The aggregate value of this amount, measured at today's prices of gold, would be three billion US dollars (exclusive of the numismatic value). Euro coins The mint became very outdated by the beginning of the 20th century, and many called for new equipment and for the mint to be moved to Budapest. However, this did not happen until the end of World War I. As the Czech troops invaded Northern Hungary, the Károlyi government ordered to move the equipment and noble metal stock to Budapest. The Hungarian Government started to mint the first coins with the faulty machines and worn-out dies in Csepel. Even coins minted in 1922 bore the KB mint mark. The Czechoslovak government had to set up a new mint as well, since not more than the buildings were left in Kremnica. Work on the new machinery started in 1921. Since then, the Kremnica Mint has manufactured all the coins used by the Czechoslovak and Slovak state and minted coins for 25 other countries. Since Kremnica was the site of the sole mint of the Czechoslovak state, the Czech protectorate (1939–1945) was supplied with coins by Germany, and the Czech Republic (since 1993) established its own mint. Today Kremnica Mint manufactures both circulation coins and commemorative coins for the National Bank of Slovakia (Slovak euro coins), but the Mint's available capacities and quality standards make it capable of supplying coins to other countries worldwide. In March 2013 the Mint won a contract to produce 175 million Sri Lankan 10 Rupee pieces with total value of the contract of US$6.032 billion. This contract is especially valuable for Kremnica Mint as it succeeded in the field previously dominated by the Royal Mint. Exposition Kremnica Mint established its own coin shop in 2006. The shop is placed inside the reconstructed historical building from 1450. An exposition of minting is part of the coin shop and it also includes a remaining set of a historical striking machines - Vulkan. In addition to historical striking machines, visitors could also observe coinage on modern striking machines. Mint marks The first mint mark on coins minted in Kremnica was C (for Latin Cremnicium), this was changed to K (for Hungarian Körmöcz or German Kremnitz) under Sigismund and later K-B (Hungarian Körmöcz- Bánya or German Kremnitz-Bergstadt). With a decree from 16 June 1766, Maria Theresa uniformized the mint marks of the Austrian Empire, the new alphabetical system showed the importance of the mint: Körmöcbánya received letter B (Vienna mint received A, Prague mint C, etc.). This was changed back to K.B. (for Körmöczbánya) temporarily in 1848-49 and finally in 1868. The K.B. mint mark was used after evacuation of the mint to Budapest until 1922. The Mincovňa Kremnica uses its initials (MK) as mint mark.

It is located on the River Tees at Haverton Hill, east of Billingham in North East England. Operated by SITA UK since its conception, the plant replaced the Portrack Incinerator and opened in 1998. The station is one of the most modern incinerators operating in England; it is noted for its innovative operation. In 2009, an extension was completed at the station, with the construction of an extra furnace line and a rail head. This increased the capacities of the plant from 19.2 MW and 250,000 tonnes of waste per year to its current levels. The plant initially burned only waste from Teesside, but this was extended to include Northumberland with the 2009 extension. A second plant, the North East Energy Recovery Centre (NEERC), has planning permission to be built on land adjacent to the current plant. If built, this will extend the plant's catchment to include waste from south Tyne and Wear. HistoryReplacement for Portrack= Between 1975 and 1996, the Portrack Incinerator on the River Tees burned 200,000 tonnes of Teesside's waste every year, generating 20 megawatts of electricity in doing so. In November 1996, the plant was closed down after it failed to meet emission regulations; it was then demolished in stages between 1998 and 2000. Following the closure of the Portrack plant, a new facility to burn Teesside's refuse was constructed. Teesside Energy from Waste plant was opened in May 1998 as a collaboration between SITA UK (the station's operator) and the local authorities of Stockton-on-Tees, Middlesbrough, Hartlepool and Redcar & Cleveland. =Third incineration line= In December 2006, SITA UK signed a 28-year private finance initiative contract worth £70 million with Northumberland County Council, to provide them with waste management services and to reduce the county's reliance upon landfill. This included the construction of an extra incineration line at the Teesside plant. Civil construction of the extension began in April 2007, with heavy erection beginning that November. Von Roll was the general contractor for the entire extension. In May 2009, the third line, which cost £70 million to build, was brought into operation. It was officially opened on 8 October 2009 by former MP Hilary Armstrong, SITA UK Chief Executive David Palmer-Jones, and Northumberland County Councillor Jeff Reid. At various times, between 60 and 100 people were employed in building the third line, and an additional 20 full-time jobs were created for its operation once open. Built on time and within budget, the extension surpassed expectations in its first year of operation. A year after the opening of the third line, only a fifth of the amount of waste that was being sent to landfill in Northumberland prior to its opening was still being sent there. Design and specification The plant is a large metal-clad building. The metal is finished in the colour 'Goosewing Grey', accented in 'Solent Blue' and 'Petra Red'. The plant's clean, clear lines and colours are said to \\"contrast favourably\\" with the nearby industrial buildings. Until 2009, the station had two operating furnace lines, which together were capable of burning a total of 250,000 tonnes of waste per year, and generated 20 MW of electricity. However, in May 2009 a third line was brought into operation. The plant currently burns 360,000 tonnes of waste a year and generates 29.2 MW of electricity. This is enough electricity to power 60,000 homes. The original plant uses Babcock & Wilcox Volund boilers to provide steam for a single Ansaldo turbo generator rated at 19.2 MW. The third line uses a Von Roll Inova reciprocating grate to burn the waste, and generates electricity using a single Von Roll Inova three-pass steam generator, rated at 10 MW. Operations The station operates constantly, burning municipal household waste from the local councils of Stockton-on-Tees, Hartlepool, Middlesbrough, Redcar & Cleveland, North Tyneside and Northumberland. When there is a shortfall in household waste, non-hazardous industrial and commercial waste are used to make up capacity. The station burns only residual waste, which is material left over after recycling. The incinerator operates 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Waste is delivered to the station by road, using up to 100 waste collection vehicles. Up to 2,800 tonnes of waste a week or as much as 1,000 tonnes of waste a day, can be delivered at the plant. A rail head was also built on the railway sidings adjacent to the site in 2009. This allows for waste to be delivered to the plant by rail, rather than just by road. This is more sustainable as it reduces the amount of traffic on local roads. In December 2011, it was announced that the rail head would be used to receive up 500,000 tonnes of residual waste per year from Merseyside via a rail waste transfer facility at Knowsley Industrial Park, Kirkby, in a contract worth £400 million. Waste arriving at the plant is checked in and weighed, before being delivered to the plant's reception hall. The large reception hall allows the vehicles to dump their waste safely. Air for the combustion of the waste later in the plant is drawn from the reception hall so that odour and dust doesn't pollute the building's surroundings. From the hall waste is tipped into a large concrete bunker. Here the feedstock is homogenified by a crane operator, who mixes and removes unsuitable waste. A grab crane then manoeuvers waste from the bunker to the hoppers that feed the furnace. This crane is operated from a control room. This room also monitors the equipment in the plant, the combustion gases and maximises the efficiency of the plant. From the hoppers, the waste falls onto the furnace-charging chute and from there onto the incinerating grate. Here it is burned at a temperature in excess of 1,200 °C. This heat is then converted into super heated steam through the plant's boilers. This in turn powers steam turbines, much in the same way as a conventional thermal power station. Electricity is generated at 11 kilovolts. After exiting the turbines, the steam is condensed back to water. For the original two incinerating lines use river water from the Tees as a cooling medium, whereas in the third line, water is condensed through air cooled condenser. The cooled water is treated and reused in the boilers. Gases from the furnace are cleaned using selective non-catalytic reduction (SNCR), spray absorbers and active carbon injection. These processes remove nitrogen oxides, acidic gasses, dioxins and heavy metals from the plants emissions. The remaining gases are passed through fine-fabric bag filters to remove any particles, before it is released from the chimney. Each incineration line has its own independent stack in the chimney, and the flue gases are continuously monitored before being released. This information is relayed to the control room. The remaining fly ash from the filters contains particles from the incineration, lime from the spray absorbers, salt and carbon dust, and so is stored in a sealed silo until it is taken from the site for disposal. Incinerator bottom ash left on the incineration grate after the burning is moved by conveyor to a bunker. Whilst on the conveyor, a magnet removes ferrous metal from the ash for recycling. The remaining ash is then used as an aggregate in the construction industry. A recycling centre operates next to the plant, which opened in December 2001. In 2006 a composting facility was opened. Environmental impact Waste to energy plants are strictly monitored, and the plant has achieved various ISO external certificates. The plant is seen to be at the forefront of sustainable energy production and waste disposal. The plant not only reduces the amount of waste sent to landfill, but displaces the burning of depleting fossil fuels, and makes significant contributions to meeting the North East region's waste recovery and recycling targets. The future: North East Energy Recovery Centre A rendition of the planned second plant In 2008, it was announced SITA had plans to build another EfW plant adjacent to the current one, named the North East Energy Recovery Centre (NEERC). SITA UK began consulting key partners, stakeholders and local residents on these plans in April 2008, before submitting a formal planning application that summer. Permission for the plant's construction was granted on 15 October 2008. On 17 September 2010, it was announced that SITA had signed a contract with the South Tyne and Wear Waste Management Partnership for their waste to be burned at NEERC once the plant was completed. Construction is expected to begin in early 2011, in time for a 2013 completion date. NEERC is expected to be capable of handling up to 190,000 tonnes of waste per year. This waste will be burned to generate electricity for the National Grid and cogenerate to provide heat for local industries in the form of steam. NEERC will have two processing lines, capable of generating 21 MW of electricity, enough to provide for 37,500 homes. This means that over the two facilities, 640,000 tonnes of waste will be burned annually, and over 50 MW of electricity generated. This would make Teesside the largest operational EfW centre in the UK outside London. The plant will be a mirror image of the current one, and will create 160 jobs; 25 in South Tyne and Wear, 100 in the construction of the plant, and the rest once the plant is operational.

Assessors are appointed by the chief executive of local government, who chairs the Giunta--the mayor of a comune, the president of a province or region. They serve until the chief executive ends his term or resigns, if he doesn't dismiss them. In comunes with 15,000 residents or more and in provinces, assessors cannot be members of Consiglio (council), the local legislative body: if a member of council is appointed as assessor, he must resign from council. The mayor or president usually assigns to each assessor responsibility for a specific aspect of municipal, provincial or regional affairs and the supervision of corresponding branch of local government, called assessorato (department). Among the assessors one is chosen by mayor or president as his deputy and is called vicesindaco (deputy mayor) or vicepresidente (vice president).

The band's sound was heavily influenced by elements from black metal, doom metal and hardcore with philosophical influences from Aleister Crowley, the occult, horror, satanism and the dark, heavy sound of Black Sabbath. They toured the Japanese national club circuit extensively during the 1980s and the early 1990s and created various recordings until they disassociated in 1992. History Bellzlleb was formed between junior high school mates in 1985, guitarist and composer Tetsu (Genkaku Allergy, Spooky Six Mouse, E.G.O., Love House, Zeus) drums and arrangement by Yuji (Scarecrow, Love House). Tetsu and Yuji played together prior to Bellzlleb in hard rock band Love House. After a series of auditions, Rick (Norihiko Hayashi) the loudest and craziest bass player in Chiba city, was recruited into the band along with Koizumi (Atsuko Koizumi) who fronted local Black Sabbath cover bands in high school. Her high-tone vocals were influenced by singer Ozzy Osbourne. This completed the original lineup of Bellzlleb in 1985 during high school. Bellzlleb played at local clubs such as Dancing Mother's and participated in local metal festivals and drew fans together in Chiba, which led to participation in the band contest Yamaha East West in 1985. Bellzlleb won through a series of local and regional contests and was nominated in the East West 1985 nationwide junior finals in Tokyo at Nakano Sun Plaza. During an extensive club circuit era in the Kanto region their first real break came in 1986 when they were asked to open for a thrash metal band, Black Rose. Black Rose was the band whose guitarist and lead composer Pata later joined X Japan. Opening for Black Rose at Kagurazaka Explosion several times during the course of a few months led to a live-phono- sheet recording entitled \\"Satanic Metal\\". \\"Satanic Metal\\" increased Bellzlleb's core fan base, which led to another compilation recording at Kagurazaka Explosion in 1987 entitled Heavy Metal Force IV. By the Summer of 1987, Bellzlleb had expanded beyond Kanto region in Japan to expand their fan base on a nationwide level with extensive club circuiting in Japan. Koizumi left in 1987 due to direction disagreement and health related reasons to be replaced by vocalist Rei (ex-Hardwave) as the new frontman. Co-founder and drummer Yuji left in 1988 due to musical style disagreement and direction changes. Bellzlleb's first full-length album \\"Bellzlleb\\" which was originally scheduled for release in 1998 was delayed for a year. In 1998 drummer Eby ex- Zi:Kill supported Bellzlleb live performances and participated in compilation album recordings immediately after Yuji's departure. Fumi was recruited 1989 and started recording of their first full-length album, Bellzlleb released from Nude Records. Rick left the band soon after this release due to directional disagreement and was replaced by ex-Jurassic Jade bass player, Mataro. With the 1990 line-up, Bellzlleb recorded a second full-length album, Section II ~Aru Gusha no Shougai~ released by Captain Records (owned by Takarajima). Bellzlleb increased their touring schedule nationwide to support their release, however Mataro and Fumi left to pursue their respective band careers in Japan and overseas. Tetsu and Rei, left without a rhythm section at Bellzlleb in 1991 released an acoustic mini-album, Inori at Nude Records. The final line-up of Bellzlleb in 1992 consisted of bass player Takami Rosenfeld and drummer Kimura. Bellzlleb released their third and last full-length album, Mr.Ree: ~Kairai to Sad~ in 1992. Bellzlleb toured nationwide and participated in print media and television programs to support the new release, but countless member replacements seemed to have damaged the life of Bellzlleb throughout the life of the band as to portray how they were haunted as a group. Bellzlleb disbanded because Tetsu knew they could not have continued to produce a better sound than they currently had. Kuroyume opened for Bellzlleb on their last gig in 1992 at Meguro Rock-May-Kan.

Background Richard Hardinge was born at Pewsey, Wiltshire. He was the son of John Hardinge of Pewsey and Salisbury and Honora Estcourt. Honora was the daughter of Giles Estcourt, Member of Parliament for Salisbury and Recorder for the town of Poole. Education Hardinge matriculated at St Edmund Hall, Oxford University on 20 October 1609, but left two years later without a degree. In 1611 he was admitted to Lincoln's Inn. Parliamentary career In 1640 he represented Great Bedwyn in the Short Parliament and the Long Parliament. English Civil War In August 1644 Hardinge was the bearer of King Charles II's (whilst Prince of Wales) message to the Parliamentarian General and Lord Beauchamp. Essex refused to make peace with the King and therefore the mission did not succeed. He was a friend of Essex. Further service in Royal Household Hardinge accompanied the Prince to Jersey and France and back to England. He spent eight years in exile. Death He is thought to have died at Bruges and is buried at Loosdiijnen. There is a portrait of Richard still existing and is in the possession of the current Earl of Clarendon, a direct descendant of Edward Hyde, the 1st Earl of Clarendon. The portrait was painted by Cornelius Jansen of the Flemish school c. 1640. It was once part of the collection belonging to the 1st Earl at his seat, Clarendon Park, Oxfordshire. He left the collection to his son Henry, the 3rd Earl, who in turn left it to his sister, the Duchess of Queensbury. She took it to Amesbury Park, Wilts., and on her death in 1777, left it to her husband. Later the 4th Duke of Queensbury removed it to Richmond where it was seen by Horace Walpole. Upon the 4th Duke's death, the collection was taken to Bothwell Castle, Scotland and it remained there until the 7th Duke sold some back to the 4th Earl of Clarendon, in whose family it has remained ever since.

In 1810, Spartan was operating off Naples and there fought and inconclusive engagement against a much larger Neapolitan squadron on 3 May, for which Brenton was highly rewarded. War of 1812 In 1811, Brenton's brother Edward Pelham Brenton took command and operated off the American Eastern Seaboard during the War of 1812, attacking shipping off Cape Sable but otherwise having little success against American merchant ships. In July 1812, Spartan and captured two American vessels: * 17 July: brig George, of 211 tons, sailing from Messina to Salem with a cargo of wine, brandy, opium, oil, etc.; and * 18 July: schooner Hiram, of 132 tons, sailing from Lisbon to Salem with a cargo of fruit and dollars. On 15 July Spartan and captured the brig Start. Start, of 173 tons (bm), P.Hazelton, master, had been sailing from St Ubes to Newburyport, Massachusetts with a cargo of salt. The boats of Spartan and captured the US Revenue Cutter Commodore Barry on 3 August in the Little River, Bay of Fundy, together with three privateer schooners, Madison, Olive, and Spence (or Spruce). Commodore Barry was armed with six guns and each of the schooners was armed with two guns. Before the British captured the vessels their crews escaped. They had erected batteries on shore, using the guns from their vessels. They resisted, inflicting some casualties, but then evaded capture. Even so, some men were captured on Commodore Barry and remained prisoners of war until paroled in June 1813.Wells (1998) Prize money to the crew of the Spartan for the Commodore Barry was paid in July 1820. Spartan was part of Sir John Borlase Warren's squadron when on 17 September she captured , an American ship returning from Chile and bound to Baltimore. Spartan sent Melantho into Halifax, Nova Scotia, where the Vice admiralty court condemned her in prize. Spartan shared the prize money with Statira, Acasta, Nymphe, Orpheus, Maidstone, Aeolus and Emulous. On 17 October 1812 and Spartan were in company when Maidstone captured the American privateer brig Rapid on the Saint George's Bank. Rapid, of 190 tons (bm), John Weeks, master, was armed with 14 cannon – twelve carronades of various sizes and two long 6-pounder guns – but her crew had thrown eight of her cannons overboard to lighten her during the nine-hour chase. She had a crew of 84 men and was three days out of Portland. Her backers had provisioned her for a three-month cruise first off the Azores, Madeira and the Cape Verde Islands, and then off Cayenne and Bermuda. The British took Rapid into service as , which in 1813 they renamed Ferret. In 1814, Spartan returned to Portsmouth, where command passed to Phipps Hornby, who briefly served with her in the Mediterranean.Hornby, Sir Phipps, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, J. K. Laughton. Retrieved 1 April 2008 While commander of Spartan, Hornby participated in the capture of Elba from the French, for which he was invested with the Austrian order of St Joseph of Würzburg. Post-war With the end of the war in 1815, Spartan remained in the Mediterranean under Captain William Furlong Wise, who in 1818 was able to negotiate compensation of $35,000 from the current Dey of Algiers following the depredations of Algerian pirates under the previous Dey, who had died of the plague.The gentleman's magazine, Volume 88, Part 2, p.76. Fate In 1819 and 1820, Spartan visited the Caribbean and North America. Spartan was laid up and then broken up in 1822. Notes, citations, and references Citations References * * Smith, Joshua M.

It may not be eaten by Jews according to Halacha (Jewish Law). The laws regarding the prohibition of gid hanasheh are found in Tractate Chullin, chapter 7. Biblical Source The Torah () recounts that Jacob fought with an angel (according to Rashi, this was Esau's guardian angel) who could not beat him. At the end of the fight, the angel strikes a nerve in Jacob's leg, causing him to limp. The verse then states: \\"Therefore the Israelites do not eat the displaced nerve (gid ha-nasheh) on the hip joint to this very day.\\" () Interpretations The Zohar explains that the thigh is the root location of sexual desire. While most evil urges can be overcome, there is one lust that is so strong that it overpowers even great men - the gid ha-nasheh. Its very name nasheh means “forgetting” (cf. ), because once this desire has been aroused, we forget all rational thinking and moral scruples. The only way to win this battle is to completely distance ourselves from it. For this reason, the gid ha-nasheh is not eaten at all but entirely avoided. Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook explained that the prohibition of eating gid ha-nasheh demonstrates that, while we may need to slaughter animals for our physical needs, we do not seek to subjugate others, whether man or beast. For this reason, we make great efforts to avoid eating the sciatic nerve - a nerve that allows the body to stand upright. Removal The removal of the gid hanasheh and chelev (forbidden fats) is called nikkur. Since it is labor- intensive to remove all the forbidden parts of the hindquarters of an animal, the entire hindquarters are usually sold to the non-kosher market outside of Israel and a few other markets with sufficient Jewish populations to justify the expense. In the situation of a ben pekuah the nerve is permitted to be eaten. This potential reduction in expense is part of a project that began in Melbourne to create a herd of ben pekuah animals.

Self-rescue is an alternative to calling search and rescue (SAR) which can save the climber(s) being charged for SAR services and can avoid putting SAR team members in harm's way. Unfortunately, many aspiring climbers don't take the opportunity to train themselves in real-life conditions (overhanging edges, etc.) and \\"find they need to seek outside help\\". When members of a team require self-rescue, rescuing a fallen partner may expose the rescuer to significant risks. Self-rescue requires having a practiced rescue plan, good communication, and foresight to avoid \\"an incident within an incident\\". Reasons for self-rescue Self-rescue techniques can be used to pass a difficult section or to rappel down a multiple-pitch route with an injured climber.

The service was outlawed in 1869 and a new cheaper postage rate for printed matter introduced in 1870. The stamps issued by the companies are much sought after by philatelists.  Origins  The first such company was the Edinburgh and Leith Circular Delivery Company set up by Robert Brydone in 1865.Stanley Gibbons Great Britain Specialised Stamp Catalogue, Volume 1: Queen Victoria. 13th edition. London & Ringwood: Stanley Gibbons Ltd., 2004, p.463. Brydone undertook to deliver circulars within the boundaries of Edinburgh and Leith for one farthing each.Sutton, R.J. & K.W. Anthony. The Stamp Collector's Encyclopaedia. 6th edition. London: Stanley Paul, 1966, p.71. He also delivered parcels which were not covered by the Post Office's monopoly. Brydone, a printer by trade, was declared bankrupt in 1866 but moved to London to form the London Circular Delivery Company which merged with the Metropolitan Circular Delivery Company in 1867.  Spread  A 2d stamp of the Edinburgh & Leith Parcel Delivery Company. Further companies soon sprang up, some of which were connected with Brydone. They included: *Aberdeen Circular Delivery Company *Circular Delivery Company Limited *Clarke & Co. Edinburgh *Dundee Circular Delivery Company *Edinburgh & Leith Parcel Delivery Company *Glasgow Circular Delivery Company *Liverpool Circular Delivery Company *London & Metropolitan Circular Delivery Company *National Circular Delivery Company  Demise  The spread of the circular delivery companies soon attracted the attention of the Post Office who had a legal monopoly on the collection and delivery of letters. In August 1867 the Post Office brought a legal action against the London & Metropolitan Circular Delivery Company for infringing their monopoly, which case they won, and the various companies are thought to have stopped operating by September 1867.  Legacy  The Post Office half penny \\"bantam\\" stamp introduced in 1870 for printed papers. The demand for cheaper rates for printed materials was self-evident and on 1 October 1870 the British Post Office issued the first half penny stamp to pay the new reduced charge for printed papers, the small 1/2d bantam.  Collecting  The stamps appear only in specialist catalogues. Many are thought to have been forged and some may have been produced purely for philatelic purposes and to have never seen genuine use. For these reasons, collectors prefer to collect the stamps on cover, however, such covers are rare. The stamps are classed as cinderellas or stamps for a local post.

It was formed following a meeting in 1940. The President was Mr. A.C. Houlihan and Paddy Collins became the first captain. The club colours were all white, and all home games were played at Beechwalk. The highlight was probably the defeat of Thurles in the Mansergh Cup. This was only the club's fourth match. This was probably the best performance of their existence. Travel was restricted during the war years, so the games were limited. The club seems to have faded by 1944. Subsequently, there was the Rossory Rangers who had their pitch at Shanboe. This team only lasted a short time as well with some players switching to Rathdowney. Meanwhile, some Roscrea lads played with Birr in subsequent years, and it was after Birr's exit from the PTC in 1949-50, when seven of the team were from Roscrea, that the idea was mooted of a club being formed in the town. The first meeting was held in March 1950. H.M. Read(a local man who had won 13 caps for Ireland and who became President of the IRFU 6 years later) was elected president. The club colours are maroon and white and the reason for this makes a nice little story. Originally the committee had opted for an all-white strip but when they attempted to register the colours with the Leinster branch they were refused on the grounds that other clubs were using the colours. Shortly afterward the club secretary went to a hurling match between Tipperary and Galway. He was very taken with the Galway colours of maroon and white, so Roscrea has used these colours ever since. This year the jerseys have been re-designed and now they are maroon with white stripes. During the summer the club affiliated to the Leinster branch. As regards a ground, the club seems to have initially looked at acquiring a pitch at Benamore, a possible pitch on the Limerick road, with eventually a pitch being obtained at Mount Heaton courtesy of Tom Lalor. The first official match was on October 1, 1950, when Birr were the visitors to Roscrea for a friendly, and was beaten 12-0. Three of the tries were scored by Seamus Power, the other by Tom McCann. The Roscrea team was: Dwyer, McCann, Dunne, Tobin, Power, Rafter, Power, Mossop, O'Connor, Wallace, McManus, Burke, Smith, Reardon, Barry and O Connell. Success came quickly when Roscrea won the Garryowen cup in 1952 but it was not until 1970 that the second trophy the Manseragh Cup was won Roscrea scaled the heights in 1975 and again in 1980 when they won the Provincial Towns cup- the premier competition for junior clubs in Leinster. Midland's leagues were won during this period and they also qualified to compete in the Leinster senior cup twice. The structure of Leinster rugby has changed in the 1990s with the junior league and 4 divisions. For a number of years, Roscrea languished in division two and in 1999 gained promotion to division one in 1999. This was a brand new ball game. Roscrea had to compete against teams from larger towns like Dundalk, Kilkenny, Naas and Navan. This they did and finished comfortably in the top half of the league, easily retaining their division status. Coach Kevin O'Dwyer was instrumental in developing the players and bringing them to a higher level, which must be maintained to remain in Division one which is highly competitive. Roscrea were relegated at the end of the 2017-18 season and currently play in Division 3 of the Leinster League.

Its capital and largest city is Jerez de los Caballeros. Sierra Suroeste borders the comarcas of Tierra de Badajoz and Tierra de Barros to the north, Zafra - Río Bodión and Tentudía to the east, and Llanos de Olivenza to the west. The river Ardila, which runs between Andalucía and Portugal, borders the comarca to the south. The comarca contains ten municipalities: Fregenal de la Sierra, Higuera la Real, Jerez de los Caballeros, Oliva de la Frontera, Salvaleón, Salvatierra de los Barros, Valencia del Mombuey, Valle de Matamoros, Valle de Santa Ana, and Zahínos. HistoryPrehistory= Prehistoric artifacts have been found in the municipalities of Jerez de los Caballeros, Higuera la Real, Valencia del Mombuey and Oliva de la Frontera. Two stone celtic idols were found in the hermitage of Nuestra Señora Virgen de Gracia in Oliva de la Frontera. Celtic fortifications have been excavated in Higuera. Various dolmens can still be seen throughout the area, the most notable being the Neolithic Piedra Pinchá in Valencia del Mombuey, and the dolmen del Toriñuelo in Jerez de los Caballeros. =Roman Empire= During the Roman occupation, Sierra Suroeste belonged to several different political regions. First the comarca was a part of Hispania Ulterior, then later being split in two, with part belonging to the province of Lusitania and the other part to Hispania Baetica. The towns that existed during that period were known by different names: * Jerez de los Caballeros: Fama Iulia Seria * Oliva de la Frontera: Caesaróbriga * Fregenal de la Sierra: Nertóbriga Though other towns in the comarca, such as Salvaleón, claim to have origins during the Roman Empire, there exists no evidence to support these claims. Jerez de los Caballeros is home to a number of mosaics, stone stairs, and the bridges of Pontón and Viejo, all of which date to early Roman construction. Oliva de la Frontera was a Roman copper-working center, as evidenced by the discovery of 250 metalworking ovens and the remains copper mines and excavated ores. Coins from the different periods of the Roman Empire have been found throughout the comarca. =Visigoths= A number of inscribed columns date back to the period of the Visigoth occupation of the Iberian peninsula. One such inscription, found in the church of Santa María de la Encarnación in Jerez de los Caballeros, dates to 25 December 556. Another, found near Oliva de la Frontera, is inscribed by Count Theudimer in the year 662 CE. Other inscriptions from this period have also been found. A grave marker dating back to 514 was found on a farm near Alcobaza, and another dating back to 662 was found in a field by Valle de Matamoros. Additionally, latticework from the hermitage of the Virgen de Gracia is of Visigoth design. There is evidence that the municipalities of Fregenal de la Sierra and Salvaleón were established during this time period. =Moorish conquest and Reconquista= The Moors introduced a number of technological improvements to the daily life of the area. Especially impacted were agricultural practices, such as plowing, wherein the Arabs introduced new methodologies that greatly improved upon the efficiency of existing Roman techniques. Around the year 1230, Alfonso IX, King of León, conquered the area. Alfonso orchestrated a great massacre of Moors in the area now known as Valle de Matamoros (literally, \\"valley of killing Moors\\"). Ten years later, Alfonso led a military campaign through the province to assure its safety, before ceding control of the territory to the Knights Templar. =Renaissance= Church of San Bartolomé, in Jerez de los Caballeros The territory experienced a great population boom and flourishing of local economies when the Knights Templar took control of the area. The Templar founded the municipality of Zahínos as a military fortification, and which was later expanded to become a castle, around which the town grew. In 1312 CE, Pope Clement V dissolved the Order of the Templar, and the Knights' lands and titles were transferred to the Spanish crown. The Knights mounted a resistance in Jerez de los Caballeros, and were summarily executed in the castle nearby. The tower in which their throats were slit is now known as the Torre Sangrienta (literally, the bleeding tower). The various municipalities that today make up the comarca were then divided among a number of nobles. Oliva de la Frontera, Valencia del Mombuey, and Salvaleón belonged to the Duchy of Feria. Valle de Matamoro and Jerez de los Caballero fell under the control of the Order of Santiago. Fregenal de la Sierra and Higuera la Real became a part of Sevilla. A number of well-known conquistadors came from Sierra Suroeste, such as Alonso Rodríguez Santos and Hernando de Soto. Perhaps the most famous of these was Vasco Núñez de Balboa, who was born in Jerez de los Caballeros, and who is best known for conquering Panamá and discovering the Pacific ocean. Geography The Sierra Morena mountains intersect the comarca. In this mountain range there can be found a number of major peaks, including: San Cristóbal, Oratorio, del Coto, de la Herrumbre, de la Corte, del Peñón, de Monsalud, de Santa María, de san José, de Botello, de la Cazuela and de las Mesas. The tallest peaks are: * La Mira (Salvatierra de los Barros): 815 m * Peña Utrera (Salvatierra de los Barros): 813 m * Santa María II (Salvaleón): 806 m * San José (Valle de Matamoros): 787 m * San Cristóbal (Higuera la Real): 776 m A large number of rivers also run through Sierra Suroeste, the most important of which is the Guadiana. The Ardila Rivers, which forms the border with Portugal, is a tributary of the Guadiana in Extremadura. Other important rivers include the Sillo, Bodíón, Zaos, and Godolid rivers. =Flora and fauna= Sierra Suroeste is one of the most productive jamón ibérico-producing regions of Spain, thanks in part to the abundance of black Iberian pigs in the area. The acorn-eating bovines share the fields with large numbers of horses, sheep, goats, cows, donkeys, mules, and chickens. Additionally, the forests are home to significant numbers of a variety of game animals, especially deer, wild boar, and foxes. The European Union-designated Special Protection Area Dehesas de Jerez covers 480 km² and occupies approximately third of the comarca. More than thirty mated pairs of black storks make their nests in this area. In addition, numerous other storks roost in the belfries of various churches throughout the comarca. The comarca is home to large quantities of holm oak and cork oak, two sources of cork and coal. Other common trees include olive trees, chestnut trees, and grape vines. Town plazas are usually decorated with palm and white mulberry trees, especially along the Paseo de las Palmeras in Oliva de la Frontera. The holm oak forests of the area are some of the oldest and best established of all Extremadura, resulting in a variety of flora and fauna being able to develop in these areas. Hiking and sightseeing in these areas is a popular tourist activity, and there are many hiking paths and trails throughout the territory. View of the old quarter of Jerez de los Caballeros.

Due to the proximity to Huelva, and the comarca's natural abundance of black Iberian pigs, many pork products are produced and consumed in Sierra Suroeste. These products include, for example, chorizo, salchichón, blood sausages, loins and other cuts, and jamón ibérico. Some typical dishes include chickpea stew, migas, pisto, caldereta, and bacalao \\"dorao\\". Also popular are dishes of nearby Portugal, which are made in a similar manner as across the border. Sports The most popular sport in the comarca, like in much of the rest of Spain, is football. The most popular local team is Jerez CF, which has played in Segunda División B, but currently plays in the Tercera División. Also popular are the various municipal futsal tournaments, as well as the provincial juvenile tourneys. Basketball is also growing in popularity.

It was first described in his article 'The Creative City', published in the literary journal Meanjin. In this article Yencken argues that while cities must be efficient and fair, a creative city must also be one that is committed to fostering creativity among its citizens and to providing emotionally satisfying places and experiences for them. Creativity and imagination in urban activities The creative city when introduced was seen as aspirational; a clarion call to encourage open-mindedness and imagination implying a dramatic impact on organizational culture. Its philosophy is that there is always more creative potential in a place. It posits that conditions need to be created for people to think, plan and act with imagination in harnessing opportunities or addressing seemingly intractable urban problems. This requires infrastructures beyond the hardware—buildings, roads or sewage. Creative infrastructure is a combination of the hard and the soft. The latter includes a city's mindset, how it approaches opportunities and problems; its atmosphere and incentives and regulatory regime. To be a creative city the soft infrastructure includes: A highly skilled and flexible labour force; dynamic thinkers, creators and implementers. In the creative city it is not only artists and those involved in the creative economy who are creative, although they play an important role. Creativity can come from any source including anyone who addresses issues in an inventive way be it a social worker, a business person, a scientist or public servant. Creativity is not only about having ideas, but also the capacity to implement them. It advocates that a culture of creativity be embedded in how urban stakeholders operate. By encouraging and legitimizing the use of imagination within the public, private and community spheres, the ideas bank of possibilities and potential solutions to any urban problem will be broadened. This requires infrastructures beyond the hardware—buildings, roads or sewage. Creative infrastructure is a combination of the hard and the soft. The latter includes the mindset of a city's citizens, how they approach opportunities and problems; and the city's atmosphere and incentives and regulatory regime. To be a creative city the soft infrastructure includes: a highly skilled and flexible labour force; dynamic thinkers, creators and implementers. Creativity is not only about having ideas, but also the capacity to implement them. The creative city identifies, nurtures, attracts and sustains talent so it is able to mobilize ideas, talents and creative organizations. The built environment—the stage and the setting—is crucial for establishing the milieu. A creative milieu is a place that contains the necessary requirements in terms of hard and soft infrastructure to generate a flow of ideas and inventions. A milieu can be a building, a street, an area or neighborhood, a city or a region. The popularity of creativity came about because of the increased recognition that the world, along with its economic, social and cultural structures was changing dramatically. This was driven in part by information technology revolution. Coping with these changes required a re-assessment of cities' resources and potential and a process of necessary re-invention on all fronts. Cultural resources are embodied in peoples' creativity, skills and talents. They are not only things like buildings, but also symbols, activities and the repertoire of local products in crafts, manufacturing and services. Urban cultural resources include the historical, industrial and artistic heritage of assets including architecture, urban landscapes or landmarks. They also include local and indigenous traditions of public life, festivals, rituals or stories as well as hobbies and enthusiasms. Language, food and cooking, leisure activities, fashion are all part of a city's cultural resources, as are sub-cultures and intellectual traditions that can be used to express the specialness of a location. They include the range and quality of skills in the performing and visual arts and the creative industries. An appreciation of culture should shape the technicalities of urban planning and development rather than being seen as a marginal add-on to be considered after housing, transport and land-use have been dealt with. This focus draws attention to the distinctive, the unique and the special in any place.  Early developments  Partners for Livable Places (later Communities, but hereafter referred to as Partners) founded in 1977 was important in the early development of the creative city idea. Partners initially focused on design and culture as resources for livability. In the early 1980s, Partners launched a programme to document the economic value of design and cultural amenities. The Economics of Amenity programme explored how cultural amenities and the quality of life in a community are linked to economic development and job creation. This work was the catalyst for a significant array of economic impact studies of the arts across the globe. Core concepts used by Partners were cultural planning and cultural resources, which they saw as the planning of urban resources including quality design, architecture, parks, the natural environment, animation and especially arts activity and tourism. From the late 1970s onwards UNESCO and the Council of Europe began to investigate the cultural industries. From the perspective of cities it was Nick Garnham, who when seconded to the Greater London Council in 1983/4 set up a cultural industries unit put the cultural industries on the agenda. Drawing on, re-reading and adapting the original work by Theodor Adorno and Walter Benjamin in the 1930s which had seen the culture industry as a kind of monster and influenced too by Hans Magnus Enzensberger he saw the cultural industries as a potentially liberating force. The first mention of the creative city as a concept was in a seminar organized by the Australia Council, the City of Melbourne, the Ministry of Planning and Environment (Victoria) and the Ministry for the Arts (Victoria) in September 1988. Its focus was to explore how arts and cultural concerns could be better integrated into the planning process for city development. A keynote speech by David Yencken former Secretary for Planning and Environment for Victoria spelt out a broader agenda stating that whilst efficiency of cities is important there is much more needed: \\"[The city] should be emotionally satisfying and stimulate creativity amongst its citizens\\". In subsequent writing about creative cities the tendency has been to concentrate on one or other of the two necessary characteristics proposed by Yencken for a creative city but rarely on both together. A significant follow-up initiative in Australia was a Creative Australia National Workshop in 1989 on 'The Relationship between Creativity and an Innovative Productive Future' jointly sponsored by the Commission for the Future and the Australia Council for the Arts\\". Another important early player was Comedia, founded in 1978 by Charles Landry. Its 1991 study, Glasgow: The Creative City and its Cultural Economy was followed in 1994 by a study on urban creativity called The Creative City in Britain and Germany. The terms cultural industries and cultural resources were introduced into Europe by Franco Bianchini in 1990, who coming from Italy was acquainted with their notion of resorsi culturali and further developed in Australia by Colin Mercer from 1991. Bianchini based his notions on Wolf von Eckhardt, who in 1980 in The Arts & City Planning noted that \\"effective cultural planning involves all the arts, the art of urban design, the art of winning community support, the art of transportation planning and mastering the dynamics of community development\\", to which Bianchini added \\"the art of forming partnerships between the public, private and voluntary sectors and ensuring the fair distribution of economic, social and cultural resources\\". Mercer added cultural planning has to be \\"the strategic and integral use of cultural resources in urban and community development.\\" Bianchini elaborated the term cultural resource in collaborative work with Landry. They stated: \\"Cultural resources are the raw materials of the city and its value base; its assets replacing coal, steel or gold. Creativity is the method of exploiting these resources and helping them grow.\\" This focus draws attention to the distinctive, the unique and the special in any place. This approach has been criticized by Jamie Peck as a \\"neoliberalizing\\" of a city's culture, as cultural spaces and elements are reconfigured into economic resources, thus bringing them inside the neo- liberal market economy. Anatomy As well as being centers of a creative economy and being home to a sizable creative class, creative cities have also been theorized to embody a particular structure. This structure comprises three categories of people, spaces, organizations, and institutions: the upperground, the underground, and the middleground. The upperground consists of firms and businesses engaged in creative industries. These are the organizations that create the economic growth one hopes to find in a creative city, by taking the creative product of the city's residents and converting it into a good or service that can be sold. The underground consists of the individual creative people—for example, artists, writers, or innovators—that produce this creative product. The middleground, then, serves as a space for the upperground and the underground to come into contact with one another. The middleground can consist of physical areas, for example neighborhoods with high populations of creative individuals, or galleries and bars where these individuals congregate. It can also consist of organizations, such as art collectives, that serve to bring together creative individuals. The middleground allows the creative product of the underground to be given a more concrete form by synthesizing disparate creative outputs into discrete products. In its capacity as space, it also allows individuals from the upperground and individuals from the underground to meet, facilitating the transfer of ideas and people from one level to another.Cohendet, P., Grandadam, D., Simon, L., 2010. The Anatomy of the Creative City. Industry and Innovation 17, 91–111. doi:10.1080/13662710903573869 The policy implications of this theoretical framework are that, in order to harness the economic growth potential that creative industries bring with them, urban governments must foster the growth of the middleground and underground as well as the upperground. This can be done through urban planning initiatives that create spaces that can be used as a middleground, and policies that encourage the \\"creative class\\" that comprises the underground. This policy dimension of the creative city concept has been criticized by others as being a tool, not for revitalizing cities, but for the creation of an industry dedicated to offering promises of urban renewal. In Richard Florida's work on creative cities and the creative class, he quantifies various measures of the \\"creative potential\\" of a city, and then ranks cities based on his \\"creativity index\\". This, in turn, encourages cities to compete with one another for higher rankings and the attendant economic benefits that supposedly come with them. In order to do this, city governments will hire consulting firms to advise them on how to boost their creative potential, thus creating an industry and a class of expertise centered around creative cities. The emergence of the creative economy and creative class In the first years of the 21st century, the publication of John Howkins's The Creative Economy and Richard Florida's The Rise of the Creative Class gave the movement a dramatic lift as global restructuring was hitting deep into the US. Florida's book hit a nerve with its clever slogans such as \\"talent, technology, tolerance\\" and interesting sounding indicators like the \\"bohemian index\\" or the \\"gay index\\", that gave numbers to ideas. Importantly it connected the three areas: a creative class – a novel idea, the creative economy and what conditions in cities attract the creative class. Florida concluded that economic development is driven in large measure by lifestyle factors, such as tolerance and diversity, urban infrastructure and entertainment. Florida's work has been criticized by scholars such as Jamie Peck as, \\"work[ing] quietly with the grain of extant 'neoliberal' development agendas, framed around interurban competition, gentrification, middle-class consumption and place-marketing\\". In other words, Florida's prescriptions in favor of fostering a creative class are, rather than being revolutionary, simply a way of bolstering the conventional economic model of the city. The idea of the creative class serves to create a cultural hierarchy, and as such reproduce inequalities; indeed, even Florida himself has even acknowledged that the areas he himself touts as hotspots of the creative class are at the same time home to shocking disparities in economic status among their residents. In order to explain this, he points to the inflation of housing prices that an influx of creatives can bring to an area, as well as to the creative class' reliance on service industries that typically pay their employees low wages. Critics also argue that the creative city idea has now become a catch-all phrase in danger of losing its meaning. Cities also tend to restrict its meaning to the arts and activities within the creative economy professions, calling any cultural plan a creative city plan, when such activities are only one aspect of a community's creativity. There is a tendency for cities to adopt the term without thinking through its real organizational consequences and the need to change their mindset. The creativity implied in the term, the creative city, is about lateral and integrative thinking in all aspects of city planning and urban development, placing people, not infrastructure, at the centre of planning processes.

Politics and conservation The Village Development Committee is part of a protected environmental buffer zone in Nepal called the Royal Chitwan National Park (RCNP). Within the locality, politically, the VDC is under obligation to respect national Community Forestry guidelines. However, a 2003 Journal and Forest Livelihood report, indicated a leadership crisis in Kumarwarti from 2001, with several people failing to provide a committee to consider protection due to a reluctance to deal with the warden and National Park rangers. The people of the Village Development Committee have been criticised for lacking the capacity to deal with the authorities, and to distance themselves away from management roles. In Kumarvarti, the sale of forest products is restricted within the buffer zone. In 1998 when the poorer Majhi/Bote households wanted to sell their share of thatch grass to outside buyers for ₹3 per bundle to raise finances, they were denied permission by the authorities.

Fenn drafted the ordinance (86-04, 2004) for sponsoring supervisor Tom Ammiano, who had also sponsored placing the solar bond authority on the 2001 ballot, and Fenns' company, Local Power Inc., went on to draft a 2007 implementation plan and 2013 business model to implement the $1 billion project. Local Power also contributed substantially to Sonoma county's Sonoma Clean Power program which has a similar structure.

Origin Owners of a nearby ostrich-raising farm in Lo-Reninge with accommodations for vacationers, Urbain Coutteau and Philippe Driessens developed an interest in making distinctive regional beers to serve to their guests. In 2001 they began doing so with help from local wine maker Carlo Grootaert, and this project eventually developed into its own independent commercial concern. Upon its inception in 2003, Struise produced beers at the Caulier brewery in northern Hainaut. Since 2006, they have been made at the Deca brewing facility in Woesten-Vleteren in West Flanders until 2014, after beers were brewed at their own brewhouse. The firm has reported that their own microbrewery and tasting room in Het Oud Schooltje (a renovated school building) located in Oostvleteren, is open and operational. The company takes its name from the historic Flemish word for ostrich, which also is a contemporary slang term meaning \\"tough\\". They render the name into English as \\"The Sturdy Brewers\\", and many of their labels feature ostriches, a trait they share with Dutch brewery Brouwerij 't IJ. Following industry trends made popular by American craft brewers, the brewery has recently ventured into stronger, more flavorful beers and also barrel-aging. They have also collaborated with other European artisan beer scene such as Denmark's Mikkeller, Estonia's Põhjala, fellow Belgians Picobrouwerij Alvinne and Brouwerij De Molen of the Netherlands, as well as American brewers. While their Black Albert was originally conceived in concert with United States- based Ebenezer's Pub, a joint effort to create a \\"Pannepot Cafe\\" in Brunswick, Maine was abandoned in May 2009. Awards and recognition Craft beer fan rating website Ratebeer selected beers from DSB for 9 of their Top 100 Best Beers of Belgium in 2009. Struise was edged out for the #1 slot only by the venerable Trappist brewers of Westvleteren. In 2008, RateBeer declared Struise to be the best brewers in the world per their annual members' poll. This was met with mixed opinions in the world of beer enthusiasts. Many of those critical of the award cited the recent founding of the company as well as the fact that DSB did not own a brewing facility at the time. DSB also received 7 separate awards from Ratebeer in 2007, including accolades for the Aardmonnik and Pannepot.

The basis for this practice is , \\"You shall not eat of any fatty suet, whether from cattle, sheep, or goats.\\" The English word porge, or porging is from Judeo-Spanish porgar (from Spanish \\"to purge\\").; the Yiddish is treibering. The process is done by a menakker. Regional practices It is much easier to perform nikkur on the front part of the animal. It is also easier to perform on non-domestic animals such as deer as the chelev does not need to be removed from such animals. Since it is difficult to perform nikkur on the hind part of domestic animals, the entire hind part is usually sold to the non-Jewish market in Ashkenazi Jewish communities. However, among Yemenite Jews, nikkur on the hind part of the animal is still practised. This tradition goes back for centuries. While many Muslims today (e.g. in the Middle East) do accept food from People of the Book based on the Quranic precept, not all Muslim communities accept Kosher- slaughtered meat, including those hindquarters, as halal; communities that do not accept it include many on the Indian subcontinent.HalalPAK comparison between halal and kosher On the other hand, in countries like Israel, specially trained men are hired to prepare the hindquarters for sale as kosher. Texts on Nikkur The Halachot of Nikkur are presented in Maimonides, Mishne Torah Ma'achalot Asurot vi-viii and Tur and Shulchan Aruch Yoreh Deah §§65, 66. The following document (click to open), translated here from the original Hebrew, has been the basis for ritual slaughterers in Yemen when excising the fatty tissue (suet) known as chelev from the butchered animal, in accordance with a biblical injunction in Leviticus 3:3–4.Yehuda Saadi, Yemenite Jewish manuscript, early eighteenth century, Yemen (with Hebrew original).

Hilchot Nikkur (the excision of fatty tissue known as \\"suet\\" from the slaughtered animal) - by Rabbi Yehuda Sa'adi A diagram showing the four ruminant stomachs (Click to Enlarge) Insomuch that I have seen in this, our orphaned generation, all of us groping like blind men to find the suet and its [appointed] places, and its [required] removal by excision, [not knowing] which of these [places] are to be judged strictly, and which of them are to be judged leniently; as also the [required] removal of the sinew [of the two hind legs], and the membranes, as also the \\"threads\\" (i.e. blood vessels and nerves) which are forbidden under the category of \\"suet,\\" my heart has, [therefore], taken it upon itself to write what I have known about them, perchance those seeing my writing will give answer and show me the way of truth, and cause me to understand where I may have erred. All of the exponents of our laws whom I have known agree to [this] one opinion, that there are three fatty tissues (suet) which, [by eating], men would become liable to extirpation, and they are that which men offer to God [upon the altar]. They are the suet which lies upon the innards, and the suet (fat) which is upon the kidneys, and the suet which is upon the flanks. The suet which is upon the innards is that which is spread as a blanket over the inner ruminant stomach (Heb. Kores), which includes that which is upon the omasum (Heb. Messos) and the reticulum (Heb. Beith Hakossoth). That which is upon the kidneys is as it is implied, whose place is known; while that which is upon the flanks is that which is below the kidneys towards the hind side of the animal, attached to the fat of the kidneys, and which is [called in Aramaic] Tarba de-Aqlivusta, where the joint of the hind legs (Aramaic: Deleifan Atmatha) is located, and which is the suet at the root of the thighs from within. Thus is it written by Maimonides, and by Rabbi Yitzhak Alfasi, as also the author of Halachot Gedolot. Included in this [category] is the suet which [clings] to its side, spreading itself upon the flanks at both sides of the animal. As for the meaning of \\"Aqlivusta,\\" Rashi has explained [it as being] the small bone lying on that bone which, [in French], is called hanche (haunch or hip), and [which is] connected to the vertebrae of the tail [of the sheep]. But Rabbi Yitzhak Alfasi explained [it as] that bone which holds fast all the [other] bones, while the Kol Bo has written Rashi's explanation under his name. Yet, the [book known as] Sefer Mitzvot Gedolot (Hasemag) has written [under] the prohibitive command # 138, Tarba de-Aqlivusta: Rashi has explained the Qaliboseth (i.e. tail bone) as being the small bone lying on that bone which is called [in French] hanche (haunch or hip), and [which is] connected to the vertebrae of the tail [of the sheep] from above, upon which there is suet beneath the loin, and which is among that suet found on the flanks. Regions of vertebral column in ruminants (Click to Enlarge) Now these are the words used by Rabbi A. of Meitze: \\"Near the tail can be found the [edible] fat of the sheep's tail, upon which is the suet of the Qaliboseth (i.e. tail bone), and that same suet and [edible] fat of the sheep's tail cling one to another, etc.\\" But in [the book] Sheiltot of Rabbi Ahai Gaon, and in [the book] Halachot Gedolot, they have written: \\"The suet which is upon the flanks is the suet of the Qaliboseth (i.e. tail bone), where the hind legs attach themselves.\\" Likewise has Maimonides, of blessed memory, written: \\"[It is] the suet which is at the joints of the hind legs from within.\\" Yet, in [the book] Sefer Hazikkaron, he explained Tarba de-Aqlivusta as the place where the thighs are attached, etc., while in an Arabic commentary on the laws governing Ritual Slaughter [we find] that Qaliboseth [means] \\"al-falakh.\\" Now what we have received as being the way to surgically remove all fatty tissue [is as follows]: After undressing the animal, they tear away the outer ruminant stomach from the hind legs unto the chest-wall cavity, and they take out the inner stomach, and remove, in its entirety, the blanket-like covering [of suet] which is spread out over it. And they take special precautions over the thin [layer of] suet which is connected to the large intestines, which is at the end of [that place called], the \\"coils of the ileum\\" (Heb. Hadar Hakanoh), near the place where he excretes excrement, [and] which, on the one side, the \\"suet of the innards\\" is attached, while on the other side, the fat of the kanoh (ileum). That suet which lies next to it is the suet of the small intestines, which is prohibited according to the Geonim, of blessed memory. They take precaution, likewise, over that side which clings somewhat unto the ileum (Heb. Senei Dhebei = \\"hatred of wolves\\"), surgically removing all of it thoroughly. They also take precaution to remove all of the suet that is found upon the abomasum (Heb. Kevah) externally, which is known as the ḥūmṣā, until nothing remains of it. Moreover, they take away the suet which is inside the abomasum, from within, which distinctively adheres itself to the abomasum. Yet, that which is not spread out like a blanket is that which is permitted, it being that which is ritually clean, and it is called bar ḥūmṣā. Now that which is spread over the omasum (Heb. Messos) [and the reticulum] like a blanket is forbidden, which is an even layer of fat covered with a membrane and easily peeled, and which happens to be included among the \\"suet which lies upon the innards.\\" Now they scrape away [all suet] from the intestine which comes out of the abomasum (the fourth ruminant stomach) for the space of about a cubit (ca. 54 cm.), it also being the suet of the small intestines which is prohibited according to [Maimonides], (Nachmanides) and Rabbi Yitzhak Alfasi, seeing that it is a close neighbour to the suet which lies upon the innards. Afterwards, they take out all of the entrails (intestines), and the inner ruminant stomach (Heb. Kores), as well as the liver, aside from the mesentery (Heb. Ḥalūḥelet), for he still needs to clean it from the suet which is upon it. Afterwards, they peel away all of that lining membrane which is upon the flanks, which is forbidden on account of suet. They are scrupulous about its removal that nothing remains of it. The beginning of its place is from where there is the white [tissue] which is in the centre of the diaphragm (Heb. Tarfash) [which divides the digestive organs from the respiratory organs], extending downwards unto the thighs [of the hind legs and] running width-wise along all the flanks, unto the spinal column (vertebrae). They remove it (i.e. the lining membrane) with the suet that lies upon it which is situate at the end of the thighs and which lies upon that flesh which is beneath the loins, which is called \\"lonbel\\" in the foreign, [French] language and mutemaziqah in Arabic. Now this suet is categorically included among the suet which lies upon the flanks. Ruminant's digestive tract (Click to Enlarge) Afterwards, they pull out the five \\"threads\\" (i.e. blood vessels and nerves) that are upon the flanks, these being three on the right side and two on the left. The three on the right side, each one branches off into two separate [veins], while the two [\\"threads\\"] on the left side, each one of them branches off into three separate [veins], while one of its heads is attached to the spinal column, and they are called the \\"threads (nerves) that are in the hip,\\" the \\"threads of the walls [of the chest],\\" and the \\"threads that are upon the flanks,\\" their prohibition being on account of suet. Now if they are pulled off while they are still warm, they can be pulled off altogether. However, if they have become cold, they can no longer be pulled off, and one must then poke around after them. Afterwards, they rend with a knife the thin membrane that is conspicuously located upon the two sides of the spinal column, beneath the loins and extending as far as the ribs. It is the place that appears to the eyesight as a whitish colour by the light of the sun or by the light of a candle from the hind side of the animal, and which can be seen on its inside, and where there is no flesh that lies upon it. After the membrane has been rent, they remove the [forbidden] fat (suet) that is beneath it, extending down as far as the [edible] fat that lies beneath that same suet, it being that which divides between the hide of the animal and the said suet, and it is permitted. Now he removes this suet from [the two sides of] the spinal column, its length extending from beneath the loins all the way up to the ribs; while its breadth extending [outwards] until it becomes covered over in flesh, and once it has been covered over in flesh, [it is permitted]. They scrape away the suet that is upon the spinal column from within, where lies the flesh of the loins which is called [in Arabic] mutemaziqah, and they excise [the fatty tissue from] the mutemaziqah, [surgically removing] all of the [forbidden] fat (suet) that lies upon it externally. Then they dislodge the fat of the kidneys from the place of its attachment on the spine, above the diaphragm (Heb. Tarfash) [which divides the digestive organs from the respiratory organs], towards the side of the animal's loins, surgically removing all suet beneath it, or else they remove the central bone of the spinal column entirely. Afterwards, he opens up the [pelvic] bone that joins together the two thighs, [separating the two thighs], taking out all fat that is within it [and which] lies over the fat of the kidneys, it being the [forbidden] \\"fat that is upon the flanks,\\" or what is also called [in Aramaic] Tarba de-Aqlivusta. They surgically remove it up to the place where the tail begins in large domesticated animals, but in sheep they continue to scrape away the outer part of the fatty tail (rump) towards its inner side which knocks upon the thighs, with the fat of the kidneys and the flanks, all that which is high up at the top of the fatty tail (rump), at the place where it excretes excrement, extending as far as the bones of the fatty tail (rump). Now beneath it there is a marked difference in the thin membrane between the said suet and the suet in the fatty tail, as well as between the \\"threads\\" (i.e. blood vessels and nerves) which draw nourishment from the fat of the kidneys and the flanks. Now they scrape away all the fat (suet) which is between the sinews (Heb. Peqoqeloth) [in the loins], which in Arabic is [known as] al-falakh (Coccyx), along with the \\"threads (i.e. blood vessels and nerves) that enter inside the perforations in the bones which join together the loins of the animal above, wherein ends the spinal cord. He then dismembers the thighs, each one individually, and opens up each one from its flesh on that side where the hide is attached, until the displaced tendon (Heb. Gid Hanasheh) can be seen which is on the hollow of the thigh, removing it and digging up after it in all the flesh of the thighs. Now on [that part of] the [hollow of the] thigh which is called [in Arabic] mukheh, [it requires removing the tendon] from without and from within, and on the calf [of leg] which is called [in Arabic] sā‘ed, [it requires removing the tendon] from without and from within, and on the flesh which is upon it, which grows from the bunch of converging sinews [in the calf] (Heb. Ṣūmmat Hagīdīm), called [in Arabic] suqleh, with all of the fat of the tendon, in every place where it is to be found. Now there are found on the two sides of the [hollow of the] thigh which is called [in Arabic] mukheh and in its socket [what are known as] stems (Heb. Qenuqenoth), as well as the fat (Heb. Shoman) of the displaced tendon, [both] being virtually impossible to clean them very well. Therefore, let him remove them and cast them away. Now there are in the calf, underneath its flesh, three small tendons, they being of the displaced tendon. Therefore, let him open up the flesh and remove them. And as for the spleen, let him peel away the membrane which is upon it, and pull away the \\"threads\\" (i.e. blood vessels and nerves) that are inside of it which are three, their prohibition being on account of suet, and one is required to dig-up after them. The inner ruminant stomach (Heb. Kores), the omasum (Heb. Messos) and the reticulum (Heb. Beith Hakossoth), (as well as the rump of sheep), require being cleaned of all suet that clings to them. The membrane which is upon the diaphragm (Heb. Tarfash) [which divides the digestive organs from the respiratory organs], alongside the liver, is forbidden on account of suet, and that which is alongside the lung is customarily removed lest he who sees it becomes skeptical, although it is permitted. They [also] remove the lower membrane which is upon the kidneys, it being forbidden on account of suet, [as also the tunic membrane that envelope the testes]. As for the \\"threads\\" (i.e. veins and arteries) that are forbidden on account of blood, they do not have it as a practice in these countries to remove them, seeing that they cut up the animal in several pieces. Now may God deliver us from errors, and instruct his servants in the way of truth. Amen, may it even be His will.

It is supposedly the first neo-noir film in Tamil cinema. The story takes place in a day in the lives of the six protagonists, played by Jackie Shroff, Ravi Krishna, Sampath Raj and newcomers Yasmin Ponnappa, Guru Somasundaram and Master Vasanth. Produced by S. P. B. Charan's Capital Film Works, the film features critically acclaimed musical score by Yuvan Shankar Raja and cinematography by P.S. Vinod and editing handled by the duo Praveen K. L. and N. B. Srikanth. The film was launched on 18 December 2008, with its principal photography being completed by late 2009, which was followed by a lengthy post-production phase. It ran into difficulties as the regional censor board in Chennai raised objection against the film, giving it an adult rating besides demanding 52 cuts. After screening at and becoming approved by the Tribunal in Delhi, the film was released worldwide on 10 June 2011, to high critical acclaim but underperformed at box-office. Despite its failure, it gained recognition over the years and now it is regarded as a cult film in Tamil and Indian cinema. It had its world première on 30 October 2010 at the South Asian International Film Festival, where it won the Grand Jury Award for Best Film. Subsequently, the film was honoured with two National Film Awards for Best Editing and Best First Film of a Director category respectively. Plot The film opens with the ageing gangster, Singaperumal (Jackie Shroff), forcing himself on a young girl, Subbu. He is unable to perform, and vents his anger by slapping the helpless Subbu. Singaperumal is the grand don of crime in Madras. His lieutenant, Pasupathi, brings a proposal. A large stash of cocaine, worth about 2 crore, has entered the city. The guy bringing the stash wants to sell it for 50 lakh. Pasupathi sees the immediate easy profit, as well as the long term benefit (to control the cocaine market with such a large supply) and the recognition that they are able to pull off such a deal. The drawback is that the stash really belongs to their arch-rival Gajendran. Singaperumal knows that Gajendran is a vicious and unpredictable adversary, and the venture is risky and likely to become messy. He decides to pass. Pasupathi dourly suggests Singaperumal is getting old and rusty. He asks Singaperumal to loan him the 50 lakh so he can do the job himself. Pasupathi is prepared to face the risks, and in return for the loan, he offers Singaperumal a cut of the profits. Singaperumal agrees to the loan, but, instead asks Pasupathi to first get the stash and then think of the profit distribution. The money for the loan is brought to Singaperumal. The film introduces Kalaya, a now destitute farmer, and his young, street-smart son Kodukapuli. They live in the slums and earn a meagre living staging cock- fights; as a coincidence, Singaperumal loves to watch these cock-fights. One evening, a man arrives to bunk with Kalaya for the night. This man is the cocaine courier. He routinely transports various stashes of drugs in and out of the city, and collects a relatively small fee ( 10,000) for each trip. That evening, after a long bout of drinking, he reveals that he has learnt the true value of the stash, and he now intends to sell it himself instead of delivering it to its true owner. He passes out. Seeing Subbu in tears, Singaperumal asks one of his men, Sappai, to take her out and comfort her \\"so she is prepared to perform for him at night\\". Sappai takes her to the beach and tries to console her. Pasupathi and the men meet with the tipster and drive off to retrieve the stash. En route in the car, one of the men receives a call from Singaperumal, who orders him to bump-off Pasupathi as soon as the stash is acquired. Pasupathi overhears this as the call is on speaker mode and gets into a Mexican stand-off with others. In a desperate ploy he deliberately provokes a cop at a checkpoint, getting arrested and then later making an escape. The other men kidnap his wife, Kasturi, and use her as bait to lure Pasupathi. Singaperumal orders them to bring Kasturi to him. Subbu hates being a plaything for Singaperumal. She yearns to be free and live life on her own terms. She tries to persuade Sappai to think for himself and realise that Singaperumal is merely using them. Sappai, however, is too fearful and weak to oppose Singaperumal. Subbu and Sappai become unlikely lovers, and Subbu continues to hope for a way out. We learn that Subbu is somewhat educated, and learns whatever she can about the world outside Singaperumal. Kalaya stages his cock-fight the following day. But this time, his prize cocks get killed. Kalaya is in serious financial trouble. Kodukapuli senses this and immediately goes to see if their visitor, still unconscious, has any money. They find out that the man had overdone his drink and died. Kalaya and Kodukapuli find the cocaine stash and the telephone number of a prospective buyer (Singaperumal and Pasupathi). Kalaya declares that his financial woes are at an end. Singaperumal is worried. His stash has not arrived, nor has he got word that Pasupathi is dead. He gets an angry call from Gajapati (Gajendran's brother and right-hand man): if Pasupathi seizes Gajapati's stuff, Gajendran will unleash a terrible gang war. The cunning Singaperumal tells Gajapati that Pasupathi has gone rogue, and that Gajapati is free to take out Pasupathi. Singaperumal figures this will benefit him both ways: he will get the stash, and his avaricious general will be killed by Gajendran. Gajendran sends his thugs after Pasupathi. Pasupathi is on the run. Now that Singaperumal has become his enemy, Pasupathi figures that Gajendran could possibly become an ally. Kalaya calls Singaperumal to meet and make a deal for the stash. While waiting for him, Singaperumal's thugs arrive and kidnap Kalaya at the rendezvous point. After continuous torture, Kalaya is unable to reveal anything as his son Kodukapuli has the stash. Kodukapuli ends up calling Pasupathi's number accidentally, and offers to trade the stash for his father. Pasupathi joins Kodukapuli and offers the same trade to Singaperumal: the stash in return for Kalaya and Kasturi. Pasupathi places a call to Gajendran and offers to reveal the location of the stash. Gajendran and his gang arrive at the location to make the exchange with Pasupathi. Singaperumal's thugs also arrive at about the same time. Pasupathi pretends to offer the stash to Gajapati, but instead slices his throat right in front of Gajendran. An enraged Gajendran and his gang chase Pasupathi. Pasupathi leads them around the block where Singaperumal's gang lay waiting. Both gangs mistaking Pasupathi's loyalties charge at each other and ensue in a gang-fight. Pasupathi gets out of the fray, and watches as Gajendran and the key generals of Singaperumal's hack each other to bits. Pasupathi's plan to decimate the two strong factions has succeeded. He returns to finish Singaperumal. Back in his rooms, Singaperumal discovers that the bag with the loan money is missing. He rushes to the conclusion that Sappai took it. When Sappai returns (having been sent by Subbu to fetch fruits), Singaperumal beats him up severely. Sappai's faith is shattered. In his first moment of independence, he grabs a pistol and shoots Singaperumal dead! Subbu emerges from the shadows. She is proud of Sappai, but in a stunning twist, she shoots and kills Sappai! When Pasupathi arrives, he finds Sappai and Singaperumal dead and Subbu in tears. Having always been sympathetic to Subbu's suffering with Singaperumal, he says she is free to go. Subbu leaves. Pasupathi summons the remaining thugs of Singaperumal's gang and assumes command. Kasturi is unharmed. Pasupathi gets the stash and pays Kodukapuli a fair commission. It is finally revealed that Subbu had planned the whole thing. She sent Sappai with the bag containing the loan money to provoke Singaperumal's temper. She retrieves the bag with the loan money and quietly leaves the city to begin her new life. She remarks that the men basically mistrusted, misused and slaughtered each other. In her view, Sappai, too, was not really an innocent victim.

P. B. Charan's next production venture arose. While initial reports suggested that he would produce Achchamundu! Achchamundu!, starring Sneha and Prasanna, Charan opted to produce a film titled Aaranya Kaandam, to be directed by a newcomer Thiagarajan Kumararaja and starring newcomers. However, despite announcing the project, it was called off later that year and Charan started producing the film Kunguma Poovum Konjum Puravum in May 2008. In late 2008, while Kunguma Poovum Konjum Puravum was in post-production stage, reports surfaced that Charan and Kumararaja were going to revive the project, with noted Bollywood actor Jackie Shroff being roped in for a leading role, making his debut in Tamil cinema. Director Thiagarajan Kumararaja was revealed to be a former Loyola College student, and popular advertisement film-maker, who has also directed several short films, including the short film Becky, which was awarded the first prize at the one-minute film competition 60 Seconds to Fame. Kumararaja had previously written the dialogues for the 2007 comedy film Oram Po as well. He got the opportunity to work with Charan, when Pushkar-Gayathri, the director duo of Oram Po, had suggested him to approach Charan, who listened to the storyline and immediately agreed to produce the film, \\"in a matter of time\\" as Kumararaja cites. The film was formally launched on 18 December 2008 at the Kodandapani Studios in Chennai. =Writing= The script was written by Thiagarajan Kumararaja himself, which he had finished in 2006. He cites that he wanted to make a \\"racy film\\" and wrote the climax part first, which would be the \\"raciest part of a film\\". He then wrote \\"multiple story lines with three climaxes\\" as he felt that one climax was \\"not enough for a feature film\\", which eventually turned out to be a \\"leisurely paced film, taking its own time to unfold\\" and not a racy film as intended. He cited that, while writing the script, he was sure that it was meant for a matured audience and not for children, \\"primarily because of the content\\".Thiagarajan Kumararaja went on to add that there were \\"no hero and no villain introduction scenes, there are no love scenes, no sentimental scenes\\" but nonetheless considered his film a masala film and not an experimental film. =Casting= When announcing the film had already roped in Jackie Shroff, debuting in the Tamil film industry, Ravi Krishna, Sampath Raj of Saroja fame along with Guru Somasundaram from the Chennai based theatre group Koothu-P-Pattarai. Shroff was said to play the role of a \\"hoodlum\\", who was chosen after Kumararaja had approached several other Tamil actors, who declined the offer, fearing of their \\"image\\". According to the director, the role required a senior person and Shroff had fit the role \\"completely\\". Speaking of his role, Shroff remarked that he had done things in the film that he hadn't dared to do in the past 30 years of his career, quoting \\"I am literally a monster in the film. Actually, I am more like a coconut – hard on the outside, but a veritable softie inside\\". Ravi Krishna plays a \\"lover boy\\", whose role, he claimed would be totally different from his earlier roles. Ravi Krishna was Kumararaja's first choice for the character as he had written it with keeping Ravi Krishna in mind. Sampath Raj enacts the role of a gangster named Pasupathy. Kumararaja finalised Guru Somasundaram for the character of Kaalayan, after he had seen him performing the titular character in Koothu-P-Pattarai's play Chandrahari. Kumararaja had stated that the voice modulation and pattern of the Kaalaiyan character was based on Somasundaram's performance in the play Chandrahari, which eventually resulted in casting him in the film. Somasundaram cited that the dialogues were also written \\"keeping the artist in mind\\". Yasmin Ponnappa, a popular Bengaluru based model, who had appeared in television advertisements and won many beauty pageants, was selected for the role of the lead female character. Her role was, however, written for Pooja Umashankar, keeping her in mind, who couldn't accept the offer as she had given her dates to Bala's magnum opus Naan Kadavul. The details about the crew members were also published, when the film was announced in early December. P. S. Vinod was chosen as the cinematographer, who had earlier shot films like Musafir and My Wife's Murder, while Videsh was announced as the art director, 'Super' Subbarayan as the stunt master and Kalyan and Ajay Raj as choreographers. Vasuki Bhaskar was appointed as the costume designer. However, during the making of the film 'Super' Subbarayan was replaced by his son Dilip Subbarayan. Themes and influences Aaranya Kaandam is named after one of the chapters from the epic Ramayana meaning \\"Jungle Chapter\\". It is supposedly the first neo-noir film in Tamil cinema and influenced by films like Traffic and Pulp Fiction. Thiagarajan Kumararaja said that his inspiration behind making a gangster film was revealed to be The Godfather as well as the thought of \\"how someone becomes a gangster and continues to be one\\", clarifying that Aaranya Kaandam was not a biography or history of a gangster but \\"a page out of the life of a gangster\\". The film's poster was inspired by a panel in Akira, a widely popular Japanese post-apocalyptic cyber-punk manga series.https://m.media- amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDJiZGIyYjMtYjZkMy00NzE5LTljMDAtNjc3YmNlNjM3MDIzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyOTk3NTc2MzE@._V1_SY1000_CR0,0,639,1000_AL_.jpghttps://i.pinimg.com/originals/57/ca/73/57ca73ef27428e1cab048036ecb1d483.jpg Music Yuvan Shankar Raja was signed as the music director, who was working on a gangster film again after the likes of Pattiyal and Pudhupettai. Kumararaja divulged that he actually hadn't anyone in mind, but joined with Yuvan Shankar, following producer Charan's recommendation, who shared a \\"good working relationship\\" with the composer. Initially a soundtrack was also planned to be composed, with Gangai Amaran being roped in to pen lyrics, however Charan disclosed later that the film would feature no songs at all, becoming Yuvan Shankar Raja's second film project after Adhu without a soundtrack. Charan told that background music of this film will be released in CD's which eventually proved false. The song \\"Moodupanikkul\\" from Thirudan Police (2014) was originally composed for this film.http://www.top10cinema.com/article/27129/aaranya-kaandam-song-lost-and- found Release The film was first screened on 30 October 2010 at the South Asian International Film Festival in New York City. The film was incomplete at that time, with post-production works pending and a low-quality version without colour correction and without a film score was projected at the festival. Despite the drawbacks, the film gained positive feedbacks and went on to win the Grand Jury prize for Best Film. After completion, the film was screened to the regional censor board in Chennai, who declined to clear it. The committee had demanded 52 cuts and several consequential sub-cuts, particularly due to profanity and excessive violence, before permitting a theatrical release. Kumararaja, who admitted that he had expected difficulties in the censorship, disapproved of the board's demands as he wanted to present the film uncompromisingly to the audiences. He claimed that the usage of \\"bad language\\" was \\"part of developing the characters\\" in his story, while he also disagreed with bleeping out the \\"objectionable\\" words since he felt \\"it throws audiences off the film's narrative\\". Producer Charan voiced the same opinion, citing that he had made the film for a \\"mature audience\\", took the film to the Central Tribunal at Delhi. =Critical response= Aaranya Kaandam opened to strong critical acclaim. The India Daily lauded the director and the producer for making a \\"strikingly different film that is raw, realistic and is just like watching angry men up close\\", further adding that \\"picturizing crude realities of life so real needs amazing guts\\". The leading actors, particularly Jackie Shroff and Sampath, were appreciated for their performances, being labeled as \\"perfect\\", while film score and cinematography were praised as well, citing that \\"Yuvan Shankar Raja deserves all accolades for a fantastic re-recording\\" and that \\"Vinod's lens captures the darker sides of city life well\\". Rediffs Pavithra Srinivasan gave the film 3 out of 5, claiming that film \\"bypasses gangster clichés\\". The reviewer also spoke in high terms of the cast and crew, pointing out Guru Somasundaram's performance whose \\"gleeful cackles at the rooster fight, pathetic rumblings to his son and wide-eyed act in the Lodge are wonderful to behold\\" and Yuvan Shankar Raja's score, described as \\"easily [one of] the movie's biggest strengths\\". Behindwoods claimed the film to be an \\"intelligently made gangster flick\\", giving it 3.5 out of 5. Director Kumararaja was praised for that having structured \\"every frame and character in his film with brilliant dexterity\\", adding that the manner of narration and screen play was \\"commendable\\", while also acknowledging aspects such as dialogues, music and cinematography. Sifys reviewer appreciated Kumararaja for \\"taking the road less travelled\\", however criticized the large amount of violence in the film, terming it the \\"most violent and bloody film ever to get through Chennai regional censors\\". In regard to the performances of the cast, he cited that the best performance came from Sampath, who \\"just smirks throughout the film\\", while claiming that Yasmin was \\"fantastic in her début role\\". NDTVs critic described the film as a \\"gangster movie which stands out with its realistic portrayal and no-nonsense treatment\\", further adding that \\"good performances, effective dialogues, slick editing and amazing camera-work help the movie stand out from the crowd\\". A reviewer from Chennaionline wrote that the film was made \\"near-perfect\\" featuring \\"some stunning performances, sharp dialogues and excellent camera work and music\\". Jackie Shroff and P. S. Vinod, in particular, won high praise from the critic, who wrote that the former \\"proves his class\\" and \\"shines in the don’s role\\", while they had done a \\"terrific job and should be considered a major factor for the film’s success at the box-office\\". N. Venkateswaran from Times of India rated the film 4.5 out of 5 (the highest rating for any Tamil film ever), while The Hindustan Times critic Gautaman Bhaskaran gave 3.5 out of 5. Rohit Ramachandran of nowrunning.com, too, rated the film 3.5 out of 5 stating that \\"Aaranya Kaandam is a neo-noir film that runs at breakneck speed only to be slowed down and stopped at an unwelcome destination. But why think of the destination when the journey is one that you've thoroughly enjoyed?\\" Baradwaj Rangan commended the film, citing that \\"with most mainstream films, especially in Tamil, you know some fifteen minutes in if they’re working for you (or not) [...] But there are a few that leave you hanging until almost the end [...] and then, gradually, things begin to cohere and reshape your entire thus-far experience, and you slap your forehead and smile and say wow! This is one of those films.\\" Accolades ;National Film Awards * Best Editing - Praveen K. L. & N. B.

Only the chelev of animals that are of the sort from which offerings can be brought in the Tabernacle or Temple are prohibited (). The prohibition of eating chelev is also, in addition to the Torah, one of the 613 commandments that, according to the Talmud,Talmud, Makkot 22b were given to Moses on Mount Sinai.Maimonides, Sefer Hamitzvot, Negative Commandments (lo sa'aseh) number 185 Hebrew BibleHebrew language In Biblical Hebrew, the word for fat is chelev (חֵלֶב), and it is first used for the \\"fats\\" of Abel's offering, and most often used for fats of animal sacrifices on the altar of the Tabernacle or Temple. The same word is also used in the phrase \\"the fat of the land.\\" Rabbinical interpretation The punishment for eating chelev bemeizid (on purpose) is kareth (exclusion from the after life). The atonement for eating it by mistake is to bring a korban hattath (atonement sacrifice). The prohibition on chelev is only regarding those animal types which were used as a korban: cattle, lamb and goat, which are the only kosher domestic livestock. Fats from avians and deer may be eaten, and different types of bovinae are in state of doubt. Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook suggested that the prohibition of chelev reminds us that we may only take the lives of domesticated animals for our essential needs. \\"We are permitted to slaughter these animals for their meat, to give us energy and strength, but … we should not kill them merely for the pleasure of eating their fatty meat, so pleasurable to the palate of the gastronome.\\" In order that fat should be considered chelev it must look like a sheet of fats, like a thick fibrous skin that can be removed (see picture). Some tendons and muscles are also removed due to the rabbinic law, since they are neighboring and resolving some chelev. The chelev must be removed by a qualified menaker in a process called nikkur (surgical removal). =Kidney fats= The fats surrounding the kidneys are called chelev hakloyoth, and are considered non-kosher. =Abdominal fats= The sheet of fat which is covering the interior of the abdominopelvic cavity is real chelev, except at some regions where it is covered with steak, not with skin or tendon. However even where it is covered with meat, there is some fat which is still forbidden, since it could occasionally get uncovered while the animal walks. Therefore, one must be well trained in order to identify kosher fat. =Digestive system fats = There are many fats around the digestive organs such as the stomach and intestines, and one must be highly educated and trained in order to identify them. =Tail fat= The tail fat of the fat-tailed sheep, called alyah in Hebrew, is a large fatty membrane located on the hindquarters of certain breeds of sheep. The Torah uses the term chelev of this fat, but only in the sense of \\"the good part\\"; its consumption is permitted.Rambam, Maachalot Assurot 7:5 The Karaites, however, understand this fat to literally be forbidden chelev, and thus do not allow eating the tail fat. Rabbi Judah HaLevi, in his 12th century work The Kuzari, questioned the practicality of the Karaite position: \\"Where exactly does [the prohibited fat] end? Some might prohibit only the tip of the sheep tail, while others the entire hind part.\\"Kuzari III:35 See also * Nikkur *Shechita #Nikkur ReferencesExternal links *Laws of Judaism concerning eating fat from the Torah and Maimonides’ Code of Jewish Law *Getting the Knack of Nikkur: OU Kashrut Seminar on Removing Veins and Forbidden Fat Big Success *OU Film Category:Jewish sacrificial law Category:Ancient Israel and Judah Category:Negative Mitzvoth Category:Animal anatomy Category:Hebrew words and phrases in the Hebrew Bible Category:Hebrew words and phrases in Jewish law ","title":"Chelev"},{"id":"20759804","text":"Niguldipine is a calcium channel blocker and a1-adrenergic receptor antagonist.

The noun form kareth does not occur in the Hebrew Bible.AlHatorah search The plural, Kerithoth (\\"Excisions\\"), is the seventh tractate of the fifth order Kodashim of the Mishnah.

Rooker, Dennis R. Cole Leviticus 2000 Page 108 \\"This latter category cannot be expiated, and the offender is karat, “cut off,” a term often understood as designating a premature death\\".International Standard Bible Encyclopedia: E-J - Page 219 Geoffrey W. Bromiley - 1995 \\"Kerithoth ( According to Richard C. Steiner, the phrase \\"to be cut off from one's people\\" is an antonym for \\"to be gathered to one's people\\" (e.g. ), and thus kareth in the Bible means to be deprived of the afterlife.Richard C. Steiner, Disembodied souls: the Nefesh in Israel and kindred spirits in the ancient Near East, with an appendix on the Katumuwa inscription (SBL Press, 2015), p. 126 Examples of sins making a person liable to kareth include eating chametz on Passover, sexual violations, ritual impurities, and a man's refusal to be circumcised. The Book of Numbers states that anyone who sins deliberately or high-handedly receives kareth. Rabbinic interpretation Kareth is the punishment for certain crimes and offences defined under Jewish law (e.g. eating the life blood of a living animal, eating suet, refusing to be circumcised, etc.), a punishment that can only be given at the hand of heaven unto persons of the Jewish faith who are bound to keep the Jewish law, rather than made punishable by any earthly court. In some cases of sexual misconduct and in breaking the laws of the Sabbath, such as where there are witnesses of the act, the court is able to inflict punishment. By definition, kareth does not apply to non-Jews. Kareth can either mean dying young (before the age of 50 or 60Moed Kattan 28a), dying without children, or the soul being spiritually \\"cut off\\" from your people after death. According to Nachmanides, both definitions are accurate, and are applicable according to the nature of the person that committed the offense. If he was generally a good person, meaning that the good in him outweighed the evil, he is punished with dying before his time, unless he had other virtues that are cause for him to merit living out his full life, but retains his portion in the world to come. However, if the evil in him outweighed the good, he is then granted a good and lengthy life to reward him for the good that he did in his life, but upon death, he will have no portion in the world to come.Nachmanides, Commentary on the Torah. Leviticus 18:29 The medieval scholar Rabbi Yonah Gerondi, in his famous ethical work The Gates of Repentance, says that the Torah itself makes a distinction as to which form of kareth is to be applied for a particular offense. In most cases, the Torah uses the term such as that in Leviticus 18:29; the persons who commit them shall be cut off from among their people, which he says is a reference to a punishment in this world. However, when the Torah uses a term such as that in Numbers 15:31, that person will be cut off completely, his offense will remain with him, that penalty refers to being spiritually cut off after death.Shaarie TeshuvaPart 3 Sec. 124 There are two opinions as to what the nature of being spiritually cut off means in reference to the soul after death. Maimonides is of the opinion that this means that upon his death the \\"soul that left his body is completely destroyed and he dies the death of animal\\".Maimonides, Mishneh Torah, Laws of Repentance 8:1 Nachmanides maintains that the soul is not destroyed, but that the soul being cut off after death is a reference to the spiritual world where after death the soul exists in an exalted spiritual state, and that the penalty of Kareth is that he is not eligible to enter into that world. However, the soul lives on, and is eligible for the Resurrection of the dead.Nachmanides, Commentary on the Torah. Leviticus 18:29 Kareth is applicable only when the transgression was done on purpose, and without later proper repentance, and is applicable only to Jews. When done unintentionally, such a transgression generally requires that a sin-offering be brought. =Offenses punishable by kareth= According to the Mishnah,Kerithoth 1:1 kareth is the punishment for the following 36 offenses (where the offense is sexual intercourse, kareth applies to both parties): #Sexual intercourse with one's mother #Sexual intercourse with one's father's wife #Sexual intercourse with one's son's wife #A male having sexual intercourse with another male #A male having sexual intercourse with an animal #A female having sexual intercourse with an animal #Having sexual intercourse with both a mother and her daughter within the span of his lifetime #Sexual intercourse with a married woman #Sexual intercourse with one's sister #Sexual intercourse with one's father's sister #Sexual intercourse with one's mother's sister #Sexual intercourse with the sister of one's wife #Sexual intercourse with one's brother's wife #Sexual intercourse with the wife of one's father's brother #Sexual intercourse with a menstruating woman, known as a niddah #Cursing God using the Tetragrammaton, known as megadef (מגדף)) #Worshiping a deity other than God, known as Avodah Zarah (In Jewish law, idolatry is understood as implying an act that one does for another god and which is tantamount to what an Israelite would normally do for his own God, such as bowing down unto it, or sacrificing unto it, etc.) #Delivering one's child to Moloch #Consulting with a spirit through a process known as ov (אוב) #Violating the Shabbat by doing one of the 39 categories of activities prohibited on Shabbat #Eating of an offering while in a state of ritual impurity, known as tumah #Entering the temple or Tabernacle while in a state of ritual impurity, known as tumah #Eating of a form of animal fat known as chelev (This prohibition applies only to the suet of domesticated animals, e.g. bullocks, sheep and goats, but not to the suet of wild game animals, such as deer, gazelles, and antelope)Babylonian Talmud, Chullin 109b #Eating or drinking blood (excluding the blood of fish) #Eating of an offering after the allowable time for the eating of that offering has expired.

Tugdamme's legacy began sometime around 660 BC. It seems that his first known attacks were against the Greek coastal cities in Asia Minor. In 653 BC he began to push at the mighty Assyrian Empire during the reign of Ashurbanipal. The Assyrian inscriptions speak of Tugdamme as being the \\"King of the Saka and Qutium\\" but the Assyrian inscriptions also call him by the title \\"Sar Kissati\\" which means \\"King of Kish\\" or \\"King of the world\\" which suggests that Tugdamme ruled a vast area of land. Tugdamme would eventually be defeated around 641-640 BC, but it remains unknown as to who defeated and killed him. The historian Strabo suggest that Madys killed Tugdamme and defeated his forces. Ashurbanipal says Marduk defeated Tugdamme, which may suggest that an outside element had defeated Tugdamme and not the Assyrians; this outside element may have been Madys. According to Fritz Hommel, Tugdamme must have been an ancestor of Sandakhshatra (whom he identified with Cyaxares) and his son Ishtivegu (Astyages), implying identification of Tugdamme with Phraortes.The Civilization of the East, Fritz Hommel, translated by J.

A blacklight poster is a poster printed with inks which fluoresce under a black light. The inks used contain phosphors which cause them to glow when exposed to ultraviolet light emitted from black lights. Although black lights date to 1903 with the development of Wood's glass, fluorescent ink was not developed until 1932 when the Switzer brothers were inspired by a Popular Science article to experiment in their father's pharmacy. Their Day-Glo Color Corp. marketed the ink chiefly to the military before a counterculture emerged to embrace the aesthetic.Ensminger, David. \\"Black Light Panthers: The Politics of Fluorescence,\\" Art in Print Vol. 5 No. 2 (July–August 2015). The 1960s saw the pervasive use of illegal drugs, especially mass use of hallucinogenics such as LSD (lysergic acid diethylamide), mescaline, and marijuana for the first time. With the ability to glow and vibrate under ultraviolet light, the posters could simulate the sensations and visual distortions one experienced during an acid trip. In the United States, blacklight posters emerged as part of the psychedelic fashion scene between 1967 and 1969. The style was popular in advertisements for concerts at venues like the Fillmore and Avalon Ballroom, and further promoted and commercialized by companies like Pandora Productions (established in Minneapolis, 1964) and the Houston Black Light Company (Houston, 1969). Designs ranged from respectful copies of concert posters to prurient adolescent fantasies. At its height radical black artists found inspiration in the aesthetic, such as Faith Ringgold's series of Black Light paintings that eschewed any white pigment, or Barbara Jones-Hogu's prints (especially Relate to Your Heritage). Commercial producers happily reciprocated by incorporating blaxploitation themes into their posters, as in George Goode's series for the Houston Black Light Company and George Stowe Jr.'s work for One Stop Posters. Since then, the art form has gone out of fashion and is generally viewed as a relic of the 1970s. Although blacklight posters have continually been produced since the 1960s, there has been a resurgence in popularity since 2007 as blacklight and glow-in-the-dark parties have become more popular. As of 2014, there are five companies actively producing new and classic flocked blacklight posters in a wide range of content, including music, nature, and pop culture. The black parts of these posters are overlaid with black flocking, which gives it a velvet feel, and these are often referred to as velvet posters. Artists continue to make use of the material, notably Dorothy Cross' 1998 Ghost Ship (a decommissioned light ship painted to glow at night, evoking the pigment's original military purposes), or Hank Willis Thomas' 2014 screenprints And I Can't Run and Blow the Man Down (exposing black victims under fluorescent light, evoking the pigment's historic association with black radicalism).

It consists of 3D Space-Wars (1983), 3D Seiddab Attack (1984) and 3D Lunattack. All three games were later published together as \\"The Seiddab Trilogy\\" by Hewson for the Rotronics Wafadrive. The series name is derived from the word \\"baddies\\" being spelt in reverse. Astroclone (1985), also programmed by Turner and featuring the Seiddab, is part of this series. 3D Space-Wars 3D Space- Wars was released in 1983 by Hewson Consultants. 3D Seiddab Attack 3D Seiddab Attack was released in 1984 by Hewson Consultants. =Critical reception= Your Spectrum's review highlighted the realistic 3D effect and split-screen display, but criticized the monochrome graphics and slow game speed. Sinclair User awarded 5 out of 10, criticizing the unclear, flickering display but praising a sophisticated concept and satisfying explosions. Personal Computer Games were unimpressed with the 3D effect and felt that the enemy ships were indistinct and the action unexciting. 3D Lunatack 3D Lunattack was released in 1984 by Hewson Consultants, and is the only game of the series that was also published for the Commodore 64. The player takes control of a Z5 Luna Hover Fighter in an attack against the Seiddab command base. The Z5 must be piloted through three rings of defence before destroying the base. = Gameplay = The game requires the player to attack the Seiddab base, which is protected by three rings of defense. The first consists of robotically controlled tanks which fire missiles; these tanks can be destroyed by laser fire. The second ring is an area of mountains protected by mines, which are set to explode when the player gets too close. They may be shot using the Z5's lasers, or dodged. An exploding mine rocks the players craft altering its course. The third ring of defence is studded with missile silos, which may be attacked with the Z5's lasers. If the player manages to penetrate the command zone, the base must be repeatedly strafed while avoiding its defensive firepower. At any time the player may be attacked by Seiddab fighters. The Z5 is armed with air-to-air missiles that can be used to destroy the enemy fighters before they come into range. Once they are visible, the lasers must be used. Weapon selection is automatic- if the target is below the horizon lasers will be used, if the target is above then missiles will be fired. The screen displays a cockpit with a horizon of mountains, and enemy craft displayed, and crosshair sights of the Z5's weaponry. There is also a radar display which switches on automatically when an enemy hover fighter is detected, and places a small box near the enemy location indicating the range to the fighter. At this stage missiles may be fired and forgotten. Below the main display are indicators for fuel, armament type in use and hull temperature, which increases to a critical point with each enemy strike. An additional audio track was included on the cassette tape. 3D Lunattack also supported Currah Microspeech. = Critical reception = Reviews were mixed. While Sinclair User only gave the game 6/10, CRASH awarded it a CRASH Smash at 90%. Sinclair User said of the game \\"the controls are difficult to handle and of the type where you lose position rapidly through having to over-correct continually\\", while CRASH decided that \\"the display is wonderful, the best three dimensional Battlezone-type game yet... Really excellent, most playable and addictive too.\\" Astroclone Astroclone was published in 1984 by Hewson Consultants.

This Buddhist pilgrimage site, which was constructed some 2500 years BCE, contains relics of Gautama Buddha. According to Buddhist texts, after Buddha's Mahaparinirvana, his cremated remains were divided and distributed among the princes of eight of the sixteen mahājanapadās. Each of the princes constructed a stupa at or near his capital city, within which the respective portion of the ashes was enshrined. One of them was Rāmagrāma, a major city of the Koliya kingdom (this settlement is sometimes referred to as Koliyanagara) at that time. Some 300 years later, Emperor Ashoka opened seven of these stupas and removed the Buddha relics (his goal was to redistribute the relics into 84,000 stupas which he planned to construct throughout the Maurya Empire). According to legend, the Naga serpent king was guarding the Ramagrama stupa, and prevented Ashoka from unearthing the relic. To this day, Ramagrama stupa remains the only intact and original stupa containing relics of Lord Buddha. The stupa has been an object of great reverence and pilgrimage site since its original construction. The high stupa is now buried under a mound of earth and is awaiting further research. * Devdaha The historical and religious site of Nepal situated 6 km west of Sunwal, is best known for the maternal home of lord Gautam Buddha.

Biosynthesis Metabolically, (S)-canadine is derived from (S)-reticuline, a pivotal intermediate in the biosynthesis of numerous BIA structural subgroups, through three enzymatic steps: 1) Berberine bridge enzyme to (S)-scoulerine; 2) (S)-scoulerine 9-O-methyltransferase to (S)-tetrahydrocolumbamine; and 3) (S)-canadine synthase/CYP719A21 to (S)-canadine. (S)-Canadine is the immediate metabolic precursor of berberine, which is obtained through the action of the enzyme (S)-tetrahydroprotoberberine oxidase. It is also an intermediate in the complex biosynthesis of noscapine, which is likewise a benzylisoquinoline alkaloid, but of the phthalideisoquinoline structural subgroup. (S)-Canadine, berberine, palmatine, and hydrastine are the major alkaloids present in goldenseal. Effects A number of in vitro effects of (S)-canadine have been reported. It stimulates myogenesis and inhibits muscle protein degradation. (S)-Canadine blocks K(ATP) channels in dopamine neurons. (S)-Canadine has displayed antioxidant activity: though it lacked any demonstrable cytotoxic effect in three unique cell cultures, it was observed to possess antioxidant activity against free radical-induced oxidative injury.

However, during the collapse of the Late Bronze Age, the coastal regions came under attack from a collection of nine seafaring tribes known as the Sea Peoples. The transitional period is believed by historians to have been a violent, sudden and culturally disruptive time. During this period, the Eastern Mediterranean saw the fall of the Mycenaean Kingdoms, the Hittite Empire in Anatolia and Syria,For Syria, see M. Liverani, \\"The collapse of the Near Eastern regional system at the end of the Bronze Age: the case of Syria\\" in Centre and Periphery in the Ancient World, M. Rowlands, M.T. Larsen, K.

At least three of the nine tribes of the Sea Peoples are believed to have been ethnic Greeks; the Denyen, Ekwesh, and the Peleset, although some also include the Tjeker. According to scholars, the Peleset were allowed to settle the coastal strip from Gaza to Joppa becoming the Philistines. While the Denyen settled from Joppa to Acre, and the Tjeker in Acre. The political vacuum, which resulted from the collapse of the Hittite and Egyptian Empire's saw the rise of the Syro-Hittite states, the Philistine, and Phoenician Civilizations, and eventually the Neo-Assyrian Empire. Al-Mina was a Greek trading colony. = Hellenistic Age = Further Information: Wars of Alexander the Great, Seleucid Empire, Coele-Syria The Seleucid Empire in 200 BC (before expansion into Anatolia and Greece) The history of Greeks in Syria traditionally begins with Alexander the Great's conquest of the Persian Empire. In the aftermath of Alexander's death, his empire was divided into several successor states, and thus ushering in the beginning of the Hellenistic Age. For the Levant and Mesopotamia, it meant coming under the control of Seleucus I Nicator and the Seleucid Empire. The Hellenistic period was characterized by a new wave of Greek colonization.Professor Gerhard Rempel, Hellenistic Civilization (Western New England College) . Ethnic Greek colonists came from all parts of the Greek world, not, as before, from a specific \\"mother city\\".Ulrich Wilcken, Griechische Geschichte im Rahmen der Altertumsgeschichte. The main centers of this new cultural expansion of Hellenism in the Levant were cities like Antioch, and the other cities of the Tetrapolis Seleukis. The mixture of Greek-speakers gave birth to a common Attic-based dialect, known as Koine Greek, which became the lingua franca throughout the Hellenistic world. Dark blue: areas in which Greek speakers probably were a majority. Light blue: areas that were Hellenized. The Seleucid Empire was a major empire of Hellenistic culture that maintained the pre-eminence of Greek customs in which a Greek political elite dominated, in newly founded urban areas.\\" Glubb, Sir John Bagot 1967 34 \\"Britannica, Seleucid kingdom, 2008, O.Ed. The Greek population of the cities who formed the dominant elite were reinforced by emigration from Greece. The creation of new Greek cities were aided by the fact that the Greek mainland was overpopulated and therefore made the vast Seleucid Empire ripe for colonization. Apart from these cities, there were also a large number of Seleucid garrisons (choria), military colonies (katoikias) and Greek villages (komai) which the Seleucids planted throughout the empire to cement their rule. = Roman Era = Levantine Hellenism flourished under Roman rule in several regions, such as the Decapolis. Antiochians in the Northern Levant found themselves under Roman rule when Seleukeia was eventually annexed by the Roman Republic in 64 BC, by Pompey in the Third Mithridatic War. While those in the Southern Levant were absorbed gradually into the Roman State. Eventually, in 135 AD, after the Bar Kokhba revolt the North and South were merged into the Roman province of Syria Palaestina, which existed until about 390. During its existence, the population of Syria Palaestina in the north consisted of a mixed Polytheistic population of Phoenicians, Arameans and Jews which formed the majority, as well as what remained of Greek colonists, Arab societies of Itureans, and later also the Ghassanids. In the East, Arameans and Assyrians made up the majority. In the South, Samaritans, Nabateans and Greco-Romans made up the majority near the end of the 2nd century. = Byzantine Era = The flag used by the Greek Orthodox Church Throughout the Middle Ages, Byzantine Greeks self-identified as Romaioi or Romioi (Greek: Ῥωμαῖοι, Ρωμιοί, meaning \\"Romans\\") and Graikoi (Γραικοῖ, meaning \\"Greeks\\"). Linguistically, they spoke Byzantine or Medieval Greek, known as \\"Romaic\\". which is situated between the Hellenistic (Koine), and modern phases of the language.. Byzantines, perceived themselves as the descendants of classical Greece,; ; .: \\"As heirs to the Greeks and Romans of old, the Byzantines thought of themselves as Rhomaioi, or Romans, though they knew full well that they were ethnically Greeks.\\" (see also: ): \\"All through the Middle Ages the Byzantines considered themselves the guardians and heirs of the Hellenic tradition.\\" the political heirs of imperial Rome,; ; .: \\"The Byzantines did not call themselves Byzantines, but Romaioi—Romans. They were well aware of their role as heirs of the Roman Empire, which for many centuries had united under a single government the whole Mediterranean world and much that was outside it.\\" and followers of the Apostles. Thus, their sense of \\"Romanity\\" was different from that of their contemporaries in the West. \\"Romaic\\" was the name of the vulgar Greek language, as opposed to \\"Hellenic\\" which was its literary or doctrinal form.. The Byzantine dominion in the Levant known as the Diocese of the East, was one of the major commercial, agricultural, religious, and intellectual areas of the Empire, and its strategic location facing the Sassanid Empire and the unruly desert tribes gave it exceptional military importance. The entire area of the former diocese came under Sassanid occupation between 609 and 628, but it was retaken by the Emperor Heraclius until its irreversible lost to the Arabs after the Battle of Yarmouk and the fall of Antioch. = Arab Conquest = Further Information:Muslim conquest of the Levant, Arab-Byzantine Wars The Arab conquest of Syria (Arabic: الفتح الإسلامي لبلاد الشام) occurred in the first half of the 7th century,\\"Syria.\\" Encyclopædia Britannica. 2006. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. 20 Oct. 2006 Syria -- Britannica Online Encyclopedia and refers to the conquest of the Levant, which later became known as the Islamic Province of Bilad al-Sham. On the eve of the Arab Muslim conquests the Byzantines were still in the process of rebuilding their authority in the Levant, which had been lost to them for almost twenty years.\\"Britannica Iran\\" At the time of the Arab conquest, Bilad al-Sham was inhabited mainly by local Aramaic-speaking Christians, Ghassanid and Nabatean Arabs, as well as Greeks, and by non-Christian minorities of Jews, Samaritans, and Itureans. The population of the region did not become predominantly Muslim and Arab in identity until nearly a millennium after the conquest. Map detailing the route of Muslim invasion of central Syria In Southern Levant The Muslim Arab army attacked Jerusalem, held by the Byzantines in November 636. For four months the siege continued. Ultimately, the Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem, Sophronius, agreed to surrender Jerusalem to Caliph Umar in person. Umar, then at Medina, agreed to these terms and traveled to Jerusalem to sign the capitulation in the spring of 637. Sophronius of Jerusalem also negotiated a pact with Caliph Umar, known as the Umariyya Covenant or Covenant of Omar, allowing for religious freedom for Christians in exchange for jizya, a tax to be paid to conquered non-Muslims, called \\"dhimmis\\". While the majority population of Jerusalem during the time of Arab conquest was Christian, the majority of Palestine population about 300,000-400,000 inhabitants, was still Jewish.Israel Cohen (1950).Contemporary Jewry: a survey of social, cultural, economic, and political conditions, p 310. In the aftermath the process of cultural Arabization and Islamization took place, combining immigration to Palestine with the adoption of Arabic language and conversion of the part of local population to Islam.Lauren S.

Retrieved 19 December 2011. =Ottoman Period= Historically, Followers of the Greek Orthodox Church and Melkite Greek Catholic Church regardless of ethnicity were considered as part of the Rum Millet (millet-i Rûm), or \\"Roman nation\\" by the Ottoman authorities. According to a rare ethnographic study published by French historian and ethnographer Alexander Synvet in 1878. There were 160,000 Greeks living throughout Syria, Lebanon, and Palestine. Greek War of Independence As soon as the Greek revolution commenced, Rûm (followers of the Greek Church traditions) throughout the Empire were targeted for persecutions, and Syria did not escape Ottoman wrath. Fearing that the Rûm of Syria might aid the Greek Revolution, the Porte issued an order that they should be disarmed. In Jerusalem, the city's Christian population, who were estimated to make up around 20% of the city's totalFisk and King, 'Description of Jerusalem,' in The Christian Magazine, July 1824, page 220. Mendon Association, 1824. (with the majority being Rûm), were also forced by the Ottoman authorities to relinquish their weapons, wear black, and help improve the city's fortifications. Greek Orthodox holy sites, such as the Monastery of Our Lady of Balamand, located just south of the city of Tripoli in Lebanon, were subjected to vandalism and revenge attacks, which in fact forced the monks to abandon it until 1830. Not even the Greek Orthodox Patriarch was safe, as orders were received just after the execution of the Ecumenical Patriarchate in Constantinople to kill the Antiochian Patriarch as well, but local officials failed to execute the orders. Monument to Vasos Mavrovouniotis in Podgorica On March 18, 1826 a flotilla of around fifteen Greek ships, led by Vasos Mavrovouniotis attempted to spread the Greek Revolution to the Ottoman Levant. According to then-British Consul John Barker, stationed in Aleppo, in a memo to British Ambassador Stratford Canning, in Constantinople. The Greek Revolutionaries landed in Beirut, but were thwarted by a local mufti and a hastily arranged defense force. Although initially repelled, the Greeks managed to hold on to a small portion of the city near the seashore in an area inhabited by local Rûm during which they appealed to the Rûm \\"to rise up and join them\\" and even sent an invitation to the chief of the local Druzes to also join the Revolution. A few days later, on March 23, 1826, regional governor Abdullah Pasha sent his lieutenant and nearly 500 Albanian irregular forces to exacted revenge for the failed uprising. Massacre of Aleppo (1850) On October 17–18, 1850, Muslim rioters attacked the Christian neighborhoods of Aleppo. In the aftermath, Ottoman records show that 688 homes, 36 shops, and 6 churches were damaged, including the Greek Catholic patriarchate and its library. The events lead hundreds of Christians to emigrate mainly to Beirut and Smyrna. Damascus Massacre of 1860 On July 10, 1860 Saint Joseph of Damascus and 11,000 Antiochian Greek Orthodox and Catholic ChristiansShaw, Ezel Kural. History of the Ottoman Empire and modern Turkey, Volume 2, Cambridge University Press, 1977New , York Times. Details of the Damascus Massacre, NYT, August 13, 1860 were killed when Druze marauders destroyed part of the old city of Damascus. The Rûm had taken refuge in the churches and monasteries of Bab Tuma (\\"Saint Thomas' Gate\\"). The Massacre was a part of the 1860 Mount Lebanon civil war, which began as a Maronite rebellion in Mount Lebanon, and culminated in the massacre in Damascus. =First World War and the Ottoman Greek Genocide= During the First World War, Rûm, alongside Ottoman Greeks, were targeted by the Ittihadist Ottoman authorities in what is now historically known as the Ottoman Greek genocide. As a result, three Antiochian Greek Orthodox Dioceses were completely annihilated; the Metropolis of Tarsus and Adana, the Metropolis of Amida, and the Metropolis of Theodosioupolis. Those Antiochians living outside of the French Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon were subject to the forced population exchange of 1923, which ended the Ottoman Greek Genocide. One modern Greek town, which is made up of Antiochian survivors from the population exchange is Nea Selefkia, which is located in Epirus. The founders of Nea Selefkia were refugees from Silifke in Cilicia. Present situation Damascus has been home to an organized Greek community since 1913, but there are also significant numbers of Greek Muslims originally from Ottoman Crete who have been living in several coastal towns and villages of Syria and Lebanon since the late Ottoman era. They were resettled there by Sultan Abdul Hamid II following the Greco-Turkish War in 1897-98, in which the Ottoman Empire lost Crete to the Kingdom of Greece. The most notable but still understudied Cretan Muslim village in Syria is al-Hamidiyah, many of whose inhabitants continue to speak Greek as their first language. There, of course, is also a significant Greco-Syrian population in Aleppo as well as smaller communities in Latakia, Tartus and Homs. As with most other ethnic minorities in Syria, most Greco-Syrian Orthodox Christians speak only Arabic along with a school-taught foreign language such as French or English; however, a working or rudimentary knowledge of Greek, for liturgical purposes, as well as among older, particularly first- and second-generation, individuals, is relatively widespread. Also, Damascus has a private Greek-language school for the community; it is maintained by visiting instructors from Greece. Greek Muslims in Syria In addition to the Greek Orthodox Christian population, there are also about 8,000 Greek-speaking Muslims of Cretan origin in Al- Hamidiyah, Syria and 7,000 people of Greek Muslim descent in Tripoli, Lebanon.Greek-Speaking Enclaves of Lebanon and Syria by Roula Tsokalidou. Proceedings II Simposio Internacional Bilingüismo. Retrieved 18-12-08 Greek Muslims constitute a majority of Al-Hamidiyah's population. By 1988, many Greek Muslims from both Lebanon and Syria had reported being subject to discrimination by the Greek embassy because of their religious affiliation. The community members would be regarded with indifference and even hostility and would be denied visas and opportunities to improve their Greek through trips to Greece. Because of the Syrian Civil War, many Muslim Greeks sought refuge in nearby Cyprus and even some went to their original homeland of Crete, yet they are still considered as foreigners.

At the time of the 1991 Nepal census it had a population of 3033 people living in 418 individual households. In 1969 Gary and Barbara Shepherd moved from San Diego California to Nepal and eventually found Upallo Arakhale (pronounced \\"are-ah-kha-lha\\".) They began working with the Magars who are best known for their bravery as the British Gurkha soldiers but have a historical/linguistic background that comes from Mongolia. In 1974, the Shepherds moved to Arakhale now known as \\"Upallo\\" or \\"Upper\\" Arakhale village and built a house at the top of the village which is still in use today. They lived in this remote region for months at a time with their two children Michael and Adina while they learned the language and provided humanitarian support. In 1978 Henry and Caroline Materna with Materna Productions came to Nepal to record several documentaries about Nepal for the Austria school system. One of the films produced was on the Shepherds living among the Magars in Arakhale. In 1982 Gary published \\"Life Among the Magars\\" after having met with the King of Nepal. After joining Redd Barna's save the children efforts for Nepal and learning the key skills necessary to tackle large road projects, they set off on a personal effort to raise $60,000 for a food-for-work road project that started the transformation of the region and has become a major artery for transportation which can now be seen on Google Maps. When the road was initially completed from Dhobadi up over the 5,000 ft pass to Arakhale it was named Barbara's Highway after Barbara, who died in 1991. Today Google Maps lists this as the Dhobadi - Bulingtar Rd as further fundraising efforts and eventual adoption by the government has extended this critical north/south artery from the Kali Gandaki River to the Pragatinagar Hwy. The transformation of a region by the dedication of a few is exhibited in the lack of malnutrition and survival rates of the Magars. Surveys of the area by Sister Gwen in the late 1960s showed a child mortality rate of ~60%. Today with sanitation practices established and basic hygiene and medicine that rate is now under 10%.

The film tells the story of two families caught up in the rise of Nazism in Germany before the start of World War II. Cinematographer Rudolph Maté employed shadows, shapes and camera angles to create the imagery. One notable scene shows Martin Schulz (Paul Lukas) descending a staircase awaiting his arrest by the Gestapo, while behind him the shadow of a web-like criss-cross of window panes is a visual metaphor for his own web of deceit. Plot Martin Schulz and Max Eisenstein (Morris Carnovsky) are good friends, German expatriate art dealers living in the United States. Martin's son Heinrich (Peter van Eyck) and Max's daughter Griselle (K.T. Stevens) are in love. When Martin and his wife return to Germany to find artwork, Griselle accompanies them to seek acting opportunities. Martin meets Baron von Freische (Carl Esmond), joins the Nazi Party and becomes an important government official. Martin eventually insists that Max stop writing to him as Max is a Jew. When Max sends him a hand-delivered letter to confirm he is not acting under duress, Martin makes it clear they are no longer friends. Griselle has been acting in Vienna under the stage name Stone when she lands the leading role in a play in Berlin. Before the premiere, the censor (Charles Halton) insists certain lines be cut (such as \\"Blessed are the peacemakers ...\\") as contrary to Nazi doctrine. On opening night, however, Griselle speaks the lines anyway. When the incensed censor makes her reveal her real name, it causes the antisemitic crowd to riot. The play's director hurries a still-defiant Griselle out of the theatre for her own safety. Finally realising her danger, she seeks help from Martin at his country estate, but he shuts the front door in her face. Several gunshots are heard. Martin's wife, Elsa (Mady Christians), is appalled by her husband's heartlessness. Max and Heinrich learn of Griselle's death in a short letter in which Martin states only that she is dead. Martin receives a telegram informing him that Max will resume writing to him and that Martin will understand his messages. Martin finds Max's first letter incomprehensible, as it seems to be in code. Martin is warned that receiving coded messages is illegal. When letters continue to arrive, Martin is forced to resign his party position. Elsa decides to take their children to Switzerland. Martin sends with her a letter appealing to Max to stop writing to him. The border guards see the letter, so Elsa destroys it before they can read it, raising suspicions further. Von Freische demands that Martin name his associates. When Martin persists in proclaiming his innocence, von Freische tells him that the Gestapo will question him. Martin is terrified. He considers suicide, but that night, he leaves his mansion by the front door. Immediately, he is illuminated by a flashlight. Back in San Francisco, a letter addressed to Martin is returned stamped \\"Address Unknown\\". A puzzled Max tells Heinrich that he had not resumed writing to his father. The reaction on Heinrich's face indicates that it was he who sent the letters.

By virtue of a special remainder granted to his father he was allowed to inherit the title of the Wilmot baronets of Osmaston. Wilmot married first Juliana Elizabeth Byron, the daughter of Admiral John Byron on 17 September 1783 at Pirbright. Julianna was the widow of her own cousin the Hon William Byron who had been MP for Morpeth. They had an only son before his wife died in 1788.

The couple had four other sons and two daughtersThe Gentleman's Magazine, p432, 1834 The Cope Estate and Litigation Sir Robert was made heir to the estate of General Sir John Cope, a successful veteran the Wars of the Spanish and Austrian Succession who had later fallen into personal misfortune following his defeat commanding the British force at the Battle of Prestonpans. Sir John had written in 1758 to Sir Robert's father, the first Osmaston baronet, of his intention to settle his estate on Sir Robert should his children by his mistress, Mrs Metcalf, die without issue. Sir John also wrote of abusive and malicious treatment by his family members which may have motivated his desire not to leave his property to his children or Cope relatives. In the event, Sir John devised to Sir Robert a life interest in his estate, with a remainder to Sir Robert's first and other sons in tail male. Sir John also settled on his son by Mrs Metcalf, John Metcalf Cope, a trust requiring the trustees to \\"raise, advance and pay any money... not exceeding £3,000 for the advancement of [John Metcalf Cope] in any business, art or profession, or any civil or military employment\\". The trustees laid out £1,000 to buy John an army commission and £93.2s.6d for arms, accoutrements and a war horse. Shortly thereafter John sold the commission, ran into debt and assigned all of his income in payment of the debt. John Cope brought a suit in the Court of Chancery against Sir Robert for the payment of the residue of the £3,000. Wilmot's lawyers argued that the terms of the trust had only required the trustees to outlay such funds as they thought proper to secure John Cope's professional advancement and that the trust was, in any event, of a discretionary nature. The Master of the Rolls Sir Thomas Sewell disagreed, adjudging the £3,000 to be a gift and made orders for the payment of the remaining £1906.17s.6d References - Category:People from Osmaston, Derby Category:Baronets in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom Category:1750s births Category:1834 deaths ","title":"Sir Robert Wilmot, 2nd Baronet"},{"id":"20760106","text":"Charlot was a French coxswain and Olympic champion.

Harlan published a variety of papers in the area of crop biodiversity, and publicized his concerns that modern agricultural practices were contributing to the extinction of older, traditional varieties of crops. Plant collecting As a scientist Harlan had two complementary research interests; the practical work of breeding economically important crops for desirable traits such as disease resistance or higher yield, and archaeobotany, the archeological study of the origins of crop domestication. Over the course of his career he carried out over forty plant- and seed-collecting expeditions to locations all of the world. Many of these expeditions were funded by the USDA, and the samples he brought back were added to USDA seed collections. Harlan was famous for the quality and quantity of the seed collections he brought back.Thompson, 2010 p192,193 Some of Harlan's collected seeds came to be used successfully in official USDA breeding programs. For example, in 1948 Harlan and his colleague Osman Tosun collected some wheat grains in a field in eastern Turkey (it was later discovered that the grains may actually have come from Iraq, having been brought to Turkey by recent immigrants). The sample was added to the USDA's seed bank as PI 178383. Fifteen years later in the early 1960s there was a severe epidemic of stripe rust, and hundreds of seed collections were tested for resistance to the rust. PI 178383 turned out to be resistant, not only to the stripe rust, but to several other wheat diseases as well, and it was added to breeding programs to produce new, resistant varieties, which were widely grown in America's northwestern states.Thompson, 2010 p192,193 Views on the origins of crop plant genetic diversity Harlan agreed broadly with Vavilov's idea that just a few geographical locations are crucial for generating much of the biodiversity on which plant breeders depend. However Harlan preferred the term center of diversity to Vavilov's term center of origin, because while the centers of crop diversity are known and mapped, the origins of crops cannot be definitely pinned down.

The four MPAs together encompass . The SMR protects all marine life within its boundaries. Fishing and take of all living marine resources is prohibited. History The Asilomar State Marine Reserve was established in September 2007 by the California Department of Fish and Game. It was one of 29 marine protected areas adopted during the first phase of the Marine Life Protection Act Initiative, which created a statewide network of marine protected areas along the California coastline. The reserve helps protect some of the central coast’s most heavily used and accessible areas near the shore while leaving most of the coastal waters open for continued fishing. Geography and natural features Asilomar SMR is located off the coast of the Monterey Peninsula, at the southern end of Monterey Bay. It covers an area of . The reserve is directly offshore from Asilomar State Beach. Asilomar SMR is the westernmost of four marine protected areas bordering the Monterey Peninsula. It is adjacent to the Pacific Grove Marine Gardens State Marine Conservation Area. Further east are the Lovers Point State Marine Reserve and the Edward F. Ricketts State Marine Conservation Area. All four areas are included within the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary. This marine protected area is bounded by the mean high tide line and straight lines connecting the following points in the order listed: , and . Habitat and wildlife The Monterey Peninsula includes extensive tidepools brimming with life. Its sandy beaches are used by pupping harbor seals, and dense kelp beds offshore provide shelter for sea otters. The Asilomar SMR provides habitat for a variety of marine life, and includes kelp forest, beach, rocky intertidal, and soft and hard bottom. Recreation and nearby attractions The natural environment and ocean resources of the Monterey Peninsula draw millions of visitors from around the world each year, including more than 60,000 scuba divers drawn by the area's ease of access, variety of wildlife, and kelp forestsDepartment of Fish and Game. \\"Central Coast Regional Profile\\", page 89.

Wade, founder of ServiceMaster Corp. The Wade Center serves primarily as a research center, attracting scholars from around the world. It holds at least one copy of every book written by the Wade authors, plus books, articles, and other materials about the various writers. It holds the world's fullest collection of the writings of Dorothy L. Sayers, including 30,000 pages of letters and documents both published and unpublished. For some of the Wade authors, collections of family documents are also available. The Center's museum features memorabilia and changing displays about the authors from its collection of books, letters, manuscripts, and artifacts. History and organization The center was founded in 1965 by Clyde S. Kilby. In 2001 a new building was completed at the edge of the Wheaton College campus to house the Wade Center, with an expanded reading room, classroom space, and an enlarged exhibits area. C. S. Lewis's dining-room table, which used to serve as desk space for visiting researchers, has been moved into the exhibits area near the Wade's own Lewis wardrobe. The Wade Center's second director, after Kilby, was Lyle W.

As such, these albums were wondrous romps through the slightly musically-disparate musical imaginations of its members. FIVE has Pollard and Todd Tobias amputating said toe, and the majority of the record is an over-indulgence of their prog-rock influences.

October 1725 in Eisenstadt, Kingdom of Hungary - May 13, 1799 in Breslau), was a German Talmudist. Biography Berlin studied under Ẓevi Hirsch Bialeh (Ḥarif), the rabbi of Halberstadt, at the latter's yeshivah. In 1755 Berlin moved to Breslau where he engaged in business. In 1793, when already advanced in years, he was elected to a rabbinical post, being appointed to succeed Isaac Joseph Te'omim as rabbi of Breslau. His election was marked by a dispute between the members of the community and the local maskilim, who had begun to organize themselves as a body and opposed Berlin, who, despite his love of peace, openly attacked their ideas. Berlin was elected by an overwhelming majority. Berlin was greatly admired, even by persons who differed with him in religious views. According to ḥasidic sources,Encyclopedia Judaica entry Berlin was sympathetically disposed toward that movement and extended a friendly welcome to one of its emissaries, Jacob Samson of Spitsevka. Further, Joel Brill, Aaron Wolfsohn, Judah Bensew, and many other Maskilim of Breslau often visited him to seek advice on scientific questions. As the Maskilim always carefully avoided wounding Berlin's religious feelings, he on his part met them half-way in many things. On the occasion of the Peace of Basel, for instance (May 17, 1795), he held a solemn service in the synagogue and exceptionally permitted the use of instrumental music, he himself delivering a discourse which was highly praised by the press (\\"Schlesische Zeitung\\", 1795, No. 59). Thus Berlin, conciliated the hostile elements of his congregation, and his death was mourned equally by all. Literary activity Rabbi AvChai Gaon Berlin's had the habit of annotating almost every book he read; mentioning the sources, or noting parallel passages and variant readings. Such glosses by Berlin have been published on the following books: the Bible (Pentateuch, Dyhernfurth, 1775; the other books, ib., 1807); the prayer-book, ed. Tiḳḳun Shelomoh (ib., 1806); Maimonides' Yad ha-Ḥazaḳah (ib., 1809); Alfasi (Presburg, 1836); the \\"Ḥinnuk\\", attributed to Aaron ha-Levi of Barcelona (Vienna, 1827); Malachi b. Jacob's methodology, \\"Yad Malachi\\" (Berlin, 1825); Elijah b. Moses de Vidas' book of morals, \\"Reshit Ḥokmah\\" (Dyhernfurth, 1811). Although the terse yet clear notes contained in these volumes reveal the immense learning and critical insight of their author, yet Berlin's lasting place of honor among the pioneers of Talmudic criticism rests on the following works, which treat principally of the Talmud: (1) \\"'Omer ha-Shikḥah\\" (Forgotten Sheaf), Königsberg, 1860, containing a large number of Halakot on the Talmud not noted by the codifiers; (2) \\"Oẓar Balum\\" (Full Treasure), in the edition of Jacob ibn Ḥabib's \\"'En Ya'aḳob\\", published at Wilna in 1899, tracing all the Talmudic passages quoted without sources in the different commentaries on the haggadic elements of the Talmud; (3) \\"Haggahot ha-Shas\\" (Notes to the Talmud), textual corrections and notes on the origin of parallel passages (Dyhernfurth, 1800, and in nearly all the editions of the Talmud); (4) \\"Hafla'ah Sheba-'Arakin\\" (Detached Orders) (part i., Breslau, 1830; part ii., Vienna, 1859), containing, as the title indicates, explanations and glosses on the 'Aruk; (5) \\"Ḥiddushe ha-Shas\\", novellæ on the Talmud (Königsberg, 1860, and in several editions of the Talmud); (6) \\"Minè Targuma\\" (Dessert Dishes), Breslau, 1831, remarks on the Targum Onkelos (the word \\"Targuma\\" signifying both \\"Targum\\" and \\"dessert\\", equivalent to the Greek τράγημα) and on the Palestinian Targum; (7) \\"Kashiyot Meyushab\\" (Difficulties Answered), Königsberg, 1860, treating of the Talmudic passages which end with, and written by Berlin in fourteen days; (8) \\"Rishon leẒion\\" (The First for Zion; Dyhernfurth, 1793; Vienna, 1793, and several times reprinted, the title being a play on, \\"Zion\\", and, \\"index\\"), a collection of indexes and parallel passages in the Midrash; (9) \\"She'elat Shalom\\" (Greeting of Peace), Dyhernfurth, 1786, a commentary on Aḥa of Shubḥa's \\"She'iltot.\\" Berlin's responsa collection and his commentary on the Tosefta deserve especial mention, though nothing is known of their fate.

He spent much of his career performing at the Metropolitan Opera where he sang in more than 1,000 performances, including several premieres, between 1901–1919. Excelling in the tenor buffo repertoire, Reiss was particularly associated with the roles of David in Wagner's Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg and Mime in Der Ring des Nibelungen, two roles he sang in numerous houses internationally.  Life  Early life and career= Reiss was born in Berlin and began his career as an actor. He appeared in several plays in Berlin and Strasbourg before deciding to pursue an operatic career under the encouragement of Bernhard Pollini and Ernestine Schumann-Heink. He proceeded to study singing with Wilhelm Vilmar and later Julius Lieben and Benno Stolzenberg. He made his professional operatic debut in 1897 as Peter Ivanov in Lortzing's Zar und Zimmermann at Königsberg. The following year he joined the opera house at Posen where he sang roles for only one season. In 1899 he began performing at the Wiesbaden Opera House where he performed roles until the fall of 1901 when he left to join the roster at the Metropolitan Opera. =Mid to late career= Reiss began his association with the Met touring throughout North America during October–December 1901. His first performance with the company was in Toronto on 12 October as Remendado in Bizet's Carmen. He made his first appearance at the company's house in New York City on December 23, 1901, as both the Shepherd and the Steersman in Wagner's Tristan und Isolde. This was the beginning of a long association with the Met for Reiss, who appeared with the company every year for the next eighteen years in mostly tenor buffo roles. Most notably he sang in several world premiers with the company including: Nick in Puccini's La fanciulla del West, the Broom-maker in Humperdinck's Königskinder, Nial in Horatio Parker's Mona, the offstage male lover in Puccini's Il Tabarro, Richard II of England in Reginald de Koven's The Canterbury Pilgrims and Ragueneau in Walter Damrosch's Cyrano. His farewell performance on 14 April 1919 – again as Remendado – was his 1,070th performance with the company. In addition to performances with the Met, Reiss returned periodically to Europe to appear in operas. From 1902–1907 he sang in several productions at the Bavarian State Opera. He also sang at the Hamburg State Opera (1904) and the Palais Garnier (1910). Reiss made his only other American appearances with the Chicago Grand Opera Company in 1911 and 1912. He appeared at the Royal Opera House in London at various times between 1902–1905 and 1924–1929, where he sang the roles of Valzacchi in Der Rosenkavalier, Mime in Der Ring des Nibelungen and David in Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg. After leaving the Met, he sang at the Volksoper Berlin (1923–25) and Berlin State Opera (1925–1930). Upon retiring from the stage in 1930, Reiss resettled in Nice, France, where he lived until his death in 1940.

His interest in automobiles began as a teenager. At age 14, he bought a partially finished 1948 Plymouth coupe with a chopped top. Knowing he was too young to own and drive a car, Hines's father discarded it while Ron was away at boarding school. At 16, Hines bought a four-door 1949 Mercury with a chopped top. Once again, his father was reluctant to let him keep the car. Hines was told he was still too young to drive legally in the state of New York. Elite education At Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts he roomed with John Cox, a car enthusiast from Terre Haute, Indiana. Hines's love of cars was solidified when Cox showed him a Rod & Custom magazine article featuring a 1934 Ford five-window coupe. In 1963, Hines graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia with a degree in mechanical engineering. In his senior year he met Ennis Dawson, a local drag racer who became a lifelong friend. Attending local drag races with Dawson rekindled Hines's passion for cars. As a result, he bought a 1953 Studebaker coupe and installed a 364-cubic-inch Buick motor and a four-speed transmission. After engaging in a number of dangerous street races, Hines entered his car in sanctioned National Hot Rod Association (NHRA) meets at the Strato Rods Dragway on the McGuire Air Force Base in Wrightstown, New Jersey. After graduating from the University of Pennsylvania, Hines was hired by General Motors as a quality control engineer at the manufacturer's Trenton, New Jersey facility. In 1966 he purchased a 1933 five-window Ford coupe hot rod. He still owns the Ford, which has been transformed several times into a trophy-winning drag racer, a wild street machine, and a classic street rod. The 1933 Ford currently has a detuned 302-cubic-inch Formula 5000 racing engine installed from one of the Lola T332 road racers that Benny Scott drove for Black American Racers, Inc. in 1975. Black American Racers Association In 1972 Hines met Leonard W. Miller, whose vision was to organize the black racing community into a national association. Hines, Miller, Eugene Gadson, and Charlie Singleton founded the Black American Racers Association (BARA). Hines was BARA's secretary for the five years of its existence, responsible for publishing its monthly newsletter. In 1974, Hines wrote half of the articles contained in the ’74 Black Racers Yearbook. The annual covered pre-World War II black racing history, as well as practical articles for black racers on how to obtain sponsorship. Several Fortune 500 companies placed advertisements in the yearbook. Road racing engineer In 1973, Hines became a crew member of Miller's road racing team, with Benny Scott as driver of a redesigned Tui Formula Super Vee (FSV). The team was sponsored by Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corporation (Viceroy Cigarettes). Hines was an engineer for two other BAR drivers in the 1970s - Randy Bethea and Tommy Thompson in Sports Car Club of America (SCCA) - as well as for International Motor Sports Association (IMSA) road racing entries. The Lola chassis Hines tuned and set up for the team were the T-324 and T-620. Hines traveled to road circuits such as Lime Rock Park, Road Atlanta, Watkins Glen International, Mid-Ohio, and Road America. During this period, Hines appeared on a number of television and radio shows on the East Coast with Leonard W. Miller and Benny Scott.Tommy Thompson, Leonard W. Miller and Ron Hines at the Milwaukee Mile, September 1978 Keys to the city In the spring of 1974, mayor Maynard Jackson gave Hines, Miller, and Benny Scott the keys to the city of Atlanta in a ceremony at City Hall, at which he also declared April 20 Black American Racers Day. A photograph of the team appeared in newspapers and periodicals throughout the United States. The same photo was published in Miller's autobiography Silent Thunder and in Andrew L. Schupack's book Formula Vee/Super Vee-Racing, History, and Chassis/Engine Prep. Trenton Speedway tragedy After the 1975 season BAR lost its sponsorship, along with other Viceroy teams, due to internal union pressures at Brown & Williamson Tobacco. BAR was sidelined for two years. Leonard W. Miller commenced a second effort in FSV racing after African American driver Tommy Thompson persuaded him to continue the BAR vision in 1977. Ron Hines and Ken Wright were key technical elements of the team. Hines helped it advance to an SCCA Northeast Championship at Pocono Raceway in Pennsylvania. On September 27, 1978, Tommy Thompson was killed in a crash exiting the fourth turn at the 1.5-mile Trenton Speedway, which is distinguished by its dogleg before turn 3. At this Mini-Indy (the new name for FSV) event, a competitor abruptly stopped in front of Thompson due to a catastrophic mechanical failure. Thompson never regained consciousness and died less than a week later. Second mission After a two-year recovery, Ron Hines served as crew chief of the BAR dirt track team in 1980-81, with Bruce Driver as the driver. The team won ten races at speedways at Flemington Speedway and East Windsor Speedway in New Jersey. Bruce Driver became the first black driver to achieve ten victories in each track's history. BAR continued to aim for professional road racing and the Indianapolis 500, but sponsorship proposals presented to many Fortune 500 companies were declined.Ron Hines driving his 1933 Ford 5-window coupe street rod, circa 1974. Benny Scott is in the passenger seat. Retirement Over the years, Ron Hines served as an instructor at the Granville Academy. He instructed and mentored minority urban youth in improving their mathematical skills for preparation as future technicians or engineers. During this period, he has owned many specialty cars. In addition to his 1933 five-window Ford coupe, he owns a 1975 Chevrolet Monza with a Ron Whitney Chevrolet small-block V-8 engine coupled with a four-speed transmission. Ron Hines currently organizes the annual specialty car and motorcycle show at St. John's Baptist Church in Ewing Township, New Jersey. The show takes place in July in a park adjoining the church and is open to all years, makes, and models.

Description Shells of Mya truncata can reach a size of about .MarLIN-The Marine Life Information NetworkWoRMS These bivalves are similar to the soft- shell clams (Mya arenaria), but usually they are smaller. Moreover, their shells are less elongated. Valves are rounded in the anterior end and truncated in the posterior end, with a large gape allowing the passage of an extensible siphon that can reach four times the length of the shell. The siphon can be retracted completely into the shell. The two valves are triangular and convex, but the right valve is more convex than the left one. The siphon is protected by a horny sheath and it is provided with small tentacles at its end. The outer surface of the valves is covered with concentric growth lines. It is whitish, while the outermost layer of the valves (periostracum) may be yellowish, light olive or dark brown. The hinge of the left valve shows a spoon-shaped projection, to which the ligaments are attached. The pallial sinus is deep and broad.Marine Species Identification Biology Reproduction is sexual, the gametes of both sexes being expelled into the water, then the free larvae attach themselves to rocks. These clams filter the sea water in order to feed on bacteria, diatoms and larvae of invertebrates. In some years, the reproductive cycle fails completely. These clams are the main food of the walrusses (Odobenus rosmarus). They feed on these clams by raking the mud with their tusks and sieving out the clams. Distribution and habitat This species is widespread over the Arctic seas and extends to the Bay of Biscay, to the West Atlantic coast and to Sakhalin on the Pacific coast. It has been reported also in the waters around Japan.Catalogue of life Mya truncata lives from the lower shore up to depths of 70 m, burrowed in sand or sandy mud.

CTC is a coalition- based prevention operating system that uses a public health approach to prevent youth problem behaviors such as violence, delinquency, school drop out and substance abuse.Hawkins JD, Catalano RF, & Associates. 1992. Communities That Care: Action for drug abuse prevention. San Francisco: Jossey-Bass, Inc. Using strategic consultation, training, and research-based tools, CTC is designed to help community stakeholders and decision makers understand and apply information about risk and protective factors, and programs that are proven to make a difference in promoting healthy youth development, in order to most effectively address the specific issues facing their community's youth.Fagan, A.A., Hawkins, J.D., Catalano, R.F. (2008). Using community epidemiologic data to improve social settings: The Communities That Care prevention system. In M. Shin (Ed.) Toward positive youth development: Transforming schools and community programs (pp. 292–312). Oxford; New York: Oxford University Press. right Developed by Drs. J. David Hawkins and Richard Catalano at the University of Washington's Social Development Research Group (SDRG), CTC's principal strategy, the Social Development Strategy (right), focuses on strengthening protective factors that can buffer young people from problem behaviors and promote positive youth development. CTC is grounded in rigorous research from social work, public health, psychology, education, medicine, criminology, and organizational development. It engages all community members who have a stake in healthy futures for young people and sets priorities for action based on community challenges and strengths. Clear, measurable outcomes are tracked over time to show progress and ensure accountability.  Research base  Public health understanding of risk and protective factors = The field of public health has developed a systematic methodology for understanding and effectively preventing health problems. Through rigorous research, the etiology of diseases has been documented, and the factors contributing to those diseases have been identified. Once these contributing factors are understood, careful study and application of approaches to amend those factors have demonstrated reductions in the disease burden. For example, heart disease has been one of the primary causes of death among American adults. Research shows, however, that adequate exercise, a healthy diet, and avoidance of smoking can help to prevent heart disease. These behaviors are considered protective factors, just as smoking, high blood pressure, and a family history of heart disease are considered risk factors for poor heart health. Since the late 1970s, researchers in a variety of disciplines (for example, criminology, sociology, social work, psychology, community psychology, education) have been applying this public health approach to the study of the healthy development of young people. This work has created a field called prevention science, which identifies the factors that contribute to the healthy development of children and youth (protective factors) and the factors that impede that development (risk factors). = Cause: Longitudinal studies of youth development = Protective Factors and the Social Development Model. The prevention of health and behavior problems in young people requires, at its foundation, the promotion of the factors required for positive development. Research shows that five basic factors promote positive social development: opportunities for developmentally appropriate involvement, skills, recognition for effort, improvement and achievement, strong social bonds, and clear, consistent standards for behavior. All children need opportunities to be actively involved with positive adults and peers, the skills to participate and succeed in social, school, and civic settings, and recognition for their efforts, improvements, and accomplishments. When young people are provided with opportunities, skills, and recognition, they develop strong social bonds, that is connections with and commitment to the families, schools, and communities that provided them. When families, schools, and communities communicate to young people clear standards for behavior, those who feel bonded, emotionally connected, invested in the group, will follow those standards that promote health and success. These five factors are protective factors that promote positive development in young people (Hawkins & Weis, 1985), and form the basis for the Social Development Model. Risk Factors for Adolescent Problem Behavior Chart Risk Factors. Research has also identified risk factors that can interrupt the process of positive social development. High quality longitudinal studies have identified risk factors in neighborhoods and communities, families, schools, and peer groups, as well as in individuals themselves.Biglan, A., Brennan, P. A., Foster, S. L., & Holder, H. D. (2004). Helping adolescents at risk: Prevention of multiple problem behaviors. New York: Guilford Press.Hawkins, J.D., Herrenkohl, T.I., Farrington, D.P., Brewer, D., Catalano, R.F., Harachi, T.W., Cothern, L. (2000). Predictors of youth violence. OJJDP Juvenile Justice Bulletin, April. These factors increase the probability of delinquency, violence, substance abuse, teen pregnancy, dropping out of school, and other behavior problems in young people. The risk factors shown in the risk factor chart (right) have been found in at least two high-quality studies to predict later health and behavior problems in young people. Many of these risk factors predict multiple problems. For example, the risk factor of “Poor Family Management” has been shown to predict five youth problem behaviors: substance abuse, delinquency, teen pregnancy, school drop-out, and violence. Providing effective parent training programs in a community, therefore, could potentially impact all five of these undesirable outcomes. = Intervention: Testing effectiveness of interventions = The identification of risk and protective factors provides the foundation for advances in preventing adolescent health and behavior problems. Prevention scientists have rigorously tested programs and policies that address these risk and protective factors in studies funded largely by the National Institutes of Health, and an increasing number and range of effective prevention approaches have now been identified. By 2004, 56 tested and effective programs were available in the United States that have been demonstrated to reduce involvement in problem behaviors and/or increase positive outcomes for youth. These 56 effective programs and policies are summarized in CTC's Prevention Strategies Guide at https://www.communitiesthatcare.net/Prevention%20Strategies%20Guide/introduction.pdf. Sixteen of these programs have been tested at least twice with replicated findings and have been designated as Blueprint model programs,Elliott, D. S. (1997). Blueprints for Violence Prevention. Boulder, CO: University of Colorado, Institute of Behavioral Science, Center for the Study and Prevention of Violence. which, if rigorously followed, will significantly reduce youth violence and substance abuse. Programs range from prenatal (for example, Olds, 1997Olds, D.L. (1997). The Prenatal/Early Infancy Project: Fifteen years later. In G.W. Albee & T. Bullotta (Eds.), Primary prevention works (pp.41–67). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications.) and early childhood interventions (for example, Reid et al., 2001), to community policies related to alcohol (e.g. Holder et al., 2000), to school-based curricula that teach youth social and emotional skills that will help them navigate life (e.g. Botvin at al, 2003, Eisen at al., 2002, and Grossman et al., 1997). = Systems: Researching systems change in states and communities = Prevention scientists understand that the final task arising from these research findings is the application of proven prevention programs, policies and strategies in the real world in order to enhance youth development on the ground in communities. In collaboration with communities and state and federal governments, researchers are studying the impact that prevention science can have on the effectiveness of prevention efforts within those systems. [link to History section of this article, to be added]  Description  Five Phases = Five Phases of CTC Communities That Care guides the community's prevention efforts through a five-phase process which includes: 1) Get Started—assessing community readiness to undertake collaborative prevention efforts; 2) Get Organized—getting a commitment to the CTC process from community leaders and forming a diverse and representative prevention coalition; 3) Develop a Profile—using epidemiologic data to assess prevention needs; 4) Create a Plan—choosing tested and effective prevention policies, practices, and programs based on assessment data; and 5) Implement and Evaluate—implementing the new strategies with fidelity, in a manner congruent with the programs' theory, content, and methods of delivery, and evaluating progress over time. CTC activities are planned and carried out by the CTC Community Board, a prevention coalition of community stakeholders who work together to promote positive youth outcomes. Board members participate in a series of six CTC training workshops in which they build their coalition and learn the skills needed to install the CTC system. Working through the five phases of CTC provides the opportunity to increase communication, collaboration, and ownership among community members and service providers invested in healthy youth development. Phase One: Getting Started. With technical assistance provided by a CTC trainer, a community catalyst and small group of advisors assess community readiness to undertake collaborative prevention efforts, and identify the stakeholders who need to be involved. Key activities in this phase include recruiting key leaders to serve as champions of the effort, obtaining school district support to conduct a youth survey to provide epidemiological data on risk, protection, and youth behaviors, and hiring a coordinator to manage CTC activities. Phase Two: Organizing, Introducing, Involving. In Phase Two a diverse and representative prevention coalition is formed. Specific tasks for this phase include involving and educating stakeholders who were identified in Phase One; developing a vision for the future of the community's children, and putting an organizational structure in place to help the community move toward the vision. The first two CTC trainings are implemented in this phase: the Key Leader Orientation (KLO) and the Community Board Orientation (CBO). These trainings introduce prevention science to community stakeholders, and help community members create an appropriate structure for the Community Board. Phase Three: Developing a Community Profile. This is the data collection phase, including a comprehensive community assessment of adolescent behaviors and current prevention services. This phase usually requires administration of the CTC Youth Survey . Members of the Risk and Protective Factor Assessment Work Group participate in the Community Assessment Training, in which they learn about key data sources for risk and protective factors (such as the student survey) and how to analyze the data. In communities already using the CTC Youth Survey, this training is tailored to help the work group interpret survey results and identify elevated risk factors, depressed protective factors, and problem behaviors prevalent among youth in the community. From this analysis, the work group recommends priority risk and protective factors for focused attention by the CTC Board. The second component of the community profile is an assessment of current community programs, policies, and resources that address the prioritized risk and protective factors. The Resource Assessment workgroup is trained in assessment procedures during the Community Resource Assessment Training. The goals of the resource assessment are to identify existing evidence-based programs that address the priority factors, discern the gaps in existing program delivery, and recommend where new programs or policies are needed. Phase Four: Creating a Community Action Plan. During the fourth phase of CTC, the results of the assessment process are reviewed by the full Community Board, and a community action plan is developed. The Community Plan Training (CPT) is provided to Community Boards during this phase. During this training, Board members select prevention policies and programs that target their prioritized risk factors to fill gaps in current prevention services. The CTC Prevention Strategies Guide is a tool used during this process. It describes prevention programs that have been demonstrated in at least one high quality research trial to be effective in changing risk, protection, and problem behaviors. Once program choices are made, CPT participants are trained to write an action plan that sets clear, measurable goals regarding anticipated outcomes, and also develop an evaluation plan. Phase Five: Implementing and Evaluating the Community Action Plan. In this phase, the CTC Board implements selected strategies, and evaluates progress over time. Board members and staff for the selected preventive programs attend the final CTC training workshop, the Community Plan Implementation Training (CPIT), which emphasizes the importance of implementing prevention programs with fidelity; that is, ensuring that the programs' content, dosage, and manner of delivery adhere to the protocols identified by program developers. Participants also learn methods for tracking implementation progress, assessing desired changes in participants, and using this information to adjust implementation as needed to fulfill program objectives. CTC is intended as an ongoing process. The process of monitoring implementation progress and community level changes in risk, protection and youth outcomes is repeated every two years. Based on a review of these data, CTC boards revise their action plans as needed. = Essential components = The CTC system is collaborative, proactive, science-based, and data driven, and provides structure, tools, training and technical assistance for coalitions. Collaborative. CTC uses a coalition approach to address issues at the community level. The coalition will include a diverse group of stakeholders concerned with youth development (youth-serving agency staff, school representatives, health professionals, city leaders, law enforcement, United Way, other funding entities, neighborhood groups, business people, parents, media representatives, faith community members, youth, etc.) in applying prevention science principles to decisions affecting the community's youth. By providing a setting and common language for all stakeholders to discuss prevention, the model ensures that all voices in the community are heard and respected. Proactive. Rather than reacting to problems once they have already occurred, CTC focuses on strengthening protections and decreasing risks in order to promote healthy youth development and decrease the likelihood of problem behaviors. Science based. CTC is grounded in rigorous research from a variety of disciplines, including public health, sociology, psychology, criminology, and community psychology. This research has identified the predictors of youth problem behaviors, developed epidemiologic assessment tools for measuring those predictors in a community, and tested programs that work in addressing those predictors. Data driven. The CTC system ensures local control of decisions based on local data and needs assessments, and flexibility to implement actions specific to the priorities identified by community members. The CTC system provides tools for measuring levels of risk and protective factors, selecting priority factors on which to focus a strategic plan, selecting appropriate prevention responses, and tracking progress toward desired changes in priority risk factors. a. The CTC Youth Survey is the primary tool for needs assessment and monitoring. This is a confidential, schoolwide survey for students appropriate for Grades 6-12, that measures a majority of the risk and protective factors identified to predict youth problem behaviors. Coalition members use survey results from students in their community as well as community archival data to prioritize risk and protective factors for attention. The survey is re-administered every 2 years in order to monitor progress over time. b. Effective program selection is another element of the data-driven process. Coalition members review policies and programs that have been tested and proven effective in addressing their priority factors. They consider the suitability of each program to the community's circumstances, and select prevention responses most likely to be successful in that environment. Information on program effectiveness is summarized in menus of effective programs, for example CTC's Prevention Strategies Guide and The Blueprint for Violence Prevention list of effective programs. c. Monitoring of program implementation is the third element of the data-driven process. Throughout the implementation cycle of each prevention program or strategy, coalitions collect data to ensure that the program is delivered with fidelity to the original program design. This monitoring information is important, because without close replication, the effectiveness of these programs can be compromised (see, for example, Elliot & Mihalic, 2004). Monitoring implementation is also a management tool for identifying challenges that can be addressed before they lead to program failure. Structure and tools. The CTC structure includes six training workshops and additional tools that help walk community members through each stage of the process. Training manuals are composed of modules that provide comprehensive information, exercises, and guidelines for each stage of the process. The Milestones and Benchmarks checklist functions as a roadmap for the entire effort. Milestones are major tasks that must be accomplished in each phase of CTC, and benchmarks provide essential steps toward achieving each of these major tasks. Booklets are available to help local leaders evaluate and address community readiness issues before initiating the process, and to explain the system to key leaders and potential board members. Training and technical assistance. Successful CTC efforts include high-quality training and technical assistance from experienced and certified facilitators. Feinberg et al. (2004), Gomez et al. (2005) and Greenberg et al. (2005)Greenberg, M.T., Feinberg, M.E., & Osgood, W.O. (2005). Testing a community prevention focused model of coalition functioning and sustainability. Editors: Stockwell, T., Gruenewald, P., Toumbourou, J., & Loxley, W. Preventing Harmful Substance Use: The Evidence Base for Policy and Practice. studied the functioning and sustainability of CTC coalitions in Pennsylvania, and found three factors strongly related to effective coalition function: community organizational and motivational readiness, initial training, and ongoing technical assistance (TA). The Pennsylvania study also documented that the sustainability of the effort was predicted by the prevention knowledge of coalition members, the quality of coalition functioning, and their fidelity to the CTC model. = Online CTC materials = The Center for Substance Abuse Prevention provides all CTC materials free of charge at www.communitiesthatcare.net .

The CTC system guides community groups to choose and implement appropriate tested and effective programs, policies, and practices in families, schools, and communities (see the CTC Prevention Strategies Guide and the Blueprints for Violence Prevention website). These programs have shown significant effects on minimizing youths' risky behaviors and enhancing positive choices. Evaluation resultsEvaluation of implementation= The CYDS evaluated community efforts to faithfully implement (1) the core principles of the CTC prevention system, and (2) tested and effective prevention programs with respect to content and delivery specifications. The study found that CTC communities achieved high implementation fidelity at the system and program levels when supported by training and technical assistance in CTC. Control communities did not achieve these things. At the start of the CYDS, CTC and control communities did not differ in their use of a science-based approach to prevention. (NIH Submission # 46898) By the third year of the intervention, key leaders in CTC communities reported a higher stage of adoption of science-based prevention, relative to control communities. They also were willing to provide greater funding for prevention. Differences were sustained one year after the implementation phase of the trial ended. At this point, key leaders in CTC communities also reported significantly stronger community norms against adolescent drug use. The CTC Milestones and Benchmarks Survey was used to track progress in the implementation of core components of the CTC prevention system. In each year of the intervention, CTC communities enacted an average of 90% of the key features of the CTC prevention system, including developing a community board, prioritizing risk and protective factors, selecting tested and effective preventive interventions from the Communities That Care Prevention Strategies Guide, implementing selected implementation programs with fidelity, and periodically assessing risk and protective factors and child and adolescent well-being through surveys of students. One year after the implementation phase of the trial had ended, eleven of 12 CTC coalitions continued to operate in CTC communities. These coalitions continued to implement key CTC milestones and benchmarks to a significantly greater degree than coalitions in control communities, even without ongoing study-provided support. Control communities did not make this progress over time in completing CTC milestones and benchmarks, implementing scientifically proven prevention programs, and monitoring program impacts. Over the course of the trial, the 12 CTC communities demonstrated faithful implementation of 17 different school-based, after-school, and parenting interventions selected from a menu of 39 possible tested and effective programs for 5th through 9th grade students contained in the Communities That Care Prevention Strategies Guide. On average, CTC communities implemented 2.75 tested and effective prevention programs per year (range: 1-5). High rates of fidelity were achieved consistently over time with respect to adherence to program objectives and core components (average = 91-94% per year) and dosage (number, length, and frequency of intervention sessions; average = 93-95% per year). Faithful implementation continued two years after study support ended. CTC coalitions still offered significantly more tested and effective intervention programs, implemented them with high quality, monitored implementation to a significantly greater degree, and reached significantly more children and parents, compared to control coalitions. =Impact evaluations= * Pennsylvania The Prevention Research Center at Pennsylvania State University has been studying the process and impact of the statewide CTC system since its inception in the early 1990s. Summaries of their findings will be posted here soon. * Community Youth Development Study The Community Youth Development Study (CYDS) is the first controlled experimental trial of the Communities That Care system. Twenty-four communities in 7 states agreed to participate in the study. These communities consisted of 12 matched pairs which had equivalent demographics and equivalent levels of youth risks and problem behaviors at the start of the study. Communities were randomly assigned to intervention or control conditions. The intervention communities received funding to hire a full-time community coordinator, who formed a community coalition that subsequently participated in the full cycle of CTC trainings. These communities then created community action plans, and were awarded up to $75,000 per year for the next four years to implement the tested, effective prevention strategies selected as part of the action planning process. Control communities continued prevention business as usual. Hawkins et al. 2008, reported finding no significant differences between CTC and control communities in average levels of community-targeted risks among students in fifth grade, prior to the start of the CTC programs. By the third year of the intervention, key leaders in CTC communities reported a higher stage of adoption of science-based prevention, relative to control communities, . They also were willing to provide greater funding for prevention. Differences were sustained one year after the implementation phase of the trial ended. At this point, key leaders in CTC communities also reported significantly stronger community norms against adolescent drug use. The longitudinal panel youth in CTC and control communities reported similar levels of targeted risk in Grade 5, when the intervention began, but targeted risk exposure grew more slowly for youth in CTC communities between Grade 5 and Grade 10. Significantly lower levels of targeted risk were first reported by CTC panel youth 1.67 years into the intervention, in Grade 7, and have continued to be reported by CTC panel youth through Grade 10. Panel youth from CTC and control communities also reported similar levels of delinquency, alcohol use, and cigarette smoking at Grade 5 baseline. However, between Grades 5 and 10, CTC had significant effects on the initiation of these behaviors by youth. Significant differences in the initiation of delinquency were first observed in the spring of Grade 7. Panel youth from CTC communities were 25% less likely than panel youth from control communities to initiate delinquent behavior, and they remained so in Grade 8. Significantly lower delinquency initiation rates were sustained through Grade 10, when panel youth from CTC communities were 17% less likely to initiate delinquency than panel youth from control communities. Preventive effects on alcohol use and cigarette use were first observed in the spring of Grade 8, 2.67 years after intervention programs were implemented. Grade 8 youth from CTC communities were 32% less likely to initiate alcohol use, and 33% less likely to initiate cigarette smoking than Grade 8 youth from control communities (Hawkins et al., 2009). Preventive effects were again sustained through Grade 10 when CTC panel youth were 29% less likely to initiate alcohol use and 28% less likely to initiate cigarette smoking than panel youth from control communities. Differences in the initiation of delinquency, alcohol use, and cigarette smoking from Grade 5 through Grade 10 led to cumulatively lower rates of initiation over time: 62% of 10th-grade youth in the panel from CTC communities had engaged in delinquent behavior compared with 70% of 10th-grade youth in the panel from control communities; 67% vs. 75% had initiated alcohol use; and 44% vs. 52% had smoked cigarettes. (insert illustration here). CTC also significantly reduced the prevalence of youth problem behaviors in Grade 8 and Grade 10. In Grade 8, the prevalence of alcohol use in the past month, binge drinking (five or more drinks in a row) in the past two weeks, and the variety of delinquent behaviors committed in the past year were all significantly lower in CTC panel youth compared to control community panel youth. The CYDS also found significant effects of CTC in reducing the prevalence of cigarette use in the past month and delinquent behavior and violence in the past year in the spring of Grade 10. Child Trends Research Brief: An overview of the Communities That Care system and up to date research information is available from Child Trends with an in depth research brief that can be found here . Other research is also available through the Child Trends Website. Conclusions: CTC's theory of change hypothesizes that it takes from 2 to 5 years to observe community-level effects on risk factors, and 5 or more years to observe effects on adolescent delinquency or substance use [insert CTC timeline graphic]. These early findings from the first randomized community trial of CTC are promising, suggesting that CTC is slowing the usual developmental increase in adolescents' risk exposure. Longer follow-up measurements are needed to determine if CTC can significantly reduce community levels of delinquency and drug use as hypothesized. The Community Youth Development Study will collect additional data from these students in 2007 and 2008. These data will allow tests of CTC's effects on community rates of delinquency and substance use initiation among young people through the spring of grade 9, almost 5 years after CTC was introduced in the intervention communities and approximately years after communities began implementing tested and effective prevention programs chosen through the CTC system.

Fingerpori is a Finnish comic strip written and drawn by Pertti Jarla. It started in Helsingin Sanomat in February 2007, and is currently syndicated in Satakunnan Kansa, Aamulehti, Karjalainen, Keskisuomalainen, Turun Sanomat and Etelä-Saimaa. Several strip collections in album format have also been published. The main setting of the strip is Fingerpori, an imaginary Finnish small town. The main character in the strip is the eyeglass-wearing Heimo Vesa, but other citizens also appear, such as the brash-mouthed café worker Rivo-Riitta. As well as the Fingerpori residents, the strip has included characters such as the Pope, The Phantom, Spider-Man, Adolf Hitler, Kimi Räikkönen and Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim. A few strips, featuring Jesus, have caused controversy in some circles.Obnoxious, droll, tasteless: We can deal with the double entendres in Fingerpori, but Jesus is too much. Siikavirta, Pekka. Turunsanomat.fi, 2 April 2008, accessed 19 August 2008. The humour in Fingerpori is largely verbal and is often based on (mostly untranslatable) wordplay and puns. For instance, Vesa works at the multidisciplinary research center Fingerpoli, where \\"girls with pigtails\\" is a result of a bungled stem cell experiment.Jarla, Pertti. Fingerporin naamakirja 2. Arktinen Banaani, Helsinki 2014. P. 50. Jokes are often also based on allusions, such as recurrent jokes about the skull ring of The Phantom. Besides this, the strips often have an absurdist element. According to Jarla, his original vision for Fingerpori was to create a milieu of an \\"East German Duckburg\\", but the current Fingerpori is more like a Finnish town still stuck to the 1970s as in Aki Kaurismäki's films. Although Fingerpori contains some political satire, the author claims it is not a political comic strip.HS's new comic strip Fingerpori is its creator's naïvistic view of the world. Römpötti, Harri. HS.fi, 2 April 2008, accessed 19 August 2008. Publication history The original form of Fingerpori was a strip by the same author called Karl-Barks-Stadt, which won the third prize in the strip category of a Nordic comics contest at the Kemi comics days in 2006. According to the judging board, Karl-Barks-Stadt was \\"a really well drawn strip, whose unexpressionistic characters give a lively life to the joke told by the strip\\".Results of the Nordic comics contest 2006. Kemi comics centre, accessed 19 August 2008. After winning the prize, Karl-Barks-Stadt appeared in November 2006 in Ilta-Sanomat as the Finnish strip of the month.Get Jarla to Hesari! Koivurinne, Wade. Kvaak.fi, 20 January 2007, accessed 19 August 2008. Karl-Barks-Stadt was Jarla's first continuous comic strip, he had previously only made short one-time strips to the humour magazine Pahkasika and worked as a graphic designer in the corporate world. The name of the strip is a portmanteau, referring to the East German Karl-Marx-Stadt (currently known as Chemnitz) and the cartoonist Carl Barks. In the turn of the year 2006–2007, Helsingin Sanomat was looking for a new Finnish comic strip to its pages, and the newspaper's comics editor Eeva Lepistö turned her attention to Karl-Barks- Stadt. The strip, now renamed Fingerpori, started appearing in Helsingin Sanomat on 5 February 2007. It replaced Tiger, having appeared in the newspaper for over 40 years, whose creator Bud Blake had retired in 2004.A farewell to Tiger. Römpötti, Harri. HS.fi, 4 February 2007, accessed 19 August 2008. Fingerpori is comprehensively distributed in major provincial newspapers. Literally, fingerpori is a thimble, but fingerporillinen is a proverbial small amount of alcohol, and Pori is a Finnish town. In April 2008, the comics publisher Arktinen Banaani published the first Fingerpori album.New publications in spring 2008. Arktinen Banaani, accessed 19 August 2008. The album, like the whole strip, received mixed response. In Helsingin Sanomat, professor Olli Alho criticised Fingerpori because its humour is mostly based on homonym puns, which do not interest the mature reader. He compared the strip's \\"view of the body and the soul\\" to the grotesque realism defined by Mikhail Bakhtin and its representatives, such as François Rabelais.A Fingerpori of cartoon comedy: Pentti Jarla's grotesque world. Alho, Olli. HS.fi, 12 April 2008, accessed 19 August 2008. In contrast, the Plaza.fi Kaista review praised Fingerpori as \\"the best new Finnish strip for a long time\\",Fingerpori by Pertti Jarla (****). Junni, Tatu. Plaza.fi, 21 April 2008, Kynämies Oy.

It was sold to the band Scandal, who released it in 1984 on their Warrior album. Journey also recorded and released the song and Scandal was given a large settlement in the legal aftermath. Previously intended for Journey's Frontiers album, it was pulled from the album within days of recording in favor of songs \\"Back Talk\\" and \\"Troubled Child\\". The song was eventually released as a single (which reached No. 9 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in March 1985) and appeared on the soundtrack to the 1985 film Vision Quest. It also reached No. 3 on the Mainstream Rock chart. The song's lyrical theme focuses on young people and the hope and future they all have in front of them. The song was featured later as a bonus track on the 2006 CD reissue of Frontiers. The first individual outside the band to hear the song was sixteen-year-old Kenny Sykaluk of Rocky River, Ohio, who was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis. His mother wrote a letter to the band telling them about her son's terminal condition, and how big a fan he was of Journey. The band flew to his hospital bedside in Cleveland, Ohio at the request of the Make a Wish Foundation. Along with a Walkman containing the new track, the band also brought Kenny a football helmet signed by the San Francisco 49ers and an autographed Journey platinum record award. The experience of playing the song for Kenny left Steve Perry and Jonathan Cain deeply affected. Perry said, \\"As soon as I walked out of the hospital room, I lost it. Nurses had to take me to a room by myself.\\" On the band's episode of VH1's Behind the Music, Cain broke down in tears recalling the event, remarking that \\"children should not have to live with that kind of pain\\". Kenny died the next day, with the Walkman still in his hand. The song brought life into perspective for the band and left them humbled. Neal Schon said that Kenny's death affected Journey by making them re-evaluate the issues that were causing friction inside the band itself. In honor of Kenny Sykaluk, the band used the song as their opener for the Raised on Radio Tour. Scandal version The song was also recorded by American rock band Scandal in 1984. The song was featured on their album Warrior.

Constructed between 1846 and 1847, it was designed by British-born architect Frank Wills. St. Anne's Chapel is a National Historic Site of Canada. History St. Anne's Chapel was built at the direction of John Medley soon after his arrival in Canada in 1845 as the first Bishop of the Anglican Diocese of Fredericton. Its architect, Frank Wills, was brought to Canada by Bishop Medley from Exeter, England in 1846 to work on Christ Church Cathedral. Located at the corner of Westmorland and George Streets in the west end of the city, St. Anne's was intended as a chapel of ease in which services could be held until construction of the Cathedral was completed. The chapel's cornerstone was laid in May 1846 and it was consecrated on March 18, 1847. Bishop Medley himself paid most of the construction costs. Christ Church Cathedral was completed in 1853 and in 1854 the chapel became Christ Church (Parish) Church, although it continued to be commonly known as St. Anne's. With the completion next to it of a much larger church building in 1962, St. Anne's became a chapel once more. St. Anne's Chapel of Ease was declared a National Historic Site of Canada in 1989. The designation encompasses only the 1847 chapel, not the adjoining 1962 structure. Architectural significance St. Anne's Chapel in 1850, three years after its completion The Lychgate at St Anne's ChapelSt. Anne's Chapel was the first church in North America constructed according to the principles of the Ecclesiological Society, with which both Bishop Medley and the architect, Frank Wills, had been associated before coming to Canada. As such, it was intended by Bishop Medley to be a model for future parish churches in New Brunswick. It has been authoritatively described as the finest Gothic Revival church of its size and kind in North America. The hammer-dressed grey sandstone building, which measures only 74 by 21 feet, comprises a nave and a chancel with a carved butternut screen. The interior roof, pulpit, altar and open bench pews are also crafted of local butternut. The interior is richly decorated, with multicoloured Minton encaustic tiles on the nave and chancel floors and the reredos. The stained glass windows in the nave were obtained from the Beer studio in Exeter, while the triplet window in the chancel was made by William Warrington of London. The entrance is through a small porch with ornate ironwork hinges and decoration on the doors. The churchyard is surrounded by a low stone wall incorporating a lychgate. The new chapel's innovative design was controversial at the time, with some parishioners objecting to the inclusion of a chancel with a screen, which symbolically separated the priest from the laity. Also, no pew rents were charged for the open bench pews. This deprived the parish of a source of income, as well as taking away a mark of status from pew owners.

It incorporates singing, dancing, and playing and is exclusively performed by women. The dance is mostly performed in the southwestern coastal province of Jeollanam-do. It is often associated with the Chuseok holiday and Daeboreum. The performance starts with a late Ganggangsullae and changes to a 'Jajeun-Ganggangsullae', which are characterized by the most beautiful and feminine charms of late Ganggangsullae, and 'Jung-Ganggangsullae\\" only in the Haenam and Jindo provinces.  Etymology  The etymology of Ganggangsullae is not clear, however its origins can be guessed by interpreting the name in either Korean, Chinese characters, or a combination of Korean and Chinese characters. = Korean Letter Origin = 'Gang' of Ganggangsullae means circle, and 'sullae' means a wagon, so together it means round and round. = Chinese Character Origin = It came from the word Ganggangsuallae, which means \\"a powerful barbarian is going to invade our country\\", which was a chant to make the public aware of enemy invaders. = Korean and Chinese Letter Origin = The origin related to Korean and Chinese character is similar to the Korean letter origin. 'Ganggang' means a round circle, and 'Sullae' comes from the Korean words 'Sunu' and 'Sulla' History Beginning = The dance is thought to have originated in ancient times when the Koreans believed that the Sun, Moon, and Earth controlled the universe. Participants would dance under the brightest full moon of the year in order to bring about a good harvest. Ganggangsullae has been held in Korea's most famous festivals like New Year's Day, Daeboreum, Dano, and Chuseok, which was largest at Chuseok. So, Ganggangsullae has become a popular event on Chuseok. On the evening of Chuseok, dozens of young farming women dance with their hands held together, singing and dancing. = Feature of Korea's traditional society = Korea’s traditional society was a male-dominated society, and young women were not allowed to sing loudly or go out at night. But women were allowed to sing and dance by doing “ganggangsullae” at night and give vent to their frustration at Chuseok. Women could enjoy the atmosphere free from normal restrictions during the festival. In the 16th century, during the Japanese invasion of Korea, Admiral Yi Sun-sin ordered women to do this dance in military uniform to intimidate the Japanese. The women were said to have dressed in military uniform and danced on Mount Okmae (옥매산). The Japanese scouts thus overestimated the strength of the Korean troops. On February 15, 1966, ganggangsullae was designated as Important Intangible Cultural Properties of Korea #8.  How to Perform Ganggangsullae  Wonmu = It is the main action of Ganggangsullae, which is spinning counterclockwise. = Holding hands and Walking = When holding hands with each other, the back of the right hand should be above, and the palm of the left hand should be above. When walking, the heel should be on the ground first. = Running = People doing 'running' have to run faster than 'walking'. They shouldn't open their legs very much, and they have to raise their knees while running. = Gatekeeper Play = Except the first two person, they make a line to be ready to go through the gate. The first and second person makes the gate, and then the right next person who went through the gate makes the gate, while the person who made the gate returns to the line. = Stomping Roof Tile = Except three people, they stand in a line lowering their heads. One person stands on their waist and starts to walk on them. The other two people holds her hands not to fall down.  Regional aspect of Ganggangsullae  Ganggangsullae is often handed down as a frame with Ganggangsullae, and is handed down independently, depending on the region. In this way, the patterns of existence of Ganggangsulrae vary depending on the area, and the meaning given to Ganggangsulla varies according to the region.  Function and Meaning of Ganggangsullae  Ritualistic Function = On the full moon night, there is a meaning of praying for the abundance and praise of the moon Ganggangsullae. At present, the meaning of the proposal is not strong, but it is presumed that the origin and departure of Ganggangsullae originated from the merit. Ganggangsullae's offerings differ slightly depending on tradition. In other words, in the region considered to be the central part, the quality remains stronger than the peripheral part. For example, steels are not in the periphery. So there is no ceremonial process of going from the Jin Ganggang to the Kang Ganggang. = Function and meaning of the origin of affluence = In the Shinan area, Ganggangsullae is said to have played not only with women's plays but with men and women playing together. It can be said that Ganggangsullae is responsible for the function of mating. It also means praying for the abundance toward the moon. = Function and meaning of Kanggangsullae related to the Japanese Invasion = The well - known Kanggangsullae 's theory of Imjinwaeran remains centered on Jindo and Haenam. During the Japanese invasion of Imjin, women changed their clothes and turned around Ganggangsullae. = Function and meaning as play song = In the surrounding area, Ganggangsullae is played as a play song. Heroic weaving, the end of virtue, treadmill tilting, and the birth of a child were also made for educational purposes. It is a representative meaning of Ganggangsullae in the 21st century. = Function and meaning as cultural property = Ganggangsullae is designated as the Intangible Cultural Property No. 8 of Korea. Now Ganggangsullae has become one of the performances. Ganggangsullae is a cultural asset that has a lot of music and power to pass down. Characteristics Ganggangsullae, 1891-1930 Traditionally, this dance is performed only by women at night without any instruments. Young and old women dance in a circle at night under the moonlight. They go outside in traditional Korean clothing, hold each other's hands, make a circle, and start rotating clockwise. The lead singer sings a line and everyone sings the refrain 'ganggangsullae'. The song tempo progressively becomes faster. They sing about their personal hardships, relationships, and desires. During the dance, the women play a variety of games. The dance can last until dawn.

It became the foundation for all farm grain binding machinery and was used extensively by all the major manufacturers of large grain harvesting machines in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Appleby's knotting device was a major landmark in the mechanization of agriculture and aided the development of the western wheat fields of the United States.  Background  John Francis Appleby was born in Westmoreland, New York in 1840. In 1844 his extended family of 17 arrived by boat to Milwaukee, Wisconsin. When he was just 18, Appleby invented the basic knotting device that would become the foundation for all farm binding machinery, but no one was interested in the idea at the time. He served with the 23rd Wisconsin Volunteer Infantry Regiment in the American Civil War, from 1862 to 1865. During the war, Appleby invented and patented a manual magazine feed breech loading needle gun.John F. Appleby, \\"Improvement in magazine or self-loading fire-arm,\\" U.S. Patent no. 45,466 (issued: December 20, 1864). When the US government rejected the idea, Appleby sold the patent for $500. The weapon was later used extensively by the Prussian Army.  Grain binder  After the war, he returned to Wisconsin and by 1874 had developed a successful wire grain binder. He was unable to gain any financial backing for it because of lack of support from farmers for the use of wire binding because small bits of wire often got into feed grain and were ingested by cattle, causing them harm. By 1878, Appleby had developed a successful twine binder, which he patented.See: * John F. Appleby, \\"Improvement in grain-binders,\\" U.S. Patent no. 208,137 (filed: July 8, 1878 ; issued: September 17, 1878). * John F. Appleby, \\"Improvement in grain-binding harvesters,\\" U.S. Patent no. 212,420 (filed: February 27, 1877 ; issued: February 18, 1879). Twine binders did not cut into the wheat or, like wire binders, kill cattle that happened to eat a strand.Sterling D. Evans, Bound in Twine: The history and ecology of the Henequen-Wheat Complex for Mexico and the American and Canadian Plains, 1880-1950 (College Station, Texas: Texas A&M; University Press, 2007), p. 4. He licensed the twine binder mechanism to the Gammon and Deering Company, which incorporated it into its Marsh Harvester grain binders and harvesters. Primarily on the value of Appleby’s twine binder, The Deering Harvester Company (as it became known in 1880) outsold its competitors. Appleby's design soon became the standard grain binding device used on machines manufactured by Cyrus McCormick’s McCormick Harvesting Machine Company, Champion Machine Works, and the D.M. Osborne Co.  Later life  In 1881, Appleby sold his grain binder machine patent interests to Champion Machine. He continued to work on various inventions, eventually patenting a horse-drawn cotton harvesting machine in 1905.John F. Appleby, \\"Cotton-harvesting machine,\\" U.S. Patent no. 798,651 (filed: January 23, 1905 ; issued: September 5, 1905). He died in Chicago in November 1917.

Theatre critic John Freedman names Kolyada as one of several dramatists and directors who might be designated as \\"fathers\\" or \\"mothers\\" of Russia's contemporary theatre movement. (Other contenders mentioned are Aleksei Kazantsev, Elena Gremina, Nadezhda Ptushkina, and Ol’ga Mukhina). The New York Times said that Kolyada's work has made a Yekaterinburg a \\"center of modern drama.\\" Kolyada is one of the first Russian playwrights to address homosexuality in his work, especially in Slingshot.  Career  Kolyada was born in Presnogor'kovka in the Kustanai region of Kazakhstan. He studied theater in Sverdlovsk, Russia (now known as Yekaterinburg). He worked as an actor with the Sverdlovsk Academic Theatre of Drama, and studied writing at the Gorky Literary Institute in Moscow. He gained international repute with his play Slingshot, which gave a sympathetic portrayal of a gay relationship. The play featured a romance between a nurse and his patient, a soldier wounded in the Soviet–Afghan War. Although the gay subject matter was shocking in Moscow, it earned him acclaim abroad when the play received its world premiere at the San Diego Repertory Theatre in 1989. When he began writing for the theater in the mid-1980s, Kolyada got a reputation for \\"chernukha\\", which critic John Freedman describes as an \\"almost untranslatable but expressive Russian noun [combining] shades of gloom, doom, bile, and jaundice colored with foul-mouthed-insolence.\\" His plays were known for their naturalistic approach to representing life's banal and pitiful troubles. His plays were among the first in Russia to use profanity, and are known for it. His scant use of profanity violated taboo at the time, but set the stage for much more pervasive obscenities by 2010. After living and working in Moscow for a time, Kolyada returned to Yekaterinburg, and has been instrumental in bringing the city's theater activity to prominence. He has taught playwriting at the Ural Institute and the Ekaterinburg State Theatre Institute since 1992, often teaching auditors as well as enrolled students. His students would present their work at his Kolyada Theater in Yekaterinburg. His is cited as one of the few playwriting programs in Russia, and several of his students have gone on to be produced in the more demanding venues of Moscow. Two of Kolyada's students, Oleg Bogayev and Vassily Sigarev have gained international acclaim and been produced in the United States. Kolyada is a prolific playwright. In 2006, Kolyada told a reporter, \\"I've written 90 plays. Thirty of them are good.\\" By 2010, the count of his plays exceeded 100. As a director, Kolyada is known for stark and dramatic productions using minimalist scenery and a stylized performance style. Critic John Freedman described the design of one production as typical of Kolyada's approach. He wrote, \\"The use of water and the sheet of plastic are characteristic of Kolyada’s theatre art: the barest of devices, the simplest of objects, the most powerful of effects.\\" Moscow News critic Irina Korneeva Vremya wrote in 2002 that she found his directing style to be \\"touching,\\" but repetitive, and ultimately \\"artless,\\" writing that \\"an abundance of superfluous detail and endless strolls across the stage to music are no style. They are a disaster.\\" In 2012, Kolyada came under fire when he declared his support Russian president Vladimir Putin's 2012 presidential campaign, saying that Putin was the best of the available candidates. Kolyada was the target of what the BBC described as a \\"massive bullying campaign\\" due to his support of Russian president Vladimir Putin. Kolyada's blog was overrun with comments attacking his views, and his theater was papered over with bills for a fake performance. Kolyada's theater company planned a United States tour in 2017, but the tour was cancelled due to diplomatic tensions between the United States and Russia, and the unavailability of travel visas after the United States withdrew over 1,200 diplomatic personnel from Russia. The company was to bring three of its productions to America: The Twelve Chairs; Violin, Tambourine, and Iron; and Baba Chanel. Interfax reported that the company lost on the cancellation. Kolyada is often associated with the Russian New Drama movement, though he rejects that label.

Typically, the establishment will be all-through, often with a nursery setting, and boys and girls are taught together until the age of 11 and separately from 11-16, before returning to coeducation in a joint sixth form. Diamond schools are often the product of the merger of a boys' and a girls' school, thus it is possible that at KS3 and KS4 girls and boys can be taught separately on different sites. It is a common feature that boys and girls combine outside the classroom in activities for academic trips and visits and in some co- curricular activities, such as choirs, orchestras and the Duke of Edinburgh Award scheme.

Its official French designation at that time was Ambulance Chirurgical Légère de Corps d’Armée 282. The unit made its way across France via Bordeaux to Arcachon from where it was evacuated back to Britain, arriving at Plymouth on 26 June. The unit re-grouped and re-equipped in Britain before sailing on 20 March 1941 for the Middle East, landing at Suez on 2 May. Under the designation of HCM (Hôpital chirurgical mobile) 3 Ambulance Hadfield-Spears, it was attached to the Free French forces (1st Free French Division) in the Middle East, North Africa, Italy and France before being dissolved in Paris in June 1945 on the order of General Charles de Gaulle.  Origin and leadership Sponsor= The unit was established during the Phoney War with £100,000 donated by Sir Robert Hadfield, the British steel tycoon.C. H. Desch, ‘Hadfield, Sir Robert Abbott, baronet (1858–1940)’, rev. Geoffrey Tweedale, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 24 Dec 2008 He had entrusted the money to his wife, Lady Frances Belt Hadfield, asking that she find a suitable good cause. Lady Hadfield, a francophile like her husband, spent most of the year at their villa at Cap Ferrat in the south of France. She explained to the French Consulate in London that 'the gift was the repayment of a debt she owed to France for the happiest years of her life'.Borden p.14 In the First World War, this well-connected American from Philadelphia had been one of the first to start a Red Cross hospital for the treatment of wounded and sick servicemen. This hospital at Wimereux, near Boulogne-sur-Mer, was run entirely at her own expense. Lady Hadfield, CBE, died in London on 6 November 1949. =Mary 'May' Borden= At the start of the Second World War, Lady Hadfield was 77 and no longer able to run a field hospital. Accordingly she turned to another American – her friend, the novelist Mary Borden, who was known to her friends and family as 'May'.Borden p.13 The latter had, at her own expense, also set up a hospital for the French army in July 1915 (l'Hôpital Chirugical Mobile No 1); now she wanted to help during the new conflict. Mary had close ties with France – it was while her unit was on the Somme in 1916 that she met Captain Edward Louis Spears, a British liaison officer attached to the French army.Conway p. 65 He was subsequently promoted to a General Staff Officer 1st Grade, liaising between the French Ministry of War and the War Office in London. They were married in 1918 and living in Paris at the end of the war. Spears later became a Member of Parliament; his pro-French views in the Commons earning him the nickname of 'the Member for Paris'. They had a wide circle of influential friends, both British and French, whom they entertained at their London home during the inter-war period. Mary Borden (Mrs Spears) agreed to be in charge of the (largely British) female personnel – the nurses and drivers of Lady Hadfield's new field hospital with its 100 beds. Mary Spears was generally known as 'Madame la Générale' by the French – a reference to her husband's rank in the British army. The French military 'Service de Santé' agreed to provide the male staff for the medical unit, including doctors, orderlies and drivers for the unit's heavy trucks.Borden p.16 Active service in Lorraine The river Sarre at Sarreguemines – the front line. The town had been abandoned by its French inhabitants. Girls of the Hadfield-Spears unit went for crockery from the china factory. They peered across to the German bank. ‘We could see what appeared to be a deserted café. The windows were wide open, the deep grass in front had grown up through the iron tables and chairs.’Borden p.36-36 Complete with tents, X-ray equipment, sterilizing apparatus, surgical instruments, beds, bedding, linen and ward equipment, the Hadfield-Spears mobile hospital left Paris in February 1940 for the village of St Jean le Bassel, near the front line in Lorraine. The medical officer in charge was Le Médecin Capitaine Jean Gosset – under him were three young French surgeons, a radiographer and administrative staff. There were 12 French drivers for the heavy trucks and 50 private soldiers. The British girls consisted of ten nurses, and 15 drivers of the Mechanised Transport Corps (MTC). Lady Hadfield had donated a Renault limousine for the use of Mrs Spears.Conway p.193 The Hadfield-Spears unit was attached to the French 4th Army, which was commanded by Général Réquin, a former World War 1 comrade of General Spears. At St Jean le Bassel, they were billeted partly at a convent and partly in the village itself. Their predecessors had left the wards in poor condition and they spent two weeks getting the place into shape before moving patients to their new quarters.Conway p. 194 There was little military activity in the sector – even when the Germans launched their attack on the Netherlands, Luxembourg and Belgium on 10 May. The girls had a peaceful time in the French countryside, making sorties up to the front line at Sarreguemines, which had become a ghost town since its French inhabitants were evacuated nine months previously. Lady Hadfield travelled up from the south of France to visit her unit – Mary Spears would not see her again until the end of the war. On 20 May, the news came through that her husband had been promoted to Major General, although she did not then know that he had been appointed Churchill's personal representative to the French Prime Minister, Paul Reynaud.Conway p. 199 On 28 May, they heard that the Belgian army was surrendering. General Réquin spoke to Mrs Spears and emphasised the serious of the military situation. She received telephone calls from Paris – her husband wanted her to come to Paris before he flew to London. She resisted – how could she leave her unit at a time like this? Spears was insistent but she was reluctant, as was Captain Gosset, who feared the road might be cut and that she would be unable to get back. They heard that Dunkirk had been evacuated. Then Spears rang again – this time ordering her to come to Paris. She decided to make a dash to the capital and back. They met at the British embassy. With the French army collapsing on all fronts, Spears was exhausted. 'His eyes were bloodshot. There were lines inches deep in his face. [...] I saw for one second what was going to happen. The war leapt at me out of his eyes. I was terrified.' Borden p.43-47 That evening a call came from her unit in Lorraine – they had received orders to move to another location the following day. She realised it had been most unwise to become separated from her girls. Then her driver reported that she had wrecked their car in the blackout. Fortunately, General Spears managed to procure another car with two French military drivers; Mary Spears and her MTC driver left the following morning. They arrived back at St Jean le Bassel just as the mobile hospital was about to move off.Conway p.203 Retreat Over the next 12 days, the unit made its way first west, and then southwest across France. Initially they kept in touch with the French 4th army, hoping to set up their hospital and carry out the humanitarian task which had brought them. But this was not to be. The pace of the French collapse quickened; they were never more than two nights in any one place. It was only at Châlons-sur-Marne that a party of six French orderlies and a French nurse was briefly detached to a hospital to help its overwhelmed medical staff. The roads were choked with refugees, petrol was hard to find and they went off the edge of their road maps. While queuing to refuel at the barracks in Gannat, between Moulins and Clermont-Ferrand, they heard that Marshal Philippe Pétain had asked the Germans for an armistice.Borden p.59, p.86, Conway p. 209 The beach at Arcachon in southwestern France. After their arduous trek ahead of the German advance, girls of the Hadfield-Spears unit relaxed among French holidaymakers on these sands before transferring to a British warship. Their evacuation from Arcachon was supervised by Lieutenant Ian Fleming of the Royal Navy. It was no longer a matter of retreat – more of escape. Their destination was Bordeaux, which had been the final seat of the French government before its ultimate collapse; they knew that Mary's husband, General Spears, had been here with the French government and they were sure he would help them find a way back to Britain. At Brives, their commanding officer, le Médecin Capitaine Jean Gosset, managed to send a telegram to warn the British Embassy at Bordeaux that the unit was splitting up, and that the 26 women would be continuing alone. All Lady Hadfield's medical equipment and stores were abandoned at the roadside. It is against Red Cross regulations for surgical or medical stores to be destroyed, but it is not known whether they were subsequently seized by the Germans. The women set off in six cars for Bordeaux.Borden p.96, p.98-99, Conway p.211 The British military attaché in Bordeaux directed them to Arcachon where, at a villa outside the town, they met a British naval lieutenant, Ian Fleming, who arranged for them to be taken aboard HMS Galatea (71) for the short sea voyage to St Jean de Luz near the Spanish frontier.This ship later brought home the British Ambassador to France Sir Ronald Campbell and the Ministers for Canada and South Africa. Here they were transhipped to a passenger vessel, the Etric [sic],No ship of this name can be traced. It is likely that the liner was, in fact, the P&O; vessel, SS Ettrick. She was later designated a troop carrier. On 15 November 1942 she was torpedoed by German U155 whilst part of a convoy in the Gibraltar area and later sank. Most of her crew were rescued, but 18 naval ratings lost their lives. which already had on board a large number of British subjects (mainly well-to-do ladies and their staff) evacuated from their villas in France. Mary Spears and her party of 25 British nurses and MTC drivers docked in Plymouth on 26 June 1940 with nothing but their personal effects.Borden p.100 – 116, Conway p. 212  Re-grouping and re-equipping in Britain  Mary Spears wished to continue with her work, and had the support of some of her original volunteer nurses and MTC drivers. However, Sir Robert Hadfield was dying at a country house near Epsom; Lady Hadfield was cut off at her villa in the south of France. There was accordingly no question of more help from the original sponsors but, through her contacts in America, she tapped into funds which had been donated in America by a charitable organisation known as the British War Relief Society, whose initial donation of £25,000In Journey Down a Blind Alley (p. 118), Mary Borden gives the donation as £20,000 was enough for her to consider that their financial worries were over.Conway p. 215 The name of the new unit would remain unchanged, but its organisation and Anglo-French character would be identical to that of her two previous hospitals. These conditions – including the proviso that Mrs Spears would exercise complete control over the female personnel – were accepted in writing by General Charles de Gaulle, who was by now leading the Free French Forces from his headquarters in London.Borden p.116-118, Conway p. 221The HQ of the Free French at 4 Carlton Gardens was, coincidentally, just a stone's throw from the administrative base of the Hadfield-Spears unit at Lord and Lady Hadfield's home in Carlton House Terrace. The unit's next posting would be overseas and there would be a requirement for heavy trucks and 30 men who could not only drive but also act as orderlies. De Gaulle was unable to provide this manpower from his forces, but drivers were forthcoming from the American Field Service, and hospital orderlies from the Friends' Ambulance Unit in London – the latter all conscientious objectors. Vehicles, tents, beds, cookers and ward equipment were purchased from the War Office. The vehicles included 15 3-ton Bedford trucks, and the same number of 15-hundredweight trucks, as well as five Ford V8s to transport the nurses and officers. De Gaulle's, Free French had few medical officers and it took months to assemble a team of four doctors who would be led by Colonel Fruchaud. The Mechanised Transport Corps provided 12 drivers.Borden p.118-120 The equipment and vehicles left Cardiff by sea for Port Sudan at the beginning of February 1941.Conway p.221 The personnel sailed on 23 March from Greenock on board the Orient Line liner SS Otranto.  On active service in the Middle East  Lady Spears (centre) with Sir Edward Spears (left) in December 1942 in Lebanon on the steps of their residenceConway p. 257 – that of the First British Minister to the Levant. To the right of Sir Edward stands Henry Hopkinson, private secretary to the Permanent Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Sir Alexander Cadogan; Richard Casey, Minister Resident in the Middle East, is to the right of Lady Spears, with Mrs Ethel Casey to her left. The Hadfield-Spears unit reached Suez on 2 May, expecting to sail back to Port Sudan and from there to Abyssinia, but plans had changed and they were told to make for Palestine. Their equipment had already been off-loaded at Port Said. During a brief visit to Cairo, Mary Spears met Madame Catroux, wife of General Georges Catroux, General de Gaulle's High Commissioner to the Levant, who did not approve of Free French wounded being cared for by British nurses.Conway p. 225-227 However, instead of going to Eritrea and the Sudan, as they had expected, the unit was sent to Sarafand in Palestine, where they were joined by Colonel Fruchaud, a renowned French surgeon, and a French detachment from Eritrea. Passing through Samaria and Galilee and crossing Transjordania they reached Deraa in Syria.

He is best known for writing The River Niger, a three-act play that was originally produced Off-Broadway in 1972 by the Negro Ensemble Company, before being transferred to Broadway in 1973 and then adapted into a 1976 film of the same name starring James Earl Jones and Cicely Tyson. In 1974, Walker became the first African-American writer to win a Tony Award, receiving the Tony Award for Best Play for The River Niger. The playwright previously won an Obie Award during that play's 1972 to 1973 Off-Broadway run. Biography Walker was born in Washington, D.C., to Joseph A. Walker and Florine G. Johnson. He earned an undergraduate degree in philosophy from Howard University and completed all requirements except the thesis for a master's in philosophy. In 1957, he entered the Air Force as a second lieutenant and later received a master of fine arts degree in drama from Catholic University. In his later years, he taught drama at Howard University and served as chairman of the theater department at Rutgers University's Camden, New Jersey, campus. Walker was one of the first African Americans, along with Lorraine Hansberry, to be nominated for the Tony Award for Best Play, which he won for The River Niger. His efforts and talents drew him critical acclaim at the Negro Ensemble Company (NEC), with Douglas Turner Ward as the artistic director. The River Niger's run was one of the NEC's longest consecutive runs. Other works include the drama District Line, Yin-Yang, The Harangues (Tribal Harangue 1, 2, and 3), The Lion is a Soul Brother, Out of the Ashes, Absolution of Willie Mae, Koulaba D. Haiti,“Stage: ‘District Line,’ From Negro Ensemble,” New York Times, December 5, 1984, and the musical King Buddy Bolden. Early life Walker met his first wife, Barbara Ann, in philosophy class; they were married in September 1957. That same year Walker entered the Air Force, going first to San Antonio, Texas, and then to Harlingen Air Force Base before serving as first lieutenant, 2nd in command of 350 Airmen of the 42nd Supply Squadron. In 1958–60, while stationed at Loring Air Force Base, Walker became founder and artistic director of Pine Tree Theatre Guild. During that time, his first son, Michael Alexander Walker, was born. Walker's second son, Steven Martin Walker, was born in 1962. That same year, Walker was discharged and decided to pursue an MFA in Theatre with a minor in Elizabethan Drama at Catholic University. During this time, Barbara Walker pursued her law degree. Walker's time in the Air Force is significant because the main character from The River Niger, Jeff Williams, was also discharged from the Air Force. In addition, the Williams character makes references to symbolically asking everyone at the Air Force base to \\"let go of my toe\\". Barbara Walker has stated that The River Niger may be semi-autobiographical. He taught at Spingarn High School in Washington, D.C., from 1963 to 1965 as an English/drama teacher. Artistic career Walker then began the pursuit of an acting career In 1966. He began studying voice and vocal reproduction from Brook Alexander and at the end of that year joined Voices, Inc. He remained narrator, lead singer, and artistic director of this organization until The Believers was produced in 1968. The Believers was co-authored by Walker and Josephine Jackson. From 1969 to 1975, he taught at CCNY's Leonard Davis Center of Performing Arts as an associate professor in the speech and theatre department. Also in 1969 he met Moses Gunn, who introduced him to Douglas Turner Ward, the artistic director of The Negro Ensemble Company (NEC), which led to the production of The Harangues, opening the 1969–70 season. Ododo, which Walker wrote, directed, and co-choreographed, opened with mixed reviews in the 1970–71 season at NE. The music for \\"Ododo\\" was composed and directed by his second wife Dorothy Ann Dinroe-Walker, also a Howard University graduate. Walker married Dorothy A. Dinroe in 1970, a match made in their love for the arts. Wanting to create his own theatre company, Walker became the artistic director of the Demi-Gods. The Demi-Gods was co- founded with his wife Dinroe-Walker between 1970 and 1974. In 1971–72, Walker and Dinroe-Walker co-produced Yin-Yang at the African American Studio. In 1972–73, Douglas Turner Ward went into production for The River Niger. The response to The River Niger was so overwhelming that the play was moved to the Brooks Atkinson Theatre on Broadway in 1973, where it won the Tony Award in 1974. In this same year his first daughter, Kumina Walker, was born. Walker received 400 hours towards a Motion Picture Production Certificate received at the Germaine School of Photography, New York City, in 1973. He also completed 28 credits towards his Ph.D. in cinema studies at New York University and was honored as playwright-in-residence at Yale School of Drama. Later life Walker spent his last years continuing his writings while maintaining full tenure at Rutgers University's Camden, N.J., campus, where he was chair of the theater arts department. He is survived by his five children Michael Walker, Steven Walker, Kumina Walker, Nandi Walker, and Jodoa Walker. Walker's youngest son, Kamau Walker, predeceased him in 2001.

History In the late 19th century, a stone marker was placed every mile east of the courthouse in Portland, resulting in a \\"Base Line Road\\" along the Willamette Baseline: Rockwood developed at the 10-mile mark, in a rocky and wooded area that was later the inspiration for the name of the community.Rockwood Urban Renewal from the city of Gresham's website A Ten-Mile Inn located in present-day Rockwood became a stagecoach stop, a junction that also attracted a school, a grange hall, a church, a grocery store, among other businesses. The Rockwood area was annexed by Gresham in the mid-1980s. Demographics The Rockwood neighborhood is situated in the zip codes 97233 and 97230 and based on 2010 census data (estimating 97233 zip also in Portland boundaries) has a population of approximately 28.000 people - approximately 1/3 of the population of Gresham. The census tracts included are: 98.01, 97.02, 96.06, 96.05, 96.04, 96.03. This neighborhood makes up much of the westernmost boundary of Gresham as it connects to Portland. The income range/household median income falls below the average income for the Multnomah County area where it is located. Within the County, the areas in Rockwood are within the ten lowest income zip codes east of the Willamette River.http://www.rockwoodcdc.org/rockwood/ Public services Since 2003, a area of Rockwood has been included in a Gresham-Rockwood Urban Renewal Area. Rockwood is served by the Rockwood / East 188th Avenue light-rail station on the MAX Blue Line.

It is a Grade II* listed building. The house was newly built in 1848 for John Allcard, a wealthy Quaker banker and stockbroker of Derby. It was originally built as a modest two bedroomed house, to a design by architect Joseph Paxton with interiors by Augustus Pugin and intended as a summer retreat. It was much extended by T D Barry and E W Pugin in 1856 for Allcard's son William, a railway engineer, best known for his 1830 work on the Sankey Viaduct, Warrington, Cheshire, where he was mayor in 1848 and 1851. The Allcard family fortunes were much reduced by a financial downturn in 1866 and in 1871 William Henry Allcard, a barrister, sold the estate. Further improvements and extensions were made in 1888 by J B Mitchell Withers for the purchaser Smith Taylor-Whithead, who was High Sheriff of Derbyshire in 1894.

Cairns began his football career with Ardwick towards the end of their last season before joining the Football League, in March 1892. However, it was more than 18 months before he made his debut for Ardwick, playing at right half in a 3–2 home defeat to Newcastle United on 21 October 1893. That match turned out to be Cairns' only appearance for the club, and he joined Newton Heath in September 1894.

Biography Rivka Keren was born as Katalin Friedländer in Debrecen, Hungary. She immigrated with her parents and small brother to Israel in 1957. She has been writing since childhood, first in Hungarian, later in Hebrew. Studied painting in Jerusalem and New York City, philosophy, literature and psychology in Bar Ilan University, graduated in Tel Aviv University (MA, clinical psychology). Keren has worked as a librarian, art therapist and clinical psychologist. Exhibited her paintings in various countries. During these years, she had published books for children, adolescents, novels, short stories, translations and was included in numerous anthologies. Some of her books and short stories had been translated to German, English, Spanish, Russian, Hungarian, Braille (for the blind) and recorded on disks. Keren is a member of PEN, ACUM, and IPA. She is married with two children. Literary work Rivka Keren published so far fourteen books and four additional books are due to be published soon. Her work is dealing mostly with subject matters such as destiny, memory, identity, the mystery of love and evil and the dualism of immigrants. Keren's writing is multi-layered and non-linear. The characters wander in a limbo between good and bad, love and hate, sanity and madness, while their state of mind meticulously analyzed. Their quests for belonging, roots and most of all truth and purpose, carry them to their goals through suffering and harsh experiences. Those of the novels that examine the characters against the black hole of the Holocaust were bestsellers and subject to much controversy among critics. In her writings, Rivka Keren, as second generation to Holocaust survivors, is representing the ongoing turmoil and conflict in the existence of immigrants, their pain and alienation but also their absorption and success. Her novels are a study of the human nature, the destructiveness of evil and revenge and the power of hope and love. List of books * Outrage, novel, Agam Publishing House, Hanamal series, 2010.

Since 1975, it is also Arbor Day, as trees are planted across the nation to aid the fight against desertification.  Importance of date  The date of the formal, complete independence from France was 3 August 1960, while 18 December 1958 marks the founding of the Republic and creation of the Presidency of the Republic of Niger, following the constitutional changes of the French Fifth Republic, and the elections of 4 December 1958 held across The French Colonial possessions. Nigeriens consider that date to be the founding of their national institutions. Between 18 December 1958 and 3 August 1960, Niger remained a semi-autonomous Republic within the French Community. At the beginning of 1960 a revision of the French Community allowed membership of independent states, and on 28 July the Nigerien Legislative Assembly became the Nigerien National Assembly: Independence was declared on 3 August 1960. Commemoration Since 1960, 3 August has been a national festival. In 1975, the government began celebrating Independence Day, in part, through the coordinated mass planting of trees in order to fight desertification.Editorial : le culte de l'exemple. Saidou Daoura, Editor, le Sahel (Niamey). 2011-08-01. The celebrations are also known as the Fête de l'Arbre.Le Niger célèbre mardi le 44ème anniversaire de son indépendance. Xinhua News. 4 August 2004.Le Niger en lutte contre la désertification. Habibou Bangré, Afrik.com. 21 November 2005. Independence Day is celebrated in Niger with official festivals and appearances of political leaders, an official broadcast by the President as well as the tradition (since 1975) that every Nigerien plant a tree. It is a public holiday, in which government offices and many businesses close.Participation de la chargée du bureau à la plantation d'arbre du 3 Août.

Born in Airdrie, McFarlane began his career with local side Airdrieonians, before moving to England to play for Bootle.Shury and Landamore (2005), p. 68. He was part of the Bootle side that took part in the inaugural season of the Football Alliance in 1889–90, helping them to second place behind The Wednesday. That summer, he joined Sunderland Albion, whom he also helped to a runners-up spot in 1890–91. He moved on to Newton Heath in 1891–92,Dykes (1994), pp. 239–40. where he took over as captain from the departing Jack Powell. He immediately became the club's first-choice right- back and played in all but four league matches during the season, scoring once in a 5–0 win at home to Walsall Town Swifts on 5 March 1892,Shury and Landamore (2005), p. 53. as he secured his third successive second-place finish. He also played in four FA Cup matches (although the Second Round Qualifying match was technically a friendly after their opponents, Heywood, were disqualified from the competition) and the Manchester Senior Cup semi- final defeat to Bolton Wanderers. At the end of the season, while on holiday back home in Airdrie, he re-signed for Airdrieonians after being allowed to resume his amateur status.McCartney (2002), p. 15. To replace McFarlane, Newton Heath signed Airdrieonians full-back Andrew Mitchell, who had been set to partner McFarlane in defence for the Scottish club. McFarlane played a further 67 league games between 1894 and 1898, when he contracted pneumonia and died. His final appearance for the club came against Morton at Cappielow on 8 October 1898, and he died later that month. McFarlane was married to a sister of the Doughty brothers, Jack and Roger, who also played for Newton Heath in their pre-League days.

The nonregulatory, nonprofit organization functions under the State Resources Agency. The conservancy creates grants for economic, recreation, and resource preservation in the greater Sierra Nevada area. In addition, it offers educational symposiums. Since 1973, seven other state conservancies were formed in California. The Sierra Nevada Conservancy was established with the passing of Assembly Bill 2600 in 2004, and is supported by the Sierra Nevada Alliance. Its creation was spearheaded by Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, and co-sponsored by Assemblymembers Tim Leslie and John Laird. In 2006, voters passed Proposition 84, with some of the funding appropriated to the Sierra Nevada Conservancy for safe water supply and quality, flood control, park improvements and natural resource protection. The conservancy's jurisdiction covers approximately in the counties of Alpine, Amador, Butte, Calaveras, El Dorado, Fresno, Inyo, Kern, Lassen, Madera, Mariposa, Modoc, Mono, Nevada, Placer, Plumas, Shasta, Sierra, Tehama, Tulare, Tuolumne, and Yuba. Including 3500 plant species, and 720 animal species, it supports half of California's plants, half of the state's reptile and amphibian species, and two-thirds of the state's bird and mammal species. The conservancy has offices in Auburn, Bishop, Mariposa, and Susanville. It is governed by a 13-member board, and there are three non-voting members. In November 2005, Jim Branham was appointed as the organisation's first Executive Officer.

The Old New Synagogue in Prague, Bohemia (Czech Republic), the oldest synagogue in continuous use, built around 1270 compares similarly with the Ramban synagogue in Safed, modern Israel. Synagogues may be considered \\"oldest\\" based on different criteria. Many very old synagogues have been discovered in archaeological digs. Some synagogues have been destroyed and rebuilt several times on the same site, so while the site or congregation may be ancient, the building may be modern. Still other very old synagogue buildings exist, but have been used for many centuries as churches, mosques, or for other purposes. Some very old synagogues have been in continuous use as synagogues for many centuries. Worldwide right * The oldest evidence of the presence of synagogue buildings are found in middle and lower Egypt in the 3rd century BCE on Elephantine island. They consist of two synagogue dedication inscription stones and a reference to a synagogue in a papyrus letter dated to 218 BCE. * The oldest synagogue building yet uncovered by archaeologists is the Delos Synagogue, a possibly Samaritan synagogue that dates from at 150 to 128 BCE, or earlier, and is located on the island of Delos, Greece.\\"The Oldest Original Synagogue Building in the Diaspora: The Delos Synagogue Reconsidered,\\" Monika Trümper Hesperia, Vol. 73, No. 4 (October–December, 2004), pp. 513–598 * The excavated Jericho synagogue may be the oldest, securely dated, mainstream Jewish synagogue in the world, although the identification of the remains as a synagogue is not certain. It was built between 70 and 50 BCE as part of a royal winter palace complex near Jericho. * Dura-Europos synagogue, Dura- Europos, Syria. =Standing buildings= According to legend, el Ghriba synagogue in Djerba, Tunisia was first built in 586 BCE or 70 CE, which would make it the oldest synagogue still standing and in continuous use in the world. Two of the claimants to be the oldest structures still standing that were built as synagogues are the Old Synagogue in Erfurt, Germany, which was built c. 1100Archeologists Discover Medieval Jewish Bath in Erfurt, 12.04.2007, Deutsche Welle, \\"Treasures of the plague,\\" Marian Campbell, Apollo Magazine, 31 August 2007 and the Synagogue of Santa María la Blanca in Toledo, Spain, which was built in 1190. However, neither has been used as a synagogue for centuries. The oldest active synagogue in the world is the Old New Synagogue of Prague in the Czech Republic, built in 1270s. The Ben Ezra Synagogue of Cairo has the honor of being the longest-serving synagogue in the world, having continuously served as one from 1025 until the mid 20th century. Owing to the migration of nearly all of Egypt's Jews to Israel (only 18 remained ), today the monument functions as a museum. By countryAfrica=Algeria * Synagogue of Tlemcen was built around 1392 when Rabbi Ephraim Alnaqua, a Spanish refugee who was the son of the author of Menorah, settled in Agadir, he obtained permission for Jews to settle in the city of Tlemcen, where he built a synagogue. Egypt * Stone synagogue dedication inscriptions stones found in middle and lower Egypt (see above), and dating from the 3rd century BCE, are the oldest synagogue fragments found anywhere in the World. Libya * Slat Abn Shaif Synagogue, in Zliten, Libya, was built around 1060 and destroyed in the 1980s. Tunisia * El Ghriba synagogue, according to legend, the construction of the synagogue goes back to the High Priests' escape following the destruction of Solomon's Temple by the Babylonians under Nebuchadnezzar II in the year 586 BCE (or, alternately, the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE). The High Priests carried with them a door and a stone of the destroyed Temple. Thus the synagogue links the Jewish diaspora to the \\"sole sanctuary of Judaism\\". In modern times, the local Jews are distinguished by their dress, which includes a black band around their pants, which signifies the destruction of the Temple. South Africa * The Gardens Shul, established 1841, is the oldest congregation in South Africa. Its 1863 building, which is still standing, may be the oldest synagogue building in the country. Rabbi Osher Feldman is the Rabbi of the Gardens Shul. =Asia=Afghanistan * In Herat, Afghanistan, the Yu Aw Synagogue still stands. There is no definitive date for the synagogue. India The Paradesi Synagogue in Kochi, India * In Kochi, in the South Indian state of Kerala, Paradesi Synagogue is believed to be built in 1568. It is the oldest Jewish synagogue in India that is still existing and in active use, although there are even older ones still existing but not in active use anymore. The oldest of India's synagogue buildings can be found in the state of Kerala, where synagogue construction began during the medieval period. Whereas Kerala’s first Jewish houses of prayer said to be from the eleventh through the 13th centuries perished long ago as a consequence of natural disasters, enemy attacks, or the abandonment of buildings when congregations shifted, as did the earliest confirmed synagogue in Kochangadi authenticated to 1344 by a surviving building inscription now found in the courtyard of the Paradesi synagogue in Kochi's Jew Town, those originating from the 16th and 17th centuries subsist. These extant synagogues, though altered over time, include not only the oldest found on the Indian subcontinent but in the British Commonwealth. The consensus among historians based on a compilation of limited recorded history and a mélange of oral narratives is that first synagogues in Kerala were not built until the medieval period. Various Kerala Jews and the scholars who have studied the community believe that the earliest synagogues in the region date to the early 11th century. According to a narrative, a Kerala Jew by the name of Joseph Rabban who accepted on behalf of his community copper plates granting the local Jews a set of privileges by the Hindu King Bhaskara Ravi Varman was also given wood by his Highness for the erection of a synagogue around 1000. While no physical evidence of this and any other similar period building survives, study of the literature, Jewish folksongs, and narratives supports the notion that synagogues likely stood in Malabar Coast towns, places now within the modern-day State of Kerala, from this epoch. A portion of these medieval- period buildings perished when the Kerala Jews had to leave them behind under the threat of persecution by the Moors and the Portuguese or as a result of natural disasters. The balance was rebuilt as a consequence of naturally occurring or intentionally set fires, modernization efforts, or assorted other variables.Waronker, Jay. \\"The Synagogues of India.\\" M.A. Thesis, Cornell University, 2010.

The Jews of Sardis are mentioned by Josephus Flavius in the 1st century CE, who refers to a decree of the Roman proquestor Lucius Antonius from the previous century (50–49 BCE): \\"Lucius Antonius, the son of Marcus, vice-quaestor, and vice-praetor, to the magistrates, senate, and people of the Sardians, sends greetings. Those Jews that are our fellow citizens of Rome came to me, and demonstrated that they had an assembly of their own, according to the laws of their forefathers, and this from the beginning, as also a place of their own, wherein they determined their suits and controversies with one another. Upon their petition therefore to me, that these might be lawful for them, I gave order that their privileges be preserved, and they be permitted to do accordingly.\\" (Ant., XIV:10, 17) It is generally understood that \\"a place of their own\\" refers to the synagogue serving the local Jewish community of Sardis. Josephus Flavius also mentions the decree of Caius Norbanus Flaccus, a Roman proconsul during the reign of Augustus at the end of the 1st century BCE, who confirms the religious rights of the Jews of Sardis, including the right to send money to the Temple of Jerusalem.

The present building, of which partial walls and pillars set upright by archaeologists remain, dates from the 4th century. However, excavation revealed that it is on the site of an earlier synagogue dating from the middle of the 1st century CE, that is, from before the destruction of the Temple. * The Ancient Synagogue of Barcelona, is a building from the 3rd or 4th century, when its function is unknown, and extended in the 13th, perhaps marking the start of its use as a synagogue. It has been described as the oldest synagogue in Europe. It was used as a synagogue until the massacre of the Jews in Barcelona in 1391, then used for other purposes until it was rediscovered and restored in the 1990s. * The Köln Synagogue in Cologne, Germany has been excavated 2007/2012 and dates clearly pre Carolingian (bef. 780/90). There is at the moment some strong evidence that it dates back to the early 4th century when emperor Constantine in 321 issued a privilege for the Cologne Jews. This has been confirmed recently by the find of a rainwater mikveh of the 4th century inside the building complex. * The Old Synagogue in Erfurt, Germany, which was partly built c.1100, is thought by some experts to be one of the oldest synagogue buildings still standing in Europe (most of it is 13th/14th century).

He was a popular philanthropist in his home town of Norwich and a Liberal politician who represented the city in parliament. Biography Colman was the son of James Colman and his wife Mary Burlingham, daughter of John Burlingham of Old Buckenham. He became a partner in the family mustard business at Stoke Holy Cross in 1823 and from then on the company was called J. & J. Colman. In 1854, the firm employed 200 workers. Jeremiah James was responsible for moving the firm to the larger works at Carrow in 1856. The Carrow site had been bought from the Norwich Railway Company in 1850 and it was well served by road, rail and river transport. The massive expansion of Carrow Works brought steady employment to a depressed and stagnating city. By 1874 he was the master of 1,500 workers. He lived in Carrow House at the heart of the works, devoting his life to the firm and to public interests.Stoke Holy Cross Watermill In 1866 Jeremiah James Colman was appointed mustard maker to Queen Victoria.

He was a City and County magistrate, Deputy Lieutenant in 1880 and an Alderman in 1896. He served as Governor of Norwich School in 1858 and as its Chairman in 1890. He was a trustee of the Municipal Charities in 1856 and its Vice-Chairman from 1869 - 1872. In 1893 he was made an Honorary Freeman of the City. He championed nonconformity, and persistently urged religious freedom. His generosity, kindness and courtesy gained him the affection and support not just of his business colleagues and employees but all who came into contact with him. On the day of his funeral the city came to a complete halt and thousands were in mourning. His large collection of historical documents about the city was given to the library by his great grandson and his paintings went to the Norwich Castle Museum In 1856 he married Caroline Cozens-Hardy, the eldest daughter of William Hardy and Sarah Cozens of Letheringsett Hall, who changed their surnames by royal licence in 1842 to Cozens-Hardy. They had six children and after her elder son Russell James Colman recovered from a serious childhood illness in 1863, Caroline became closely associated with the work of the Jenny Lind Hospital for children. She gave her husband much support in his civic and parliamentary duties. She was the central figure behind all the welfare work for the employees of the company. A school was opened in King Street when the company moved to Carrow and in 1864 a new magnificent building was opened on Carrow Hill. The Carrow Works Dispensary was established in 1864 with a doctor and the first industrial nurse in the country. The company owned hundreds of properties around the city. Houses were provided for the workers at Carrow Close in Corton Road and Nightingale Cottages. In 1878, the County Ground, Lakenham was bought to become not only the focus of Carrow sport, but also home to Norfolk County Cricket Club. After Caroline died in 1895 Jeremiah James Colman gave a new site for the hospital on the outskirts of the city in her memory. In 1899, the Carrow Works Pension Fund was introduced as a memorial to J.J. Colman.

Examples of opioids include morphine, heroin, fentanyl, tramadol, and methadone. Symptoms include insufficient breathing, small pupils, and unconsciousness. Onset of symptoms depends in part on the route by which the opioids are taken. Among those who initially survive, complications can include rhabdomyolysis, pulmonary edema, compartment syndrome, and permanent brain damage. Risk factors for opioid overdose include opioid dependence, use of opioids by injection, use of high doses of opioids, mental disorders, and use of opioids together with alcohol, benzodiazepines, or cocaine. Risk of overdose is particularly high following detoxification. Dependence on prescription opioids can occur from their use to treat chronic pain. Diagnosis of an opioid overdose is based on symptoms and examination. Initial treatment involves supporting the person's breathing and providing oxygen. Naloxone is then recommended among those who are not breathing to reverse the opioid's effects. Giving naloxone into the nose or as an injection into a muscle appear to be equally effective. Among those who refuse to go to hospital following reversal, the risks of a poor outcome in the short term appear to be low. Efforts to prevent deaths from overdose include improving access to naloxone and treatment for opioid dependence. Opioid use disorders resulted in 122,000 deaths globally in 2015, up from 18,000 deaths in 1990. In the United States, over 49,000 deaths involved opioids in 2017. Of those, about 20,000 involved prescription opioids and 16,000 involved heroin. In 2017, opioid deaths represented more than 65% of all drug overdose related deaths in the United States. The opioid epidemic is believed to be in part due to assurances in the 1990s by the pharmaceutical industry that prescription opioids were safe. Signs and symptoms Because of their effect on the part of the brain that regulates breathing, opioids can lead to a person having very slow or stopped breathing during overdoses and therefore result in death if left untreated. Opiate overdose symptoms and signs can be referred to as the \\"opioid overdose triad\\": decreased level of consciousness, pinpoint pupils and respiratory depression. Other symptoms include seizures and muscle spasms. Sometimes an opiate overdose can lead to such a decreased level of consciousness such that the person will not wake up. Prolonged lack of oxygenation from respiratory depression can also lead to detrimental damage to the brain and spinal cord and can leave the person unable to walk or function normally, even if treatment with naloxone is given. Alcohol also causes respiratory depression and therefore when taken with opioids can increase the risk of respiratory depression and death. In young children, opioid overdose may not be apparent right away. This is due to absorption, distribution, and metabolism differences between young children and adults, and the higher amount of opioid ingestion per kilogram of body weight. Cause Prescription Drug Overdose Patient Information, CDC 2012 Fentanyl. 2 mg. A lethal dose in most people.Fentanyl. Image 4 of 17. US DEA (Drug Enforcement Administration). Risk factors for opioid overdose include opioid dependence, injecting opioids, using high doses of opioids, and use together with alcohol, benzodiazepines, or cocaine. The risk is particularly high following detoxification. Dependence on prescription opioids can occur from their use to treat chronic pain. In young children an overdose is usually due to opioids that are intended for their parents, older siblings, or grandparents. In mothers who take codeine during breastfeeding, opioid overdoses have occurred in their baby. Codeine is therefore not recommended in those who are breastfeeding. = Co-ingestion = Opioid overdoses are often associated with benzodiazepines or alcohol use. Other CNS depressants, muscle relaxers, pain relievers, anti-convulsants, anxiolytics, treatment drugs of a psychoactive or epileptic variety or any other such drug with its active function meant to calm or mitigate neuronal signaling (barbiturates, etc.) can additionally cause a worsened condition with less likelihood of recovery cumulative to each added drug. This includes drugs less immediately classed to a slowing of the metabolism such as with GABAergics like GHB or glutamatergic antagonists like PCP or ketamine. File:US timeline.

Green line is cocaine and any opioid. Gray line is cocaine without any opioids. Yellow line is cocaine and other synthetic opioids. = Risk factors = Opioids are metabolized by the liver before they are excreted in the urine and each opioid may be metabolized by different cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes. Polymorphisms in CYP superfamily of genes vary by individual and can account for differences in therapeutic response to drugs. This biotransformation of opioids by the liver can either lead to the inactivation or activation of the drug. For example, methadone is converted primarily by CYP3A4 liver enzyme to an inactive metabolite. In contrast, codeine is an initially inactive prodrug that is metabolized by CYP2D6 to its active form morphine to exert its analgesic effects. An individual who has a poor metabolizer phenotype of CYP2D6 may experience weak analgesic effects with codeine while someone who has the ultra-rapid metabolizer phenotype would experience greater side effects. Mechanism Permanent brain damage may occur due to cerebral hypoxia or opioid-induced neurotoxicity. Opioids inhibit the medulla's chemoreceptors through the mu and delta receptors. Opioids bind to receptors that are part of the endogenous opioid system as well as other central nervous neurotransmitter systems, binding to excitatory neurotransmitters like dopamine or glutamate, or inhibitory neurotransmitters like GABA. The main excitatory chemoreceptor, glutamate, and main inhibitory chemoreceptor, GABA, are the main neurotransmitters that control respiration.Watson SJ, Akil H, Khachaturian H, et al. Opioid systems: Anatomical, physiological and clinical perspectives. In: Opioids Past, Present and Future, Hughes J, Collier HO, Rance MJ, Tyers MB (Eds), Taylor & Francis, London 1984. p.145. Because of its fatal consequences, opioid induced respiratory depression is one of the major limiting factors of its analgesic effects. Opioids vary in the rate of metabolism amongst individuals. The rate of metabolism of opiates vary due to genetic factors while tolerance of the opiates can determine risk. Prevention Opioid overdoses can often be prevented.In press Clear protocols for staff at emergency departments and urgent care centers can reduce opioid prescriptions for individuals presenting in these settings who engage in drug seeking behaviors or who have a history of substance abuse. Drug seeking behaviors include but are not limited to obsessiveness or impatience when it comes to attaining medications, seeking multiple pain adjunct medications, and inconsistent physiological presentation. A prescription monitoring program may help determine if an individual is receiving a high doses of opioids or combinations of medications such as benzodiazepines and opioids that put them at high risk. Limited amount of evidence suggests opioid therapy with extended-release or long-acting formulations may increase the risk of an unintentional overdose compared to shorter-acting agents. Routinely screening using tools such as the CAGE-AID and the Drug Abuse Screening Test (DAST-10) in adults and the CRAFFT in those aged 14–18 years is recommended. Other “drug seeking” behaviors and physical indications of drug use should be used as clues to perform formal screenings. There are several medication-assisted treatments available for people with opioid use disorder or opioid dependence, who are at higher risk for opioid overdose. The selection of treatment depends on various factors, such as a person's preference, accessibility, and history of treatment. Examples of medication-assisted treatments are buprenorphine (with or without naloxone), naltrexone, and methadone. Peer support groups have tentative evidence of benefit. There is also some evidence indicating benefits in community-based overdose education and naloxone distribution programs. Buprenorphine and methadone can help decrease drug cravings. Combining pharmacologic treatments with behavioral therapy, such as support or recovery groups, can increase likelihood of overcoming addiction and reduce the risk of an opioid overdose. Individuals diagnosed with opioid dependence should be prescribed naloxone to prevent overdose and should be directed to one of treatment options available, such as needle exchange programs and treatment centers. A naloxone prescription is also recommended when risk factors for opioid overdose are present such as history of overdose, substance use disorder, or higher doses of opioids. Brief motivational interviewing can also be performed and has been shown to improve people's motivation to change their behavior. Despite these opportunities, the dissemination of prevention interventions in the US has been hampered by the lack of coordination and sluggish federal government response. In the United States, 49 states and the District of Columbia have expanded naloxone access at a pharmacy level via standing order, protocol order, naloxone-specific collaborative practice agreement, or pharmacist prescriptive authority. Treatment In people who have overdosed on opioids, basic life support and naloxone are recommended as soon as possible. Naloxone is effective at reversing the cause, rather than just the symptoms, of an opioid overdose. Compared to adults, children often need larger doses of naloxone per kilogram of body weight. Programs to provide drug users and their caregivers with naloxone are recommended. In the United States, as of 2014, more than 25,000 overdoses have been reversed. Programs training police and fire personnel in opioid overdose response using naloxone have also shown promise. Programs have been developed in cities, such as San Francisco, to increase community awareness and engagement in prevention of opioid overdose.https://harmreduction.org/issues/overdose-prevention/dope-sf/ Epidemiology In 2016, the World Health Organization estimates 34 million people used opioids and 19 million used opiates. Of these, about 27 million people had opioid dependence, with the majority—but a decreasing number—using illicit heroin. In 2015, 118,000 people died from opioid use disorders, causing almost one third of all drug related deaths. = United States of America = Of the 70,200 overdose deaths in the US in 2017, opioids were involved in 47,600.

Awareness  The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration hosts an annual health observance known as National Prevention Week. Every third week of May, they encourage communities across the country to unite to share stories about positive mental and behavioral health and the importance of implementing prevention methods. They also sponsor recovery Month every September. Recovery Month aims to raise awareness about mental and substance use disorders and to honor individuals who recover, promoting the positive message that prevention works and that treatment is effective. International Overdose Awareness Day is on August 31st to remember those who have lost their lives to overdose, to decrease stigma of drug-related deaths, and to promote prevention of overdose.

It is caused by mites in the genus Knemidocoptes which burrow into the bird's flesh. The tunnels made by the mites within the skin cause dermatitis and scaly lesions. Scaly face is caused by the same mite responsible for scaly foot and other related mites cause depluming. The condition is transmitted from one bird to another by direct prolonged contact. Causes Scaly foot, otherwise known as knemidocoptiasis, is caused by burrowing mites in the genus Knemidocoptes. The condition can be compared with sarcoptic mange in mammals, but does not seem to cause the same level of itching. The birds chiefly affected are galliformes (chickens and turkeys), passerines (finches, canaries, sparrows, robins, wrens), and psittacine birds (parrots, macaws, parakeets, budgerigars). The condition sometimes additionally affects piciformes (woodpeckers, toucans) and anseriformes (ducks, geese, swans), raptors and other birds. The two species of mite most often implicated are K. jamaicensis and K. intermedius. Other related species of mite affect feather follicles and cause depluming. The mites are mostly transmitted by prolonged direct contact, particularly from parent bird to unfledged nestling. Symptoms Scaly foot causes lesions of the skin with dermatitis and thickening of the skin. Commonly known as scaly face, scaly legs, or tassel foot, knemidocoptiasis affects primarily the face and legs of birds around the world worldwide and can be fatal. Etymology Knemidocoptic mange [neʺmĭ-do-kopʹtik mānj] From the Latin manducare (to itch), mange is a skin disease caused by mites in domestic and wild animals.

Billed as \\"the soap opera that's good for you\\", BodyLove uses fictional drama to reach African American listeners with messages that promote healthy lifestyles. The program is based upon the principles of \\"entertainment-education\\" that have been recommended for reaching audiences not reached by traditional health education and health promotion messages. The show is aimed at an African American audience which struggles with many of these health problems in disproportionate numbers. (For example, the diabetes death rate for blacks is more than double that for whites.) Betsy Hunter, executive director of the non-profit Media for Health, told The Birmingham News, \\"If you can't entertain, you can't possibly change health behavior.\\" Summary In each weekly 15-minute episode, characters deal with a variety of health problems while trying to navigate personal relationships and deal with strains both financial and emotional. The drama revolves around characters who work and spend their time at a fictitious Birmingham, Alabama, beauty salon called \\"BodyLove\\". BodyLove focuses on the family of Vanessa Love, an African American woman in early middle-age who owns the salon and struggles with issues of diet, high blood pressure, weight gain, substance abuse, stress, and death. Vanessa is also raising three children with little help from her husband, a recovering alcoholic. The characters make progress through modest lifestyle changes. History BodyLove was created by Dr. Connie Kohler, a public-health professor at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. The show began in 2002 as a single 10-episode series on Birmingham station WJLD (1400 AM). It quickly expanded in scope and affiliate coverage to a multi-year saga heard in all of Alabama's population centers. The first 80 episodes of BodyLove aired across the state of Alabama in four 20-episode seasons between 2003 and 2007. After a fundraising break, Kohler and her partners resumed writing and producing new episodes, which began airing in late 2008 after local stations cycled through reruns of the earlier seasons. The show's episodes were written by UAB faculty and UAB students in screen- writing classes taught by Lee Shackleford. BodyLove is currently a project of Media for Health and the UAB School of Public Health. Media for Health is a private non-profit organization formed in September 2006 to produce, promote, and distribute BodyLove. Funding for BodyLove is provided by local and national charitable foundations, in partnership with the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation's Local Initiative Funding Partners Program. Presentation On most affiliate stations, each episode is followed by a 45-minute talk period where listeners may speak to local health experts and get information about local health resources. For example, on WJUS in Marion, Alabama, the program is hosted locally by registered nurse Frances Ford who bookends the show with a listener call-in show offering advice, support, and \\"practical steps to better health\\". Since nearly one-third of Perry County residents live in poverty, Ford tailors her on-air nutrition tips to suit local budgets. On WJJN in Dothan, Alabama, the call-in program following each episode is hosted by Dr. Harriett Searcy, medical director at the Alfred Saliba Family Services Center's Family Health Clinic. On Birmingham station WJLD (1400 AM), hosts included Dr. Pamela Plummer, Jann Robinson and Benita Wrenn. Wrenn was also a part of the Bodylove Writer's Group. Affiliates Stations in Alabama that have broadcast BodyLove include WEUP-FM and WEUV in Huntsville, WHBB in Selma, WHIY in Moulton, WJDB in Thomasville, WJJN in Dothan, WJLD in Birmingham, WJUS in Marion, WMFC in Monroeville, WRJX in Jackson, WSYA in Anniston, WTLS in Tallassee, WTSK in Tuscaloosa, WVAS in Montgomery, and WZZA in Tuscumbia. The show is also carried by stations in Atlanta, Georgia, Jackson, Mississippi, and Port St. Lucie, Florida. Off the air, the episodes can be streamed online from the website of WBHJ in Birmingham, Alabama.

It has consistently been in first position in the Canadian civil law schools rankings in Maclean's until 2017. In 2018, the Faculty was ranked as the best francophone law school in the world. In addition to its civil law degree (LL.B.), the Law School offers a one-year J.D. in common law for Quebec civil law graduates that enables them to take the bar exam in other Canadian provinces and in New York, Massachusetts and California. Combining civil and common law in a uniquely bijural environment, the education provided at the Faculty of Law seeks to make students proficient in both Western legal traditions. UdeM Faculty of Law is also bilingual. The languages of instruction are French and English for the LL.B. and English for the J.D.  History  The Faculty was originally a branch of Québec City's Université Laval in Montréal. It became part of the Université de Montréal upon its foundation in 1920. Between 1895 and 1942, the Faculty was located on St. Denis St. in Montréal. In 1945, it moved to Mount-Royal and was relocated in 1968 to its current location, which became the Pavillon Maximilien-Caron in 1978 in honour of a famous jurist who influenced an entire generation of law professors and students. One of the first full-time law professor in Quebec, Maximillien Caron promoted a reform in the teaching of law that integrated all aspects of life and instituted new pedagogical methods that included sociology, economics and politics. Since the graduation of its first class in 1879, the Faculty has trained the largest number of jurists in Canada. Indeed, approximately 15,000 students have obtained an undergraduate law degree from the Faculty. Graduates from the Faculty of Law are renowned in their province, country and internationally. Alumni and professors have been, and still are, pioneers in many fields of law, such as indigenous law, cyberspace law and business law. They have greatly contributed to Quebec and Canadian society as jurists, politicians, business persons and artists. The faculty of law of the University of Montreal is very prestigious and is considered by many intellectuals, judges and politicians to be the best law faculty in Canada.  Law Review  For nearly 60 years, the Faculty has published the Revue Juridique Thémis de l'Université de Montréal, which has become a reference for Quebec's legal community as well as a symbol of tradition and excellence. Professors, students and practitioners contribute to its success, which has spread well beyond the borders of Quebec. Indeed, the Journal was ranked by the Washington and Lee University School of Law as Canada's first primarily French-speaking journal, along with the University of Toronto Law Journal for English-speaking Canada and the Harvard Law Review for the United States. The Journal is published three times a year and touches upon all fields of law; public law, private law and criminal law. It also includes contributions from the research centres of the Faculty as well as letters from international jurists who provide insights into developments affecting their legal system. UdeM Campus  Public Law Research Centre  Established in 1962, the Public Law Research Centre (Centre de recherche en droit public (CRDP)) is the first and most important legal research centre in Canada. The CRDP is renowned for its interdisciplinary approach and work on contemporary forms of law as well as for maximizing the involvement of students in its extensive research activities. Research concentrates on three main axes: law and new social relations; law and information and communications technologies; and, law, biotechnology and community. Since 1995, the Centre publishes a bilingual electronic review, Lex Electronica, which is an international journal specialized in communications and information technologies law, health and biotechnology law, as well as theories of law and social changes. The Centre relies on the active participation of 15 full-time researchers and 50 students from a dozen different countries currently working on over 20 research projects. Among the CRDP's most important recent research projects, one deals with the various dimensions of the status of Aboriginal peoples in Canada, and another one examines questions pertaining to privacy and information security.  Student life  Students of the Faculty belong to two student associations, the Association of Law Students (AED, undergraduate level) and the Association of Graduate Law Students (ACSED, graduate level). These two associations are part of the Federation of Student Associations of the Campus of the Université de Montréal (FAÉCUM). Members of their executive boards sit at Faculty Council as well as on other Faculty committees. In addition to organizing cultural and professional development activities, they coordinate numerous other committees, as the well known Comité du droit des affaires et de gestion (CDAG) and the Comité Droit et Politique, therefore contributing to a dynamic student life. The AED publishes a student newspaper, Le Pigeon Dissident, and both associations have launched websites presenting their activities and addressing other subjects of interest.

The Foundling operates programs in the five boroughs of New York City, Rockland County, and Puerto Rico. Its services include foster care, adoptions, educational programs, mental health services, and many other community-based services for children, families, and adults. History A wave of very poor immigrants and social disruption were among the many conditions that led to an epidemic of infanticide and abandonment during the late 1860s. It was not unusual for the sisters at St. Peter's Convent on Barclay Street to find a tiny waif left on the doorstep. Sister Mary Irene FitzGibbon, of St. Peter's approached Mother Mary Jerome, the Superior of the Sisters of Charity, regarding the need of rescuing these children. Archbishop (afterwards Cardinal) John McCloskey urged the Sisters to open an asylum for such children.\\"The New York Foundling Hospital\\", National Orphan Train Complex =The Foundling Asylum (1869–1879)= The New York Foundling Asylum of the Sisters of Charity was established on October 8, 1869. Shortly thereafter, Sisters Irene, Sister Teresa Vincent and Ann Aloysia began operating out of a rented house at 17 East 12th Street in New York's Greenwich Village, where they received an infant on their first night of operation. Sister Irene Fitzgibbon in an undated photo Sister Irene, placed a white wicker cradle just inside the front door with the goal of receiving and caring for unwanted children and those whose parents could not properly care for them.\\"History\\", New York Foundling 45 more babies followed in that first month.

Within a year, the Foundling purchased a larger house at 3 Washington Square. After two years, The Foundling had accepted 2,500 babies. The New-York Historical Society has a collection of the notes left with the abandoned babies, which is part of a larger collection of historic photographs of the Foundling maintained by the Society.

Among its medical programs was St. Ann's Hospital (opened 1880), which provided unmarried mothers with medical treatment; and St. John's Hospital for Sick Children (1882), which was at the forefront of developing pediatric practices and approaches to caring for children in a hospital setting.

Beginning in 1945, The Foundling also operated a developmental clinic to observe, examine and analyze the developmental norms for young children. The clinic became a learning center for students from New York City area medical schools, nursing schools and psychology departments. These programs were the beginning of, and were subsequently incorporated into, what became Saint Vincent's Hospital in New York City. While The Foundling provided medical treatment in addition to adoption and support services for mothers-in-need, it wasn't until the 1930s that a Social Service department was established to assist those who could not properly care for their children. The New York Foundling today The New York Foundling's administrative headquarters are located at 590 Avenue of the Americas, in Chelsea with additional locations across the five boroughs of New York City, Rockland County, Westchester County, Putnam County and Puerto Rico. In 2006, The New York Foundling received accreditation from the Council on Accreditation (COA), an international, independent, not-for-profit, child- and family-service and behavioral healthcare organization which sets standards for service delivery. Programs, services and initiativesFoster care and adoption= The New York City Administration for Children's Services (ACS) refers children to organizations like The New York Foundling for placement with a foster family and for additional support services. Some foster children are able to be reunited with their birth parents while others may find a permanent home through placement with a blood relative or through adoption. Providing foster care for children whose parents are unable to care for them has been a core component of The Foundling's mission since its founding. In recent years, foster care practices have shifted toward evidence-based interventions that are proven to support happy, healthy, and functioning families. The Foundling's current foster care model, Child Success NYC (CSNYC), was launched in 2012 and is a multifaceted approach geared toward improving outcomes for the children. The New York Foundling's foster care program is responsible for approximately 700 children at any given time (roughly 1,200 per year) and range from newborns up to age 21. =Vincent J. Fontana Center for Child Protection= The Vincent J. Fontana Center for Child Protection was founded in 1998 by Doctor Vincent J. Fontana, who served as medical director of The Foundling for over 40 years. The Fontana Center is dedicated to furthering the understanding and detection of child abuse and neglect, and to teaching prevention and treatment. =Mott Haven Academy Charter School= In 2008, The Foundling opened the Mott Haven Academy Charter School. The first charter school of its kind in the nation, Haven Academy uses a trauma-sensitive curriculum designed to meet the unique educational needs of kids in the child welfare system. One-third of Haven Academy's seats are reserved for scholars in foster care, and another third are reserved for those who receive services to prevent them from entering foster care. Approximately 23 percent of the school's non-foster care population are homeless, returning to a shelter each night after school. Haven Academy is housed in a colorful building, with two teachers and a maximum of 26 students per classroom. Art, music, or dance is offered daily. There are two social workers – a behavioral specialist and an outreach worker – at the school. There is also an after- school leadership program and summer camp offered to Haven Academy students through The Foundling. =Juvenile Justice Programs= The New York Foundling has five juvenile justice programs geared toward achieving better outcomes for juvenile offenders: * Blue Sky – Intervention strategies to treat young offenders while they remain at home and in the community * Arrow – Serves teens with psychiatric impairment * Kids Experiencing Young Successes (KEYS) – Serves at-risk youth with family and community intervention strategies * Families Rising – Uses Functional Family Therapy for older teens charged with a crime to keep them out of detention. * Way Home – Works with parents and youth in a family therapy model designed to build bridges and result in a safer, more effective and more secure family environment. =Deaf Services= Family Services for Deaf Children and Adults at The New York Foundling is a preventive program for families in which there is one or more deaf members. The program began in 1982. Staff are fluent in American Sign Language and provide a variety of home-based services based on families' assessed needs. =Programs for Individuals with Developmental Disabilities= The New York Foundling began its program to help individuals with developmental disabilities in 1974 with the opening of a group home in Nyack, NY. Since then, The New York Foundling has expanded and now provides services to nearly 300 individuals and their families each year. =Head Start Programs: Puerto Rico= Since 1984, The New York Foundling has operated Head Start and Early Head Start programs in Puerto Rico. The goal of these programs is to improve social and educational outcomes for children and families in impoverished areas of the island. ReferencesFurther reading * Renée Wendinger. \\"Extra! Extra!

Set in an eccentric north London Jewish old age home, the film revolves around three generations of the same family. There's cantankerous old Izzie Goldberg (Ron Moody), who's dying and is not at all happy about it, his hedonistic daughter Dee (Rula Lenska), the home's owner, a cross between a Sixties flower child and a traditional Jewish mother—and there's her teenage age son Keith (Leyland O'Brien), the mixed-race outcome of a disastrous marriage. Keith's identity crisis forms the film's emotional core: he's trying to build personal and religious bridges with his grandfather while starting a relationship with the mysterious Kim (Lee Blakemore), who turns up one morning looking for shelter, and who offers the promise of a life outside Paradise Grove.

Regina Trench was the Canadian name for a German trench dug along the north-facing slope of a ridge running from north-west of the village of Le Sars, south-westwards to Stuff Redoubt (), close to the German fortifications at Thiepval. It was the longest such German trench on the Western Front front during the First World War. Attacked several times by the Canadian Corps during the Battle of the Ancre Heights, the 5th Canadian Brigade of the 2nd Canadian Division briefly controlled a section of the trench on 1 October but was repulsed by counter-attacks of the German Marine Brigade (equivalent to an army division), which had been brought from the Belgian coast. On 8 October, attacks by the 1st Canadian Division and the 3rd Canadian Division on Regina Trench also failed. On 21 October, the 4th Canadian Division attacked the western portion of Regina Trench, as the 18th (Eastern) Division, 25th Division and the 39th Division of II Corps, attacked the part further west (known as Stuff Trench to the British). The Canadians met little opposition and gained the objective, as the II Corps divisions captured Stuff Trench in thirty minutes, giving the British control of Thiepval Ridge. Three counter- attacks were repulsed by the Canadians and by 22 October, more than a thousand Germans had been taken prisoner. The east end of the trench was captured by the 4th Canadian Division during the night of BackgroundBattle of Thiepval Ridge= The Battle of Thiepval Ridge was the first large offensive mounted by the Reserve Army (Lieutenant-General Hubert Gough), during the Battle of the Somme and was intended to benefit from the Fourth Army attack at the Battle of Morval, by starting afterwards. The battle was fought on a front from Courcelette in the east near the Albert–Bapaume road, to Thiepval and the Schwaben Redoubt () in the west, which overlooked German defences further north in the Ancre valley and on the rising ground towards Beaumont Hamel and Serre on the other side of the river. Thiepval Ridge was well fortified and the German defenders fought with great determination, while British infantry–artillery co-ordination declined after the first day, due to the confused nature of the fighting in the maze of trenches, dug-outs and shell- craters. On 26 September, Thiepval was outflanked on the right, with the loss of the village and most of the garrison, the British infantry managing an advance of on the attack front. The British pushed on towards Stuff and redoubts until the end of the month and Reserve Army attacks resumed in the Battle of the Ancre Heights, which began on 1 October. The British had made better use of their artillery and although German artillery ammunition consumption in September rose to shells from the fired in August, much of the ammunition was wasted on unobserved area bombardments, while defensive barrage fire was limited to three-minute periods; up to of the German guns became unserviceable in battle, due to mechanical failure. PreludeBritish offensive preparations= An offensive by the Reserve Army was planned for mid-October and Gough began a reorganization on the north side of the Ancre. On the south side of the river, Regina Trench (), along the reverse slope of Thiepval Ridge, north of Courcelette and Thiepval and the remainder of Stuff and redoubts were to be captured by the Canadian Corps and II Corps on 1 October, ready for a northward advance, during the offensive which was due around 12 October, jumping-off from the front held by the Canadian Corps. =German defensive preparations= In late September, the Marine Infantry Brigade, comprising the 1st and 2nd from the 1st and the 3rd from the 2nd , an infantry complement equivalent to an army division, composed of well-trained and rested troops of excellent quality, was moved from the Belgian coast to the Somme. The move was as part of a general relief of the divisions opposite the British. On 30 September, the moved up through (Boom Ravine) and relieved the 8th Division on the right of the 4th Division. (Stuff/Regina Trench) was found to have disappeared, due to the effect of the British artillery bombardments. had been dug as a supply route to (Stuff Redoubt) and was on the reverse slope, which proved a considerable advantage against an attack from the south. Reserves could be sheltered nearby at (Boom Ravine), which was difficult for British artillery to bombard from the south, because of the obstruction of the ridge. In the long periods of poor visibility, artillery observation aircraft were grounded, which made British bombardments even more inaccurate but the still had a stream of casualties caused by shellfire. Nightly supply and frequent relief enabled the Marines to hold their positions. Battle1 October= At the 2nd Canadian Division reported to the corps headquarters and corps artillery, that study of aerial photographs showed Regina and Kenora trenches had been insufficiently bombarded but was assured that the bombardment would be completed during the morning. At Brigadier-General Elmsley, the 8th Canadian Brigade commander reported that the wire in front of Regina Trench was uncut, which led to the artillery continuing the wire-cutting bombardment to the last minute. At the Canadian Corps attacked Regina Trench on the higher ground west of Courcelette Trench to consolidate up to Dyke Road and establish a defensive flank on a track to Destremont Farm. The British artillery bombardment increased in intensity to \\"drumfire\\", while the German artillery stayed silent because of a shortage of ammunition, being limited to firing only when the infantry attack began. British aircraft flew overhead at observing for the artillery, strafing the ground when they saw movement and throwing hand-grenades. The British artillery lifted towards and Miraumont and the 8th Division troops saw waves of Canadian infantry advancing, while the division was being relieved by the Marine Brigade. The Germans fired rockets to alert the German artillery, which opened fire immediately. Two 2nd Canadian Division battalions advanced east of the East Miraumont road against spasmodic machine-gun fire and dug in, having moved forward and eliminated bulges at the flanks of the brigade area. An attack by the 23rd Division of III Corps to the right, had also succeeded and gained touch with the Canadians. The 5th Canadian Brigade attacked of the trench west of the East Miraumont road but a German barrage caught the support waves of the right-hand battalion and machine-gun fire swept the leading wave. A few survivors managed to get through the wire and were overwhelmed. The central battalion reached Kenora Trench and dug in under small-arms fire, partly from a flank and the left-hand battalion reached its objective in Regina Trench. The 3rd Canadian Division battalion to the left, was driven back by a German counter-attack and a large party of Germans began to bomb along the trench. By nightfall the 5th Canadian Brigade held most of Kenora Trench and outposts in the West Miraumont road and Courcelette Trench. The 3rd Canadian Division attacked with two 8th Canadian Brigade battalions on the right but a German barrage fell on the front line, a few minutes before zero hour. Both battalions managed to cross no man's land despite machine-gun fire, forced their way into Regina Trench through uncut wire and commenced a bombing fight with I Battalion, Marine Regiment 2 and I Battalion, Marine Regiment 1, which had relieved the 8th Division at the end of September. A counter-attack by the I and II battalions of Marine Regiment 2, overcame the Canadians in mutually costly fighting at on 2 October, when the last Canadian foothold west of the Courcelette–Grandcourt road was abandoned. Preparations began for another attack but bad weather forced a delay. A bombardment was maintained on Regina Trench, despite high winds and poor visibility and the 3rd Canadian Division was relieved by the 2nd Canadian Division by 4 October, which then moved the left flank eastwards, as the 25th Division of II Corps extended its flank. On 6 October, the 1st Canadian Division took over on the right flank of the Canadian Corps which lay east of the Pys road. The Canadians connected their advanced posts along a line about from Regina Trench and sent scouting parties forward each day, who reported that the wire in front of the trench was being cut but that the Germans were putting out \\"concertina\\" wire to fill the gaps. =8 October= The 1st Canadian Division attacked on 8 October at in cold rain. The 1st Brigade on the right with two battalions, took the front trench of the Le Sars line from Dyke Road to beyond the Quadrilateral, then repulsed a counter-attack with artillery-fire. As the Canadians reorganized before resuming the attack on the Quadrilateral, a heavy German bombardment fell in the area and a counter-attack began from two directions. After hours of costly fighting, the Canadians withdrew to their jumping-off trenches when they ran out of bombs. The Canadians had suffered out of and taken . After dark, a trench was dug on the right to link with the 23rd Division. The right- hand battalion of the 3rd Canadian Brigade was delayed by uncut wire but forced its way through and took part of Regina Trench on its right flank. The left-hand battalion was stopped in front of the trench with many casualties and the brigade withdrew at nightfall. A few troops of the right-flank battalion of the 9th Canadian Brigade, 3rd Canadian Division got into Regina Trench through some German sally ports but was overwhelmed. The battalion on the left flank, reached Regina Trench at the junction with Courcelette Trench but was then forced back. Part of the 7th Canadian Brigade reached Regina Trench, began to bomb westwards and also worked up the West Miraumont road but was eventually forced back by German counter-attacks. The left hand battalion was obstructed by new German barbed wire covered by machine-guns and was not able to advance up Kenora Trench. Relief of the Canadian Corps began on 10 October. =21 October= The British attack was delayed from 19 October and began with the 4th Canadian Division on the right and the 18th, 25th and 39th divisions in line to the left, on a front. The fire from guns and howitzers and the field artilleries of seven divisions, was found to have severely damaged Regina Trench and cut most of the wire. The 4th Canadian Division attacked the trench at with the 11th Canadian Brigade, supported by an overhead machine-gun barrage and swiftly captured the trench. East of the Courcelette–Pys road a defensive flank was formed, with outposts pushed forward from Regina Trench; the left-hand battalion linked with troops from the 18th Division. Three German counter-attacks were defeated during the afternoon. The 5th Division, which had relieved the Marine Brigade on was pushed back for . By 22 October, the British had captured from the 28th Reserve and 5th divisions, which were relieved in turn by the 38th Division and the 58th Division, which counter-attacked and Regina Trench to the east on 26 October. The attack was a costly failure, with many casualties in Infantry Regiment 107 of the 58th Division and Guard Reserve Regiment 2 of the 1st Guard Reserve Division. Divisions which had already fought on the Somme and were being sent back, found that their fighting power had been much eroded. =10/11 November= After two months of attacks and constant shelling, the remaining part of Regina Trench to the east of the Courcelette–Pys road was taken by a night attack on by the 4th Canadian Division. The trench was attacked by the 46th (S. Saskatchewan) and 47th (British Columbia) battalions of the 10th Canadian Brigade, with a company of the 102nd Battalion of the 11th Canadian Brigade on the right flank. The Canadians crept close to the German line before the barrage began; after eight minutes the barrage suddenly lifted, the Canadians rushed the trench and surprised the German garrison. Advanced posts were pushed forward in the centre and in trenches leading north-east, towards the line between Le Sars and Pys. The Canadians took mainly from Infantry Regiment 107 of the 58th Division, with some troops from Guard Reserve Regiment 2 of the 1st Guard Reserve Division and four machine- guns, for a loss of several German counter-attacks were defeated. AftermathAnalysis= On 5 October, Gough had issued a Memorandum on Attacks which summarized the lessons of the battle. Gough pointed out that maintaining the momentum of an attack required that succeeding waves and reserves not wait for opportunities to intervene in the battle, because communication delays left them with no time to act. Brigadiers should reorganize the troops holding successive objectives, since these troops became reserves once the advance had moved on and should move with the advance. Divisional commanders should create reserves by reorganizing their brigades. Headquarters should be placed where attacks could be seen, to keep in touch with events when communications broke down, a chronic problem which was increased by distance from the front line. Telephone links in the rear were far easier to maintain but became less important once the infantry battle began. Corps headquarters also had the benefit of air observation and less need of direct communication with troops on the battlefield, since their main role was counter-battery artillery-fire, which was independent of the infantry battle. The attack was to be maintained by the use of reserves moving towards objectives laid down before the attack, to make them independent of messages from the front line, which were often delayed and out of date if they arrived. Reports made after the battle by units of the Canadian Corps stressed that battalion command was impossible once an attack began, companies and platoons needed to be given objectives before the attack and discretion on how to reach them. The attacking troops should have in the line to study the ground, followed by in reserve to receive a detailed briefing. The Canadians suggested that the first wave should not carry tools but a light load of of ammunition, two hand grenades, two days' rations and a ground sheet. Some units pointed out that most of the tools carried by the leading troops were thrown away anyway. The importance of carrying enough hand grenades was stressed, since uncut wire forced the attackers into German communication trenches, where many more were used to fight forward compared to an advance on the surface, which used up the stock intended to repel counter-attacks. Where the wire was cut, the infantry could move above ground, bypassing isolated German defences and leaving them for mopping-up parties. The value of Lewis guns and enough ammunition was emphasised in many reports, as was the importance of moving them forward quickly, to support the infantry and engage German counter- attacks. By the end of the Battle of the Somme, each platoon had a Lewis gun, giving battalion. Opinion divided over the Stokes mortar because of its rate of fire; each bomb weighed about , which meant that it was impractical to carry many forward in an attack. The mortar was most useful in static positions at the rear until supply routes had been built to the new front line. Tanks were judged to be limited in mechanical reliability, mobility and armour protection but useful accessories to infantry operations, having overcome German strong points and diverted German artillery-fire from the infantry.

Most of the men buried at Regina Trench fell in battle between October 1916 and February 1917. The original portion of the cemetery (Plot II, Rows A to D) was established during the winter of 1916–1917. After the armistice in 1918, the Regina Trench location was selected as a \\"concentration cemetery\\" with mortal remains brought in from scattered graves and small battlefield cemeteries around Courcelette, Grandcourt and Miraumont. Unlike many CWGC cemeteries, where men are laid one-to-a-grave, many of the graves contain more than one burial and where two names are shown on the one headstone, it is necessary to count the individual names to find the correct grave location. The CWGC website states that Regina Trench Cemetery is located in Grandcourt but this is somewhat misleading, because while it is located between Grandcourt and Courcelette, it is most easily reached by a rough road that runs approximately north-west of Courcelette village.

The work is regarded as an important contribution to Frankfurt School critical theory. It has been characterized as a critical (largely negative) evaluation of the concept of world disclosure in modern philosophy. An English translation by Frederick G. Lawrence was published in 1987.See occurrences on Google Books. A French translation by Christian Bouchindhomme and Rainer Rochlitz was published in 1988.Jürgen Habermas, Le Discours philosophique de la modernité : Douze conférences (Paris: Gallimard, 1988). . Summary Habermas presents an outline of the “cultural self-understanding of modernity” as it emerged in Europe during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and attempts to retrieve the “historical context of Western rationalism” in which modernity or modernization (more narrowly conceived in terms of social and economic transformation)Habermas summarizes this transformation in the following way: “…the concept of modernization refers to a bundle of processes that are cumulative and mutually reinforcing: to the formation of capital… the development of the forces of production… the establishment of a centralized state power and the formation of national identities; to the proliferation of rights of political participation, of urban forms of life, and of formal schooling; to the secularization of values and norms.” Philosophical Discourse, 2. was originally understood as both a process of disenchantment and alienation as well as the “historical objectification of rational structures.”Habermas, Jurgen, The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity. Tr. by Frederick Lawrence. Cambridge, MA: The MIT Press, 1987. 2 This presentation prepares the ground for the larger argument of the book, namely, that by losing sight of the “cultural impulse of modernity,” and abandoning the project of modernity as a whole, European intellectuals on both ends of the political spectrum have ignored the emancipatory dimension of the European Enlightenment, and thereby have renounced the only means of developing a consistent and immanent critique of modernity itself. Modernity is defined by Habermas as a set of problems related to the issue of time, problems produced by the transformation of European society in accordance with what Hegel called the “principle of subjectivity,” the notion of individual autonomy as the essence of man.‘In modernity… religious life, state, and society as well as science, morality, and art are transformed into just so many embodiments of the principle of subjectivity.” Philosophical Discourse, 18. This freedom from all forms of external authority, which includes nature as well as tradition, means that the subject “has to create its normativity out of itself;”Habermas, Philosophical Discourse, 7 because it is free, it cannot accept any value or law that it does not recognize as its own. Subjectivity, in other words, is defined by “the right to criticism: the principle of the modern world requires that what anyone is to recognize shall reveal itself to him as something entitled to recognition.\\"Habermas, Philosophical Discourse,17 Insofar as the subject wills only those laws that recognizes as rational, laws which are “self-proscribed and self-obligated,” the subject wills only itself, or, in Hegelian terms, it “wills the Will:” “The Will is Free only when it does not will anything alien, extrinsic, foreign to itself (as long as it does so, it is dependent), but wills itself alone – wills the Will. This is the absolute Will – the volition to be free.”G.W.F Hegel, The Philosophy of History, trans. J. Sibree, Buffalo: Prometheus Books. 1991, 442. According to Habermas, Nietzsche undertakes a critique of “subject-centered reason,” of modern forms of knowledge and ethics, from a standpoint that only appears to be “genealogical,” that is, situated, historically, outside of modernity and Enlightenment thinking in an archaic, Dionysian era of myth, prior to the formation of modern subjectivity in the renunciation of instinct or “life.” He sees Nietzsche’s argument that all moral and cognitive claims (along with the rational subject) are the historical products of a power forced inward by its inability to discharge itself not as being based on a genealogy of modernity, but rather as a critique of the modern cognitive and practical subject from the perspective of an equally modern aesthetics (which Nietzsche “transposes,” according to Habermas, “into the archaic”), elevating the “judgment of taste of the art critic into a model for value judgment.” Nietzsche's critique of subject, in other words, is based on a modern aesthetic experience – in particular, the “painful de-differentiation, a de-delimitation of the individual, a merging with amorphous nature within and without” – which presupposes the modern subject itself. What appears, then, in Nietzsche as the historical “other” reason is in fact a version of Kantian aesthetics shorn of any claim of intersubjective validity. Reception The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity is regarded as an important contribution to Frankfurt School critical theory. It has been characterized as a critical (largely negative) evaluation of the concept of world disclosure in modern philosophy.Nikolas Kompridis, Critique and Disclosure: Critical Theory between Past and Future (Cambridge: MIT Press, 2006).

The character is played by Chris Perry-Metcalf. He is the nephew of former student, Peter \\"Tucker\\" Jenkins.  History  When Togger started in Grange Hill in year 7 he found himself to be a prankster with best mates Abel and Andy. Pranking school headmaster MrMcdonald and arch rival Tanya Young. In year 8 Togger hears about the Grange Hill time capsule from Uncle Peter and is determined to find it. Wally catches the lads digging up the school lawn; and the quest lands them in trouble during cross-country. Togger and Abel interview Bill Winston, the oldest surviving Grange Hill pupil, for their class presentation. They do not bother to do any work and discover Bill has died when they make a return visit. Togger agonises whether to tell Andy about Emma, and when events overtake them Andy is furious Togger kept quiet. In year 9 Togger worries he'll be seriously embarrassed by little brother Tigger and his worries prove justified after an eventful Year 7 induction day. Togger is devastated when he fails to get into the football academy, but the demands it places on Abel almost destroys their friendship. Togger rescues Tanya from her abductor and the pair begin to develop an understanding. In year 10 it's another hectic year for Togger, he, Andy and Abel find themselves locked in a shed full of wild animals when Togger should be in \\"detention\\" filming a wedding video with Tanya. Togger is challenged to improve the state of the school toilets; no-one is interested in his crusade and even Andy tells him to throw in the towel. At the end of the year brand-spanking new loos are opened - Togger is pleased with himself. Tanya is elected school rep unopposed when Togger nominates her. Togger and Tanya share a tender moment on the last day of term; Tanya waits for him after school but he's too busy sorting out Tigger's scrape with Mooey. As Tanya walks off into the sunset, Togger is gutted at missing his chance. Year 11 proves to be Togger's most traumatic year at Grange Hill. As if having Tigger at the same school weren't bad enough his sister Lucy has now joined them and to make matters worse she instantly takes a disliking to Tanya's sister Jenny which causes friction between Togger and Tanya. Andy then announces that his parents have withdrawn him from Grange Hill to send him to private school and get him away from Togger whom they consider a bad influence. Tanya meanwhile seems to be dating an older guy much to Togger's chagrin. In an attempt to get Tanya out of his system Togger turns his attentions to Anna Duncan, a year nine girl. At first things seem to go well but when Togger thinks that Baz Wainwright is showing an interest as well he sees history repeating itself after Baz's brief relationship with Tanya the previous year. Togger starts to show resentment and jealousy towards Baz which culminates in football practice when Togger takes his anger out on Baz with a bad tackle which sends Baz crashing to the ground where he stays. When Mr MacDonald examines him he finds that Baz has died. Togger is mortified by what he believes to be the result of his actions and stays away from school for several days unable to face people, especially Baz's girlfriend Holly and best mate Donny Briscoe who blames Togger for Baz's death. Tanya goes to see Togger and the two have a heart to heart which seems to bring them closer. She persuades Togger to return to school but despite the post-mortem showing that Baz's death was nothing to do with Togger but rather a heart defect Donny and several others still blame Togger. Towards the end of the year Togger decides to make a clean break at the end of the year and get away from Grange Hill when his Uncle Peter (Tucker Jenkins) offers him a job on a building site in Germany. He begins to rethink however when he and Tanya share a kiss. On the last day of school Togger is shocked when he is awarded the new Baz Wainwright trophy and Donny finally admits he was wrong for blaming Togger for Baz's death. Togger and Tanya attend the prom together officially as boyfriend and girlfriend and Togger decides to stay on at Grange Hill for sixth form.

The band was one of the most popular performing groups in East Tennessee during the 1920s through the 1940s, gaining initial fame as a backing band in fiddle contests held at Market Hall in Knoxville, Tennessee, and later performing at fairs and other gatherings around the eastern United States. They recorded several sides for Brunswick/Vocalion in 1928 and 1929, which were issued on the Vocalion label. After the death of William Sievers in 1954, siblings James and Willie formed a Hawaiian music group known as Mack's Novelty Hawaiians.Charles Wolfe, The Tennessee Ramblers: Ramblin' On .\\" Old Time Music, Summer 1974, pp. 5-11.

County Records, 1997. Origins William Sievers (the name is sometimes spelled \\"Seivers\\") was born in Elza, Tennessee (now part of Oak Ridge) in 1875 and worked as a barber in nearby Clinton, where James and Willie were born in 1904 and 1909, respectively. William's grandfather and mother had been fiddle players, and his children later recalled that most everyone in the family played an instrument of some sort. William's wife, Myrtle McKinney, occasionally sang with the band in its early years. Aside from his parents, William's influences included an obscure Knoxville fiddle player known as \\"Old Bill\\" Jones (Georgia fiddler Earl Johnson also claimed Jones as an influence) and a Knoxville blues group known as the \\"Kinser Brothers.\\" James Sievers began playing banjo with his cousin, Walter McKinney, in 1913, and learned much of his technique from a north Anderson County banjo player named Steve Cole. Willie initially took piano lessons, but quit after her instructor told her she would only learn an instrument by \\"playing it by ear.\\" She took up guitar shortly thereafter, and would later go on to win several contests.Eugene Chadbourne, \\"[ Tennessee Ramblers -- Biography].\\" Allmusic. Retrieved: 18 December 2008. Within a few years, James and his sister Willie were playing at school assemblies. The two developed what would become a lifelong interest in Hawaiian music during this period, at the same time learning old-time music their father taught them. Career Tennessee Ramblers display at the Museum of Appalachia William Sievers and his two children formed the Tennessee Ramblers in 1922. Walter McKinney typically appeared with the band playing steel guitar or Hawaiian guitar. James chose the name \\"Tennessee Ramblers\\" one night while they were driving to a show in Virginia. Throughout the 1920s, the band played at various venues across the eastern United States. They appeared on numerous radio stations, including WNOK in Knoxville, WLW in Cincinnati, and WFJC in Akron. At the fiddler conventions held by Frank Murphy at Market Hall in Knoxville, the Tennessee Ramblers were often paired with fiddlers Charlie Bowman and Earl Johnson. In February 1928, the Tennessee Ramblers recorded their first record at a Brunswick session in Ashland, Kentucky. The recordings included \\"Cackling Pullet,\\" which is based on the traditional tune \\"Hen Cackle,\\" and \\"Fiddler Contest,\\" which includes a guitar solo by Willie and a banjo solo by James. The session also produced \\"Preacher Got Drunk and Laid His Bible Down,\\" which, as the chorus suggests, is based on the 1909 Robert Hoffman song, \\"I'm Alabama Bound.\\" In August 1929, Brunswick began the first of a series of large-scale recording sessions at the St. James Hotel in Knoxville. At this session, the Tennessee Ramblers recorded \\"Ramblers March,\\" which was written by James, and \\"Garbage Can Blues,\\" which they typically used to open performances. The group recorded several sides at Brunswick's follow- up Knoxville session in April of the following year, but no recordings from this session were released. Willie, however, is believed to have supplied the brief guitar solo on Uncle Jimmy's Favorite Fiddlin' Pieces, recorded at the same session by fiddler Uncle Jimmy Thompson of Grand Ole Opry fame.Charles Wolfe, \\"Notes to Volume 2.\\" In Nashville: The Early String Bands, Vol. 2 (p. 5) [CD liner notes]. County Records, 2000. Later years In 1931, Walter McKinney left the group and moved to the western United States. He was replaced by a mandolin player named Jerry Taylor, who played with the Ramblers throughout the 1930s. In 1938, the Ramblers also added J.T. Jones. The band continued playing at various gatherings around the region, including a large concert in St. Petersburg, Florida in 1932, and continued playing various venues in downtown Knoxville. The Tennessee Ramblers disbanded with the death of William Sievers in 1954. The following year, James and Willie decided to focus on Hawaiian music, and formed a band called \\"Mack's Novelty Hawaiians.\\" This band, which included Jo Adkins on drums, played regularly in downtown Knoxville through the 1970s.

According to legend, she led a march on November 10, 1821 that resulted in the population of Los Santos rising up against Spanish rulers. Although even her existence is disputed, Alfaro is part of popular memory and even is an official symbol of Panama. Biography Rufina Alfaro is said to have had black hair and eyes, tanned skin, and she was tall and thin. The date of her birth, in nearby Las Peñas, is unknown, but she is said to have lived with her parents, and that they were in the business of raising chickens for sale and agriculture. She knew how to read and write and dressed in basquiña, common dress typical of that time. Her village was two miles away from Los Santos and she worked selling eggs and vegetables in the village. At age 22, Alfaro gained prominence by helping to develop a plan to seize the local police fortress, the only breadwinner of the Spanish colonial government. Alfaro had won the sympathy of the Spanish soldiers, because in addition to her beauty, she was distinguished by her fine manners and cheerful talk which allowed her entry into the elegant salons of society. Yet she knew the deep popular resentment against the Crown and that was what convinced her that she should act to support the quest for independence. In that time of government suppression, the press was muzzled and Panamanians who talked about freedom were threatened. The head of the barracks, who had fallen in love with Alfaro, allowed her the entrance to the hall to chat, but she used these meetings to obtain information. She felt sympathy for the soldier, related Horacio Moreno in the Journal Lottery, but suppressed those feelings to help secure the freedom of her people. One day in November 1821, she told the people organizing for independence that the Spanish soldiers were cleaning their weapons, and rather than go out and sell as was her custom, she joined the improvised group of soldiers, to lead a march in which she shouted \\"Viva la Libertad\\" (Long Live Liberty). The people sized the barracks with stones and sticks; and seized the weapons. At dawn of November 10, 1821, they had already achieved their desired freedom, without spilling a single drop of blood.El Panama America. Nov. 10. 1996 Some people deny that Alfaro existed and suggest that she was the product of the popular imagination, and the issue has even been debated in the national parliament. Legacy November 10 is an official public holiday in Panama.

Philippe Antoine Francoise Barbier (2 March 1848 – 18 September 1922) was a French organic chemist. He is best known for his two named reactions in organic synthesis, the Barbier reaction and the Barbier-Wieland degradation, as well as for his role in the creation of organomagnesium reagents with his student, Victor Grignard. Although Grignard was awarded the Nobel prize in 1912 (along with Sabatier) for his discovery, Barbier and Sabatier’s collaborator, Senderens, were snubbed. Grignard himself decried this as an injustice, writing to a friend just days after returning from his Nobel acceptance: “…to tell the truth, and between us, I would even have preferred to wait a little longer, to see the prize shared between Sabatier and Senderens, and then share it myself with Barbier at a later time”. Nevertheless, Barbier’s contributions to the scientific community were plentiful and varied, including work in mineralogy, natural products isolation, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.  Early life and education  Not much is known of Barbier’s early life, largely due to his own destruction of nearly every record of his life shortly after the awarding of the 1912 Nobel prize (there is evidence that these events were linked, but this is largely speculative). It is known, however, that in 1848, Phillipe Barbier was born to Elisabeth Gros and Germain François Barbier, a schoolteacher. There is very little information to be found about his early years until he began secondary education at the College de France. His doctoral studies were performed under Berthelot, where he studied the chemistry of fluorene, coumarin, and derivatives thereof. He also discovered novel reactivity of aromatic hydrocarbons such as stilbene and phenanthrene, providing valuable knowledge about the constitution of coal tar and the useful components therein. In addition, he observed the conversion of pineol into cymene during distillation. The École Supérieure de Pharmacy, with Berthelot at the head of his committee, awarded him the degree of Pharmacist, First Class. After graduation, Barbier worked at the Ecole de Pharmacy de Paris as a preperateur, or laboratory assistant, from 1876-1878. He then served as a lecturer at the Faculte des Sciences de Lyon for a year, and in 1879, he obtained his first professorship at the Faculte des Sciences des Besancon. Finally, he was rehired at the Faculte des Sciences de Lyon as professor of chemistry, where he would remain for the remainder of his career. Selected graduate work completed by Barbier under Berthelot.  Relationship with Grignard and the Nobel Prize  In 1899, Barbier published what would become his most famous paper in the chemical community: the first known study of organomagnesium nucleophiles with carbonyl compounds. Whereas organozinc nucleophiles had been noted previously to undergo similar reactions (such as the Zaytsev reaction), organomagnesiums were significantly more reactive towards carbonyl nucleophiles. Barbier noted, though, that the reaction often suffered from low yields and reproducibility problems. He was well-known to have more ideas than time, so he tasked his new graduate student, Victor Grignard, with improving his developed conditions. Grignard took to the task with great vigor, and just one year later, in 1900, Grignard published on an alternative procedure which consisted of preformation of the organomagnesium compound followed by addition of the carbonyl substrate. Despite paying homage to Zaytsev and Barbier in the acknowledgements of this first publication, and despite citing Barbier’s 1899 communication as the inciting action for his 1900 publication, Grignard would go on to publish on this chemistry and its applications until 1928 as his own intellectual property. Considering that both Grignard and Barbier reported their individual findings as being novel (and that they published separately on the topic), it is difficult to assign credit to one person or the other for the original idea. First examples of the Grignard and Barbier reactions. Though many have speculated on what became of the relationship between teacher and pupil, what is certain is that the two continued to publish together, combining Barbier’s newfound knowledge of terpene chemistry with their joint expertise in organomagnesiums to produce 10 more joint papers over the years.(b) P.

Additionally, in line with Grignard’s statements about the unfairness of the Nobel award he received, he continued to defend Barbier’s contribution to the state of the art (though he claims his input was equally valuable), even taking care to speak with utmost fondness about his “revered master” in a biography written by his son, Robert Grignard. It is difficult to discern the logic behind the Nobel committee’s disregard for Barbier and Senderens. According to colleagues of Grignard’s at Lyon, “…with the exception of Grignard and two other students who knew how to get along with Barbier, the latter would have nothing to do with the world around him”. Barbier did, despite destroying his curriculum vitae and all other evidence of his life, eventually spoke with even tones on the matter, saying publicly, “Grignard has pointed out the rightful share that is due him in a discovery of this kind”. Grignard responded in kind with plenty of public praise for his old mentor. In fact, his inaugural speech as chair of chemistry at Lyons, in 1919, paid homage to Barbier, and the latter's contribution to chemical history, saying: > “Allow me, before starting this discourse, to welcome here the memory of my > dear master, Professor Barbier, and to present to him my utmost gratitude > and admiration. Mr. Barbier has occupied for nearly 40 years this Chair, and > has made it shine most brightly. I do not want to undertake the task of > presenting to you here, even summarily, the work he has accomplished and its > results. I want to emphasize just one point, which should interest you > particularly as students. While fierce battles were fought over atomic > theory, the major powers in education were harmful to each theory and, in > kind, to the educational system of France (much to the benefit of our > neighbors, alas!). M. Barbier enthusiastically adopted the new theories > (which he had understood at once) and gifted to his students an enlightened > perspective. He did not hesitate to sacrifice for what he regarded as the > truth, and he was one of the ardent pioneers who, by demonstrating through > their teaching and their researches all the power of atomic theory, > contributed so effectively to forming the present generation of French > chemists.” The \\"major power\\" referred to here is Barbier's own mentor, Berthelot, whose \\"autocratic influence\\" over French chemical education made Barbier's insightful stance on the matter even more impressive.  Contributions to terpene chemistry  Barbier (in collaboration with Tiemann and his PhD supervisor Marcellin Berthelot) had a . great interest in determining the structures of fragrance compounds. Due to the lack of structural elucidation tools available at the time, most of this work was done using a combination of elemental analysis and qualitative analysis. Structures elucidated by Barbier include myrcenol, citral, linalool (also known as licareol), and puleone. Barbier was also interested in the conversion of fragrance compounds into other fragrance compounds. Examples of this include the conversion of citronellol into rhodinol, geraniol (then known as licarhodol) into linalool (then known as licareol), and geranial into menthone.  Contributions to mineralogy  A sample of barbierite. Barbier's contributions to mineralogy largely concern various feldspars, likely because they were plentiful and yet little was known about their atomic structure. He paid special attention to the establishment of clear designations between the class known as \\"k-feldspars\\" (so called because they are rich in potassium), and soda feldspars (rich in sodium). All k-feldspars have the same chemical makeup, but are different in crystal structure, making them polymorphs of one another. The same is true for all soda feldspars. This meant that before the establishment of atomic theory, it was very difficult to distinguish between these polymorphs. Barbier was in fact the first to publish on the noticeable differences between two of these polymorphs, known as orthoclase and microcline, which eventually led to an understanding that each class of feldspar possessed unique orthoclase and microcline minerals, one of which he discovered for the very first time in Rhone, France. When the US Department of the Interior published their geological survey in 1912, they recommended that this new form of monoclinic soda feldspar should henceforth be called \\"barbierite\\".

It started as a Romanian military campaign on the eastern parts of the self-disarmed Kingdom of Hungary on 13 November 1918, and continued against the First Hungarian Republic, and from March 1919 against the Hungarian Soviet Republic. The Romanian Army occupied large parts of Hungary until 28 March 1920, when eventually retreated back to the demarcation lines.  Background  Béla Linder's pacifist speech for military officers, and declaration of Hungarian self-disarmament on 2 November 1918. Protest of the Transylvanian National Council against the occupation of Transylvania to Romania on 22 December 1918 = Hungary after World War 1.= Aster Revolution, liberal republic and the self-disarmament of Hungary  In 1918, the Austro-Hungarian monarchy politically collapsed and disintegrated as a result of its defeat on the Italian Front (World War I). During the war, the liberal Hungarian aristocrat Count Mihály Károlyi led a small but very active pacifist anti-war maverick fraction in the Hungarian parliament. He even organized covert contacts with British and French diplomats in Switzerland during the war. On 31 October 1918, the Aster Revolution in Budapest brought Count Mihály Károlyi, a supporter of the Allied Powers, to power. The Hungarian Royal Honvéd army still had more than 1,400,000 soldiers when Mihály Károlyi was announced as prime minister of Hungary. Károlyi yielded to U.S. President Woodrow Wilson's demand for pacifism by ordering the disarmament of the Hungarian army. This happened under the direction of Béla Linder (minister of war) on 2 November 1918.Dixon J. C. Defeat and Disarmament, Allied Diplomacy and Politics of Military Affairs in Austria, 1918–1922. Associated University Presses 1986. p. 34.Sharp A. The Versailles Settlement: Peacemaking after the First World War, 1919–1923. Palgrave Macmillan 2008. p. 156\\\\. . Due to the full disarmament of its army, Hungary was to remain without a national defence at a time of particular vulnerability. Oszkár Jászi, Minister for National Minorities of Hungary, offered democratic referendums about the disputed borders for minorities (such as the Romanians in Transylvania); however, the political leaders of those minorities refused the very idea of democratic referendums regarding disputed territories at the Paris peace conference. After the Hungarian self-disarmament, Czech, Serbian, and Romanian political leaders chose to attack Hungary instead of holding democratic plebiscites concerning the disputed areas.  International reactions after the Hungarian self- disarmament  Six days later, on 5 November 1918, the Serbian Army, with the help of the French Army, crossed the southern border of the Kingdom of Hungary. On 8 November, the Czechoslovak Army crossed the northern border, and on 13 November, the Romanian Army crossed the eastern border. On 13 November, Károlyi signed an armistice with the Allied nations in Belgrade. It limited the size of the Hungarian army to six infantry and two cavalry divisions.Krizman B. The Belgrade Armistice of 13 November 1918 in The Slavonic and East European Review January 1970, 48:110. Demarcation lines defining the territory to remain under Hungarian control were made. The lines would apply until definitive borders could be established. Under the terms of the armistice, Serbian and French troops advanced from the south, taking control of the Banat and Croatia. Czechoslovakia took control of Upper Hungary and Carpathian Ruthenia. Romanian forces were permitted to advance to the River Maros (Mureș). However, on 14 November, Serbia occupied Pécs.Breit J. Hungarian Revolutionary Movements of 1918–19 and the History of the Red War in Main Events of the Károlyi Era Budapest 1929. pp. 115–116. The Hungarian self- disarmament made the occupation of Hungary directly possible for the relatively small armies of Romania, the Franco-Serbian army and the armed forces of the newly established Czechoslovakia. During the rule of Károlyi's pacifist cabinet, Hungary lost the control over approximately 75% of its former pre-WWI territories () without a fight, and was subject to foreign occupation.  Interventions, fall of the liberal regime and communist coup d'état  Regional situation, 1918–1920 The Károlyi government failed to manage both domestic and military issues and lost popular support. On 20 March 1919, Béla Kun, who had been imprisoned in the Markó Street prison, was released.Sachar H. M. Dreamland: Europeans and Jews in the Aftermath of the Great War. Knopf Doubleday 2007. p. 409. . On 21 March, he led a successful communist coup d'état; Károlyi was deposed and arrested.Tucker S. World War I: the Definitive Encyclopedia and Document Collection ABC-CLIO 2014. p. 867. . Kun formed a social democratic, communist coalition government and proclaimed the Hungarian Soviet Republic. Days later the Communists purged the Social Democrats from the government.Dowling T.C. Russia at War: From the Mongol Conquest to Afghanistan, Chechnya, and Beyond. ABC-CLIO 2014 p. 447 .Andelman D. A. A Shattered Peace: Versailles 1919 and the Price We Pay Today. John Wiley and Sons 2009. p. 193 . The Hungarian Soviet Republic was a small communist rump state. When the Republic of Councils in Hungary was established, it controlled only approximately 23 percent of the Hungary's historic territory. The Communists remained bitterly unpopular in the Hungarian countryside, where the authority of that government was often nonexistent. The communist party and communist policies only had real popular support among the proletarian masses of large industrial centers – especially in Budapest – where the working class represented a high proportion of the population. The communist government followed the Soviet model: the party established its terror groups (like the infamous Lenin Boys) to \\"overcome the obstacles\\" in the Hungarian countryside. This was later known as the Red Terror in Hungary. The new government promised equality and social justice. It proposed that Hungary be restructured as a federation. The proposal was designed to appeal to both domestic and foreign opinion. Domestic considerations included maintaining the territorial integrity and economic unity of former crown lands, and protecting the nation's borders. The government had popular support and the support of the army. Most of the officers in the Hungarian army came from regions that had been forcibly occupied during World War I. This heightened their patriotic mood.Diner D. Cataclysms: a History of the Twentieth Century from Europe's Edge University of Wisconsin Press 2008. p. 77. Hungary as a federation would appeal to President Wilson under his doctrine of self-determination of peoples due to the nation's multi-ethnic composition. In addition, self-governed and self- directed institutions for the non-Magyar peoples of Hungary would lessen the dominance of the Magyar people. = Romania during and after World War 1. = In 1916, Romania entered World War I on the side of the Allies. In doing so, Romania's goal was to unite all the territories with a Romanian national majority into one state. In the Treaty of Bucharest (1916), terms for Romania's acquisition of territories within Austria-Hungary were stipulated. After three months of war, two-thirds of the territory of the Kingdom of Romania was occupied by the Central Powers. The capital city of Romania, Bucharest was captured by the Central Powers on 6 December 1916. German general August von Mackensen was appointed as the \\"military governor\\" of the occupied territories of Romania. In 1918, after the October Revolution, the Bolsheviks signed a separate peace with the Central Powers in the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. Romania was alone on the Eastern Front, a situation that far surpassed its military capabilities. Therefore, on 7 May 1918, Romania sued for peace. The prime minister of Romania, Alexandru Marghiloman, signed the Treaty of Bucharest (1918) with the Central Powers. However, this treaty was never signed by King Ferdinand of Romania. At the end of 1918, Romania's situation was dire. She was suffering from the consequences of punitive war reparations.Lojko M. Meddling in Middle Europe: Britain and the 'Lands Between', 1919–1925 Central European University Press 2006. Dobruja was under Bulgarian occupation. The German army under the command of Field Marshal August von Mackensen was retreating through Romania. The bulk of the Romanian army was demobilized, leaving only four full-strength divisions. A further eight divisions were left in a reserve status. The four battle-ready divisions were used to keep order and protect Bessarabia from possible hostile actions of Soviet Russia. On 10 November 1918 Romania re-entered the war on the side of the Allied forces, with similar objectives to those of 1916. King Ferdinand called for the mobilization of the Romanian Army and ordered it to attack by crossing the Carpathian Mountains into Transylvania. The end of World War I that soon followed did not bring an end to fighting for the Romanian Army. Its action continued into 1918 and 1919 in the Hungarian–Romanian war.  November 1918 – March 1919  Following the 1918 Treaty of Bucharest, the bulk of the Romanian Army was demobilized. Only the 9th and 10th infantry divisions and the 1st and 2nd cavalry divisions were at full strength. However, those units were engaged in the protection of Bessarabia against the Bolshevik Soviet Russians. The 1st, 7th and 8th Vânători de munte divisions, stationed in Moldavia, were the first units to be mobilized. The 8th was sent to Bukovina and the other two were sent to Transylvania. On 13 November, the 7th entered Transylvania at the Prisăcani River in the eastern Carpathians. The 1st then entered Transylvania at Palanca, Bacău.Mardarescu G.D. Campania pentru desrobirea Ardealului si ocuparea Budapestei (1918–1920) Cartea Romaneasca S.A., Bucuresti, 1922, p. 12. On 1 December, the Union of Transylvania with Romania was officiated by the elected representatives of the Romanian people of Transylvania, who proclaimed a union with Romania. Later the Transylvanian Saxons and Banat Swabians also supported the union.Treptow K. W. A History of Romania fourth edition. Center for Romanian Studies January 2003. .Iancu G. and Wachter M. The Ruling Council: the Integration of Transylvania into Romania (1918–1920) Center for Transylvanian Studies 1995. . On 7 December, Brașov was occupied by the Romanian Army. Later that month, Romanian units reached the line of the Maros (Mureș) River. This was a demarcation line agreed upon by the representatives of the Allied powers and Hungary at the Armistice of Belgrade. At the same time units of the German army, under the command of Marshal August von Mackensen, retreated to the west. Following a request from Romania, the Allied Command in the east under the leadership of French Genenral Louis Franchet d'Espèrey allowed the Romanian army to advance to the line of the western Carpathians. The 7th Vânători division advanced in the direction of Kolozsvár (Cluj), while the 1st division advanced in the direction of Gyulafehérvár (Alba Iulia). On 24 December, units of the Romanian Army entered Cluj. By 22 January 1919, the Romanian army controlled all the territory to the Maros River. The 7th and 1st divisions were spread thin, so the 2nd Division was sent to Nagyszeben (Sibiu) and the 6th Division to Brassó (Brașov). Two new infantry divisions, the 16th and 18th, were formed from Romanian soldiers previously mobilized in the Austro-Hungarian Army. A unified command of the Romanian Army in Transylvania was established. Its headquarters were at Sibiu, with Gen. Traian Moșoiu in command. Although Romania controlled new territories, it did not encompass all the ethnic Romanian population in the region. On 28 February 1919, at the Paris Peace Conference, the council of the Allied nations notified Hungary of a new demarcation line to which the Romanian army would advance. This line coincided with railways connecting Szatmárnémeti (Satu Mare), Nagyvárad (Oradea), and Arad. However, the Romanian army was not to enter these cities. A demilitarized zone was to be created, extending from the new demarcation line to beyond the line. The demilitarized zone represented the extent of Romanian territorial requests on Hungary. The retreat of the Hungarian army behind the western border of the demilitarized zone was to begin on 22 March. On 19 March, Hungary received notification of the new demarcation line and demilitarized zone from French Lieutenant Colonel Fernand Vix (the \\"Vix note\\"). The Károlyi government would not accept the terms and this was a trigger for the coup d'état by Béla Kun, who formed the Hungarian Soviet Republic. Around this time, limited skirmishes took place between Romanian and Hungarian troops. Some Hungarian elements engaged in the harassment of the Romanian population outside the area controlled by the Romanian Army.Constantin Kirițescu. Istoria războiului pentru întregirea României. România Nouă, 1923 volume 2.  April–June 1919  After 21 March 1919, Romania found itself between two nations with communist governments: Hungary to the west and the Russian SFSR to the east. The Romanian delegation at the Paris Peace Conference asked that the Romanian Army be allowed to oust Kun's communist government in Hungary. The Allied council was aware of the communist danger to Romania. However, there was a climate of dissension in the council among U.S. President Woodrow Wilson, British Prime Minister David Lloyd George, and French Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau about guarantees required by France on its borders with Germany. In particular, the American delegation was convinced that French hardliners around Marshal Ferdinand Foch were trying to initiate a new conflict with Germany and Soviet Russia. The Allied council did try to defuse the situation between Romania and Hungary. On 4 April, South African General Jan Smuts was sent to Hungary. He carried the proposition that the Hungarian communist government under Kun abide by the conditions previously presented to Károlyi in the Vix note. Smuts' mission also represented official recognition of the Kun communist government by the Allied council. He may have asked if Kun would act as a conduit for communication between the Allied council and the Bolshevik Soviet Russians.Read A. The World on Fire Random House 2009. p. 161\\\\. . In exchange for Hungary's agreement to the conditions set out in the Vix note, the Allied powers promised to lift the blockade of Hungary and a take a benevolent attitude towards Hungary's loss of territory to Romania, Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia. Kun refused the terms, demanding that Romanian forces return to the line of the Maros River. Smuts' negotiations ceased. Kun stalled for time in order to build a force capable of fighting Romania and Czechoslovakia. Hungary had 20,000 troops facing the Romanian Army and mobilized a further 60,000. There were recruitment centers in towns such as Nagyvárad, Gyula, Debrecen, and Szolnok. There were some elite units and officers from the former Austro-Hungarian Army, but there were also volunteers with little training. The Hungarian troops were equipped with 137 cannons and five armored trains. They were motivated by nationalist sentiments rather than communist ideals. Kun hoped that Soviet Russia would attack Romania from the east. When Kun declined the terms of the Vix note, Romania acted to enforce the new railway demarcation line. The Romanian army in Transylvania included 64 infantry battalions, 28 cavalry squadrons, 160 cannons, 32 howitzers, one armored train, two air squadrons and two pioneer battalions, one north and one south. General Gheorghe Mărdărescu commanded the Romanian army in Transylvania. The commander of the north battalion was General Moșoiu. Romania planned to take offensive action on 16 April 1919. The north battalion was to take Nagykároly (today Carei) and Nagyvárad (today Oradea. This would separate the elite Hungarian Székely division from the rest of the Hungarian army. The north battalion would then outflank the Hungarian Army. Simultaneously, the south battalion would advance to Máriaradna (today part of Lipova) and Belényes (today Beiuș)).  Hostilities begin  Foreign policy scandal: the establishment of the Slovak Soviet Republic = In late May, after the Entente military representative demanded more territorial concessions from Hungary, Kun attempted to \\"fulfill\\" his promise to adhere to Hungary's historical borders. The men of the Hungarian Red Army were recruited mainly from the volunteers of the Budapest proletariat. In June, the Hungarian Red Army invaded the eastern part of the newly-forming Czechoslovak state, approximately the former Upper Hungary. The Hungarian Red Army achieved some military success early on: under the leadership of Colonel Aurél Stromfeld, it ousted Czechoslovak troops from the north and planned to march against the Romanian Army in the east. Kun ordered the preparation of an offensive against Czechoslovakia, which would increase his domestic support by making good on his promise to restore Hungary's borders. The Hungarian Red Army recruited men between 19–25 years of age. Industrial workers from Budapest volunteered. Many former Austro-Hungarian officers re-enlisted for patriotic reasons. The Hungarian Red Army moved its 1st and 5th artillery divisions—40 battalions—to Upper Hungary. On 20 May 1919, a force under Colonel Aurél Stromfeld attacked and routed Czechoslovak troops from Miskolc. The Romanian Army attacked the Hungarian flank with troops from the 16th Infantry Division and the Second Vânători Division, aiming to maintain contact with the Czechoslovak Army. Hungarian troops prevailed and the Romanian Army retreated to its bridgehead at Tokaj. There, between 25–30 May, Romanian forces were required to defend their position against Hungarian attacks. On 3 June, the Romanian Army was forced into further retreat but extended its line of defence along the Tisza River and reinforced its position with the 8th Division, which had been moving forward from Bukovina since 22 May. Hungary at the time controlled the territory from its old borders and had regained control of industrial areas around Miskolc, Salgótarján, Selmecbánya, and Kassa. =Demoralization of the Red Army= Despite promises for the restoration of the former borders of Hungary, the communists declared the establishment of the Slovak Soviet Republic in Prešov (Eperjes) on 16 June 1919. After the proclamation of the Slovak Soviet Republic, the Hungarian nationalists and patriots soon realized that the new communist government had no intentions to recapture the lost territories, only to spread communist ideology and establish other communist states in Europe, thus sacrificing Hungarian national interests. The Hungarian patriots and professional military officers in the Red Army saw the establishment of the Slovak Soviet Republic as a betrayal, and their support for the government began to erode (the communists and their government supported the establishment of the Slovak Communist state, while the Hungarian patriots wanted to keep the reoccupied territories for Hungary). Despite a series of military victories against the Czechoslovak army, the Hungarian Red Army started to disintegrate due to tension between nationalists and communists during the establishment of the Slovak Soviet Republic. The concession eroded support of the communist government among professional military officers and nationalists in the Hungarian Red Army; even the chief of the general staff Aurél Stromfeld, resigned his post in protest. When the French promised the Hungarian government that Romanian forces would withdraw from the Tiszántúl, Kun withdrew his remaining military units who had remained loyal after the political fiasco in Upper Hungary. Kun then unsuccessfully tried to turn the remaining units of the demoralized Hungarian Red Army on the Romanians. Romanian Army operations in April 1919 When Kun became aware of Romanian preparations for an offensive, he fortified mountain passes in the territory controlled by the Hungarian Red Army. Then, on the night of 15–16 April, the Hungarians launched a preemptive attack. The Romanian lines held. On 16 April, the Romanian Army commenced its offensive. After heavy fighting, the Romanians took the mountain passes. On the front of the 2nd Vânători division a battalion of Hungarian cadets offered strong resistance. However, they were defeated by the 9th Regiment. By 18 April, the first elements of the Romanian offensive were completed and the Hungarian front was broken. On 19 April, Romanian forces took Nagykároly (Carei) and on 20 April they took Nagyvárad (Oradea) and Nagyszalonta (Salonta). Rather than following the instructions of the Vix note, the Romanian Army pressed on for the Tisza River, an easily defended natural military obstacle.d'Esperey F. Archives diplomatiques. Europe Z, R 12 April 1919, 47. p. 86.Georges Clemenceau Archives diplomatiques. Europe Z, R 14 April 1919. 47. pp. 83–84. = The Romanian Army reaches the Tisza river = Front lines on 3 May 1919 On 23 April, Debrecen was occupied by Romanian forces.Köpeczi B. History of Transylvania: from 1830 to 1919 Social Science Monographs 2001. p. 791. The Romanian Army then began preparations for an assault on Békéscsaba. On 25–26 April, after some heavy fighting, Békéscsaba fell to Romanian forces. The Hungarians retreated to Szolnok and from there across the Tisza River. They established two concentric defense lines extending from the Tisza River around Szolnok. Between 29 April and 1 May, the Romanian Army broke through these lines. On the evening of 1 May the entire east bank of the Tisza River was under the control of the Romanian Army. On 30 April, French Foreign Minister Stéphen Pichon summoned Ion I.C. Brătianu, the Romanian representative to the Paris Peace Conference. Romania was told to cease its advance at the Tisza River and retreat to the first demarcation line imposed by the Allied council. Brătianu promised that Romanian troops would not cross the Tisza River. On 2 May, Hungary sued for peace via a request delivered by his representative, Lieutenant Colonel Henrik Werth. Kun was prepared to recognize all of Romania's territorial demands; requested the cessation of hostilities; and asked for ongoing control of Hungarian internal affairs. Romania offered an armistice but this was given only under pressure from the Allied council. General Moșoiu became the governor of the military district between the Romanian border and the Tisza River. General Mihăescu became commander of the north battalion. The 7th Division was moved to the Russian front in Moldavia. = Incursions by Bolshevik Soviet Russia = The Union of Bessarabia with Romania was signed on 9 April 1918. The unification act that brought these lands within the modern Romanian state was not recognized by Bolshevik Soviet Russia, but it was occupied with fighting the White movement, Poland and the Ukraine in its war for independence, and resources were not available to challenge Romania. The Bolshevik Soviet Russians might have used Ukrainian paramilitary leader Nikifor Grigoriev to challenge Romania, but circumstances for this plan did not prove favorable. Prior to communist rule in Hungary, Soviet Russia had engaged the Odessa Soviet Republic to invade Romania. Odessa made sporadic attacks across the Dniester River in order to reclaim territory from the Bessarabia Governorate. The Moldavian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, established in 1924, was later used in this way. Romania successfully repelled these incursions. After the commencement of communist rule in Hungary, Soviet Russia pressured Romania with ultimatums and threats of war. Although a Romanian army division and some other newly formed units were moved from the Hungarian front to Bessarabia, these threats did not deter Romania's actions in Hungary. On 9 February 1918, the Central Powers and Ukraine signed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, which recognised Ukraine as a neutral and independent state. Incursions into Romanian territory ceased. From January–May 1919, there were some further limited actions by Soviet forces against Romania. In late January the Ukrainian army under Bolshevik command moved towards Zbruch. Ukrainian forces took Khotyn, a town that had been occupied by Romania since 10 November 1918. Ukrainian forces held Khotyn for a few days before being routed by the Romanian Army. At the time Soviet Russia was fending off attacks by the Armed Forces of South Russia led by Anton Denikin. Three French and two Greek army divisions under General d'Anselme, with support from Polish, Ukrainian and Russian volunteers, attacked Soviet troops near Odessa. On 21 March 1919, in support of the allied attack, Romanian troops of the 39th Regiment occupied Tiraspol. In April, at Berzov, the Bolshevik Soviet Russian 3rd Army defeated d'Anselme's forces, which retreated towards Odessa. In late April a change in government in France led to withdrawal of the Allied forces from Odessa. The troops left by ship, abandoning some heavy equipment. Some troops, with Ukrainian and Russian volunteers, retreated through southern Bessarabia. At the same time the Romanian army fortified its positions in Bessarabia. On 1 May, Bolshevik Soviet Russian Foreign Minister Georgy Chicherin issued an ultimatum to the Romanian government. Romania was ordered to leave Bessarabia. Under the command of Vladimir Antonov-Ovseyenko, Bolshevik Soviet Russian troops gathered along the Dniester River in preparation for a large attack on Bessarabia on 10 May. Bolshevik Soviet Russian attacks in Bessarabia intensified, peaking on 27–28 May with an action at Tighina. In preparation for this attack, the Bolshevik Soviet Russians threw manifestos from a plane, inviting Allied troops to fraternize with them. Sixty French soldiers crossed the Dniester River to support the Russians. The Bolshevik Soviet Russian forces entered Tighina and held the town for a number of hours. The Romanian Army's 4th and 5th infantry divisions were moved to Bessarabia. In southern Bessarabia a territorial command unit formed by the Romanian Army's 15th Infantry Division was established. By the end of June tensions in the area had eased.  July 1919 – August 1919  The Allied council was deeply displeased by the Romanian advance to the Tisza River. Some blamed Romania for the loss of Hungary to communist rule. The Allied council asked Romania to retreat to the first railway demarcation line and commence negotiations with the Kun government. Romania persisted at the Tisza line. The Allied council pressured Hungary to stop its incursions into Czechoslovakia, threatening a coordinated action against Hungary by French, Serb and Romanian forces from the south and the east. However, the Allied council also promised favor to Hungary in subsequent peace negotiations in delineating Hungary's new borders. On 12 June, the Allied council discussed Hungary's proposed new borders with Romania, Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia. On 23 June, Hungary signed an armistice with Czechoslovakia. By 4 July, the Hungarian Army had retreated 15 km south of the Hungarian–Czechoslovak demarcation line. The Allied council demanded that Romania leave Tiszántúl and respect the new borders. Romania said it would only do so after the Hungarian Army demobilized. Kun said he would continue to depend on the might of his army. On 11 July, the Allied council ordered Marshal Ferdinand Foch to prepare a coordinated attack against Hungary using Serb, French and Romanian forces. Hungary, in turn, prepared for action along the Tisza River.World War I: A–D. ABC-CLIO 2005. vol 1\\\\. p. 563. The Romanian army faced the Hungarian army along the Tisza River front line over a distance of . The front extended from beyond Szeged in the south—adjacent to French and Serb troops—to Tokaj in the north—adjacent to Czechoslovak troops. On 17 July, Hungary attacked. = Hungarian Army in July 1919 = Kun's political commissars directed the Hungarian Army, supported by experienced professional military officers. Commanders of small units were experienced soldiers. The Hungarian Army mustered 100 infantry battalions (50,000 men), ten cavalry squadrons (1365 men), 69 artillery batteries of calibers up to 305 mm and nine armored trains. The troops were organized into three groups: north, central and south. The central group was the strongest. Hungary planned to cross the Tisza River with all three groups. The north group would advance towards Szatmárnémeti, the central group to Nagyvárad and the south group to Arad. The aim was to ignite a communist uprising in Romania and incite Bolshevik Soviet Russia to attack Bessarabia. = Romanian Army in July 1919 = The Romanian Army was composed of 92 battalions (48,000 men), 58 cavalry squadrons (12,000 men), 80 artillery batteries of calibers up to 155 mm, two armored trains and some support units. They were positioned along three lines. The first line was manned by the 16th Division in the north and the 18th Division in the south. More powerful units manned the second line: the 2nd Vânători Division in the north, concentrated in and around Nyíregyháza, and the 1st Vânători Division in the south, concentrated in and around Békéscsaba. The third line was manned by Romania's strongest units: the 1st and 6th infantry divisions, the 1st and 2nd cavalry divisions and support units. The third line lay on the railway from Nagykároly, through Nagyvárad and north of Arad. The 20th and 21st infantry divisions were tasked with maintaining public order behind the third line. The first line was thin, as it was supposed to fight delaying actions until the true intentions of the attacking Hungarian army were revealed. After that, together with troops in the second line, the first line was to be held until troops in the third line could mount a counterattack. The Romanian command planned to use the railways under its control to move troops. The Romanian soldier was usually a World War I veteran. = Hungarian offensive = Operations of the Hungarian and Romanian armies during the battle of the Tisza River in July 1919. From 17–20 July, the Hungarian army bombarded the Romanian positions and conducted reconnaissance operations. On 20 July, at about 3 a.m., after a fierce bombardment, Hungarian infantry including all three groups crossed the Tisza River and attacked Romanian positions. On 20 July, in the northern arena, the Hungarians army took Rakamaz and some nearby villages. Troops of the Romanian 16th and 2nd Vânători divisions took back the villages shortly and regained Rakamaz the next day. The Hungarians renewed their efforts and, supported by artillery fire, retook Rakamaz and two nearby villages but could not break out of the Rakamaz bridgehead. Hungarian forces attempted to outflank the Romanian positions by crossing the Tisza River at Tiszafüred with troops of the 80th International Brigade. There they were halted by troops of the Romanian 16th Division. On 24 July, the Romanian 20th Infantry Division, brought in as reinforcements, cleared the bridgehead at Tiszafüred. Not being able to break out of Rakamaz, Hungarian forces fortified their positions and redeployed some troops. There was a lull in fighting in the north, as the Romanian troops did the same. On 26 July, the Romanians attacked, and by 10 p.m. had cleared the Rakamaz bridgehead. This left the Romanian army in control of the northern part of the Tisza's eastern bank. In the southern area, during a two-day battle, the Hungarian 2nd Division took Szentes from the 89th and 90th regiments of the Romanian 18th Division. On 21–22 July, Hódmezővásárhely changed hands several times between Hungarian and Romanian troops of the 90th Infantry Regiment supported by the 1st Vânători Brigade. On 23 July, Romanian forces reoccupied Hódmezővásárhely, Szentes and Mindszent. The Romanians controlled the eastern bank of the Tisza River in this sector, which allowed the 1st Vânători Brigade to move to the center. On 20 July, Hungarian forces established a solid bridgehead on the east bank of the Tisza at Szolnok, opposed by the Romanian 91st Regiment of the 18th Infantry Division. The Hungarian army moved the 6th and 7th divisions across the Tisza River, formed up within the bridgehead, then attacked the Romanians in the first line of defense. The Hungarian 6th Infantry Division took Törökszentmiklós; the 7th Division advanced towards Mezőtúr and the 5th Division advanced towards Túrkeve. On 22 July, Hungarian forces crossed the Tisza River at a point north of Szolnok and took Kunhegyes from the Romanian 18th Vânători Regiment. The Romanian 18th Division was reinforced with units from the second line, including some troops from the 1st Cavalry Division and the entire 2nd Vânători Brigade. On 23 July, Hungarian forces took Túrkeve and Mezőtúr. The Hungarian army controlled an area in length along the bank of the Tisza River and in depth to the east of the Tisza River at Szolnok. The Romanian army undertook manoeuvres to the north of this Hungarian territory. Gen. Davidoglu, commanding the 2nd Cavalry Division, formed closest to the river. Gen. Obogeanu, commanding the 1st Infantry Division, formed in the center and Gen. Olteanu, commanding the 6th Infantry Division, formed furthest to the east. = Romanian counterattack = On 24 July, the Romanian Army's northern maneuver group attacked. Elements of the 2nd Cavalry Division, supported by troops of the 18th Infantry Division, took Kunhegyes. The Romanian 1st Infantry Division attacked the Hungarian 6th Infantry Division and took Fegyvernek. The Romanian 6th Ddivision was less successful, being counterattacked on the left flank by the Hungarian reserve formations. Altogether, the attack pushed back the Hungarian army . Romanian forces were supported by the 2nd Vânători Division and some cavalry units when they became available. On 25 July, fighting continued. Hungarian forces counterattacked at Fegyvernek, engaging the Romanian 1st Infantry Division. With their lines breaking, Hungarian troops began a retreat towards the Tisza River bridge at Szolnok. On 26 July, Hungarian forces destroyed the bridge. By the end of that day the east bank of the Tisza River was once again under Romanian control. = Romanian forces cross the Tisza River = Troops from the 2nd Vânători Division crossing the Tisza River in the presence of King Ferdinand and Queen Marie. Romanian troops entering Budapest. After repelling the Hungarian attack, the Romanian army prepared to cross the Tisza River. The 7th Infantry Division returned from Bessarabia. The 2nd Infantry Division and some smaller infantry and artillery units also returned. The Romanian army massed 119 battalions (84,000 men), 99 artillery batteries with 392 guns and 60 cavalry squadrons (12,000 men). Hungarian forces continued an artillery bombardment. From 27–29 July, the Romanian Army tested the strength of the Hungarian defense with small attacks. A plan was made to cross the Tisza River near Fegyvernek, where it makes a turn. On the night of 29–30 July, the Romanian Army crossed the Tisza River. Decoy operations were mounted at other points along the river, bringing intense artillery duels. Romanian forces held the element of surprise. On 31 July the Hungarian army retreated towards Budapest. = Romanian occupation of Budapest = Hungarian Parliament, Budapest, 1919. Romanian troops in Budapest, 1919. Romanian forces continued their advance towards Budapest. On 3 August, under the command of General , three squadrons of the 6th Cavalry Regiment of the 4th Brigade entered Budapest. Until midday on 4 August, 400 Romanian soldiers with two artillery guns held Budapest. Then the bulk of the Romanian troops arrived in the city and a parade was held through the city center in front of the commander, General Moșoiu. Romanian forces continued their advance into Hungary and stopped at Győr. The incursion of Romania into Hungary caused the heaviest fighting of the war. The Romanian army casualties were 123 officers and 6,434 soldiers — 39 officers and 1,730 soldiers killed, 81 officers and 3,125 soldiers wounded, and three officers and 1,579 soldiers missing in action. As of 8 August, the Romanians forces had captured 1,235 Hungarian officers and 40,000 soldiers, seized 350 guns—including two with a caliber of 305 mm—332 machine guns, 52,000 rifles and 87 airplanes. Aftermath Romanian soldiers feeding the civilian population in Hungary. Romanian infantry patrol in Budapest. On 2 August, Kun fled Hungary towards the Austrian border and eventually reached the Soviet Union. A socialist government under the leadership of Gyula Peidl was installed in Budapest with the assistance of the Allied council, but its tenure was short-lived. The counter-revolutionary White House Fraternal Association attempted to install Archduke Joseph August of Austria as Hungary's head of state and István Friedrich as prime minister. However, the Allied council would not accept a Habsburg as head of state in Hungary, and a new government was needed. = Romanian occupation of Hungary = Romania occupied all of Hungary with the exception of an area around Lake Balaton. There, Admiral Miklós Horthy formed a militia with arms from Romania. Horthy was preparing to be Hungary's new leader at the end of the Romanian occupation. His supporters included some far-right nationalists.Bodo B. Paramilitary Violence in Hungary after the First World War, East European Quarterly 22 June 2004. Horthy's supporters also included members of the White Guards, who had persecuted Bolsheviks and Hungarian Jews, whom they perceived as a communist group given their disproportionate participation in Kun's government.Bandholtz H. H. \\"An Undiplomatic Diary\\" AMS Press 1966. pp. 80–86. Horthy's nationalists and Romanian troops took steps to protect Hungary's Jewish people. The Romanian occupying force also took punitive actions against any revolutionary elements in areas under its control.Sugar, P. F.; Hanák, P. (1994). A History of Hungary. Indiana University Press. p. 310. Initially, Romanian troops provided policing and administrative services in occupied Hungary. Later, under pressure from the Allied council, these roles were returned to the Hungarians. However, in Budapest, only 600 carbines were provided to arm 3,700 policemen. = Romanian reparations = The Allied council was discontented with Romania's conduct during much of the Hungarian–Romanian war. Romania did not follow the Allied council's instructions, for example, by moving west of the Tisza River and by demanding large reparations.Hoover H. The Ordeal of Woodrow Wilson McGraw-Hill 1958 pp. 134–140.Thomas R. The Land of Challenge, a profile of the Magyars Southwest University Press 1998. The Allied council decided that Hungary should pay war reparations in common with the Central Powers. The council pressured Romania to accept the supervision of an Inter-Allied Military Mission to oversee the disarmament of the Hungarian army and to see the Romanian troops withdraw. The Inter-Allied Military Mission committee included General Harry Hill Bandholtz, who wrote a detailed diary of the events Reginald Gorton, Jean César Graziani, and Ernesto Mombelli. Lieutenant Colonel Guido Romanelli, Mombelli's secretary and former military representative of the Supreme Council in Budapest, was accused of being biased against Romania and was replaced. The relationship between the Inter-Allied Military Mission and Romania was one of discord.Pastor, P. (1988). Revolutions and Interventions in Hungary and its Neighbour States, 1918–1919. Social Science Monographs. p. 313. The Allied council requested Romania not make its own requisition for reparations and to return any captured military assets. The Inter-Allied Military Mission requested Romania return to Hungary the largely Hungarian-populated territory between the Tisza River and the first line of demarcation. Romania, under the leadership of Prime Minister Ion Brătianu, did not comply with the requests of the Inter-Allied Military Mission. On 15 November, the Allied council denied Romania reparations from Germany. The outcome of the negotiations was that Bratianu resigned his prime ministership; Romania received 1 percent of the total reparations from Germany and limited amounts from Bulgaria and Turkey; Romania signed a peace treaty with Austria; Romania kept reparations from Hungary; and Romania's border with Hungary was determined. Hungary saw the Romanian conditions of armistice as harsh. It saw the requisitioning of quotas of goods as looting. She was also required to pay the expenses of the occupying troops. Romania sought to prevent Hungary from re-arming and retribution for the plunder of her land by the Central Powers during World War I.A Country Study: Romania. Federal Research Division, Library of Congress. Romania, having been denied by the Allied council, also sought compensation for its entire war effort. Under the terms of the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en- Laye concerning Austria and the Treaty of Trianon concerning Hungary, Romania had to pay a \\"liberation fee\\" of 230 million gold francs to each. Romania also had to assume a share of the public debt of Austria-Hungary corresponding to the size of the former Austria-Hungary territories it now held. In early 1920, Romanian troops departed Hungary. They took with them resources including foodstuffs, mineral ores and transportation and factory equipmentSlavicek, L. (2010).

Hungary ceded all war materials, except for the weapons necessary to arm the troops under Horthy's command. It handed to Romania her entire armament industry as well as 50% of the railway rolling stock (800 locomotives and 19,000 cars), 30 percent of all livestock, 30 percent of all agricultural tools and 35,000 wagons of cereals and fodder. The Allied council confiscated any goods taken by Romania after the 1918 Treaty of Bucharest.Eby C. D. (2007). Hungary at War: Civilians and Soldiers in World War II. Pennsylvania State University Press. p. 4. Controversy exists as to whether Romania's actions amounted to looting in terms of the volume and indiscriminate nature of goods removed from Hungary. Even private motor vehicles could be requisitioned.Barclay, G. (1971).20th Century Nationalism.. Weidenfeld & Nicolson. p. 26.MacMillan, M. (2002). Paris 1919, Six Months that Changed the World. New York: Random House. p. 268. Although public entities in occupied Hungary bore the brunt of the Romanian- imposed reparation quotas, where these were not enough the Romanian occupation authorities requisitioned quotes from private entities, including cattle, horses and grain from farms.

After four years she withdrew her support and the magazine was acquired by Eliot's employer, Faber and Gwyer Publishing (later Faber & Faber).

Together with its rival, Adelphi, edited by John Middleton Murry, it was the leading literary journal of the period. While the former's definitions of literature were based on romanticism allied to liberalism and a subjective approach, Eliot used his publication for expounding his defense of classicism, tradition, and Catholicism. In this contest Eliot emerged a clear victor, in the sense that in the London of the 1930s he had taken the centre of the critical stage.David Goldie, A Critical Difference: T.S.

The station served the Chicago Transit Authority's Congress Line, which is now part of the Blue Line. Kostner opened on August 5, 1962; it was the only station on the Congress Line which was not opened with the line on June 22, 1958. The station closed on September 2, 1973, due to low ridership. History When the CTA planned the Congress Line, they did not plan to put a station at Kostner. The Pulaski and Cicero stations were both close to Kostner, and the CTA felt that the lower population density of West Garfield Park did not need an additional station. It was also trying to cut down on stations in order to reduce travel times and increase efficiency. However, the Garfield Park line, which the Congress Line replaced, had a station at Kilbourn Avenue, and the Congress Line did not have a corresponding station. Neighborhood residents wanted the CTA to build a replacement station at Kostner Avenue. In response to the neighborhood pressure, the Chicago City Council passed an ordinance requiring the CTA and the Chicago Department of Public Works to build a station at Kostner. However, the CTA did not build the station, claiming that ridership at the station would never be high and travel times on the Congress Line would increase. Residents tried to respond, saying that they would be happy with an inexpensive wooden platform and a staircase. Eventually, the residents circulated a petition for the station's construction and threatened to sue the Department of Public Works. The CTA responded to the residents and agreed to build a Kostner station in 1961. The city also agreed to build the station, and the CTA did track, signaling, and electrical work. The construction was complicated by the Congress Line's operation; the city built the station between the Congress Line's tracks, but the line still had to run while Kostner was being built. The CTA solved this problem by creating two temporary bypass tracks around the construction site. Congress Line trains used these tracks from November 2, 1961 to July 8, 1962. Kostner was dedicated on August 3, 1962, at an official ceremony attended by Mayor Richard J. Daley and opened to the public two days later, on August 5. As the CTA predicted, the station never had high ridership. Station entrances peaked at 258,000 in 1967 and fell steadily after that to 137,791 in 1972, its last full year of operation. Kostner closed on September 2, 1973, as part of a group of budget-related CTA station closings; it was one of the shortest-lived CTA stations. The CTA never demolished Kostner, and the boarded-up station still sits on its original site. Structure The abandoned platform at Kostner in March 2008 The station in June 1967 Like the other Congress Line stations, Kostner consisted of a station house on the east side of Kostner Avenue overpass and an island platform in the median of the Eisenhower Expressway. Where Kostner differed from the other stations, though, was in its size and design due to its expected low ridership and late addition to the system. The station house was typical of Congress Line stations, but it was more modest in size. It had one agent's booth, one entrance turnstile, and one exit turnstile. The station house was long and wide, less than the standard by . The platform, however, was , the standard length on the Congress Line. Kostner also did not have ramps to the platform like most Congress Line stations; instead, it had a single staircase. Since Kostner was never intended to be part of the Congress Line, the CTA put a curve in the tracks at the station site. This curve caused the Kostner platform to be curved, which created visibility issues for operators. To aid the operators, a series of mirrors was installed along the station. A canopy covered the entire platform, and eight windbreaks also provided shelter. The CTA removed signage from the platform when Kostner closed, but it is otherwise intact. The station house is now boarded up and fenced off, but it is also intact.

It was brought into existence in 1921, and initially consisted of a few former Austro-Hungarian Navy vessels surrendered at the conclusion of World War I and transferred to the new nation state under the terms of the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye. The only modern sea-going warships transferred to the new state were twelve steam-powered torpedo boats, although it did receive four capable river monitors for use on the Danube and other large rivers. Significant new acquisitions began in 1926 with a former German light cruiser, followed by the commissioning of two motor torpedo boats (MTBs) and a small submarine flotilla over the next few years. When the name of the state was changed to Yugoslavia in 1929, the name of its navy was changed to reflect this. In the late 1920s, several of the original vessels were discarded. Throughout the interwar period, elements of the fleet conducted visits to ports throughout the Mediterranean, but few fleet exercises occurred due to budget pressures. In 1930, the Maritime Air Force was divorced from Royal Yugoslav Army control, and the naval air arm began to develop significantly, including the establishment of bases along the Adriatic coast. The following year, a British-made flotilla leader was commissioned with the idea that the KM might be able to operate in the Mediterranean alongside the British and French navies. In the same year, five locally-built minelayers were added to the fleet. A hiatus of several years followed, and it was not until 1936 that any further major acquisitions were made, with the purchase of eight German-built MTBs. Over the next two years, the fleet was significantly strengthened by the acquisition of three French-designed destroyers, marking the high point of Yugoslav naval strength. On the eve of World War II, the navy consisted of 611 officers and 8,562 men, operating 41 combatant ships and 19 auxiliaries. While the KM was largely captured by Italian forces during the German-led Axis invasion of Yugoslavia in April 1941, a few of its vessels, aircraft and their crews escaped and served in the Mediterranean under Royal Navy control during the remainder of World War II. When the Italians sued for peace in September 1943, most of the remaining vessels were taken over by the German Kriegsmarine or the Navy of the Independent State of Croatia. Towards the end of the war, the Allies transferred a corvette to Yugoslav control. At the end of the war, the few remaining vessels were transferred to the control of the new Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia. As the post-war Yugoslav Navy drew its lineage from the naval forces of the wartime Yugoslav Partisans rather than the KM, few of the customs and traditions of the KM survived in the successor force. HistoryOrigins= In mid-to-late 1918, as World War I drew to a close, the Austro-Hungarian Empire began to break apart, and local committees began assuming responsibility for administration from the central government. In October 1918, the self-proclaimed National Council of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs was established in Zagreb, and later that month there were discussions between the Austro-Hungarian Navy and representatives of the National Council regarding the future of the Austro-Hungarian fleet. There was even an exchange of delegates between the National Council and the Austro-Hungarian naval staff in Vienna. By the end of that month, the \\"sailor's councils\\" that had been formed aboard Austro-Hungarian warships at the main base of Pola had decided that they would leave their ships by 1 November, regardless of the political discussions that were ongoing. On 30 October, the Austro-Hungarian naval staff directed its commanders to hand over all naval and riverine vessels to representatives of the National Council. The following day, the Emperor Charles ordered the handover of all naval vessels, establishments and fortresses to the National Council. By 4:30 pm that day, the orders had been carried out. The National Council appointed Rear Admiral Dragutin Prica as the Navy Commissioner and Captain Janko Vuković de Podkapelski as fleet commander. The Italians were extremely uneasy about the rise of a new naval power in the Adriatic Sea, and on the night of 31 October, two Royal Italian Navy personnel penetrated the base at Pola and set naval mines under the keel of , the dreadnought battleship which was also Vuković's flagship. When it exploded, the ship sank, with the loss of 400 crew, including Vuković. As Prica was ill, the National Council appointed Captain Metodije Koch as Navy Commissioner and promoted him to rear admiral on 2 November. The Armistice of Villa Giusti between the Allies, the United States and Austria-Hungary was signed on 3 November, and came into force the following day. Its naval provisions included a requirement that Austria-Hungary hand over the bulk of its naval vessels to Allied and United States control and disarm the remainder. Included in the handover were 42 modern warships and submarines. Italy immediately began to occupy the former Austro-Hungarian coast and offshore islands, and demanded the handover of the vessels then under the control of the National Council. Koch requested authority to retain control over four destroyers, but this was denied by the Allied Naval Council. Later that month, the Italians convinced the Allied Naval Council to force the remaining crews off most of the vessels. On 1 December 1918, the new South Slav state, the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (KSCS, later Kingdom of Yugoslavia) was created, joining the Kingdom of Serbia with those South Slav lands formerly part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Later that month, the Serbian Ministry of Army was dissolved, and a new Ministry of Army and Navy was created. By January 1919, there were a total of 35 former Austro-Hungarian vessels in port which had a total of 600 Yugoslav crew members aboard. The National Council dissolved the Navy Commissioner's office in February and Koch was appointed as the head of the Navy Department within the Ministry of Army and Navy. During that month, the Italians finally disembarked all remaining crew from former Austro-Hungarian vessels, leaving the nascent KSCS Navy without any ships. In April, Koch's office was moved to the capital, Belgrade. The final fate of the former Austro-Hungarian vessels was determined by the Allied powers during the Paris Peace Conference, which also decided territorial disagreements between Italy and the KSCS. While the territorial questions in Dalmatia were largely decided in favour of the KSCS, Italy was more successful in denying the KSCS most of the former Austro-Hungarian fleet. The unrealistic demands of the KSCS in this regard contributed to their lack of success. For example, in April 1919, the KSCS asked for control over four cruisers, 17 destroyers, 27 ocean-going torpedo boats, and 20 submarines. Rebuffed, in May 1920 the KSCS reduced its claims to two ageing cruisers, six destroyers, 24 torpedo boats and four submarines. Even this more modest demand was rejected. alt=a black and white photograph of several ships at a dock In October 1920, the question was finally settled when the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye provided for the transfer of the obsolete coastal defence ship , eight s, four older s, the repair ship Cyclop, the water carriers Najade and Nixe, the salvage vessel Gigant, three tugs, the yacht Dalmat, four hulks, four river monitors (Bosna, Enns, Körös and Bodrog), one motor launch, three river tugs, 16 small tenders, and a significant number of coal and oil lighters. All of these vessels were formally taken over by the KSCS at the beginning of March 1921. As the only modern sea-going vessels left to the KSCS were the 12 torpedo boats, the new nation had to build its naval forces from scratch. =Establishment= Many former Austro-Hungarian naval personnel were incorporated into the new navy, 90 per cent of whom were of Croatian or Slovene ethnicity. The remainder were Serbs, or non-Slavs such as Germans. Their former ranks were recognised and, initially at least, rank insignia and regulations were adopted from the former Austro-Hungarian Navy. By 1922, the KM consisted of 124 officers and about 3,000 men. The number of officers had more than halved since the end of 1919, largely due to disillusionment. To fill the looming shortfall, around 20 graduates from each of the 1921 and 1922 classes of the Yugoslav Military Academy in Belgrade were sent to the KM. In 1923, the new Naval Academy at Gruž accepted its first class of 40 midshipmen, who were to undergo a three- year training course. All entrants to the Naval Academy had to be between 17 and 20 years of age, and graduates of high school or similar nautical school. Two specialist schools for petty officers were established, one at Šibenik for deck crew, and a machinist's school at Kumbor in the Bay of Kotor. Mine and torpedo training was conducted at Đenovići, as was pilot and air observer training. A gunnery school was established at Meljine in the Bay of Kotor. Šibenik was also the home of the main coastal radio station, the signals school and the basic and specialist training school for seamen. alt=a black and white photograph of a boat on a river In September 1923, new regulations were promulgated, dividing the navy into a fleet, a river flotilla, and naval aviation. Later that month a Naval Command was established, based in Zemun, near Belgrade. The Navy Department, now known as Navy Section, was then only responsible for purely administrative matters, with Naval Command responsible for all operational questions. The service's initially unrealistic expansion goals of 24 destroyers and 24 submarines were soon shelved, and by the end of 1923 the fleet consisted of eight 250t-class torpedo boats, four Kaiman-class torpedo boats, six s, four Schichau-class minesweepers, the water carrier Perun (ex-Cyclop), the yachts Vila (ex-Dalmat) and Lada (ex-Quarnero), the training ship Vila Velebit, the salvage vessel Moćni (ex-Gigant), and four tugs. Kumbor (ex-Kronprinz Erzherzog Rudolf) had been sold for scrap in 1922, and three of the minesweepers were disposed of in 1924, as were the four hulks. The four river monitors remained in service, as Vardar, Drava, Morava and Sava respectively. They were supported by two motor patrol boats and three river tugs. The shore establishments were developed from those inherited from the Austro-Hungarian Navy, and included Tivat in the Bay of Kotor. It was home to the Tivat Arsenal, a naval yard which was expanded to repair and overhaul larger vessels; it included two floating docks, one of and one of capacity. The apprentice school and diving school were also established there, along with the main supply base. A capacity floating dock was acquired for the private Yarrow Adriatic shipyard at Kraljevica, and a subsidiary of the French Ateliers et Chantiers de la Loire shipyard was established at Split, equipped with two more floating docks, one of , and one of capacity. The riverine vessels were usually repaired at the Novi Sad subsidiary of the Arsenal, and overhauls were completed at Sartid Works in Smederevo. =Interwar activities=1923–1929 alt=a black and white photograph of a ship at dock The early development of the navy was hampered by severe budget limitations and a lack of interest from the general staff which consisted of former Royal Serbian Army generals with little appreciation for naval matters. A Navy League () was established to promote public interest in the navy. In 1925, Prica conducted exercises off the Dalmatian coast, involving the majority of vessels. In 1926, the navy was able to make its first significant acquisition, the former Imperial German Navy light cruiser , which was renamed Dalmacija. She was refitted at the Tivat Arsenal prior to commissioning. The following year, two British-built Thornycroft Uskok-class motor torpedo boats (MTBs) were acquired, named Uskok and Četnik, and a base was built for them at Šibenik. In 1927, the first two submarines were purchased, the British-built Hrabri class—Hrabri and Nebojša. Over the next two years, two further submarines were brought into service, the French-built Osvetnik class, which consisted of Osvetnik and Smeli. The submarine flotilla was based at Tivat, supported by the depot ship Hvar (ex-Solun), acquired in 1927. Between 1928 and 1930, a number of former Austro-Hungarian vessels were discarded, including the four Kaiman-class torpedo boats. In 1929, the salvage ship Moćni was scrapped, and the German-built Spasilac was acquired to replace her. In late 1928, the naval aviation school was transferred from Đenovići to Divulje near Split, where a new seaplane station was established. In the same year, the seaplane depot ship Zmaj was acquired from Germany. In May and June 1929, a squadron, under the command of Prica and consisting of Dalmacija, Hvar and the two Hrabri-class submarines, visited Malta, Corfu and Bizerte. Also in 1929, the former Austro-Hungarian water carrier Najade, now named Sitnica, was re-employed as an auxiliary for the submarine flotilla, despite its lack of a workshop for repair work. In late 1929, Navy Command and Navy Section were combined as part of the Ministry of Army and Navy, with the navy commander holding the rank of admiral, and his deputy with the rank of vice-admiral. By that time, the Yugoslav fleet consisted of the light cruiser Dalmacija, the eight 250t-class seagoing torpedo boats, the two Uskok-class MTBs, four submarines, six Galeb-class minetenders, one minesweeper, the submarine depot ship Hvar, the training ship Sitnica, two yachts Vila and Lada, and five tugs. The riverine flotilla consisted of the four monitors and the river auxiliary Srbija. In total, the navy comprised 256 officers and 2,000 men, with a naval reserve consisting of 164 officers and 570 men. Less than half of the officers were former members of the Austro-Hungarian Navy, and 49 officers had graduated from the Naval Academy. In October, Prica retired as navy commander and was replaced by Vice-Admiral V. Wickerhauser. 1930–1940 alt=a black and white photograph of two ships at dock In January 1929, King Alexander changed the name of the country to the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, and the navy became the Royal Navy (, Краљевска Морнарица, KM). In April 1930, the salvage vessel Spasilac was added to the fleet, and the following month the submarine Nebojša was damaged when she collided with a steamer. In July, the two Hrabri-class submarines and Sitnica made a Mediterranean cruise, visiting Alexandria and Beirut. The appointment of a chief of the Maritime Air Force in 1930 signified the separation of naval aviation from army control, with a strength of around 1,000 officers and men, of whom about 80 were pilots. Around 120 naval aircraft were in service. In 1931, the fleet expanded significantly with the completion of the British-built flotilla leader Dubrovnik. The flotilla leader concept involved building large destroyers similar to the World War I Royal Navy V and W-class destroyers. In the interwar French Navy, these ships were known as contre-torpilleurs, and were intended to operate with smaller destroyers, or as half-flotillas of three ships. The KM decided to build three such flotilla leaders, ships that would have the ability to reach high speeds and with a long endurance. The long endurance requirement reflected Yugoslav plans to deploy the ships into the central Mediterranean, where they would be able to operate alongside French and British warships. The onset of the Great Depression meant that only one ship of the planned half-flotilla was ever built. Five locally-built Malinska- class minelayers were also added to the fleet in 1931. The following year, a new German-built brigantine sail training ship, Jadran was acquired, and Wickerhauser retired and was replaced by Vice-Admiral N.N. Stanković. The 250t-class torpedo boat T4 ran aground and was broken up in 1932. In 1932, Stanković assured the British naval attaché that Yugoslav naval policy was focused on the defence of her coastline, but he also opined that this task would require significant expansion of the navy, including the acquisition of six cruisers and five more flotilla leaders similar to Dubrovnik. In the same year, Dubrovnik sailed to the Black Sea then visited several ports in the Mediterranean with King Alexander and Queen Marie aboard. During 1932, the Maritime Air Force had bases at Divulje and Đenovići, with two bomber squadrons and one reconnaissance squadron at each base, each squadron consisting of 12 aircraft. In 1934, the British naval attaché reported that the French had significant influence on Yugoslav naval policy. In the same year, the KM comprised 517 officers and 6,461 men, and Stanković retired and was replaced by Rear-Admiral M. L. Polić. In October, Hrabri and Smeli conducted visits to various Mediterranean ports. Despite the fact that a half- flotilla of large destroyers was not going to be built, the idea that Dubrovnik might operate with a number of smaller destroyers persisted. In 1934, the KM decided to acquire three such destroyers to operate in a division led by Dubrovnik. In August 1935, Dubrovnik visited Corfu and Bizerte, the seaplane carrier Zmaj along with three Galeb-class mine tenders also visited Corfu, and Hrabri and Osvetnik visited Malta. In 1936, eight German-built Orjen-class MTBs were added. Also in 1936, a new naval coastal command was established under the command of a rear admiral. It was headquartered in Split, and included shore-based commands at Selce, Šibenik and Đenovići. By the end of that year, the KM consisted of 27 surface combatants, four submarines, and around a dozen auxiliary vessels, crewed by a total of 487 officers and about 5,000 men. The yacht Lada had been disposed of, as had the minesweeper D2. The training ship Sitnica had been converted into a second submarine depot ship, and the Galeb-class mine tenders had been reclassified as minelayers. The river flotilla consisted of the four monitors, the royal yacht Dragor, two patrol boats—Graničar and Stražar, and three river tugs; Cer, Triglav and Avala. However, in 1936 the only vessels ready for war service were Dubrovnik and the four submarines, and the navy was only considered capable of patrol duties and coastal surveillance, minelaying and minor raids against enemy shipping. Despite this, the United States naval attaché observed that the morale and discipline of the navy was very good. He further stated that higher-level commanders appeared discouraged at the poor position of the navy due to its inadequate budget. He concluded that the fleet was in very good condition considering its funding. During 1936, Nebojša and Osvetnik visited Corfu, and Zmaj and three Galeb-class mine tenders also visited Corfu. alt=a black and white photograph of a ship underway In 1936–1937, the fleet was significantly strengthened by the acquisition of three Beograd-class destroyers, the French-built Beograd, and the locally- built Zagreb and Ljubljana. Naval communication via teletype was established to connect Naval Command in Zemun with bases at Selce, Split, Šibenik and Novi Sad. Split was also connected to Divulje, and Đenovići was connected with the Tivat Arsenal. In 1937, the Naval Command was renamed the Naval Staff, and a Naval Staff College was established at Dubrovnik. Considerable effort was made to bring the fleet to sound seagoing condition, with a refit of Dalmacija. Dubrovnik was considered to be in good repair, but the two French-built submarines needed constant work. The eight new Orjen-class MTBs were found to be unseaworthy in rough conditions, but satisfactory in fair weather. Dubrovnik visited Istanbul, Mudros and Piraeus in August, and Zmaj, Hrabri and Smeli visited Crete, Piraeus and Corfu in August and September. In 1938, the navy consisted of 611 officers and 8,562 men. A Balkan Naval Conference was conducted in the same year, during which the Chief of the Naval Staff declared that in case of war, the Yugoslav fleet would concentrate on coastal defence, except for occasional submarine forays. The Maritime Air Force could field a total of 40 aircraft, but only the 12 Dornier Do 22s and 12 Dornier Do Js were considered to be of any value in modern warfare. Dubrovnik visited Alexandria, Beirut and Corfu in August 1938. In 1939, a new destroyer Split was laid down, and two coastal German Type IIB submarines were ordered, but due to the outbreak of World War II, Split was not completed and the submarines were never delivered. In 1939, the British observed that the commander-in-chief of the Yugoslav Navy, Polić, was \\"amiable but ignorant\\" and had little technical knowledge regarding naval matters. In the same year, the 250t-class torpedo boat T2 was broken up for scrap. In January 1940, Ljubljana struck a reef off Šibenik and sank. She was raised and placed in dry dock at the Tivat Arsenal for repairs. =Prior to the April 1941 invasion= alt=a black and white photograph of a small ship On the eve of the German-led Axis invasion of Yugoslavia, the KM comprised 41 combatant ships and 19 auxiliaries, effectively divided into ships capable of offensive and defensive tasks, and ships intended for peacetime training, logistics and minelaying tasks. The former category included Dubrovnik, the three Beograd-class destroyers (although Ljubljana was in dry dock being repaired), the four submarines, eight Orjen-class MTBs and two Uskok-class MTBs. Of the submarines, only the two French-built ones were considered fully combat-ready. The latter category consisted of Dalmacija, six Galeb-class minelayers, six 250t-class torpedo boats, five Malinska-class minelayers, and the training and auxiliary ships Jadran, Zmaj, Hvar and Sitnica. The Maritime Air Force consisted of 150 seaplanes, of which 120 were combat-capable, the remainder being training aircraft. The combat aircraft were mainly Do 22s, Do Js and Do D types. Although torpedo-capable aircraft were in service, no air-launched torpedoes were available. There were significant weaknesses in the KM prior to the invasion. One was the failure to subordinate the Naval Surveillance Command to respective sectors of Naval Coastal Command, and another was giving responsibility for two sectors of Naval Coastal Command to what were essentially training establishments. =Naval operations during the invasion of 1941= When Germany and Italy attacked Yugoslavia on 6 April 1941, the initial attacks came from the air. From early morning, Italian and German aircraft attacked the naval facilities at Split and the Bay of Kotor. In the afternoon, Italian dive bombers attacked the Bay of Kotor. Their attack damaged a Do J flying boat, but one of the Italian aircraft was shot down by anti-aircraft fire, while another two were damaged. Shortly after this more Italian bombers unsuccessfully attacked the Tivat Arsenal, suffering three aircraft damaged in the attack. On the same day, three KM Dornier Do 22s and Rogožarski SIM-XIV-Hs provided air cover while the Galeb-class minelayer Jastreb laid a minefield off Budva harbour. The following day, three Italian bombers became lost in cloud and emerged over the Bay of Kotor where two were damaged and one shot down by anti-aircraft fire. On 8 April, there were Italian attacks on the base of the 2nd and 3rd Torpedo Divisions in Šibenik, and three Do J flying boats were destroyed by Italian fighters at Jadrtovac. A number of Do 22s and SIM-XIV-Hs also flew reconnaissance missions on that day. The next day, Italian bombers struck a number of Yugoslav naval and seaplane bases along the coast, destroying and damaging several aircraft. One Do 22 pilot located an Italian convoy crossing the Adriatic and despite heavy anti- aircraft fire attacked it twice without result. Another three KM Do 22s raided Durazzo in Italian-controlled Albania, but were driven off. To prevent a bridgehead being established at Zara, an Italian enclave on the Dalmatian coast, Beograd, four 250t-class torpedo boats and six MTBs were dispatched to Šibenik, to the south of Zara, in preparation for an attack. The attack was to be coordinated with the 12th Infantry Division Jadranska and two combined regiments () of the Royal Yugoslav Army attacking from the Benkovac area, supported by the Royal Yugoslav Air Force's 81st Bomber Group. The Yugoslavs launched their attack on 9 April, but the naval prong of this attack faltered when Beograd was damaged by near misses from Italian aircraft off Šibenik when her starboard engine was put out of action, after which she limped to the Bay of Kotor, escorted by the remainder of the force, for repairs. The Italian aerial bombardment of Kotor badly damaged the minelayer Kobac, which had to be beached to prevent its sinking. On 10 April, the 2nd Hydroplane Command at Divulje began to disintegrate, with some pilots flying their aircraft to the Bay of Kotor to join the 3rd Hydroplane Command. One Do 22 attacked an Italian tanker off Bari, claiming a near miss that the Yugoslav crew believed to have caused some damage. The following day, Italian dive bombers attacked MTBs of the 2nd Torpedo Division near Šibenik, with the Yugoslav boats shooting down one Italian aircraft and damaging another. At the start of the campaign, the river monitors had carried out offensive operations by shelling the airfield at Mohács in Hungary on 6 April and again two days later, but had to begin withdrawing towards Novi Sad by 11 April after coming under repeated attack by German dive bombers. Early in the morning of 12 April, a squadron of German dive bombers attacked the Yugoslav monitors on the Danube. Drava was hit by several of them but they were unable to penetrate her thick deck armour, until by chance, one put a bomb straight down the funnel, killing 54 of the 67 crew. During the attack, the monitors' anti-aircraft gunners claimed three dive bombers shot down. The remaining three monitors were scuttled by their crews later on 12 April as German and Hungarian forces had occupied their bases and the river systems upon which they operated. The crews then gathered on a tugboat and attempted to flee to the Black Sea. While the boat was passing under a bridge near Zemun, it was attacked by Axis aircraft. Several bombs struck the bridge, causing it to collapse on the tug, and killing all but three of the crew. =Aftermath= alt=a black and white photograph of the main gun of ship with a group of men around it The Italians captured most of the KM in port, including Ljubljana, which had spent the duration of the invasion in dry-dock. However, Zagreb was blown up and scuttled at the Bay of Kotor by two junior officers, Sergej Mašera and Milan Spasić, to prevent her capture. The submarine Nebojša and two Orjen-class MTBs escaped to Alexandria to join the Allied cause. A fourth destroyer, Split, was captured while under construction in the Kotor shipyard, but the Italians were not able to complete her before they sued for peace in September 1943. She was completed by the Yugoslav Navy after the war. Ten Maritime Air Force aircraft escaped to Greece, with nine eventually making it to Egypt, where they formed a squadron under Royal Air Force command. The three Yugoslav ships that escaped capture were used to create a KM-in-exile. The force was led by Captain I. Kern, who was attached to the Yugoslav government-in-exile in London, and operated with the British Mediterranean Fleet from bases in Malta and Alexandria. A number of the captured Yugoslav warships, notably Dubrovnik, Beograd and the repaired Ljubljana, were employed by the Italian Regia Marina until the armistice in 1943, whereupon the German Kriegsmarine, and to a lesser extent the Navy of the Independent State of Croatia, appropriated the surviving vessels for their own fleets. Ljubljana was wrecked on a shoal near the Gulf of Tunis whilst in Italian service in April 1943, and Dalmacija entered German service with her previous German name Niobe, but was soon transferred to the Croatian navy as Zniam. Beached on Silba island, she was destroyed by British MTBs in December 1943. Dubrovnik and Beograd were not sunk by Allied forces until April and May 1945 respectively. In early 1944, the Royal Navy Flower-class corvette Mallow was transferred to the KM-in-exile as Nada. In August 1945, following the end of World War II in Europe, the British government ordered the navy to disband. Its assets were transferred to the newly constituted post-war Yugoslav Navy, where they continued their service. The post-war Yugoslav Navy drew its insignia and traditions from the Partisan naval forces that evolved from armed fishing vessels operated along the Adriatic coast from late 1942, so few of the traditions of the KM were carried over to the post-war navy. The British government gave the personnel of the KM-in-exile the choice of being repatriated or remaining in exile. Of these, 93 men chose to stay abroad. The British government briefly housed them in military camps before allowing them to move to countries of their choosing. OrganisationPeacetime= The peacetime organisation of the KM remained essentially unchanged from 1929 until the invasion of Yugoslavia. The Naval Command in Zemun formed part of the Ministry of Army and Navy, and controlled Navy Headquarters. Navy Headquarters consisted of the staff, archives, main naval radio station and the navy newspaper, and controlled six branches; the fleet, River and Lake Forces, Maritime Air Force, Coastal Defence Command, Naval Surveillance Command, and shore establishments. The exact composition of the fleet varied considerably as vessels were added and disposed of, but from 1938 it usually comprised three torpedo divisions, a submarine division and a training squadron, reaching its maximum strength during the summer training period each year. The minelayers were usually part of the Coastal Defence Command, but were detached to the fleet during naval exercises, as were naval aviation squadrons. The Maritime Air Force consisted of three seaplane commands each of two groups, the naval aviation school and the seaplane depot ship Zmaj. =Wartime= In case of war or national emergency, the Naval Staff was to become directly subordinate to the Supreme Command. The Naval Staff would command the fleet, river flotilla, Maritime Air Force and Naval Coastal Command. All other naval establishments would remain under the control of the Navy Section of the Ministry of Army and Navy. There were a few exceptions to these general arrangements. For example, the naval detachments on Lake Ohrid and Lake Scutari were subordinated to the local army districts, and the Naval Coastal Command was subordinated to the Royal Yugoslav Army's Coastal Defence Command. In case of mobilisation, the navy would need to requisition about 250 sea-going and 25 river vessels. Logistics and personnel The primary base for the KM was in the Bay of Kotor on the southern Adriatic coast. It encompassed the Tivat Arsenal and a number of schools and other establishments. Other bases were located at Šibenik in central Dalmatia and Selce in the northern Adriatic. The Yugoslav coastline extended for , and there were over 600 Yugoslav islands in the Adriatic. The main riverine port was at Novi Sad on the Danube. Throughout its existence, the KM struggled with logistical difficulties associated with foreign-made ships and naval armament. The KM grew from slightly over 3,000 officers and men soon after its establishment to a strength of more than 9,000 immediately prior to World War II. Ship crews ranged from 240 for the flotilla leader Dubrovnik and 145 for the Beograd-class destroyers, to just five for the Uskok-class MTBs.

All non-glass contaminants must generally be removed from the glass prior to recycling. The processes used in glass crushing for recycling involves the same methods used by the aggregate industry for crushing rock into sand (rock crusher). Vertical shaft impactor (VSI) glass crushing The use of VSI crushers in large scale operations allow the production of up to 125 tons per hour () of crushed glass cullet. VSI crushers use a high speed rotor with wear-resistant tips and a crushing chamber designed to 'throw' the glass against. The VSI crushers utilize velocity rather than surface force as the predominant force to break glass as this allows the breaking force to be applied evenly both across the surface of the material as well as through the mass of the material. In its shattered state, glass has a jagged and uneven surface. Applying surface force (pressure) results in unpredictable and typically non-cubicle particles. As glass is 'thrown' by a VSI rotor against a solid anvil, it fractures and breaks along fissures. Final particle size can be controlled by 1) the velocity at which the glass is thrown against the anvil and 2) the distance between the end of the rotor and the impact point on the anvil. The product resulting from VSI crushing is generally of a consistent cubicle shape which may optimize yield in consumptive applications such as the fabrication of fiberglass, ceramic ware, flux agents and abrasives. Due to the highly abrasive nature of the glass material, a VSI crushing process is generally preferred over Horizontal Shaft Impact and most other crushing methods with higher maintenance and lower wear part lives. VSI crushers generally utilize a high speed spinning rotor at the center of the crushing chamber and an outer impact surface of either abrasive resistant metal anvils or crushed glass (or rock in an aggregate applications). Utilizing cast metal surfaces 'anvils' are traditionally referred to as a \\"Shoe and Anvil VSI\\". Utilizing crushed material on the outer walls of the crusher for new material to be crushed against is traditionally referred to as \\"rock on rock VSI\\".

Jean-Nicholas Huyot (December 25, 1780, Paris - August 2, 1840, Paris) was a French architect, best known for his 1833 continuation of work on the Arc de Triomphe from the plans of Jean Chalgrin. Biography Son of a builder, Huyot attended the École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts in Paris, and won the Prix de Rome in 1807. Following his study in Rome, between 1817 and 1821 Huyot traveled in Asia Minor, Egypt, and Greece. He developed significant credentials as an antiquarian. He was part of the Cléopâtra expedition under Louis Nicolas Philippe Auguste de Forbin in 1817, and Huyot sent to Jean- François Champollion a collection of inscriptions he'd found in the temple of Ramses II at Abu Simbel; this contribution was helpful in Champollion's work in deciphering hieroglyphics. Huyot also provided technical archeological assistance to the Fine Arts section of the French scientific Morea expedition into Greece in 1823. In 1822 Huyot was elected a member of the Academy of Fine Arts of the Institut de France. Among his architectural students were Hector Lefuel, Alexis Paccard, Jean-Louis Victor Grisart, Jean-Charles Danjoy and the Swiss architect Melchior Berri. Beginning in 1823 Huyot began presenting lectures in classical architectural history at the École des Beaux-Arts, lectures that influenced a group of self-stylized \\"romantic\\" architectural students including Félix Duban, Henri Labrouste, Léon Vaudoyer and Louis Duc. This group in turn was influential in establishing neo-Classicism as a style in mid-19th Century France. At his death he bequeathed to the National Library a large collection of drawings and plans. He was buried in the cemetery of Père-Lachaise (8th division).

Playing career  Whittaker began his career with Manchester League side Molyneaux. He had a short spell with Buxton, but returned to Molyneaux before joining Newton Heath in February 1896 as a replacement for William Douglas, who had transferred to Derby County. Whittaker was one of four goalkeepers Newton Heath tried following Douglas' departure (including their regular left-half Walter Cartwright), but the team lost all three matches Whittaker appeared in; he was transferred to Fairfield at the end of the season. After a season away, Whittaker returned to the Football League with Second Division side Grimsby Town in May 1897, playing in all but two of the club's matches in the 1897–98 season. In May 1898, Whittaker transferred to Southern League club Reading, where he played for almost two seasons before returning to The Football League with Blackburn Rovers in February 1900. After just over 50 league appearances for Blackburn, Whittaker rejoined Grimsby Town – newly promoted to the First Division – in December 1901. The club narrowly avoided relegation at the end of the 1901–02 season, but they were unable to repeat the feat in 1902–03, and at the end of the season, after 47 more appearances for Grimsby, Whittaker transferred to Derby County to remain a First Division player. Whittaker was predominantly Derby's second-choice goalkeeper in 1903–04, making just 12 league appearances out of a potential 34, before returning to the Southern League with Brentford in May 1904. After two years with Brentford, he moved back to Reading for a season, before returning to the Football League again in 1907 with Second Division side Clapton Orient. After making 90 Football League and six FA Cup appearances in three years with the London side, he made a final return to the Southern League First Division with Exeter City in July 1910.  Management career  In July 1912, Whittaker was appointed as the first manager of Swansea Town and spent two years with the newly elected Southern League Second Division club in a player-manager capacity. In his first season with Swansea, he won the Welsh Cup and guided the team to third place in the league. After leaving Swansea, he took over as player-manager at nearby Llanelly, but his time there was cut short by the outbreak of the First World War.

The Superfund program of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) protects the public and the environment by requiring cleanup of the nation’s worst hazardous waste sites.http://www.epa.gov/region4/waste/sf/index.htm History The plant operated from 1902 until 1981, when the company filed for bankruptcy. Before 1950, creosote was the primary wood preservative chemical, and after 1950 pentachlorophenol (PCP) became the preferred chemical. Prior to 1970, operators discharged liquid process wastes into two onsite, unlined, percolation ponds which were allowed to overflow into Bayou Chico and Pensacola Bay. Later, workers drew wastewaters off the ponds periodically and discharged them into designated \\"spillage areas\\" on site. Additional discharges occurred when heavy rainfall flooded the ponds, which then overflowed their dikes. Contamination concerns The site is in a predominantly residential area, with commercial properties along the northern boundary. Though the area is served by municipal water supplies, numerous residents and businesses operate private irrigation wells. Major contaminants in the soil, sediment, and groundwater are volatile organic compounds (VOCs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), PCP, and dioxins and dioxin-like compounds from the former wood-treating processes.

Cortines returned as Los Angeles superintendent in October 2014, and his contract was extended in June 2015 for another year, through June 2016.  Early life and career  Cortines was born in San Antonio, Texas. He briefly served as Superintendent of Schools in LA in 2000 and has headed a total of five school districts nationally. Cortines had also served in the U.S. Army from 1953-1955. During the early 1960s Cortines served as Activity Director for Covina High School and later with South Hills (in West Covina) High School and soon moved up as the former Superintendent of Schools in the California cities of Pasadena, San Francisco, San Jose, along with being a former New York City Schools Chancellor. He was appointed to lead the New York City Schools in September 1993 by the former New York City Board of Education, serving during the last months of the administration of Mayor David Dinkins and during the first years of the administration of Mayor Rudy Giuliani. Cortines and Giuliani feuded for much of their shared tenure, with Giuliani being critical of Cortines' running of the schools. Cortines stepped down from the chancellorship in October 1995, going into the private sector. Following his tenure in New York, Cortines served as a Senior Advisor to the U.S. Secretary of Education during the tenure of former Education Secretary Richard Riley. Before accepting the chancellorship, Cortines had been nominated to serve as Assistant Secretary of Education for Intergovernmental Affairs by President Bill Clinton, but he withdrew his nomination before his was confirmed by the U.S. Senate. Cortines served as LA's interim Superintendent for several months in 2000, before former Colorado Gov. Roy Romer assumed the position. = Los Angeles Deputy Mayor = From 2006 to 2008, Cortines served as LA's Deputy Mayor for Education, Youth and Families in the Cabinet of Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa. As deputy mayor, Cortines oversaw education policy for the mayor, was his liaison to the school district, along with overseeing various agencies and policies impact children and families, including parks and recreation. Cortines left this position to become Senior Deputy Superintendent of Schools. In 2012, a year after Cortines retired, the district announced a $200,000 settlement with a mid-level administrator, Scot Graham, who accused Cortines of sexual harassment. The deal later unraveled and Graham sued Cortines and the district. One suit was dismissed on technical grounds, and a second suit was withdrawn, according to L.A. Unified. After Cortines returned as superintendent in 2014, Scot Graham filed a new lawsuit with claims of sexual harassment against Cortines in February 2015. =Los Angeles Unified= During one of his stints at LAUSD, Superintendent Cortines had dual jobs as a board member from the Scholastic board, and as Superintendent of LAUSD. The Los Angeles Times reported that he was paid $150,000 while serving at the Scholastic board, in addition to $250,000 as Superintendent of LAUSD. Cortines defended his tenure at Scholastic, and claimed he avoided any issue which involved the educational publishing company. Cortines resigned from the Scholastic board on February 18, 2010.  Office of Inspector General  A notable controversy occurred six months after Cortines was named Superintendent of LAUSD, after he proposed to reduce funding for the Office of Inspector General (OIG) by 75%. During this time, LAUSD was operating under a significant budget shortfall. The Inspector General of OIG, Jerry Thornton, a retired FBI agent, came to a compromise with Cortines to reduce OIG's budget by 25% instead. Subsequently, Cortines and the LAUSD Board members refused to extend Thornton’s contract. Thornton had previously produced audit and investigative reports that showed misuse of funds, lack of financial controls and many conflict-of-interest charges against senior district management. Notable reports include excessive consultant costs at the district's construction program, over $20 billion, largest in the country, as well as millions in excessive and unwarranted consultant charges against the Office of Environmental Health and Safety. Cortines eventually suspended and replaced many of the senior staff mentioned in Thornton’s audits. Thorton left on June 30, 2010. Cortines selected, and the Board approved, Jess Womack, former deputy general counsel for the LAUSD construction program, as interim Inspector General. Interim Jess Womack continued OIG investigations of LAUSD senior management. A notable report was released four months after Jerry Thornton’s departure, which found “irregularities in $65 million worth of consultant contracts.” This includes costs that exceeded pre-approved amounts by 50% and additional contracts worth $31 million without school board approval, specifically against James Sohn, Chief of Facilities, whom Cortines had hired to replace the prior chief, Guy Mehula. Cortines responded to this by canceling $3.7 million in consulting contracts cited in the report, but left open the possibility these consultants and contracts would return. Cortines originally retired as superintendent of the Los Angeles Unified School District on April 16, 2011. In June, 2011 the school board announced that the downtown high school for the arts would be renamed Ramon C. Cortines School of Visual and Performing Arts.School Board press release, June 14, 2011. Retrieved 2015-10-30  Third tenure  In 2014, Cortines returned for a third time to lead LAUSD following the resignation of Superintendent John Deasy. On December 15, 2015, Cortines ordered all LAUSD schools to close for the day after receiving a bomb threat. Cortines is retiring and his successor has not yet been named. The L.A. Board of Education met early Tuesday morning to discuss the school closures and to continue its discussions for a new schools' chief, although Cortines remains in charge.

Background alt=A map of a path across a portion of the Atlantic Ocean. The track starts near the Cape Verde Islands, and heads generally west- northwestward. South America is depicted on the lower-left side of the map. Hurricane Georges began as a tropical wave that moved off the coast of Africa during mid-September 1998. Tracking westward, the wave spawned an area of low pressure two days later, which quickly strengthened into a tropical depression. On September 16, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Georges, and to Hurricane Georges the next day. The storm reached its peak intensity on September 20 with winds of 155 mph (250 km/h), just below Category 5 status on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. Over the following five days, the hurricane tracked through the Greater Antilles, causing over 600 fatalities, mainly in Haiti and the Dominican Republic. By September 25, Georges entered the Gulf of Mexico as a Category 2 hurricane. The storm made landfall three days later near Biloxi, Mississippi with winds of 105 mph (165 km/h). Upon landfall, the hurricane's forward motion slowed to an eastward drift. Georges continued to diminish until it completely died down on October 1 near the Atlantic coast of Florida. Impact Georges was already a weakened hurricane upon reaching Haiti, but cities and other areas of low elevation were still in danger of high winds, mudslides, and flooding. Haiti's capital received minimal damage. The rest of the country, however, experienced a significant number of flash floods due to deforestation along the mountains. Mudslides destroyed or severely damaged many houses, leaving 167,332 homeless. Floods left the greatest impact along the northern coastline. On the southern coast, the head of a U.S.-based medical team, stranded for several days by flooding in the remote town of Belle Anse, anticipated a rise in malnutrition, disease, homelessness and poverty. Hurricane Georges caused citizens to have no access to clean water, which added to the already unsanitary conditions from dirty flood water and rampant diseases. In all, there were at least 400 fatalities. Like in the Dominican Republic, the agricultural sector suffered extreme damage. After a severe drought in 1997, Georges's severe flooding stopped any chances of recovering quickly. Most of the country's significant crop land, including Artibonite Valley, suffered total losses. Up to 80% of banana plantations were lost, while vegetable, roots, tubers, and other food crops were destroyed. In addition, thousands of livestock were missing. Total agricultural losses amounted to $179 million (1998 USD, $281 million 2019 USD). Aftermath The country requested food assistance in the aftermath of the hurricane to alleviate the serious losses. Organizations such as the BHR/OFDA offered monetary assistance and provided limited amounts of resources such as blankets, water, and plastic sheeting. CWS sent some of its members to Haiti to scope the extent of aid needed and provided kits containing cleaning supplies and toiletries. CWS and FEMA partnered together to gather volunteers and oversee rebuilding efforts. Cuba provided medical assistance and gave additional training to Haitian doctors through an agreement made with Haiti.Kirk, Emily, and John M.

The film is a sequel to Ong Bak 2 (2008) and follows the story of the warrior Tien (Tony Jaa), who had been captured by the ruthless warlord Lord Rajasena (Sarunyu Wongkrajang). Tien escapes from Rajasena's clutches, recovers from his crippling injuries with the help of Master Bua (Nirut Sirijanya), and returns to confront Bhuti Sangkha (Dan Chupong), who has replaced Rajasena as the primary villain. Plot In the year 1431 in Thailand, Tien (Tony Jaa) is held captive being beaten with wooden staves. On the orders of Lord Rajasena (Sarunyu Wongkrajang), his elbows and knees are snapped. As Lord Rajasena sleeps, Tien's guerilla fighters attempt to free Tien, but Bhuti Sangkha (Dan Chupong) appears and kills them. Lord Rajasena offers to hire Bhuti, but he refuses and gives the offer to remove the curse which has been placed on Rajasena before leaving. Rajasena orders his men to kill Tien, but before this can be carried out, a man arrives with a pardon from the king, indicating that he will take Tien, much to Rajasena's ire. The messenger returns Tien to the Kana Khone villagers. After fending off the village from invaders who are after Tien, Master Bua (Nirut Sirijanya) feels guilty over Tien's imprisonment and becomes a Buddhist monk. Pim (Primrata Det-Udom) heals Tien to life, but finds that Tien is still crippled from his beatings. Tien then embarks on a rehabilitation regimen with the help of Master Bua. Rajasena visits Bhuti at his temple to remove his curse, but Bhuti reveals his true motive of usurping Rajasena and becoming the new king. After a battle, Bhuti decapitates Rajasena, but his severed head curses Bhuti. After meditating, Tien returns to his village to find it in ruins, and the surviving villagers kidnapped and enslaved by Bhuti. Bhuti uses his magic to summon an eclipse. When Pim reveals herself as Tien's companion, she is taken to Bhuti's palace, where she is killed. Tien witnesses this killing from a statue and fights his way through the guards before confronting Bhuti, who launches a spear at Tien's chest. As he falls to his knees, defeated, he remembers Bua's words, and finds himself again atop the statue. Overcoming Bhuti's illusion, lightning strikes and Bhuti's eclipse magic is dispelled. Bhuti attempts to escape but is confronted by Tien. Bhuti attempts again to throw a spear at Tien, who catches and throws it aside. On the royal ledge above the arena, Tien's upright finger tips hold Bhuti aloft by his chin. Suddenly an elephant's trunk butts the doors below the ledge, causing Bhuti to fall from Tien's grasp. Bhuti falls, over the elephant's tusks. The camera pans as we watch Bhuti dying on the ground, pierced by the elephant's broken tusk. As he breaths his last breath, the elephant, now resembling the one tusk Ganesha, raises his head in a victorious trumpet. Beginning life anew, with good having triumphed over evil, the final scene opens as Tien, Pim and the remaining villagers, pray before the statue of Ong Bak.

Both Empire and Film Business Asia praised the action scenes but pointed out the weak story. Film Business Asia gave the film a five out of ten rating praising the action sequences but finding that it made Ong Bak 2 \\"look like a masterpiece of character development.\\" Variety and Total Film found the film spent too much focus on Buddhist philosophy that left not enough time for the action scenes. Total Film awarded the film two stars out of five, stating that \\"a greater focus on Buddhist philosophy...leaves little room for the sort of bone-crunching, no-frills set-pieces that first brought Jaa to our attention.\\" Slant Magazine gave the film three stars out of four praising it as \\"easily the most brutal of all the contemporary Thai martial arts films that have come to the U.S. thus far. But that's what characterizes the Thai style of fighting films: inspired excess and decadence.\\" Video game Ong Bak Tri is being developed by Studio Hive and will be published worldwide by Immanitas Entertainment for PC, smartphones, PlayStation Network, and Xbox Live Marketplace.

The war continued to rage on Christmas and skirmishes occurred throughout the countryside. Celebrations for both troops and civilians saw significant alteration. Propagandists, such as Thomas Nast, used wartime Christmases to reflect their beliefs. In 1870, Christmas became an official Federal holiday when President Ulysses S. Grant made it so in an attempt to unite north and south. War activities On the first Christmas Day during the war, Lincoln hosted a Christmas party during the evening; earlier that day, he spent many hours trying to legitimize the capture of Confederate representatives to Great Britain and France, John Slidell and James Murray Mason (the Trent Affair).Long p.151 U.S. President Abraham Lincoln and his son Thomas \\"Tad\\" Lincoln In 1862, the Lincolns visited injured soldiers at the various hospitals.Long p.301 Many Union soldiers in 1863 received gifts \\"From Tad Lincoln\\", as Tad had been deeply moved by the plight of Union soldiers when he was taken by his father to see them. The gifts were mostly books and clothing.Toy Soldier Tree Herbert Hoover Presidential Library and Museum The most famous Christmas gift Lincoln ever received came on December 22, 1864, when William Tecumseh Sherman announced the capture of Savannah, Georgia.Long p.615 Military exercises also took place on December 25. In 1861, a blockade runner was caught by the Union navy, and there were two skirmishes in Virginia and Maryland. In 1862, there were several skirmishes, and Confederate general John Hunt Morgan engaged in his famous Christmas Raid in Kentucky. On that day, Morgan's men destroyed everything they could of the improvements that the Louisville & Nashville Railroad had made along 35 miles of track from Bacon Creek to Lebanon Junction.Herr p.37 There was also a military execution for desertion that the soldiers were forced to witness.\\"Ought it not be a Merry Christmas?\\" Fort Ward Museum In 1863, Union forces destroyed Confederate salt works at Bear Inlet, North Carolina and, in South Carolina, there were skirmishes between the Union navy and Confederate artillery on the Stono River and near Charleston.Long p.449 In 1864, the Confederates fiercely repelled the Federal assault of sixty warships on Fort Fisher and several skirmishes were fought in the western theater of the war. Celebrating A silk Christmas card, ca. 1860 Soldiers not actively campaigning celebrated Christmas in several ways. Union soldiers would use salt pork and hardtack to decorate Christmas trees.Christmas North and South CivilWarStudies.org Others were treated to special meals; a captain from Massachusetts treated his soldiers to foods such as turkey, oysters, pies, and apples. However, many soldiers received no special treats or privileges. In one incident on December 25, 1864, 90 Union soldiers from Michigan, led by their captain, dispensed \\"food and supplies\\" to poor Georgians, with the mules pulling the carts decorated to resemble reindeer by having tree branches tied to their heads. In some units, celebrating Christmas was not allowed. On December 25, 1862, soldiers of one unit were punished for celebratory gunfire for the holiday, when actually the gunfire was for a funeral salute. Carols, hymns, and seasonal songs were sung during the period, with some, such as \\"Deck the Halls\\", \\"Oh Come All Ye Faithful\\", and Mendelssohn's \\"Hark, the Herald Angels Sing\\" (1840), still sung today. American musical contributions to the season include \\"It Came Upon a Midnight Clear\\" (1850), \\"Jingle Bells\\" (1857), \\"We Three Kings of Orient Are\\" (1857) and \\"Up on the Housetop\\" (1860). Although popular in Europe at the time, Christmas cards were scarce in the United States, and would not enjoy widespread use until the 1870s.Collins, p.56 Henry Wadsworth Longfellow wrote his pacifist poem, \\"Christmas Bells\\" on Christmas Day 1864 at the news of his son Lieutenant Charles Appleton Longfellow having suffered severe wounds in November during the Mine Run Campaign. The poem was set to the tune \\"Waltham\\" by John Baptiste Calkin sometime after 1872 and has since been received into the established library of Christmas carols. The carol does not include two stanzas from the original poem that focused on the war.Griffin, Pam. The songs of Christmas spread the real meaning of season The Destin Log, December 18, 2008Studwell pp.166-7 For children, Christmas was altered during the war. Presents were fewer, especially in the devastated South. In We Were Marching on Christmas Day, author Kevin Rawlings notes that some southern children worried about the Union blockade, and one little girl, Sallie Brock Putnam, plotted the course Santa Claus would have to take to avoid it. Sometimes fathers on both sides were allowed furlough, and children were said to react to their fathers as if seeing \\"near strangers\\".Marten p.120 Excuses for a lack of Santa included Yankees having shot him. Nast cartoons and other propaganda A husband and wife separated by the war (Nast, 1862) Thomas Nast, who used his editorial cartoons to issue Union propaganda,Lively, James. Propaganda Techniques of Civil War Cartoonists The Public Opinion Quarterly, Vol. 6, No. 1 (Spring, 1942) made several illustrations reflecting the war. The one for Christmas Eve 1862, which ran in the January 1863 issue of Harper's Weekly shows a wife on one side praying though a window in one circle, and in another circle shows her husband on the battlefield, also in prayer.Thomas Nast's Original \\"Civil War Christmas\\" Print Sonofthesouth.net The same issue's cover started how Santa Claus would be perceived by future Americans, as a white-bearded Santa hands such gifts as socks to Union soldiers, while also holding a Jefferson Davis dancing puppet with a rope tied around its neck to imply his execution.Thomas Nast's Original Civil War \\"Santa Claus In Camp\\" Print Sonofthesouth.net The Christmas 1863 issue showed the couple back together.Christmas in the Civil War Historynet.com Lincoln welcomes Confederate soldiers (Nast, 1864) The Nast Christmas cartoon for 1864 was a more conciliatory piece, showing Lincoln inviting Confederate soldiers into a warm lodge hall full of merriment.Thomas Nast's Original \\"The Union Christmas\\" Civil War Print Sonofthesouth.net Lincoln called Nast's use of Santa Claus \\"the best recruiting sergeant the North ever had\\". Nast was not the only one to use Christmas as a propaganda tool. On the Union side, The New York Herald also engaged in propaganda. One illustration published in the paper included Santa Claus fuming that he could not reach southern children, due to the northern blockade. On the Confederate side, The Richmond Examiner described Santa to its young readers as \\"a Dutch toy monger\\" who was a New York/New England \\"scrub\\" and Hottentot that had nothing to do with traditional Virginian celebrations of Christmas.

Essentially, the session resulted in the most commercially oriented record he made, complete with two pop covers and a laidback, swinging vibe. That wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing, but the band sounds constrained by the material and their desire to make the music appeal to a wide audience ... no one sounds particularly enthusiastic, including Mobley. In fact, Mobley's presence on the record feels strangely minimal. Only during \\"Good Pickin's\\" -- a laidback bop original that's easily the best thing here -- does he come alive, weaving a spell with long, liquid lines, but its subtle grace just illustrates the problems with this curiously bland record\\".

The genus occurs throughout Southeast and South Asia, and currently contains seven species. Asian leaf turtles average in length. They are mostly brown to greenish in color, with round to rectangular shells. Their carapaces bear a superficial resemblance to plant leaves, hence their common name. They can be found around shallow, slow-moving bodies of water in hilly forests. Adults are primarily terrestrial, though juveniles are more aquatic. Taxonomy and nomenclature Cyclemys turtles belong to the family Geoemydidae under the subfamily Geoemydinae. They were first described in 1834 by English zoologist Thomas Bell in his work A Monograph of the Testudinata. Cyclemys and closely related genera (Cuora, Pyxidea, and Notochelys) are believed to have diverged from a common Heosemys- like ancestor. The characteristic round carapace of the genus, shown here by an adult Cyclemys dentata Cyclemys taxonomy and phylogeny have been historically difficult to ascertain due to the morphological similarity between species, as well as changes in the color patterns during growth. Until recently, the genus was thought to comprise only one or two morphologically variable species, C. dentata and C. oldhamii.Asian Turtle Trade Working Group 2000. Cyclemys dentata. In: IUCN 2010. IUCN Red List of Threatened Species . Version 2010.4. Retrieved March 25, 2011. Subsequent investigation has now put the number of species under the genus to seven, though this remains controversial. The status of C. enigmatica as a valid species is contested, as is the recognition of C. atripons and C. pulchristiata, both of which are nearly impossible to tell apart morphologically. Previously recognized species, C. tcheponensis ( = C. tiannanensis) and C. shanensis, have been merged into C. oldhamii following mtDNA sequencing. The conclusions of which showed that the morphological differences between them (the presence or absence of neck/head stripes, and hatchling color patterns) were not enough to classify them as separate species. C. ovata has been similarly subsumed into C. dentata. The two distinct morphological differences between Cyclemys species are based on the main color of their plastrons - species with yellow bellies (C. atripons, C. dentata, and C. pulchristiata), and species with dark bellies (C. enigmatica, C. fusca, C. gemeli, and C. oldhamii). Synonyms of Cyclemys (ex errore) include: Cyclemus Li, Cyclemis Good, and Cyclemy Mao. The generic name Cyclemys comes from the Greek (, meaning 'round' or 'circle', referring to the shape of the carapace) and (; 'freshwater turtle'). They are known under the common name Asian leaf turtles or simply leaf turtles, again because of the appearance of their carapaces. They share the collective name 'leaf turtles' with turtles of the genus Geoemyda, as well as turtles with 'leaf' in their names, such as the Annam leaf turtle (Mauremys annamensis), among others. 'Asian leaf turtle' is also the specific common name of C. dentata.  Description  The pattern of scutes on the carapace (upper left) and plastron (upper right) of the shell of Cyclemys: Shown in broken lines are the secondary divisions of the abdominal scutes, a distinguishing characteristic of the genus which only occurs in adults. Cyclemys turtles are characterized by more or less round carapaces, which are typically dark green, brownish, tan, or olive in color. The shell may have a prominent vertebral keel running from head to tail. Serrated marginal scutes are common in juveniles. In adults, only the posterior marginal scutes are serrated. Adults of Cyclemys also develop a joint in the middle of their plastrons (known as a plastral hinge), enabling them to articulate the front and rear halves to some extent. Unlike the closely related Cuora, which can completely close its shell because of the hinge, Cyclemys plastral hinges only close the shell partially. The plastral hinge may also play a significant role in facilitating egg-laying in adult females. A distinguishing characteristic of the genus is the secondary division of the abdominal scutes (the middle pair of scutes in the plastron) due to the development of the plastral hinge as the turtle matures. It eventually leads to the formation of small triangular additional scutes between the abdominal and pectoral scutes. Cyclemys turtles are cryptodires, having the ability to pull their heads straight back and vertically into their shells instead of folding them sideways like pleurodires. The head varies between species from dull to striped with bright red or orange bands of color. The plastron can have a dark or light (tan to yellow) background which can be uniform or patterned with fine lines radiating from the center of each plastral scute. Their feet are partially webbed and well developed for either aquatic or terrestrial mobility. They can grow to about in length. Cyclemys species achieve sexual maturity after seven to 12 years, earlier for males and later for females. Sexual dimorphism is apparently mostly absent, though females are likely to outgrow males. Females usually deposit 10 to 15 eggs per clutch. =Lifespan= A C. dentata individual has been recorded living up to 14.7 years in captivity. However, an adult specimen caught in the wild has also been recorded living another 14 years, making it likely that the maximum lifespan of Cyclemys species has been underestimated. Distribution and habitat A Cyclemys turtle along a perennial stream (Upper Dikorai) in Pakke Tiger Reserve The distribution ranges of individual species of Cyclemys remain unclear, but the genus occurs in South Asia and Indochina (Vietnam, Myanmar, Laos, Cambodia, Myanmar, Thailand, central to southern China, Bangladesh, Nepal, and northeastern India), as well as the Southeast Asian countries of Malaysia, Indonesia, Brunei, and the Philippines. Adults spend most of their time on land. They can be found near ponds, streams, and other shallow, slow- moving bodies of water in hilly forests. Although more common in lower elevations, they have been found in higher elevations exceeding above sea level. They are omnivorous, but juveniles tend to be more carnivorous. Because their prey are typically aquatic, the younger turtles are found in water more often than adults. Species The species are listed alphabetically along with common names, identifying adult characteristics, and known geographical distribution.Turtle Taxonomy Working Group (Rhodin, A.G.J., van Dijk, P.P, Iverson, J.B., and Shaffer, H.B.).2010.

C. annandalii is now classified under Heosemys, C. annamensis under Mauremys, and C. giebelii as Notochelys platynota. Conservation Cyclemys species are often caught and sold for the pet trade, food, or traditional medicine. On August 25, 1998, Forest Protection authorities of Vietnam confiscated a shipment of about 700 turtles with an estimated 30 individuals of C. oldhamii. In May 2007, more than 3000 individuals of Cyclemys, along with Asian box turtles, were confiscated in hundreds of crates in Yangjiang, China. The most commonly encountered species of Cyclemys in the pet trade, C. dentata, is now being captive bred. They are usually preferred, as they are healthier, more acclimated to handling, and captive breeding minimizes the impact on wild populations. The confusion over their exact taxonomy and distribution led to an incomplete assessment of their conservation status by the IUCN. In 1991, with only two species recognized, Cyclemys was given the Action Plan Rating of 3 - in need of some conservation action. In the last assessment in 2000 by the Asian Turtle Trade Working Group of IUCN, the different species currently recognized under the genus Cyclemys were treated as all belonging to the species C. dentata. This resulted in the current incorrect classification of all of the species as lower risk/near threatened. Until now, the true conservation status, the actual effects of wildlife trade, deforestation, and habitat loss on individual Cyclemys species, have yet to be studied.

The translation is by Howard Goldblatt and was published in 2001 by Columbia University Press. An earlier version of Goldblatt's translations was published by Indiana University under the title The Drowning of an Old Cat and Other Stories in 1980.  Subject matter and major themes  Huang Chunming's subject matter is the people of Taiwan. One aspect of their lives that his stories treat is the way in which their lives contrast with Mainlanders and Mainland culture. An important theme is the influence of language (Taiwanese Hokkien vs. Mandarin Chinese) on keeping these two groups of people distinct. A related theme is change and the impact of modernity. Huang Chunming wrote in the introduction to the English translation, \\"In the sixties and seventies, when the modern world began making inroads into the out-of-the-way town of Lanyang, where I was born, the conflicts between the new and the old created a rich source of powerful and dramatic material. Whenever my antennae detected the new dramas being played out in my hometown, the desire to write about them raged inside me.\\"  Motifs  Huang Chunming's characters are native Taiwanese fishermen and villagers, and often have Taiwan's trademark \\"Ah\\" prefix on their names. His stories are full of neighborhood temples and folk religion observances, banyan trees, bonito fish, sparrows and sweet potatoes, and the blazing tropical sun is a prop in nearly every story. His characters often exhibit strong and even mystical attachment to their natural surroundings, including explicit expressions of fengshui ideas.  Story synopses  The Fish = This story provides a glimpse into the nuanced interactions between a grandfather from a Taiwan mountain village and his teenage grandson, who is coming of age and gaining experience of the larger world. = The Drowning of an Old Cat = A typical band of Huang Chunming characters, all in their 70s—Uncle Cow's Eye, Uncle Earthworm, Uncle Yuzai, and Uncle Ah-zhuan, led by Uncle Ah-sheng—venture forth from their usual hangout (the neighborhood temple, in the shade of the banyan tree) to challenge the coming of a modern swimming pool to their rural town. They represent barriers to translational activities that are ongoing in China by this period. = His Son's Big Doll = This story probes the roiling thoughts and emotions of an impoverished man as he juggles the challenges of his humiliating job as a \\"sandwich man\\" with the desire to support his young wife and child. The story provides an example of quintessential Huang Chunming narrative: unadorned observation of the fundamental human condition (\\"They seemed to shed a heavy emotional burden simultaneously -- he having seen his wife walk through the door, she having seen her husband drink some tea\\") juxtaposed with wry examples of the incongruity and provocativeness of modernizing Taiwan (the protagonist's occupation is \\"sandwich-man\\" or \\"ad man\\" - shouldering billboards for a movie theater and dressed in the costume of a nineteenth-century European military officer\\"). The story was adapted into a film entitled The Sandwich Man directed by Hou Hsiao-hsien. = The Gong = This story is an empathetic account of an old, derelict, and hungry man. The two main threads of the story are the man's loss of employment as a town crier (complete with attention- getting gong) due to the advent of more modern forms of communication, and the man's reluctant entry into a company of funeral followers. The story realistically captures the twin torments of his material desperation and his ambivalence about his new \\"friends.\\" The group that the man falls in with—the arhat vagrants—is a classic collection of down-on-their-luck locals: Scabby Head, Turtle, Know-It-All, Fire Baby, Blockhead, One-Eye, Gold Clock. They hang out under a tree across from the coffinmaker's shop, waiting to be called upon to assist at funerals. = Ringworms = This brief story describes a few hours in the life of a low-class husband and wife in Taiwan, together with their gaggle of children. Their concerns range from day-to-day subsistence, how to snatch some brief moments of intimacy, and how to broach touchy subjects like birth control. = The Taste of Apples = For a native Taiwan man who has migrated with his family to the urban north of Taiwan, everything changes when he hits an American military officer. The apples the family eats in the hospital symbolize the instantaneous change in circumstances: a heretofore unaffordable luxury in the Taiwanese context will now be a commonplace as their lives are touched by the American presence. The rotten apples make them sick. = Xiaoqi's Cap = This story involves two greenhorn salesmen, one of whom has a \\"bad attitude\\" which rapidly evolves in the course of events. The story includes elements that can be read as metaphors for the social situation in Taiwan: a pressure cooker that explodes and a cap that disguises disfiguring marks on an innocent little girl's head. = The Two Sign Painters = Two rural men have migrated to the city and now find themselves working on towering buildings. Their suddenly heightened visual perspective is complicated further when they become the center of official and media attention and get a taste of \\"all news, all the time\\" culture . . . . = Sayonara / Zaijian = This story concerns a Taiwanese trading company employee who must act as a \\"pimp\\" in the course of entertaining visiting businessmen from Japan who want to visit a hot spring hotel. The story addresses wide-ranging feelings of ambivalence and confusion in a society that has a complicated history of relations with Japan, and is experiencing rapidly changing mores. In a tour-de-force of imaginative dialog writing, Huang Chunming describes how the Taiwanese man avails himself of artiful use of language to simultaneously humble the group of visiting Japanese businessmen and to upbraid a misguided Chinese literature student.

It was originally settled by the native Alutiiq people who called themselves Tangirnarmiut, \\"the people of Tangirnaq.\\" They inhabited and used Woody Island for thousands of years. The Russians established an agricultural colony on Woody Island in 1792. It was officially designated Wood Island in 1894 by the US Post Office and was the primary coastal settlement for commerce and trade for many years. The first road in Alaska was built on Woody Island. Aside from the Aleut presence, the island has gone through four periods of occupation by non-natives, and is largely unoccupied today. The island is approximately 2.8 miles long from north to south and 1.8 miles wide and 13 miles in circumference. The Woody Island Historic Archeological District, comprising sites of archaeological importance on the island was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2015. Aleut settlement The Alutiiq people used the island for \\"whaling, fishing, wood-working, sweat-baths, extensive trade,\\" and build \\"large multi-roomed houses, and large villages with complex social ranking.\\" When the Russians arrived in the 18th century, the native people were initially successful in driving them off. There followed a short period of accommodation and trade, after which the Russians engaged in brutal subjugation of the people, resulting in \\"epidemics, forced relocations, and extermination of those who resisted.\\" Russian naval officer Gavriil Davydov observed an Aleut winter ceremony on Woody Island in 1802. He wrote: In 1805 a village on the east side of Woody Island was inhabited by 54 Alutiiq people. A smallpox epidemic struck the region in 1837 and the Russians forcefully amalgamated the survivors into seven villages, among them a village on Woody Island. Industry and commerce The Russian American Commercial Company operated an ice company on the island beginning in 1852. They dammed Lake Tanignak, increasing its depth substantially. They cut and shipped ice south to California. The company brought in the first iron rails to haul ice and horses to power a horse-powered saw which cut the ice into blocks. A sawmill was built to produce not lumber, but sawdust that was used to insulate the ice for shipment south. The first road built in Alaska was graded around the island to allow the horses to be exercised. In 1867 the company was renamed the Kodiak Ice Co. For much of the late half of the 19th century, many of the Aluttiq people on Woody Island were enslaved by the Russians to work for the ice harvesting companies during the winter. Conscripted by the Russians, they hunted sea otters and fur seals during the summer for their highly prized fur. In 1872 a Russian Orthodox Church was built on Woody Island. The church exerted a strong influence over the native population, replacing in many instances native ceremonies and observances with church-centered activities. The sea otter and fur seal populations declined rapidly in the latter half of the 19th century due to over-harvesting, with about 100,000 sea otters and a correspondingly high number of fur seals being taken each year. By 1911 only about 2000 sea otters remained in 13 small remnant populations, making hunting unprofitable. Commercial taking of sea otters and fur seals were prohibited by the Fur Seal Treaty. The Aleuts were permitted to hunt them for subsistence purposes only. In 1886, the Island was the commercial center for the Kodiak area. Services included the ice harvesting operation, a boat yard, a grist mill, the Alaska Commercial Company (formerly the Russian-American Company) wharf, and the only roads in Alaska connecting these facilities. The North American Commercial Company, a fur trading enterprise, established a presence there in 1891, including a store. =Religious usage= Ernest and Ida Roscoe built a Baptist Mission and orphanage on Woody Island in 1893. Over the next twenty years, the mission added a girls' quarters, boys' dormitory, office building, barn, carpenter shop, cannery, silo, and dining room. The mission provided homes for Aleut children who had lost their parents, but the Baptist missionaries sometimes brought children to the orphanage, even against their parents' will. The main building burned down in 1925, was rebuilt, and burned again in 1937. The mission was then relocated to Kodiak on the mainland where a greater variety of services were more readily available. =U.S. Navy wireless station= The United States Navy built a wireless station on the island in 1911. It included two large masts tall. During the eruption of the Novarupta volcano on the Alaska Peninsula in 1912, over of ash was deposited on the island. Everyone but the watchman evacuated to Kodiak. During the ash fall, lightning struck one of the antenna which started a fire that burned most of the wireless station. Harry Martin, a survivor of the volcanic eruption, told U.S. Navy radioman Bart Phelps about the experience in 1924: The wireless station was rebuilt and updated in 1914. The wireless station was decommissioned on February 28, 1931, and shortly thereafter the Federal government allowed the Territory of Alaska to use the remaining buildings for the Longwood School. After the mission and orphanage was relocated to the mainland, the entire island's population declined rapidly. The Longwood School enrollment dropped from 71 in 1937 to 20 in 1939, and the school was permanently closed. Many of the natives moved to Kodiak where they were less dependent on subsistence living and could find jobs. =Air station built= In 1941, the Civil Aeronautics Administration built the Kadiak Naval Air Station including a runway, flight service station, remote air ground, remote transmitter, low frequency range beacon, and VHF link terminal facilities. These gathered and relayed weather and other aeronautical data to pilots. During World War II up to forty technicians and their families lived on the island. They maintained the teletypes, transmitters, and radio receivers essential to supporting military and civilian aircraft operating in the North Pacific. In 1951 or 1952 the Russian Orthodox Church building, which had been abandoned for many years, was torn down. Former Navy facilities were converted to apartments and a school was built on in 1951 for the small community. The facility was automated in the early 1970s and the majority of the remaining FAA complex burned in 1979. Current use During the 1950s, the American Baptist Church began offering a non-denominational summer camp on the island, which is still in operation today. The FAA still maintains a radio beacon on the island for aircraft directional use. There is no longer any public transportation to the island. The island is inhabited today by two \\"hermits\\" and is visited by two families owning summer homes there. The majority of land on Woody Island is private property, except for the Woody Island State Recreation Site a wilderness area belonging to Alaska State Parks.Woody Island SRS Alaska Department of Natural Resources The island is designated as the Leisnoi Alaska Native Village Statistical Area.

History The park was created in 1923 by the former company of the Panama Canal, as the Experimental Farm Summit, to test the adaptation of plants’ species from different parts of the world to the tropical climate of Panama. It was through this experimental farm that teak was introduced to the American continent. In the 1960s a small zoo was started within the Botanical Garden. The zoo has increased gradually, and today is home to about 300 animals. One of the attractions of the zoo is the harpy eagle; the national bird of Panama. The land was transferred back to Panama as part the Torrijos-Carter treaties, and was part of the Soberanía National Park created by Executive Decree No. 13 on May 27, 1980. In 1985, the area covered by this park was transferred to the administration of the Mayor’s office of Panama, thus establishing the Municipal Park and part of the restructured area into a Botanical Garden, converting it into a research center for development of tropical biology and horticulture. Plants The botanical garden includes a representation of plant species from tropical and subtropical countries around the world as well as native species of Panama. Many of them have beneficial uses for humans as food, medicines, construction materials, or ornamental use.

The four-storey yellow-painted building was built in the first half of the nineteenth century by the eccentric Lord Charles Currie, a visiting Englishman who fell in love with Lake Como. Failing to find a villa for sale, he decided to create his own, right on the water's edge. It was subsequently owned by Antonio Besana, a friend of the composer Giuseppe Verdi. By 1977, when it was bought by the Italian designer Gianni Versace, it was in a state of abandonment, and the designer set about restoring it to its former neoclassical glory. The work, completed in December 1980, included landscaping the three acres (1.2 Ha) of ornamental gardens, which include three cottages, a tennis court, water frontage of some 800m and a private mooring. Versace personally chose hundreds of oil paintings and with other artworks displayed throughout the interior and exterior, he created a mini-palace that was a personal shrine. Before Versace's death, celebrities such as Sir Elton John, Sting, Diana, Princess of Wales and Madonna, were regular guests at the property. The English art historian and landscape gardener Roy Strong created the gardens of the villa for Versace. Strong also worked on the grounds of Versace's house in Miami, the Casa Casuarina. Since the death of Versace in 1997, however, only American singer Jennifer Lopez and her husband Chris Judd were known to have visited, having spent their honeymoon there in 2001. Otherwise the property was a largely lifeless temple to Gianni Versace.The Sunday Times, March 16th 2008, London The estate is now owned by Russian millionaire restaurateur Arkady Novikov who bought it for 33 million Euros in early 2008 and retained Milanese architect Claudio Pozza to undertake restoration works at the property La Provincia Di Como, 'Villa Fontanelle, il russo restaura E il Comune di Moltrasio incassa' 17 ottobre 2012, Como Gallery File:Villa Fontanelle.JPG File:Guesthouse at Villa Fontanelle.JPG File:Villa Fontanelle View.JPG File:Second Guesthouse and storeroom at Villa Fontanelle.JPG References Category:Gardens by Roy Strong Category:Houses completed in the 19th century Category:Province of Como Category:Versace Fontanelle Category:Neoclassical architecture in Lombardy ","title":"Villa Fontanelle"},{"id":"20763750","text":"Modrej (; in older sources also Modreja) is a settlement on the right bank of the Soča River, just north of Most na Soči, in the Municipality of Tolmin in the Littoral region of Slovenia.Tolmin municipal site ReferencesExternal links *Modrej on Geopedia Category:Populated places in the Municipality of Tolmin ","title":"Modrej"},{"id":"20763756","text":"The Nirvana bootleg recordings are a number of audio CD recordings of musical performances by the American rock band Nirvana, which were previously not officially released by the band, or under any other legal authority. The recordings consist of both live performances and outtakes from studio sessions unavailable as a legal release. Overview Nirvana was formed by singer/guitarist Kurt Cobain and bassist Krist Novoselic in Aberdeen, Washington in 1987, and featured drummer Dave Grohl for the majority of the band's career. They had previously gone through a succession of drummers, most notably Chad Channing, Dale Crover and Dan Peters. Jason Everman was briefly added as a second guitarist in 1989. Pat Smear joined the band as a touring guitarist in 1993. Although Nirvana existed for less than a decade, they released four studio albums, starting with 1989's Bleach, followed by their major label breakthrough album, Nevermind in 1991. In Utero was released in 1993, just seven months prior to Cobain's death in April 1994. Also released in 1992 was Incesticide. As Nirvana's popularity grew following the success of Nevermind, unreleased recordings of the band began to surface in the form of unofficial bootleg CDs, often originating from companies in Europe and Japan. The sound quality and album art would frequently range from appalling to appealing, sometimes sounding like and resembling something of a legitimate release. Some of the recordings came from \\"tape trading\\" circles while others may have been recorded or obtained specifically for the bootleg CD. Material was sometimes gathered from already existing vinyl bootlegs or other bootleg CDs as they became available. Additionally, songs issued only as a b-side or compilation track became frequent candidates for use as filler material. Nirvana would not see any royalties from these releases, nor would they have anything to do with their production. The first Nirvana bootleg CD was released in 1992 by Post Script, simply titled Europe 1991. Since then, hundreds of recordings of concerts, demos and various unreleased material have surfaced in this format. The official release Incesticide was issued in late 1992, including demos, outtakes and radio sessions, some of which were previously circulating in lower quality on bootleg CDs. Despite MTV Unplugged in New York being released less than a year after the performance occurred, it would still become one of the band's most bootlegged shows. After the first several installments of the unofficial Outcesticide collection came through, the official live album From the Muddy Banks of the Wishkah was released in 1996, containing various performances recorded between 1989 and 1994. It should also be noted that the official With the Lights Out box set was released in 2004, which included many rare, unreleased recordings, while the official Live at Reading debuted Nirvana's now classic 1992 Reading Festival performance in 2009, after years of endless bootlegging. Due to the fact that there is an uncountable number of unofficial releases and their accompanying versions, below is a partial list of the most sought-after and talked about bootleg CD recordings, including the A Season in Hell Part One box set, the Into the Black box set, and the complete Outcesticide series. Since bootleg CDs are notorious for including erroneously listed information pertaining to song titles, dates and venues, the information below has omitted any false listings and replaced them with the correct information. Outcesticide albums The Outcesticide albums are the most well known Nirvana bootleg CD series in existence and carry a name recognition second only to Nirvana's official releases. These unofficial compilation albums consisted of live material, demo recordings, television appearances, radio performances and other various unreleased material. Although Blue Moon Records originally produced the series and manufactured multiple pressings throughout the 1990s, they have been endlessly cloned, with counterfeit versions accounting for the majority of the market.

In 1996, the inferior A Season In Hell Part Two was released by Razor's Edge, containing the 1994 Le Zénith show and an array of miscellaneous material, most of which was lifted from the Outcesticide series and official releases. =A Season in Hell Part One, CD 1= All songs written by Kurt Cobain except where noted. * All tracks from an incomplete audience source recorded live at the Off Ramp Café, Seattle, Washington on November 25, 1990 and would be the ninth ever performance to feature Dave Grohl on drums.

Into the Black Into the Black is a six CD box set released by Tribute in 1994, which is often considered the preferred Nirvana bootleg box set due to it being compiled by a knowledgeable fan. It is housed in a glossy box, including a 22-page booklet made of thick cardstock. Several recordings were obtained specifically for the set and it contains a large amount of material that had not yet surfaced up to the time of its release. The extensive 116-track collection includes demo recordings, two band-made compilations, the 1992 Reading Festival performance and BBC radio sessions from Maida Vale Studios. The set also contains two Seattle shows; the 1991 Halloween homecoming performance for their North American Nevermind tour, and their last ever American show in 1994.

Reception Allmusic awarded the album 4 stars with review by Thom Jurek saying, \\"While not as groundbreaking as A Caddy for Daddy, Dippin' or Soul Station, Flip is nonetheless a solid hard groove date for Mobley ... Flip is a very worthwhile side to add to the Mobley shelf\\".Jurek, T. Allmusic review. Retrieved April 10, 2012.

The Guardian Review: Hank Mobley: The Flip, accessed July 16, 2019 On All About Jazz Germien Linares stated \\"An exquisite soul messenger, Mobley was criticized for not being as aggressive, voluminous, or trailblazing as his contemporaries. Indeed, he was not. Instead, his music was steeped in care, precision and nuances. In Mobley's hands, such treatment often dazzled, as on his latest Blue Note reissue, The Flip ... He's supported by an excellent crew of international musicians, ... All the tunes on The Flip were composed by Mobley and are built around his strengths of soul, swing, and subtlety ... True, this album and its composer will never be within the ranks of the most influential, the most revered, or even the most downloaded. Fine. Besides, as a provocateur of beauty, Mobley is in a class all his own\\".Linares, G. All About Jazz Review, accessed July 18, 2019 Flophouse magazine noted \\"In the late sixties Hank Mobley’s round tone had become a bit rougher around the edges and his style was more hard-driving. This is evident on 1969’s The Flip, which boasts hi-voltage blowing but is short on finesse. Mobley, always the prolific songwriter, wrote all five tunes on The Flip. The compositions that turn out best are the ones that resemble Mobley’s songwriting of the late fifties and early sixties. ... The Flip swings hard and is sure to enliven a party. But unfortunately, it also swings wild and uncontrolled, favouring a strained, hi-octane tension over a sophisticated build-up\\".Flophouse magazine Review, accessed July 18, 2019  Track listing  All compositions by Hank Mobley. # \\"The Flip\\" - 9:02 # \\"Feelin' Folksy\\" - 8:29 # \\"Snappin' Out\\" - 7:14 # \\"18th Hole\\" - 6:00 # \\"Early Morning Stroll\\" - 6:53  Personnel  * Hank Mobley -- tenor saxophone * Dizzy Reece -- trumpet * Slide Hampton -- trombone * Vince Benedetti -- piano * Alby Cullaz -- double bass * Philly Joe Jones -- drums References Category:1970 albums Category:Albums produced by Francis Wolff Category:Blue Note Records albums Category:Hank Mobley albums ","title":"The Flip (album)"},{"id":"20763780","text":"Linden Grove is a historic home located at Frederick, Frederick County, Maryland, United States.

It is a human blood parasite responsible for visceral leishmaniasis or kala-azar, the most severe form of leishmaniasis. It infects the mononuclear phagocyte system including spleen, liver and bone marrow. Infection is transmitted by species of sandfly belonging to the genus Phlebotomus in Old World and Lutzomyia in New World. Therefore, the parasite is prevalent throughout tropical and temperate regions including Africa (mostly in Sudan), China, India, Nepal, southern Europe, Russia and South America. It is responsible for thousands of deaths every year and has spread to 88 countries, with 350 million people at constant risk of infection and 0.5 million new cases in a year. L. donovani was independently discovered by two British medical officers William Boog Leishman in Netley, England, and Charles Donovan in Madras, India, in 1903. However, the correct taxonomy was provided by Ronald Ross. The parasite requires two different hosts for a complete life cycle, humans as the definitive host and sandflies as the intermediate host. In some parts of the world other mammals, especially canines, act as reservoir hosts. In human cell they exist as small, spherical and unflagellated amastigote form; while they are elongated with flagellum as promastigote form in sandflies. Unlike other parasitic protists they are unable to directly penetrate the host cell, and are dependent upon phagocytosis. The whole genome sequence of L. donovani obtained from southeastern Nepal was published in 2011. Discovery One of the earliest known epidemics of L. donovani infection (kala-azar as it was called in Hindi) was known in India just after the Indian Rebellion of 1857. The first medical record was however only in 1870 by British medical officers from Assam. In 1900, an English soldier stationed at Dum Dum, West Bengal, died at the Army Medical School in Netley, England. The autopsy was performed by William Boog Leishman. He processed the tissue sample of the enlarged spleen using a staining technique (now known as Leishman's stain) which he had just developed, and discovered the protozoan parasites using microscopy. But he mistakenly considered the parasites to be degenerate trypanosomes, already known protozoan parasites in Africa and South America. In 1903, Leishman published his discovery of \\"trypanosomes in India\\" in the British Medical Journal, which appeared on 11 May. Another British medical officer Charles Donovan, who was serving in the Indian Medical Service, had found the parasites in April of that year at the Government General Hospital in Madras. After reading Leishman paper, Donovan confirmed on 17 June that the parasites (by then known as \\"Leishman bodies\\") were definitely the causative agents of kala-azar. He wrote a commentary of his discovery in relation to that of Leishman in the same journal, that appeared on 11 July 1903. Soon a controversy arose as to whom such a monumental discovery should be credited. Donovan sent some of his slides to Ronald Ross, who was at the time in Liverpool, and to Alphonse Laveran at the Pasteur Institute in Paris. Laveran and his colleague Félix Mesnil identified the protozoan (and yet wrongly) to be members of Piroplasmida, and gave the scientific name Piroplasma donovanii. It was Ross who resolved the conflict of priority in the discovery and correctly identified the species as member of the novel genus Leishmania. He gave the popular name \\"Leishman-Donovan bodies\\", and subsequently the valid binomial Leishmania donovani, thereby equally crediting the two rivals. Structure Leishmania donovani is a unicellular eukaryote having a well-defined nucleus and other cell organelles including a kinetoplast and a flagellum. Depending on its host it exists in two structural variants, as follows: #Amastigote form found in the mononuclear phagocyte and circulatory systems of humans. It is an intracellular and non- motile form, being devoid of external flagellum. The short flagellum is embedded in the anterior end without projecting out. It is oval in shape, and measures 3–6 μm in length and 1–3 μm in breadth. The kinetoplast and basal body lie towards the anterior end. #Promastigote is formed in the alimentary tract of the sandfly. It is an extracellular and motile form. It is considerably larger and more highly elongated, measuring 15–30 μm in length and 5 μm in width. It is spindle-shaped, tapering at both ends. A long flagellum (about the body length) is projected externally at the anterior end. The nucleus lies at the centre, and in front of which are kinetoplast and basal body. Infection and life cycle Life cycle of Leishmania donovani Leishmania donovani is a digenetic parasite passing its life cycle in two different hosts. =Definitive host= In humans the metacyclic promastigotes are injected by sandfly through the skin during its blood meal. When sandfly bites using its proboscis it ejects the parasites that are stored inside the hollow tube. Some promastigotes may enter the blood stream directly where some are destroyed by macrophagic cytolysis. But many are also taken up through phagocytosis by mononuclear phagocytes in liver, spleen and bone marrow. Inside the cells they undergo spontaneous transformation into oval-shaped amastigotes. Granulocytes selectively kill the promastigotes by oxidative mechanism, while amastigotes are resistant. Then the surviving amastigotes undergo cell division using simple binary fission. Multiplication continues until the host cell can no longer hold and ruptures. In a fully congested cell there can be as many as 50 to 200 amastigotes, which are released into tissue cavities. Each individual amastigote is then capable of invading fresh cells. As a result, the entire tissue is progressively infected and destroyed. A number of free amastigotes then enters the blood stream where many are phagocytosed by macrophages. These free and phagocytosed amastigotes in peripheral blood are then sucked up by blood-feeding sandfly. =Intermediate host= L. donovani undergo further development only in the digestive tract of the female sandfly. Hence only females are responsible for transmitting the infection. Once the amastigotes are ingested, they enter the midgut of the sandfly. Then they undergo structural modification into flagellated promastigotes, becoming larger and considerably elongated. They get attached to the gut epithelial lining where they multiply rapidly by binary fission. (They are also capable of sexual reproduction by genetic hybridisation in the sandfly gut.) They then migrate back towards the anterior part of the digestive system such as pharynx and buccal cavity. This process is known as anterior station development, which is unique in Leishmania. A heavy infection of pharynx can be observed within 6 to 9 days after initial blood meal. The promastigotes become infective only by this time, and the event is called the metacyclic stage. The metacyclic promastigotes then enter the hollow proboscis where they accumulate and completely block the food passage. Immediately upon biting a human, the parasites are released, which invariably results in infection. The stages of development in sandfly can be described as follows: #Soon after entering the gut, the amastigotes get coated with peritrophic matrix, which is composed of chitin and protein complex. This protects the parasites from the digestive enzymes of the host. #The amastigotes travel as far as the abdominal midgut and first transform into a weakly motile \\"procyclic promastigotes\\" on the gut wall within 1–3 days. #The young promastigotes secrete a neuropeptide that stop peristalsis of the gut. The surface lipophosphoglycan (LPG) of the promastigote serves as an attachment to the gut epithelium. These factors prevent the expulsion of promastigotes during excretion of the insect. #During 4–7 days the peritrophic matrix is degraded by the activity of chitinases. This release the more actively motile \\"nectomonad promastigotes\\" which migrate anteriorly until they reach the opening of the thoracic gut. #Another transformation takes place by which they turn into \\"leptomonad promastigotes\\". These are fully motile and capable of binary fission. Multiplication and migration towards thoracic midgut cause congestion of the pharynx and buccal cavity. Here they secrete promastigote secretory gel (PSG), which is composed of soluble acid phosphatase and phosphoglycoprotein. #After 6–9 days the promastigotes become metacyclic. Some are also transformed into non-replicating promastigotes, which also become metacyclic. The sandfly is able to regurgitate and eject the parasites from its proboscis with the help of PSG when it bites. =Reservoir host= Dogs are known to be susceptible to L. donovani infection. Especially in the New World, infection is a zoonotic disease, involving different canine species, including domestic dog and the two fox species, Lycalopex vetulus and Cerdocyon thous. In the Mediterranean region domestic dogs and the three fox species Vulpes vulpes, V. corsac and V. zerda are common reservoir hosts. In Africa and Brazil, some marsupials and rodents are also reported to harbour L. donovani. Epidemiology It is estimated that visceral leishmaniasis (VL) affects more than 100 million people worldwide, with 500,000 new cases and more than 50,000 deaths each year. Although L. donovani is only the second- most prevalent Leishmania causing VL, it is the most dangerous form and directly fatal to humans. Over 90% of reported cases are from India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Sudan and Brazil. In India it is prevalent in the eastern region including Bihar, West Bengal, eastern Uttar Pradesh, Assam and foothills of Sikkim. It is responsible for tens of thousands of mortality among Africans in eastern and southern parts of Sudan. During the epidemic of 1984–1994 death toll was as high as 70% in the Sudanese population. Moreover, due to emergence of drug resistance the prevalence is not subsiding, and in fact has spread to central Europe. For example, during the late 1990s hundreds of cases were reported in Switzerland. Pathogenicity L. donovani is the causative agent of visceral leishmaniasis, traditionally known as kala-azar (\\"black fever\\", particularly in India), because of its characteristic symptoms. The disease is highly lethal if not treated properly. The incubation period generally ranges from 3 to 6 months, and in some cases may be over a year. In Indian leishmaniasis, incubation can be as short as 10 days. The target cells are those of mononuclear phagocyte system. The two main tissues of infection are spleen and liver. Clinical symptoms include pyrexia (recurring high fever which may be continuous or remittent), enlargement of spleen and liver, and heavy skin pigmentation which darkens the physical appearance (the reason for naming \\"black fever\\"). To a lesser extent mucosa of the small intestine and lymph nodes are also invaded by the parasite. Morphological symptoms are noticeable particularly on facial and abdominal regions. Skin becomes coarse and hard. In African infections, warty eruptions are common. In a fully developed stage, the patient shows emaciation and anaemia. Where medical facilities are poor, mortality can be as high as 75–95% within 2 years of epidemics. The disease is often accompanied by complications with dysentery, tuberculosis, septicaemia and even HIV infection. =Cellular invasion and immunological response= Amastigotes of L. donovani enter macrophages via a Rac1- and Arf6-dependent process, and are found in phagocytic vacuoles that interact with endosomes and lysosomes and acquire lysosomal features. During phagocytosis by macrophages, the promastigotes inhibit the formation of the phagolysosome, a cellular product by which invading pathogens are removed. The promastigote can do this using its glycolipid lipophosphoglycan (LPG) on its cell membrane. LPG causes disorganisation of F-actin and disruption of phagosomal lipid microdomains. They are capable of evading the microbicidal actions of macrophages, which can kill ordinary pathogens using reactive nitrogen and oxygen intermediates. They effectively subvert the production of reactive oxygen species. In this way the amastigotes are able to survive and replicate inside these primary immune systems. The parasites manipulate the cell signalling pathway of the macrophages, such as down-regulating of Jak/stat signalling, NO and TNF-α production, and also by blocking the NF-κB-dependent pathway. There are two major mechanisms of immune evasion such as induction of immune suppressive IL-10 responses and the generation of poor and functionally impaired CD8(+) T-cell responses. Treatment The conventional treatment method is an intravenous injection with antimony compounds, such as pentostam. Unfortunately, these chemotherapeutics are so poisonous that about 15% of the patients die from the treatments. To compound the situation, drug resistance has evolved in the parasites against the traditional antimonials. According to rough estimates, about 40% of patients in India are already resistant to this therapy. Another antimicrobial drug amphotericin B is also commonly used. Liposomal amphotericin B (L-AmB) has been a drug of choice in India, but is practically useless in Africa because of low effectiveness in the African strain of the parasite. Further, amphotericin B has severe adverse effects. Its acute effects includes nausea, vomiting, rigors, fever, hypertension or hypotension, and hypoxia, and its chronic effect is nephrotoxicity. In 1999 an anticancer drug miltefosine was demonstrated to be highly effective (95% cure rate) among Indian patients. This was the first time an oral drug is effective for visceral leishmaniasis. Clinical trials showed that the new drug is relatively harmless. The most adverse effects were only vomiting and diarrhoea in 20–28% patients, which were rather mild. The drug has been officially approved in India. The recommended dosage is 100 mg per day over a period of four weeks. Evolution L. donovani is now considered to be a complex species as indicated by different pathological symptoms occurring in different geographical areas where the species of the vector sandfly are also different. However, none of the parasites are morphologically distinguishable, except by molecular analysis. Molecular data show that genotype is strongly correlated with geographical origin. DNA sequencing of different geographical strains indicates that the protozoan complex can be classified into two valid taxa, L. donovani and L. infantum. The genus Leishmania most likely originated in South America, from where it migrated to Asia. L. donovani and L. infantum diverged ~1 Mya, with further divergence of infraspecific genetic groups between 0.4 and 0.8 Mya.

John Trumbull sketched this pencil drawing in 1785.Taylor, 169 Joseph Louis Cook, or Akiatonharónkwen (died October 1814) (Mohawk), was an Iroquois leader and commissioned officer in the Continental Army during the American Revolution. Born to an African father and an Abenaki mother in what is now Schuylerville, New York, he and his mother were taken captive in a French-Mohawk raid and taken to Kahnawake, a Mohawk village south of Montreal. They were adopted by a Mohawk family. His mother soon died and he served Catholic missionaries, learning French. He became an influential leader among the Mohawk and distinguished himself as a warrior for their allies the French during the French and Indian War. During the American Revolutionary War, Cook supported the American colonists and joined their fight against the British. He became the highest-ranking Native American officer in the Continental Army, achieving the rank of lieutenant colonel. He led Oneida warriors, who were allied with the rebels, against the British in some actions. After the war, he settled in central New York State, where he became an important adviser to the Oneida. He represented them and the Seven Nations of Canada to negotiate with the government of New York state in trying to achieve more justice in postwar land deals. He later settled at Akwesasne, eventually a formal Mohawk reserve that straddles the New York, USA-Quebec, Canada borders. Early life and education Cook was born as Nia-man- rigounant to an Abenaki mother and black father; while living in what is today Schuylerville, New York, the family was taken captive in a French-Mohawk raid in 1745. A French officer planned to keep the boy as a slave, but the Mohawk intervened and saved him. They took the boy and his mother with them when they returned to their village of Kahnawake south of Montreal.Darren Bonaparte, \\"Louis Cook: A French and Indian Warrior\\", Wampum Chronicles, 16 September 2005 Cook was formally adopted by a Mohawk family and assimilated into the tribe; he grew up learning their culture and language. In the Mohawk language, he was named Akiatonharónkwen, translates as \\"he unhangs himself from the group.\\"Darren Bonaparte, \\"Too Many Chiefs\\", Wampum Chronicles, p. 6 Over the years, Cook also learned French, as he was educated by Jesuit Catholic missionaries in the village. Later he learned English as well. Among English- language records, he is most often referred to as Louis Cook or Colonel Louis. French and Indian War Cook lived in the Mohawk village of Kahnawake. He fought with the Mohawk nation on the side of the French against the British in the French and Indian War, the North American front of the Seven Years' War.Taylor, 172 A friend and minister, Eleazer Williams, later wrote that Cook was at the battle against the Braddock expedition in 1755 (the Braddock party included the young George Washington), and served under General Montcalm at the Battle of Fort Oswego in 1756. The same year, he was wounded in a skirmish with Rogers' Rangers near Fort Ticonderoga. Cook was given his first command in the 1758 Battle of Carillon, where he was praised by General Montcalm. He was also present at the Battle of Sainte-Foy in 1760, serving under the Chevalier de Levis. Following the war, Cook returned to Caughnawaga and married Marie-Charlotte.\\"Colonel Louis Cook\\", Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online As he never fully accepted the British victory and found his homeland increasingly overrun by American colonists, he moved with his family to Akwesasne, a Mohawk village along the St. Lawrence River in what was then Quebec. American Revolution Tomahawk in The Death of General Montgomery in the Attack on Quebec, December 31, 1775 by John TrumbullCooper, 84 Although the Mohawk and three other of the Iroquois nations sided with the British during the American Revolution, hoping to expel the colonists from their lands, Cook allied with the Thirteen Colonies, as did the Oneida and Tuscarora. As early as 1775, he offered his services to General George Washington.Bonaparte, Darren \\"Louis Cook: A “Colonel” of Truth?\\", Wampum Chronicles, accessed 13 April 2009 Cook returned in January 1776 with a group of to meet with Philip Schuyler in Albany and with Washington and John Adams at Cambridge, Massachusetts.Calloway, p. 223 Cook was with Benedict Arnold on his expedition into Quebec, when he was already known as \\"Colonel Louis.\\"\\"1776: The Chapter Closes On Canada\\", Mother Bedford Website, accessed 13 April 2009 Washington met again with Cook in 1776.Washington describes \\"Colonel Louis\\" in a note as the principal of the \\"French Caghnawaga tribe\\". [Note: Because many of the Mohawk at Caughnawaga had converted to Catholicism, some Americans referred to them as a different tribe, but they identified as Mohawk.] His note is available online from the Library of Congress. In New York, Louis Cook was present at the Battle of Oriskany, and participated in the Saratoga Campaign. He led a large body of Oneida warriors under General Robert Van Rensselaer. Following the Battle of Klock's Field, Cook forded a river in pursuit of Sir John Johnson while General Rensselaer delayed. Infuriated, Colonel Louis shook his sword at Rensselaer and accused him of being a Tory.Stone, pp. 121-122 Cook was with the Continental Army at Valley Forge in the winter of 1777. In spring 1778, Peter Stephen DuPonceau wrote of meeting Cook, dressed in American regimentals, after hearing the officer singing a French aria.Darren Bonaparte, \\"Colonel Louis at Oriskany and Valley Forge\\", Wampum Chronicles', 30 September 2005 In March of that year, General Philip Schuyler sent Cook to destroy British ships at Niagara in order to prevent another Canadian expedition.Bonaparte, Darren \\"The Missions of Atiatonharongwen\\", Wampum Chronicles', accessed 13 April 2009 The nickname of \\"Colonel Louis\\" was made fact on June 15, 1779, when Cook received a commission from the Continental Congress as a Lieutenant Colonel in the Continental Army. This commission was the highest rank awarded to an American Indian during the Revolution.Oneida Nation of New York Conveyance of Lands Into Trust , Department of Indian Affairs, pg 3-159 It is the only known Continental Army commission given to a man of known African descent.Taylor, 173African Americans in the American Revolution, Buzzle.com website Colonel Louis led a Native American delegation to greet General Rochambeau in 1780, where some officers noted he spoke French with no discernible accent.Calloway, 224 was with Lieutenant-Colonel Marinus Willett at the Battle of Johnstown in 1781, one of the last North American battles of the Revolution. During the war, Cook became a personal enemy of Captain Joseph Brant, a Mohawk who supported the British. When each returned to their homes after the war, their personal conflict divided the Mohawk nation. The Seven Nations of Canada and the Iroquois at what would be the Six Nations Reserve, who were mostly emigrants from the New York colony, were brought to the brink of war. Later life Cook settled in the area of Sterling, New York following the war. He became an influential adviser to the Oneida tribe because he could speak both French and English in addition to Oneida.\\"Oneida Nation of New York Conveyance of Lands Into Trust\\" pg 3-168, Department of Indian Affairs While living at Onondaga, Cook married Marguerite Thewanihattha. They had several children. Cook convinced the Oneida to lease their lands, using the example of the Mohawk tribe at Kahnawake. The Oneida leased nearly to Colonel John Livingston for 999 years. Conflicting claims were made on many of the Iroquois lands, and much of the land was lost to the state of New York because the Iroquois were forced to cede land, as the majority had been allies of the defeated British. The Oneida named Cook and Peter Otsequette to negotiate with Governor George Clinton for a return of, or compensation for, their land. Governor Clinton made some minor concessions to the Oneida in the Treaty of Fort Schuyler, but generally did not yield much to the Oneida representatives.Taylor, 180-185 Today, Cook has been criticized for negotiating bad land deals for the Oneida. Despite his shortcomings in the Oneida land negotiations, between 1792 and 1796 Cook was selected by the Seven Nations of Canada on six separate occasions to represent them in land negotiations with New York state.Taylor, 345 The negotiations were related to lands sold by the people of two villages, Grand River and Tyendinaga Mohawk Territory, Ontario, who were led by Joseph Brant. The Mohawk peoples of Akwesasne and Kahnawake, then considered two of the Seven Nations, denied that those villages had the right to sell what was common Mohawk land in New York. Ultimately, New York prevailed in keeping control of the land, and the division between Cook and Brant was deepened. By 1789, Cook had settled at Akwesasne, where he became an influential chief. The Mohawk reserve eventually established there spans the New York (US)-Quebec (Canada) border and the St. Lawrence River. He argued that the St. Regis Indians (as they were called in New York) and the Seven Nations should remain neutral in the War of 1812 between the US and Great Britain. The United States forgot Cook's earlier service and detained the Mohawk at Fort Niagara; he was released after producing proof of his commission in the Continental Army, as well as letters from George Washington.Williams (see link, below) Although too elderly to participate in the War of 1812, Cook followed the United States Army into Canada during the war; he was present at the Battle of Lundy's Lane. He was involved in a skirmish and fell from his horse. The injuries proved fatal; he died in the American camp in October 1814. Cook was given a military salute at his funeral, and was buried near Buffalo, New York.

The dotted line indicates the area of Captain Johnson's 1821 voyage. New South Greenland, sometimes known as Morrell's Land, was an appearance of land recorded by the American captain Benjamin Morrell of the schooner Wasp in , during a sealing and exploration voyage in the Weddell Sea area of Antarctica. Morrell provided precise coordinates and a description of a coastline which he claimed to have sailed along for more than . Because the Weddell Sea area was so little visited and hard to navigate due to ice conditions, the alleged land was never properly investigated before its existence was emphatically disproved during Antarctic expeditions in the early 20th century. At the time of Morrell's voyage, the geography of the then unnamed Weddell Sea and its surrounding coasts was almost entirely unknown, making the claimed sighting initially plausible. However, obvious errors in Morrell's voyage account and his general reputation as a fabulist created scepticism about the existence of this new land. In the German explorer Wilhelm Filchner searched for but found no traces of land after his ship Deutschland became icebound in the Weddell Sea and drifted into the locality of Morrell's observation. A sounding of the sea bottom revealed more than of water, indicating no land in near proximity. Three years later, trapped in the same waters with his ship Endurance, Ernest Shackleton was able by similar means to confirm the land's non-existence. Various explanations for Morrell's error have been suggested, including intentional deception. However, Morrell describes his find briefly and prosaically, evidently seeking no personal credit or glory from the discovery. In his narrative, he assigns the honour to his fellow sealing captain, Robert Johnson, for finding and naming the land two years earlier. Morrell may have been honestly mistaken, through miscalculation of his ship's position or by misremembering detail when writing the account after nine years. Alternatively, he may have made the common error of confusing distant icebergs with land, or been misled by the distorting effects of Antarctic mirage. In 1843 the distinguished British naval explorer James Clark Ross reported possible land in a position close to Morrell's; this land, too, would eventually be proven not to exist.  Voyage of the Wasp, 1822–23  June 1822 to March 1823 = In the early 19th century the geography of Antarctica was almost completely unknown, though occasional sightings of land had been recorded.For details of early Antarctic land sightings, including Bellingshausen's first sighting of the Antarctic mainland, see Headland, pp. 108–30 In 1822 Benjamin Morrell, who had sailed to the South Sandwich Islands the previous year,Morrell, pp. xx to xxvii was appointed commander of the schooner Wasp for a two-year voyage of sealing, trading and exploration in the Antarctic seas and the southern Pacific Ocean.Morrell, p. xxvii In addition to his sealing duties Morrell had, as he put it, \\"discretionary powers to prosecute new discoveries.\\" He proposed to use this discretion to investigate the Antarctic seas \\"and to ascertain the practicality ... of penetrating to the South Pole.\\" This would be the first of four extended voyages that would keep Morrell at sea for most of the following eight years, although he would not revisit the Antarctic after the initial voyage.The subsequent voyages, in successive ships, would take Morrell to the Pacific Ocean, the south and west coasts of Africa, and the Indian Ocean. See Morrell, Contents pages i to vii Wasp sailed south from New York on 1822. She reached the Falkland Islands late in October, after which Morrell spent 16 days in fruitless searches for the nonexistent Aurora Islands,The Aurora Islands were one of numerous phantom islands reported in sub-Antarctic waters, eventually proved to be nonexistent. See list of phantom sightings in .W.J Mills, pp. 434–35 before heading for South Georgia, where the ship anchored on . In his account Morrell wrongly records the position of this anchorage, giving a location in open sea about south-west of the island's coastline. According to Morrell's account, Wasp then headed eastwards to hunt for seals, and reached the remote Bouvet Island on . The polar historian H.R. Mill notes that Morrell's description of this island's physical features fails to mention its most singular characteristic—the permanent ice sheet that covers its surface.H.R. Mill, pp. 106–07Morrell, pp. 58–62 Morrell then attempted to take the ship southwards but, reaching thick ice at around 60°S, turned northeast towards the Kerguelen Islands where he anchored on . Bouvet Island, which Morrell claimed to have reached on 6 December 1822 After several days of exploration and evidently profitable sealing, Wasp left the Kerguelens on 1823, sailing south and east to record her furthest eastern position at 64°52'S, 118°27'E on .Morrell, pp. 62–65H R Mill, pp. 107–08 From this point, according to his own account, Morrell decided to take advantage of strong easterly winds, and made passage westward back to the Greenwich meridian, 0°. His subsequent account of this voyage has been disputed, particularly his assertion that a distance of more than was covered in 23 days. The writer Rupert Gould points out that, according to Morrell's record, this journey included a stretch of in four days, a rate of progress that even Gould, generally sympathetic to Morrell, is inclined to doubt.Gould, p. 261 Morrell quotes various positions during the voyage at southerly latitudes which later proved to be at least 100 miles inside the then undiscovered Antarctic continental mainland. One possible explanation for this discrepancy, offered by the writer W.J. Mills, is that since Morrell's account was written nine years after the voyage he may not have had access to the ship's log, and hence \\"felt constrained to invent details that appeared plausible\\", in order to sustain his narrative. On Wasp reached Candlemas Island in the South Sandwich Islands. After a few days spent in a search for fuel to feed the ship's stoves, Morrell sailed southwards on , into the area later known as the Weddell Sea.James Weddell, who first explored the area a month before Morrell, named the sea \\"King George IV's Sea\\". This name was not generally adopted; in 1900 the sea was formally named the Weddell Sea. Everett-Heath p. 409 (Weddell Sea entry) Finding the sea remarkably free of ice, Morrell advanced to 70°14'S before turning north-westward on . This retreat, Morrell says, was due to the ship's lack of fuel; otherwise, he claims, in these open waters he could have taken the ship to 85°, or perhaps to the Pole itself.Morrell, pp. 66–68 These words are very similar to those used by the British explorer James Weddell to describe his own experiences in the same area, a month earlier, which has led historians to suspect that Morrell may have plagiarised Weddell's experiences.Simpson-Housley, p. 57 = Sighting of land = Captain Benjamin Morrell, who claimed to have sighted New South Greenland. From the earliest navigations of the Southern Ocean in the 16th century, lands which subsequently proved to be nonexistent had from time to time been reported.See list of reported lands and islands in: Robert Headland of the Scott Polar Research Institute has suggested various reasons for these false sightings, ranging from \\"too much rum\\" to deliberate hoaxes designed to lure rival ships away from good sealing grounds. Some sightings may have been of large ice masses that were carrying rocks and other glacial debris—dirty ice can appear convincingly similar to land. It is also possible that some of these lands existed, but later became submerged after volcanic eruptions. Other sightings may have been of actual land, the position of which was wrongly fixed through observational errors arising from chronometer failure, adverse weather or simple incompetence.Rubin, p. 152 (insert by Robert Headland: \\"Non-existent Antarctic Islands\\") At 2 pm on 15 March, as Wasp cruised north-eastwards, Morrell records: \\"Land was seen from the masthead, bearing west, distance 3 leagues\\" (about nine miles, 14 km).Morrell, pp. 69–70 He did not at the time consider that he had made a new discovery; he seems to have assumed that he was seeing the east coast of the Antarctic Peninsula, the western coast of which had been explored and given the name New South Greenland in 1821, by Robert Johnson, a former captain of the Wasp. Johnson's name for this land was never adopted; in 1831 it was named Graham Land.H R Mill, pp. 161–62. At the time of Morrell's voyage, the geographical character and dimensions of the peninsula were unknown; Morrell's recorded position was in fact far to the east of the peninsula.H R Mill, p. 109 Morrell's account reads: \\"At half past we were close on with the body of land to which Captain Johnson had given the name of New South Greenland\\".Simpson-Housley, map, p. 52 The next few days were spent exploring this supposed coast, which was apparently rich in seal. Some further south, Morrell thought he could see snow-covered mountains. After three days, Morrell called a halt \\"because of shortage of water and season far advanced\\". Wasp turned north, from a position Morrell calculated as 67°52'S, 48°11'W, and on , the ship passed what he assumed was the northern cape of the land, at 62°41'S, 47°21'W. \\"This land abounds with oceanic birds of every description\\", wrote Morrell. He also records seeing 3,000 sea elephants. At 10 o'clock Wasp \\"bade farewell to the cheerless shores of New South Greenland\\", and sailed for Tierra del Fuego, then through the Magellan Strait into the Pacific Ocean, reaching Valparaiso, Chile, on 1823.  Searches for Morrell's land  1894 maps of Antarctic regions showing the limited knowledge of Antarctic geography 70 years after Morrell. The lower map marks Ross's Appearance, but not New South Greenland In 1838, the French explorer Jules Dumont d'Urville sailed over the position of Morrell's \\"north cape\\", but saw no indication of land.Gould, pp. 266–67 This, together with the obvious errors in Morrell's voyage account, and his general reputation as a braggart, led most later geographers to doubt his story.H R Mill, pp. 104–05 This scepticism remained even after Sir James Clark Ross reported an appearance of land in 1843, not far from Morrell's alleged observation; Ross's sighting was occasionally proffered as support for Morrell's claim. After Ross there was no further exploration of the Weddell Sea until 1903, when William Speirs Bruce took Scotia to 74°1'S, but in a sector of the sea which did not bring him close to Morrell's or Ross's supposed sightings.Speak, p. 92. Bruce reached his Farthest South at longitude 22°W. Bruce was, however, did not dismiss Morrell's claims, writing that they should not be rejected until absolutely disproved.Gould, p. 271 The first determined search for New South Greenland came during the Second German Antarctic Expedition, 1911–13, under Wilhelm Filchner. The expedition's ship, Deutschland, became trapped in heavy sea ice while attempting to establish a shore base at Vahsel Bay. Her subsequent north-westerly drift had, by mid-, brought her to a position just east of Morrell's recorded sighting. Filchner left the ship on and, with two companions and sufficient provisions for three weeks, sledged westward across the sea ice in search of Morrell's land. Daylight was limited to two or three hours a day, and temperatures fell to −31 °F (−35 °C), making travel difficult. They found no signs of land; a lead weight dropped through the ice reached a depth of before the line snapped. The depth confirmed that there was no land in the vicinity, and Filchner concluded that Morrell had probably seen a mirage. On 17 August 1915 Sir Ernest Shackleton's ship Endurance, trapped in the ice like Deutschland three years earlier, drifted to a point 10 miles west of Morrell's sighting. Here, a depth sounding recorded 1,676 fathoms (10,060 feet, 3,065 m), leading Shackleton to write: \\"I decided that Morrell Land must be added to the long list of Antarctic islands and continental coasts that have resolved themselves into icebergs\\". On a further sounding of 1,900 fathoms (11,400 feet, 3,500 m) gave Shackleton additional evidence of the non- existence of New South Greenland.Shackleton, pp. 60–61 Although Filchner's and Shackleton's investigations and observations were accepted as conclusive proof that New South Greenland was a myth, there remained the question of Sir James Ross's reported appearance of land in a position around 65°S, 47°W.Gould, p. 272 Ross's reputation was sufficient for this possibility to be taken seriously, and for his alleged sighting to be recorded on maps and Admiralty charts.Wild, p. 91 In 1922 Frank Wild, leading the Shackleton-Rowett Expedition aboard Quest after Shackleton's death early in the expedition, investigated the location of Ross's sighting. Nothing was seen; prevented by ice conditions from reaching the exact spot, Wild took a sounding at 64°11'S, 46°4'W, which revealed of water. This showed that no land was near.Wild, p. 144  Opinions and theories  Weddell Sea iceberg in the region of \\"New South Greenland\\", Endurance expedition August 1915\\\\. Shackleton observed how land appearances frequently resolved into icebergs. Hugh Robert Mill, writing in 1905 before the non-existence of New South Greenland had been finally established, concluded that because of Morrell's blunders, and his habit of incorporating the experiences of others into his story, all his claims should be treated as unproven.H R Mill, p. 111 Nevertheless, he conceded that \\"a man may be ignorant, boastful and obscure, and yet have done a solid piece of work\\".H R Mill, p. 105 The Canadian geographer Paul Simpson-Housley, although sceptical about much of Morrell's account, suggests that the speeds claimed for the derided western journey, though fast, were not impossible,Simpson- Housley, pp. 57–69 and Morrell's farthest south in the Weddell Sea, queried by Mill,H R Mill, p. 109. is entirely plausible, given that James Weddell had sailed four degrees further south just a month earlier. The writer Rupert Gould, in a lengthy essay on New South Greenland published in 1929, queries the assumption that the sighting was simply invented by Morrell, partly on the grounds that very little weight is given to the discovery in Morrell's 500-page account. Gould writes: \\"If Morrell wished to gain an undeserved reputation as an Antarctic explorer, one would think he could have gone a better way about it than to bury his pièces justificatives, after he had forged them, in an undistinguished corner of so bulky a book.\\"Gould, p.268 Nor would he have credited it to Captain Johnson two years earlier, rather than to himself. The Larsen Ice Shelf, on the eastern coast of the Antarctic peninsula Gould also discusses the possibility that what Morrell sighted was the eastern coast of Graham Land, the so-called \\"Foyn Coast\\",Gould uses the term \\"Foyn Coast\\" to describe the whole east coast of Graham Land. The Foyn Coast is actually only a short stretch of this coast, approximately long, separated from the Weddell Sea by the Larsen Ice Shelf. See Stonehouse, p. 107 despite its being 14° further west from position of the New South Greenland sighting. Gould asserts that the features of the peninsula's eastern coast corresponds closely with Morrell's description of New South Greenland.Gould, pp. 277–78 This theory supposes that Morrell miscalculated the ship's position, perhaps because he lacked the chronometer necessary for proper navigational observation. In his account Morrell writes that he was \\"destitute of the various nautical and mathematical instruments\\",Morrell, p. 67 although other parts of his narrative seem to indicate that the occasional dead reckoning calculation was the exception to the norm.Gould, p. 276 A longitudinal error of 14° is very large, and the additional distance of about to the Foyn coast seems too great to have been covered within the ten-day voyage from the South Sandwich Islands, where the ship's position is recorded accurately. Even so, Gould suggests that a \\"balance of evidence\\" shows that what Morrell saw was the Foyn coast.Gould, pp. 280–81 Fata Morgana, a form of superior mirage, which distorts ice or distant coastlines so they might appear as islands with tall cliffs. Filchner's view that the supposed sighting of New South Greenland could be explained by a mirage is echoed by Simpson-Housley. He suggests that Morrell and his crew saw a superior mirage. One form of superior mirage, sometimes described as a Fata Morgana, distorts distant flat coastlines or ice edges both vertically and horizontally, so they can appear to have tall cliffs and other features such as high mountain peaks and valleys. In his expedition account South, Shackleton gives a description of a Fata Morgana observed on 1915, coincidentally as his ship Endurance drifted close to the recorded position of New South Greenland: \\"The distant pack is thrown up into towering barrier-like cliffs, which are reflected in blue lakes and lanes of water at their base. Great white and golden cities of Oriental appearance at close intervals along these cliff-tops indicate distant bergs ... The lines rise and fall, tremble, dissipate, and reappear in an endless transformation scene\\".  Afterwards  Morrell's four voyages finally ended on 1831, with his return to New York.Morrell, p. 492 He then wrote his Narrative of Four Voyages, which was published the following year. He attempted to resume his seafaring career, seeking employment with the London- based shipping firm of Enderby Brothers, but his reputation had preceded him and he was rejected. Charles Enderby stated publicly that \\"he had heard so much of him that he did not think fit to enter into any engagement with him.\\"Gould, p. 255 Morrell also sought to join Dumont D'Urville's expedition to the Weddell Sea in 1837, but his services were again declined.H R Mill, pp. 110–11 He reportedly died in 1839,American National Biography (Vol. 15), p. 879 and is commemorated by Morrell Island, 59°27'S, 27°19'W, an alternative name for Thule Island in the Southern Thule sub-group of the South Sandwich Islands. Robert Johnson, who coined the name New South Greenland, disappeared with his ship in 1826, while investigating the Antarctic waters in the vicinity of what would later be known as the Ross Sea.

It is a -story brick house. A notable feature is the large two-story pedimented portico supported by fluted Doric columns on the first floor and Ionic columns on the balustraded second floor. It was the retirement home of Thomas Johnson (1732–1819), the first elected Governor of the State of Maryland and Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court. It was built in the mid-1790s by his daughter and son-in-law. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971. History of the Property This land was a part of \\"Tasker's Chance\\", a 7,000-acre tract owned in 1726 by Benjamin Tasker. In 1737 a group of German farmers took out an option on the entire tract of land described as containing some of the area's finest potential home-sites. Unable to raise the sum of money Tasker had asked for the land, the small farmers, all of them poor, went to Annapolis lawyer and land speculator Daniel Dulany for financing. Agreeing to undertake the financial arrangements Dulany bought the option, then the tract itself, selling small lots to the enterprising Germans. One 225 acre section was bought in 1746 for 20 pounds by a German, Hans Peter Hoffman. He called the tract \\"Rose Garden.\\" His descendants subsequently sold his whole plantation to Maryland' first elected Governor, Thomas Johnson in 1778 for 4,000 pounds, current money of Maryland at that time. The 225 acre tract was given by Governor Thomas Johnson to his eldest daughter, Ann Jennings Johnson as a wedding gift on the eve of her marriage to Major John Colin Graham. Following the death of his wife, Governor Johnson spent the last 25 years of his life living as a guest of his daughter Ann at Rose Hill. Under Graham's hand, Rose Hill's acreage doubled. By the mid-1820s Graham was having problems making ends meet and he sold off some of his slaves, 100 acres of Rose Hill and 300 acres of a farm located 5 miles to the west of Rose Hill. His will instructed his wife to sell the estate after his death, pay debts and keep what was left. =Later ownership= *In 1833, Captain John McPherson who married Mrs. Graham's niece purchased Rose Hill. He never occupied the mansion, thus protecting Mrs. Graham's right to remain there until her death in 1837. *In 1837, Rose Hill was sold to Colonel William Slater, an Irish immigrant and wealthy merchant from Philadelphia and Baltimore. *In 1843, Colonel Slater sold the estate to his brother George. *In 1845 the property was sold to John J. Willson (married to Anna Tyler) who spent a considerable amount of money on renovating it. *In 1853 the estate was sold to David Ogle Thomas, a direct descendant of one of the original purchasers of Tasker's Chance. Upon his death, the property was left to his wife who sold it in 1894 and moved to Baltimore. *The estate was on the market for 12 years and unoccupied, when the agent Noel Cramer bought it and lived in it until the mid 1920s. He gave it to his son, James, who thought it was too far from town and it was left vacant for 25 years, except in 1930 when it served as a hotel and restaurant. *In the 1950s the Cramer's returned and restored it, but the owner died in 1957. *In 1968, the Board of County Commissioners of Frederick County purchased the remaining 43 acre site for $401,400 of Federal, State and County funds. The house is currently owned by the county and is operated as part of Rose Hill Manor Park & Children's Museum. *In 1972 a unique 'see and touch' children's museum was opened in the mansion as a joint venture with the Frederick County Parks Commission and the Board of Education. Description of the House and Property Thought to have been built by local craftsman the Rose Hill manor house construction began shortly after the wedding of Ann Jennings Johnson and Major John Colin Graham. The construction of the 2-1/2 story, white frame, brick wall mansion stretched over an eight-year period from laying the foundation to its occupation around 1798. The house rests on a low fieldstone foundation with brick cellar walls. The front façade faces the south and is laid in Flemish bond and all other is in common bond. A nineteenth century galleried portico with white columns fronts the mansion. Rose Hill Mansion is approached by a driveway off an entrance road adjoining the northern boundary of Governor Thomas Johnson High School from the west side of North Market Street. The portico forms two porches: One is on the ground floor at the entrance level with four Doric columns supporting a structure between the columns and a roof consisting of an architrave, frieze and elaborate, carved cornice. The other is above on the second floor with four Ionic columns supporting the pediment lighted by a lunette window. On either side of the large pediment, the roof is pierced by a dormer window with round-arch and a parapet. A similar pediment with a lunette window also graces the rear elevation of the mansion. A flush chimney rises from each gable end of the main block. The mansion's design reflects the late Georgian style of Tidewater, Maryland and the Greek Revival style. At the north end of the wide entrance hall is a broad staircase that rises to a landing from which a window overlooks the north garden. The stair continues up in units of six steps to the third story. The upper rails and banisters are light in weight and plain. Off the east side of the entrance hall is a 26-foot square, high ceiling drawing room containing six windows, a mantel piece and a large chandelier with crystal prisms. To the west of the entrance hall is a dining room of the same generous dimensions which recalls an age of good living and entertainment. The second floor center hall south door opens directly onto the upper level of the front porch that faces the high school. On either side of the upper hall are two large bedrooms with fireplaces and two smaller bedrooms that have had a section partitioned off for a bathroom. A kitchen with a fireplace and beehive oven is adjoined to the western side of the mansion with a flush brick chimney rising from the west gable end. There is a service entrance at the front and a verandah on the back overlooking formal gardens. There are several small rooms over the kitchen. Windows on the first floor are nine-over-nine sash and on the second floor are nine-over-six sash all with colonial shutters having widely spaced louvers with hand wrought hardware and headed by jack arches. The attic contains two large finished rooms. It is lighted by nine-over-six sash pane round arched dormer windows headed by local style stepped gables on the front and rear. A formal, native fieldstone walled garden and orchard with old trees occupies about a half an acre on the northern side of the mansion. The garden is accented by an attractive, two-tier cast iron fountain with the pedestal and bowls decorated by Greek acanthus leaves. This was topped by a \\"putti\\" [cherub] embracing a swan. Other buildings include a brick smokehouse with hour glass design louvers, a hipped roof summer kitchen, ice house, old tool shed, an 1835 log cabin, a new building known as the Robert H. Renneberger Carriage Museum features a collection of restored carriages and sleighs, a carriage repair shop and blacksmith shop, three exhibit buildings housing steam engines, antique farm machinery and a livestock barn, the Farm Museum displays include tractors, 19th and early 20th century agriculture tools and equipment, farm family life, a carpentry shop and a broom shop.

GERAM Framework: This set of components is identified in the first image and briefly described in the following. Starting from defined concepts to be used in enterprise integration (GERA), GERAM distinguishes between the methodologies for enterprise integration (GEEM) and the languages used to describe structure, contents and behaviour of the enterprise (GEML). Generalised Enterprise Reference Architecture and Methodology (GERAM) is a generalised enterprise architecture framework for enterprise integration and business process engineering. It identifies the set of components recommended for use in enterprise engineering.J.G. Nell, NIST (1997). \\"An Overview of GERAM\\" ICEIMT'97 International Conference on Enterprise Integration Modelling Technology 1997. Updated 30 January 1997 This framework was developed in the 1990s by a joint task force of both the International Federation of Automatic Control (IFAC) and the International Federation of Information Processing (IFIP) on enterprise architectures for enterprise integration. The development started with the evaluation of then-existing frameworks for enterprise application integration, which was developed into an overall definition of a so-called \\"generalised architecture\\".P. Bernus, and L. Nemes (1994). \\"A Framework to Define a Generic Enterprise Reference Architecture and Methodology\\". In: Proceedings of the International Conference on Automation, Robotics and Computer Vision (ICARCV'94), Singapore, November 10–12, 1994.  Overview  One of the basics of GERAM is that enterprise modelling was seen as the major issue in enterprise engineering and integration. It contained several of building blocks, in which the methodologies and the corresponding languages have been implemented, such as: * Enterprise modelling tools (GEMT) to support the enterprise integration process. * Ontological theories (OT), * Generic enterprise models (GEMs) and * Generic modules (GMs) The building blocks were designed to support the modelling process by providing means for more efficient modelling. The resulting enterprise model (EM) represents all or part of the enterprise operation. These models will allow simulation of operational alternatives and thereby their evaluation leading. GERAM provides a generic description of all the elements recommended in enterprise engineering and integration. Generalised Enterprise Reference Architecture and Methodology (GERAM) is an enterprise-reference architecture that models the whole life history of an enterprise integration project from its initial concept in the eyes of the entrepreneurs who initially developed it, through its definition, functional design or specification, detailed design, physical implementation or construction, and finally operation to obsolescence. The architecture aims to be a relatively simple framework upon which all the functions and activities involved in the aforementioned phases of the life of the enterprise-integration project can be mapped. It also will permit the tools used by the investigators or practitioners at each phase to be indicated. The architecture defined will apply to projects, products, and processes; as well as to enterprises.  History  Generalised Enterprise Reference Architecture and Methodology (GERAM) was developed in the 1990s by an IFAC/IFIP Task Force on Architectures for Enterprise Integration, which consisted of Peter Bernus, James G. Nell and others. The IFAC/IFIP Task Force on Architectures for Enterprise Integration was establishment in 1990 and had studied enterprise-reference architectures ever since.J.G. Nell (2006). \\"Requirements and Methodology for Enterprise-Reference Architectures: A New Work Item Proposal\\". updated 20 May 1996. The task force established the requirements to be satisfied by candidate enterprise-reference architectures and their associated methodologies to fulfill the needs of industry for such aids to enterprise integration. The result has been called GERAM, for \\"Generalized Enterprise-Reference Architecture and Methodology\\", by the Task Force. The Task Force has shown that such an architecture is feasible and that several architectures presently available in the literature can already or potentially can fulfil such requirements. The development of enterprise- reference architecture has evolved from the development of Design Methodology for Advanced Manufacturing Systems in the 1980s,Doumeingts, G., Vallespir, B., Darracar, D., M., \\"Design Methodology for Advanced Manufacturing Systems\\", Computers in Industry, Vol. 9, pp. 271-296, December 1987. such as CIMOSA, the Open System Architecture for CIM.AMICE Consortium (1989). Open System Architecture for CIM, Research Report of ESPRIT Project 688, Vol. 1, Springer- Verlag.AMICE Consortium (1991), Open System Architecture, CIMOSA, AD 1.0, Architecture Description, ESPRIT Consortium AMICE, Brussels, Belgium. The GERAM framework was first published by Peter Bernus and Laszlo Nemes in 1994.  Topics  Components = The eight main components, as shown in figure 1 are: * Generic Enterprise Reference Architecture (GERA): Defines the enterprise related generic concepts recommended for use in enterprise integration projects. These concepts include enterprise systems life cycle; business process modeling; modeling languages for different users of the architecture (business users, system designers, IT modeling specialists, others); integrated model representation in different model views. * Generic Enterprise Engineering Methodologies (GEEM): Describe the generic processes of enterprise integration. These methodologies may be described in terms of process models with detailed instruction for each step of the integration process. * Generic Enterprise Modeling Languages (GEML): Define the generic constructs (building blocks) for enterprise modeling adapted to the different needs of people creating and using enterprise models. * Generic Enterprise Modeling Tools (GEMT): Define the generic implementation of enterprise- integration methodologies and modeling languages and other support for creation and use of enterprise models. * Enterprise Models (EM): Represents the enterprise operation. These models will be represented using generic modeling language constructs. * Ontological Theories (OT): Formalise the most generic aspects of enterprise-related concepts in terms of essential properties and axioms. * Generic Enterprise Models (GEMs): Identify reference models (partial models) which capture concepts common to many enterprises. GEMs will be used in enterprise modeling to increase modeling process efficiency. * Generic Modules (GMs): Identify generally applicable products to be employed in enterprise integration (e.g. tools, integrating infrastructures, others.). = Generic Enterprise Reference Architecture = Generic Enterprise Reference Architecture (GERA) defines the enterprise related generic concepts recommended for use in enterprise integration projects. These concepts include life cycle; enterprise entity types, enterprise modelling with business process modelling; integrated model representation in different model views and modelling languages for different users of the enterprise architecture (business users, system designers, IT modelling specialists, among others). Fig 2. GERA Life-Cycle Concept.  Life-Cycle Concept  Provides for the identification of the life-cycle phases for any enterprise entity from entity conception to its final end. The Figure 2: GERA Life-Cycle Concept, shows the GERA life cycle phases of enterprise entities. A total of 9 life cycle phases has been defined. * Identification phase allows the identification of the enterprise business or any part of it in terms of its relation to both its internal and external environment. This includes the definition general commitments of the integration or engineering activities to be carried out in relevant projects. * Concept phase provides for the presentation of the management visions, missions, values, operational concepts (build/buy, etc.), policies, plus others. * Requirement phase allows the description of operational processes and collection of all their functional, behavioural, informational and capability requirements. * Design phase is the specification of operational system with all its components satisfying the above requirements. Process and resources alternatives may be specified which provide operational alternatives to be used during the operation. * Implementation phase describes the real operational system which may deviate from the designed system due to enterprise preferences or availability of components. * Build phase supports the system manifestation, physical implementation of resources, testing and validation for the designed processes and the subsequent release for operation. * Operation phase employs the released operational processes and the provided resources to support the life cycle phases of the enterprise products. * System Change/Re-Engineering phase allows to modify or re-engineer the operational processes according to newly identified needs or capabilities provided by new technologies. * End of Life phase supports the recycling or disposal of the operational system at the ending of its use in the enterprise operation. This phase has to provide concepts for recycling and/or disposal of all or part of the system. Fig 3. GERA Enterprise-Entity Concept.  Enterprise Entity Type Concept  Identifies entity types to be used in enterprise engineering and enterprise integration. Adopting a recursive view of integration altogether five entity types with their associated life-cycles can be identified. The recursiveness of the first four entity types can be demonstrated by identifying the role of the different entities, their products and the relations between them. Figure 3: GERA Enterprise Entity Concept, shows the GERA life cycle phases of enterprise entities. A total of 9 life cycle phases has been defined. * Strategic Enterprise Management Entity (type 1): defines the necessity and the starting of any enterprise engineering effort. * Enterprise Engineering/Integration Entity (type 2): provides the means to carry out the enterprise entity type 1. It employs methodologies (type 5 entity) to define, design, implement and build the operation of the enterprise entity (type 3 entity). * Enterprise Entity (type 3): is the result of the operation of entity type 2. It uses methodologies (entity type 5) and the operational system provided by entity type 2 to define, design, implement and build the products (services) of the enterprise (type 4 entity). * Product Entity (type 4): is the result of the operation of entity type 3. It represents all products (services) of the enterprise. * Methodology Entity (type 5): represents the methodology to be employed in any enterprise entity type. Figure 3 represents the chain of enterprise entity developments. The type 1 entity will always start creation of any lower level entity by identifying goal, scope and objectives for the particular entity. Development and implementation of a new enterprise entity (or new business unit) will then be done by a type 2 entity; whereas a type 3 entity will be responsible for developing and manufacturing a new product (type 4 entity). With the possible exception of the type 1 entity all enterprise entities will have an associated entity-life cycle. However, it is always the operational phase of the entity- life cycle in which the lower entity is defined, created, developed and built. The operation itself is supported by an associated methodology for enterprise engineering, enterprise operation, product development and production support Fig 4: GERA Enterprise-Entity Concept--Type 3. Figure 3 also shows the life cycle of the methodology (type 5 entity) and the process model developed during the early life cycle phases of the methodology. However, there must be a clear distinction between the life cycle of the methodology with its different phases and its process model. The latter is used to support the operational phase of a particular enterprise entity. The operational relations of the different entity types are also shown in Figure 4: GERA Enterprise Entity Concept (Type 3), which demonstrates the contributions of the different entities to the type 3 entity life-cycle phases. The manufacturing entity itself produces the enterprise product in the course of its operation phase (type 3 entity). Fig 5. GERA Generic-Reference-Architecture Concept.  Enterprise Modelling concept  Enterprise Modelling concept provides process models of enterprise operations. Process oriented modelling allows to represent the operation of enterprise entities and entity types in all its aspects: functional, behaviour, information, resources and organisation. Models which can be used for decision support by evaluating operational alternatives or for model driven operation control and monitoring. To hide complexity of the resulting model it will be presented to the user in different sub-sets (views). This view concept is shown in Figure 5: GERA Generic Reference Architecture Concept. It is applicable during all phases of the life cycle. Please note that the views will be generated from the underlying integrated model and any model manipulation. That means any change being done in one particular view will be reflected in all relevant aspects of the model. The GERA life cycle model has defined four different views: function, information, decision/organisation and resource/structure. Other views may be defined if needed and supported by the modelling tool. In addition, the life cycle model of GERA provides for two different categories of modelling: operation control and customer-service related.  Modelling Language concept  Modelling languages increase the efficiency of enterprise modelling. In addition they allow a common representation of the enterprise operation. Modelling languages have to accommodate different users of enterprise models; for example, business users, system designers, and IT- modelling specialists. Modelling languages have to support the modelling of all entity types across all phases of their respective life cycles. In addition, modelling languages have to provide generic constructs as well as macro constructs (GEMs) built from generic ones. The latter will further enhance modelling productivity. Figure 5 shows the reference architecture for those enterprise entity life cycle phases which require generic constructs. The partial level shows the place of the GEMs in the reference architecture. The particular level indicates the life cycle phases of the enterprise entity itself. = Generic Enterprise Engineering Methodologies = Fig 6. Enterprise Engineering and the Life-Cycle Concept. Generic Enterprise engineering methodologies (GEEM) describe the process of enterprise integration and, according to the GERAM framework (Figure 1), will result in a model of the enterprise operation. The methodologies will guide the user in the engineering task of enterprise modelling and integration. Different methodologies may exist which will guide the user through the different tasks required in the integration process. Enterprise-engineering methodologies should orient themselves on the life-cycle concept identified in GERA and should support the different life cycle phases shown in Figure 2. The enterprise integration process itself is usually directed towards the enterprise entity type 3 (see above) operation and carried out as an enterprise engineering task by an enterprise entity type 2 (Figures 2 and 4). The integration task may start at any relevant engineering phase (indicated in Figure 6: Enterprise Engineering and the Life-Cycle Concept.) of the entity life cycle and may employ any of those phases. Therefore, the processes relating to the different phases of enterprise engineering should be independent of each other to support different sequences of engineering tasks. Enterprise engineering methodologies may be described in terms of process models with detailed instruction for each step of the integration process. This allows not only a very good representation of the methodology for its understanding, but provides for identification of information to be used and produced, resources needed and relevant responsibilities to be assigned for the integration process. Process representation of methodologies should employ the relevant modelling language discussed below. = Generic Enterprise-Modelling Language = Generic enterprise modelling languages (GEML) define generic constructs (building blocks) for enterprise modelling. Generic constructs which represent the different elements of the operation improve both modelling efficiency and model understanding. These constructs have to be adapted to the different needs of people creating and using enterprise models. Therefore, different languages may exist which accommodate different users (e.g. business users, system designers, IT modelling specialists, others). Modelling the enterprise operation means to describe its processes and the necessary information, resources and organisational aspects. Therefore, modelling languages have to provide constructs capable of capturing the semantics of enterprise operations. This is especially important if enterprise models are to support the enterprise operation itself. Model-based decision support and model-driven operation control and monitoring require modelling constructs which are supporting the end users and which represent the operational processes according to the users perception. Modelling languages increase the efficiency of enterprise modelling. In addition they allow a common representation of the enterprise operation. Modelling languages have to support the modelling of all entity types across all phases of their respective life cycles. In addition, modelling languages have to provide generic constructs as well as macro constructs (GEMs) build from generic ones. The latter will further enhance modelling productivity. = Generic Enterprise-Modelling Tool = Generic enterprise modelling tools (GEMT) define the generic implementation of the enterprise integration methodologies and modelling languages and other support for creation and use of enterprise models. Modelling tools should provide user guidance for both the modelling process itself and for the operational use of the models. Therefore, enterprise modelling tools designs have to encompass not only the modelling methodology, but should provide model enactment capability for simulation of operational processes as well. The latter should also include analysis and evaluation capabilities for the simulation results. = Enterprise Models = Enterprise models (EMs) represent the enterprise operation mostly in the form of business processes. However, in certain cases other representations may be suitable as well. Business processes will be represented using the generic modelling-language constructs defined above for the relevant engineering methodology. Enterprise operations are usually rather complex and therefore difficult to understand if all relevant aspects of the operation are represented in a common model. To reduce the model complexity for the user, different views should be provided which allow the users only to see the aspect of concern. = Ontological Theories = Ontological theories (OT) formalise the most generic aspects of enterprise related concepts in terms of essential properties and axioms. Ontological theories may be considered as 'meta-models' since they consider facts and rules about the facts and rules of the enterprise and its models. = Generic Enterprise Models = Generic enterprise models (GEMs) identify reference models (partial models) which capture concepts common to many enterprises. GEMs will be used in enterprise modelling to increase modelling process efficiency. = Generic Modules = Generic Modules (GMs) identify generally applicable products to be employed in enterprise integration (e.g. tools, integrating infrastructures, others.).

This experience taught her true cooperation as she would star in Gigi one week and work on the back stage crew the next. Her high school plays and musicals gave her an outlet during the school year and her parents would continually have her join their programs and performances at George Williams College where they both were teachers. With graduation she won a scholarship to a new musical theater training program at Boston Conservatory of Music. Career Morrison left Boston Conservatory, attended the HB Studios in New York, spent time in San Francisco before arriving back in Chicago. At 19, she joined The Benny Kim Show, a 7-member family band created by Korean Big Band leader Benny Kim. As Emcee and singer/trombone player She wore a black afro wig and a '70s white jump suit with glitter and fringe. They played nightclubs and Holiday Inns in and around Chicago for the next year. This ended when while on stage it was announced that she would marry the second eldest son and left the show. Morrison was admitted to an apprentice program that Burt Reynolds was sponsoring at his Jupiter, Florida dinner theater. Besides singing in the lobby before performances the 10 member group would work back stage on the crew. This gave Ann the chance to watch and get to know the TV and film stars (Tyne Daly, Sally Field, and Kate Jackson) some of whom were making a stage debut. She was given an opportunity when it was decided she would play the Girl in The Fantastiks. At the end of the year-long program each apprentice earned their Actors' Equity Association card by signing a contract for The Sound Of Music (Ann played Sister Margaretta), the last show of the season. Prior to that they each appeared on Dinah! when Dinah Shore brought her daytime TV talk show to the stage of the Burt Reynolds Theater for one week. Morrison sang \\"I Can Cook Too\\" wearing a 1940s style costume with hat and gloves. After wowing Dinah and the live audience, Burt Reynolds declared that Morrison was the one to watch and that we would probably see her on Broadway in a year or so.\\"Dinah!\\"(1978)broadcast from the Burt Reynold's Jupiter Theater. Burt Reynolds and Dinah Shore with Ann Morrison Having Earned her AEA card, Morrison moved to New York where within a month was cast in a new Waldman/Uhry musical Dream Time. Regional productions of Grease, Babes In Arms and Godspell followed. Then she was cast in a role that would change her life. After seeing her play silent film actress Mabel Normand in a new musical Keystone at the GEVA Theatre in Rochester, NY, famed choreographer Ron Field told her she should play Mary Flynn in the new Sondheim/Furth musical Merrily We Roll Along. All of the roles had been cast but Harold Prince was still looking for Mary. She was flown to New York for a first audition for the Casting Director, then returned to GEVA to finish her run. Back in New York, on her 25th birthday she was asked to sing for Harold Prince and Stephen Sondheim. She recalls in interviews that Prince walked down to the stage and offered the role of Mary. They would begin rehearsals 6 months later. Much has been written about what happened when Merrily We Roll Along opened on Broadway. During 6 weeks of previews (52 performances) James Weisenbach was replaced by Jim Walton and Larry Fuller took over as choreographer when Ron Field was replaced. Morrison claims that there were changes in every performance until 3 days before opening. The morning after the show closed, the cast went into the studios at RCA Records to make the Original Broadway Cast recording. The next spring, Morrison received a Theatre World Award for her performance as Mary Flynn. Together with former Merrily castmate Jason Alexander, she replaced the original cast of Forbidden Broadway at Palsson's in New York. She impersonated Mary Martin, Julie Andrews, Carol Channing and appeared on TV on The Merv Griffin Show as Patti LuPone in Evita. While playing in Forbidden Broadway she taped a TV version of Keystone for broadcast on New Jersey Network, reprising her role as Mabel Normand. American Producer Louis Busch Hager wanted to cast an American Actress in the title role of a new musical version of Peg O' My Heart set for the West End in London. He cast Ann after her London audition and back in New York she began a series of backers auditions while working with composer David Heneker (Half A Sixpence). Heneker completed the song Manhattan Hometown while he and Morrison were staying at Hager's Cooperstown, NY home. Peg as the musical was now titled, began rehearsals in London for an April 1984 opening. She was welcomed by her British cast of West End stars Sian Phillips, Edward Duke, and Patricia Michael, in a small production (9 characters, no chorus) giving them a modest run through the summer. They made a cast recording http://www.jayrecords.com/cast-recordings/ before Morrison returned to New York. In the years that followed, Morrison created the role of Lizzie in the highly acclaimed Polly Pen/Peggy Harmon musical Goblin Market first Off-Off Broadway at the Vineyard Theatre, then moving to Circle In The Square Downtown Off Broadway. This earned her a Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Actress in a Musical nomination. With Teri Klausner she made an Original Cast recording with JAY Records.http://www.jayrecords.com/cast-recordings/ In her new home of Los Angeles she played Faye Apple in the West Coast Premiere of Anyone Can Whistle and won a Dramalogue Award for Blame It On The Movies II. In regional theaters across the country she has starred in Peter Pan, Guys and Dolls, Little Shop Of Horrors, Cabaret, On a Clear Day You Can See Forever, Oliver!, Good News, musical versions of A Midsummer Night's Dream, Twelfth Night and Love's Labours Lost, Can-Can (musical), Sunset Boulevard, Shadowlands and On The Verge. She has done countless cabaret performances and concerts, most notably the S.T.A.G.E. benefits for APLA, the Merrily We Roll Along Reunion Concert in 2002 and the Stephen Sondheim birthday celebration, Children And Art, at the New Amsterdam Theater. In 2006 Harold Prince secured her for the workshop and several backers auditions for the new musical Lovemusik, to play Lotte Lenya opposite Michael Cerveris as Kurt Weill. When the show opened on Broadway, the role went to Donna Murphy and a small role was added for Ann who understudied and performed as Lotte Lenya on May 13, 2007.

It was an act of civil disobedience, since abortion was illegal in France, and by admitting publicly to having aborted, they exposed themselves to criminal prosecution. The manifesto was published in the social democratic French weekly magazine Le Nouvel Observateur on April 5, 1971. The manifesto called for the legalization of abortion and free access to contraception. It paved the way to the adoption, in December 1974-January 1975, of the \\"Veil law\\", named for Health Minister Simone Veil, that repealed the penalty for voluntarily terminating a pregnancy during the first ten weeks (later extended to twelve weeks). The text The text of the manifesto was written by Simone de Beauvoir. It began (as translated into English): > One million women in France have abortions every year. Condemned to secrecy, > they do so in dangerous conditions, while under medical supervision, this is > one of the simplest procedures. Society is silencing these millions of > women. I declare that I am one of them. I declare that I have had an > abortion. Just as we demand free access to contraception, we demand the > freedom to have an abortion. Impact It was the inspiration for a February 3, 1973, manifesto by 331 doctors declaring their support for abortion rights: > We want freedom of abortion. It is entirely the woman's decision. We reject > any entity that forces her to defend herself, perpetuates an atmosphere of > guilt, and allows underground abortions to persist ....Michelle Zancarini- > Fournel, « Histoire(s) du MLAC (1973-1975) », Clio, numéro 18-2003, Mixité > et coéducation, [En ligne], mis en ligne le 04 décembre 2006. URL : > http://clio.revues.org/index624.html. Consulté le 19 décembre 2008. The week after the manifesto appeared, the front page of the satirical weekly Charlie Hebdo carried a drawing attacking male politicians with the question \\"Qui a engrossé les 343 salopes du manifeste sur l'avortement?\\".Image of cover from Charlie Hebdo (\\"Who got the 343 sluts [bitches] from the abortion manifesto pregnant?\\"). This drawing by Cabu gave the manifesto its familiar nickname, often mistaken as the original title. For Maud Gelly,Maud Gelly, \\"Le MLAC et la lutte pour le droit à l'avortement\\"(http://www.fondation- copernic.org/spip?article75) doctor and author, \\"A caricature meant at ridiculing politicians left a macho insult to qualify these women, and that tells a lot about the anti-feminism sometimes dominating the rewriting of the history of women's struggles.\\" In 1971, the feminist group Choisir (\\"To Choose\\") was founded by Gisèle Halimi, to protect the women who had signed the Manifesto. In 1972 Choisir formed itself into a clearly reformist body, and the campaign greatly influenced the passing of the law allowing contraception and abortion carried through by Simone Veil in 1974.

In December 2008, he was extradited to Russia despite protests by human rights organizations including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch. It was feared that Gasaev might be at risk of torture and ill-treatment, as well as the denial of a fair trial due to the potential use of evidence extracted under torture in Russia. The Russia's extradition request appeared to have been based on statements by a prisoner in Russian custody who accused Gasaev of being a participant in the events of June 2004 (the 2004 Nazran raid on government buildings in Ingushetia) while under interrogation by the Federal Security Service (FSB).

The explosion took place 9.30 on a Tuesday morning, shortly before Simchat Torah religious services were to begin. Three people were killed and 106 wounded. Bombing The bomb had been concealed in a delivery truck parked overnight with one wheel removed, as if it had broken down. The explosion blew in the doors and stained-glass windows of the synagogue and smashed storefronts and windows for blocks around. After the blast, only the vehicle's axles, glass and other debris remained. Police sources said the registration number on the van's chassis revealed it was bought from a Brussels second-hand car dealer. It carried a transit license plate of the kind issued to foreigners residing for a short while in Belgium. The licence was taken out by a young dark-haired man who gave his name as Nicola Brazzi and an address which later proved to be that of Brussels hotel. The investigation showed that Brazzi, believed to be Lebanese, had never registered at the hotel. The same name was found on a register of another hotel where he had entered his nationality as Cypriot. Responsibility The Palestinian terrorist group Black September claimed responsibility for the attack, the group which previously staged a number of terrorist attacks, including the 1972 Munich Olympics massacre in which 11 Israeli athletes and a West German policeman were killed, and in which five of the eight guerrillas were killed. A local television station also claimed that the Belgian cell of Action Directe also claimed responsibility for the attack, but the Antwerp police said that the group had not been heard of before in Belgium. Within a week Belgian police in Ghent arrested three German neo-Nazis for the attack.Bruce Hoffman, Right Wing Terrorism in Europe since 1980, page 9. In November 2008, a 55-year-old man of Palestinian origin and with Lebanese and Canadian passports was arrested in Ottawa, Canada, on a provisional extradition warrant for the 1980 Paris synagogue bombing and as a suspect for the Antwerp bomb attack. Other attacks The attack was one year after the 1980 Paris synagogue bombing, which also took place on the eve of Simchat Torah. The Belgian prime minister of the time, Mark Eyskens condemned the attack as \\"diabolically wicked\\", saying it was \\"clearly another attack against the Jewish community.\\" It was the second anti-Jewish incident in Antwerp in three months. There was also an attack on Jews in Antwerp in July 1980. A Palestinian threw a hand grenade at a party of Jewish schoolchildren leaving for a vacation, killing one and wounding 20 others. The attacker was arrested and convicted. In May 2014 there was an attack on the Jewish Museum of Belgium in which four people were killed.

Reception The Allmusic review by Scott Yanow states: \\"As strong as pianist Cedar Walton plays on his session, the main honors are taken by two of his sidemen. Tenor-saxophonist Hank Mobley, whose career was about to go into a complete eclipse, is in brilliant form, showing how much he had grown since his earlier days. Baritonist Charles Davis, who too often through the years has been used as merely a section player, keeps up with Mobley and engages in a particularly memorable tradeoff on the lengthy title cut. Mobley is well- showcased on 'Summertime,' Davis switches successfully to soprano on 'Early Morning Stroll,' and Walton (with the trio) somehow turns the 'Theme From Love Story' into jazz.

The attack killed four and wounded 46 people. The bombing took place in the evening near the beginning of Shabbat, during the Jewish holiday of Sim'hat Torah. It was the first deadly attack against Jewish people in France since the end of the Second World War. The Federation of National and European Action (FANE) claimed responsibility,https://www.lemonde.fr/archives/article/1981/10/22/des- precedents-nombreux_2709388_1819218.html but the police investigation later concluded that Palestinian nationalists were likely responsible. Proceedings The bombing, on 3 October 1980 at 18:38, directed against a synagogue of the Union Libérale Israélite de France, Copernic street in Paris, that was filled for Sabbath services. Saddlebags packed with 10 kilograms of explosives were left on a motorcycle parked in front of the synagogue. The glass roof of the synagogue fell down on the worshipers, and one of the doors was blown through. Some cars on the street were projected into the road, the fronts windows of shops were blown through up to 150 metres. Philippe Bouissou (22 years old) who passed by on his motorbike was killed immediately. Aliza Shagrir (42 years old), an Israeli TV presentator on holiday, was also killed while she was walking on the pavement, as was Jean Michel Barbé who used to frequently visit the synagogue. Hilario Lopes-Fernandez, the Portuguese housekeeper of the Victor Hugo hotel, located almost in front of the temple, was seriously wounded and died two days later. The commemorative plaque fixed onto the synagogue notes: \\"In memory of Jean Michel Barbé, Philippe Bouissou, Hilario Lopez Fernandez, Aliza Shagrir killed during the odious attack committed against this synagogue on 3 October 1980.\\" The explosive, consisting of about 10 kg of pentrite, in the bags of a blue Suzuki TS 125 motorbike parked about 10 metres from the synagogue, could have caused more victims if it had happened a few minutes later, when the worshippers left: as it was the day before shabbat, the synagogue was full with 300 people coming to celebrate the Bar Mitzvah of three boys and Bat Mitzvah of two girls.  Reactions  Commemorative plaque onto the synagogue The day after, a march of several thousands of people started in front of the synagogue, and went to the Champs Elysées, while other protests took place in other cities in provinces On 7 October 1980 a demonstration of 200,000 people marched from Nation to République. Several Members of Parliament joined the movement. = Statement by Raymond Barre = The Prime Minister, Raymond Barre, on 3 October said on TF1: \\"This odious bombing wanted to strike Jews who were going to the synagogue and it hit innocent French people who crossed the Copernic street\\", a Freudian slip that his words of the 8 October in the National Assembly, assuring his \\"Jewish compatriots\\" of the \\"sympathy of the all nation\\", will not be erased of memories. Just before his death in August 2007, Raymond Barre attributed this campaign of protestations to \\"Jewish lobby\\". Suspects Police were originally looking for two Cypriot suspects, Alexander Panadryu and Joseph Mathias, but the investigation did not progress at the time. Thirty-four years later, Hassan Diab, a Canadian of Lebanese origin, was extradited to France in November 2014. Since then three French anti-terrorism judges have uncovered testimony from several individuals stating that Diab was in Lebanon at the time of the bombing as well as University records which show he wrote and passed exams in Beirut then and couldn't have been in Paris. They ordered his conditional release under electronic surveillance eight times, only to have their orders challenged by the prosecutor and overturned by an appeal court. He was released without charge on January 12, 2018 and returned to Canada on January 15, 2018.

Encyclopedia of the Stateless Nations. Greenwood Publishing Group. . whose members adhere to the Syriac Maronite Church with the largest population around Mount Lebanon in Lebanon. The Maronite Church is an Eastern Catholic sui iuris particular church which is in full communion with the Pope and the Catholic Church, with the right of self-governance under the Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches, one of more than a dozen individual churches which are in full communion with the Holy See. The Maronites derive their name from the Syriac Christian saint Maron, some of whose followers migrated to the area of Mount Lebanon from their previous place of residence which was located around the area of Antioch, and established the nucleus of the Syriac Maronite Church. Saint Maron sent Saint Abraham, often referred to as the Apostle of Lebanon, to convert the non- Christian native population of Lebanon to Maronite Christianity. The name of the Adonis River was changed to Abraham's river by the inhabitants after Saint Abraham preached there. Maronites were able to maintain an independent status in Mount Lebanon and its coastline after the Muslim conquest of the Levant, keeping their Christian religion, and even the distinctive Western Aramaic language as late as the 19th century. Some Maronites argue that they are of Mardaite ancestry, though some historians reject this claim. Mass emigration to the Americas at the outset of the 20th century, famine during World War I that killed an estimated one third to one half of the population, the 1860 Mount Lebanon civil war and the Lebanese Civil War between 1975-90 greatly decreased their numbers in the Levant; however Maronites today form more than one quarter of the total population of modern-day Lebanon. Though concentrated in Lebanon, Maronites also show presence in the neighboring Levant, as well as a significant part in the Lebanese diaspora in the Americas, Europe, Australia, and Africa. The Syriac Maronite Church, under the Patriarch of Antioch, has branches in nearly all countries where Maronite Christian communities live, in both the Levant and the Lebanese diaspora. All Lebanese presidents have been Maronites as part of a tradition that persists as part of the National Pact, by which the Prime Minister has historically been a Sunni Muslim and the Speaker of the National Assembly has historically been a Shi'i Muslim.  Etymology  Maronites get their name from Maron, a 3rd-century Syriac Christian Saint, often mistaken with John Maron, the first Maronite Patriarch (ruled 685-707). History Maronite villagers building a church in the region of Mount Lebanon, 1920s. Our Lady of Lebanon Cathedral Brooklyn in New York City. An estimate of the distribution of Lebanon's main religious groups, 1991, based on a map by GlobalSecurity.org Lebanon religious groups distribution. The cultural and linguistic heritage of the Lebanese people is a blend of both indigenous Phoenician elements and the foreign cultures such as Arabs that have come to rule the land and its people over the course of thousands of years. In a 2013 interview, Pierre Zalloua, a Lebanese biologist who took part in the National Geographic Society's Genographic Project, pointed out that genetic variation preceded religious variation and divisions: \\"Lebanon already had well-differentiated communities with their own genetic peculiarities, but not significant differences, and religions came as layers of paint on top. There is no distinct pattern that shows that one community carries significantly more Phoenician than another.\\" Although Christianity existed in Roman Phoenice since the time of the Apostles, Christians were a minority among the majority pagans by the time Emperor Theodosius I issued The Edict of Thessalonica in 380 AD. The coastal cities of Tyre and Sidon remained prosperous during Roman rule, but Phoenicia had ceased to be the maritime empire it once was centuries ago and the north of Berytus (Beirut) and the mountains of Lebanon concentrated a big part of the intellectual and religious activities. Very few Roman temples in Phoenicia were built in the coastal cities, hence the reason for the reign of paganism in the interior of the land. The Maronite movement reached Lebanon when in 402 AD Saint Maron's first disciple, Abraham of Cyrrhus, who was called the Apostle of Lebanon, realized that there were many non-Christians in Lebanon and so he set out to convert the Phoenician inhabitants of the coastal lines and mountains of Lebanon, introducing them to the way of Saint Maron. The Phoenician pagans became Maronite Christians. In 451 AD, the Maronites followed the Council of Chalcedon, rejecting monophysitisim and entering full communion with the Roman Catholic Church. In 517 AD, a conflict between the Maronites and the Monophysite Jacobite Christian Orthodox Syriacs caused the massacre of 350 Maronite monks. Escaping persecution following the Muslim conquest of the Levant in 637 AD, the Maronites living in the low lands and coastal cities confined themselves to the Mount Lebanon and to the cities of the Phoenician coast which did not interest the Arabs extending from Sidon in the South and up to Batroun and the south of Tripoli in the north. The Arab conquerors settled in various cities of the Phoenician coast to reduce Byzantine interference even though they were not interested in maritime trade. The mountains offered no attraction to them so the Maronites continued to find refuge from colonial empires in the Mountains of Lebanon, especially Qadisha Valley. The Maronites raided the newly Arab towns after the conquest of 637 AD and were later joined by the Mardaites in repelling the Arab army. The Mardaites were mountaineers from the Taurus that Emperor Constantine IV recruited to infiltrate Lebanon and join the Maronites to carry attacks against the Arab invaders. The resistance movement became known as Marada, meaning rebels. The Maronites managed then to become \\"civilly semiautonomous\\" where they settled and kept speaking Western Aramaic in daily life and Syriac language for their liturgy. The Christians that chose to remain in the newly Arab-controlled areas and inhabited by the Arab invaders gradually became a minority and many of those converted to Islam in order to escape taxation and to further their own political and professional advancement. In 685 AD, the Maronites appointed a Patriarch for themselves, St. John Maron, who became the first Patriarch on the Maronite Church. The appointing of a Patriarch made the Byzantine Emperor furious, which led to the persecution of the Maronites by the Byzantines. In 694 AD, Emperor Justinian II sent an army to attack the Maronites, destroying their monastery in the Orontes valley and killing 500 monks. The Maronites followed up by leading their army against the Byzantine at Amioun and defeated the Byzantine army in a crushing victory that cost Constantinople two of its best generals. Following the Byzantine persecutions in the Orontes valley, many Aramean Maronite monks left their lands in the Orontes River valley and joined the Phoenicians Maronites in the mountains of Lebanon. The Maronite Church began to grow then in the valleys of Lebanon. For the next 300 years, the Maronites raided and retreated keeping their faith and communion with the Roman Catholic Church. In 936, the monastery of Beth Moroon and other Maronite monasteries were completely destroyed by the Arabs who attacked the Maronites due to their Christianity. The Maronites welcomed the conquering Christians of the First Crusade in 1096 AD. Around the late 12th century, according to William of Tyre, the Maronites numbered 40,000 people. During the papacy of Pope Gregory XIII (1572-1585), steps were taken to bring the Maronites still closer to Rome. By the 17th century, the Maronites had developed a strong natural liking for Europe – particularly France. The Maronites have also had a presence in Cyprus since the early 9th century and many Maronites went there following the Sultan Saladin's successful Siege of Jerusalem. In the 19th century, thousands of Maronites were massacred by the Lebanese Druze during the 1860 Mount Lebanon civil war. According to some estimates some 11.000 Maronites and other Christians were killed and 4.000 died from hunger and diseases as a result of the war. After the 1860 massacres, many Maronites fled to Egypt. Antonios Bachaalany, a Maronite from Salima (Baabda district) was the first emigrant to the New World, where he reached the United States in 1854 and died there two years later. PopulationLebanon= An estimate of the area distribution of Lebanon's main religious groups. According to the Maronite church, there are approximately 1,062,000 Maronites in Lebanon, where they constitute up to 24% of the population.Lebanon - International Religious Freedom Report 2008 U.S. Department of State.

In 2017, the Annuario Pontificio reported that 3,300 people belonged to the Archeparchy of Aleppo, 15,000 in the Archeparchy of Damascus and 45,000 in the Eparchy of Lattaquié).The Maronite Catholic Church (Patriarchate) in \\"The Eastern Catholic Churches 2017\\" in Annuario Pontificio 2017. In 2015, the BBC placed the number of Maronites in Syria at between 28,000 and 60,000. =Cyprus= Maronites first migrated to Cyprus in the 8th century, and there are approximately 5,800 Maronites on the island today, the vast majority in the Republic of Cyprus.Educational Policies that Address Social Inequality: Country Report: Cyprus , page 4. The community historically spoke Cypriot Maronite Arabic,Cyprus Ministry of Interior: European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages: Answers to the Comments/Questions Submitted to the Government of Cyprus Regarding its Initial Periodical Report Retrieved 2018-11-18. but today Cypriot Maronites speak the Greek language, with the Cypriot government designating Cypriot Maronite Arabic as a dialect. =Israel= A Maronite community of about 11,000 people lives in Israel. The 2017 Annuario Pontificio reported that 10,000 people belonged to the Maronite Catholic Archeparchy of Haifa and the Holy Land and 504 people belonged to the Exarchate of Jerusalem and Palestine. =Diaspora= According to the Encyclopedia of the Peoples of Africa and the Middle East, \\"accurate figures are not available, but it is probable that the Maronite diaspora of over 2 million individuals is about two times larger\\" than the Maronite population living in their historic homelands in Lebanon, Syria, and Israel.\\"Maronites\\" in Encyclopedia of the Peoples of Africa and the Middle East (Infobase, 2009), p. 446. According to the Annuario Pontificio, in 2017 the Eparchy of San Charbel in Buenos Aires, Argentina, has 750,000 members; the Eparchy of Our Lady of Lebanon of São Paulo, Brazil, had 501,000 members; the Eparchy of Saint Maron of Sydney, Australia, had 152,300 members; the Eparchy of Saint Maron of Montreal, Canada, had 89,775 members; the Eparchy of Our Lady of the Martyrs of Lebanon in Mexico had 159,403 members; the Eparchy of Our Lady of Lebanon of Los Angeles in the United States had 46,000 members; and the Eparchy of Saint Maron of Brooklyn in the United States had 33,000 members. According to the Annuario Pontificio, 50,944 people belonged to the Maronite Catholic Eparchy of Our Lady of Lebanon of Paris in 2017. In Europe, some Belgian Maronites are involved in the trade of diamonds in the diamond district of Antwerp. According to the Annuario Pontificio, 66,495 belonged to the Apostolic Exarchate of West and Central Africa (Nigeria) in 2017. Role in politicsLebanon= With only two exceptions, all Lebanese presidents have been Maronites as part of a tradition that persists as part of the National Pact, by which the Prime Minister has historically been a Sunni Muslim and the Speaker of the National Assembly has historically been a Shi'i Muslim. =Israel= People born into Christian families or clans who have either Aramaic or Maronite cultural heritage are considered an ethnicity separate from Israeli Arabs and since 2014 can register themselves as Arameans. The Christians who have applied so far for recognition as Aramean are mostly Galilean Maronites, who trace their culture, ancestry and language to an Aramean-speaking, pre-Arab population of the Levant. In addition, some 500 Christian adherents of the Syriac Catholic Church in Israel are expected to apply for the recreated ethnic status, as well as several hundred Aramaic- speaking adherents of the Syriac Orthodox Church. Though supported by Gabriel Naddaf, the move was condemned by the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate, which described it as \\"an attempt to divide the Palestinian minority in Israel\\". This recognition comes after about seven years of activity by the Aramean Christian Foundation in Israel, led by IDF Major Shadi Khalloul Risho and the Israeli Christian Recruitment Forum, headed by Father Gabriel Naddaf of the Greek-Orthodox Church and Major Ihab Shlayan. Shadi Khalloul Risho is also a member of the Israeli right-wing Yisrael Beiteinu party, and was placed 15th in the 2015 parliamentary elections in the party's member list; the party however received only 5 seats. Identity The followers of the Maronite Church form a part of the Syriac Christians and belong to the West Syriac Rite. The Maronite Syriac Church of Antioch traces its foundation to Maron, an early 3rd-century Syriac monk venerated as a saint. Before the conquest by Arabian Muslims reached Lebanon, the Lebanese people, including those who would become Muslim and the majority who would remain Christian, spoke a dialect of Aramaic called Syriac.The Precarious Republic: Political Modernization in Lebanon. By Michael C. Hudson, 1968.For ever! Lebanon: Its Stand in History Among the Near East Countries By Salim Wakim, 1996. Syriac remains the liturgical language of the Maronite Church. =Phoenicianism= Phoenicianism is an identity on the part of Lebanese Christians that has developed into an integrated ideology led by key thinkers, but there are a few who have stood out more than others: Charles Corm, Michel Chiha, and Said Aql in their promotion of Phoenicianism. In post civil-war Lebanon since the Taif agreement, politically Phoenicianism is restricted to a small group. Among leaders of the movement, Etienne Saqr, Said Akl, Charles Malik, Camille Chamoun, and Bachir Gemayel have been notable names, some going as far as voicing anti-Arab views. In his book the Israeli writer Mordechai Nisan, who at times met with some of them during the war, quoted Said Akl, a famous Lebanese poet and philosopher, as saying; \\"I would cut off my right hand, and not associate myself to an Arab.\\" Akl believes in emphasizing the Phoenician legacy of the Lebanese people and has promoted the use of the Lebanese dialect written in a modified Latin alphabet, rather than the Arabic one, although both alphabets have descended from the Phoenician alphabet. In opposition to such views, Arabism was affirmed at the March 1936 Congress of the Coast and Four Districts, when the Muslim leadership at the conference made the declaration that Lebanon was an Arab country, indistinguishable from its Arab neighbors. In the April 1936 Beirut municipal elections, Christian and Muslim politicians were divided along Phoenician and Arab lines in the matter of whether the Lebanese coast should be claimed by Syria or given to Lebanon, increasing the already mounting tensions between the two communities. Phoenicianism is still disputed by many Arabist scholars who have on occasion tried to convince its adherents to abandon their claims as false, and to embrace and accept the Arab identity instead. This conflict of ideas of identity is believed to be one of the pivotal disputes between the Muslim and Christian populations of Lebanon and what mainly divides the country to the detriment of national unity. In general it appears that Muslims focus more on the Arab identity of the Lebanese history and culture whereas the older, long- standing Christian communities, especially the Maronites, focus on their history, and struggles as an ethnoreligious group in an Arab world, while also reaffirming the Lebanese identity, and refraining from Arab characterization as it would deny them their striving achievement of having fended off the Arabs and Turks physically, culturally, and spiritually since their conception. The Maronite perseverance led to their existence even to today. =Support of Lebanese identity= Lebanese flag Lebanese Maronites are known to be specifically linked to the root of Lebanese Nationalism and opposition to Pan-Arabism in Lebanon, this being the case during 1958 Lebanon crisis. When Muslim Arab nationalists backed by Gamel Abdel Nasser tried to overthrow the then Maronite dominated government in power, due to displeasure at the government's pro-western policies and their lack of commitment and duty to the so-called \\"Arab brotherhood\\" by preferring to keep Lebanon away from the Arab League and the political confrontations of the Middle East. A more hard-nosed nationalism among some Maronites leaders, who saw Lebanese nationalism more in terms of its confessional roots and failed to be carried away by Chiha's vision, clung to a more security-minded view of Lebanon. They regarded the national project as mainly a program for the security of Maronites and a bulwark against threats from Muslims and their hinterland. The right-wing yet secular Guardians of the Cedars, with its exiled Leader and founder Etienne Saqr (also the father of singers Karol Sakr and Pascale Sakr) took no sectarian stance and even had Muslim members who joined in their radical stance against Arabism and Palestinian forces in Lebanon. Saqr summarized his party's view on Arab Identity in their official ideological manifesto by stating; On an Al Jazeera special dedicated to the political Christian clans of Lebanon and their struggle for power in the 2009 election entitled, \\"Lebanon: The Family Business\\", the issue of identity was brought up on several occasions, by various politicians including Druze leader Walid Jumblatt, who claimed that all Lebanese lack somewhat of a real identity and the country is yet to discover one everybody could agree on. Sami Gemayel, of the Gemayel clan and son of former president Amin Gemayel, stated he did not consider himself an Arab but instead identified himself as a Syriac Christian, going on to explain that to him and many Lebanese the \\"acceptance\\" of Lebanon's \\"Arab identity\\" according to the Taef Agreement wasn't something that they \\"accepted\\" but instead were forced into signing through pressure. In a speech in 2009 to a crowd of Christian Kataeb supporters Gemayel declared that he felt there was importance in Christians in Lebanon finding an identity and went on to state what he finds identification with as a Lebanese Christian, concluding with a purposeful exclusion of Arabism in the segment. The speech met with applause afterward from the audience; Etienne Sakr, of the Guardians of the Cedars Lebanese party, in an interview responded \\"We are not Arabs\\" to an interview question about the Guardians of the Cedars' ideology of Lebanon being Lebanese. He continued by talking about how describing Lebanon as being not Arab was a crime in present-day Lebanon, about the Lebanese Civil War, and about Arabism as being a first step towards Islamism, claiming that \\"the Arabs want to annex Lebanon\\" and in order to do this \\"to push the Christians out (of Lebanon)\\", this being \\"the plan since 1975\\", among other issues. =Embrace of Arab identity= During a final session of the Lebanese Parliament, a Marada Maronite MP stated his identity as an Arab: \\"I, the Maronite Christian Lebanese Arab, grandson of Patriarch Estefan Doueihy, declare my pride to be a part of our people’s resistance in the South. Can one renounce what guarantees his rights?\\" Maronite Deacon Soubhi Makhoul, administrator for the Maronite Exarchate in Jerusalem, has said \\"The Maronites are Arabs, we are part of the Arab world. And although it’s important to revive our language and maintain our heritage, the church is very outspoken against the campaign of these people.” =Religion= Maronite division among main Syriac Christian groups. The Maronites belong to the Maronite Syriac Church of Antioch (a former ancient Greek city now in Hatay Province, Turkey) and are an Eastern Catholic Syriac Church, using the Antiochian Rite, that had affirmed its communion with Rome since 1180 A.D., although the official view of the Church is that it had never accepted either the Monophysitic views held by their Syriac neighbours, which were condemned in the Council of Chalcedon, or the failed compromise doctrine of Monothelitism (the latter claim being found in contemporary sources, with evidence that they were Monothelites for several centuries, beginning in the early 7th century). The Maronite Patriarch is traditionally seated in Bkerke north of Beirut. =Names= Modern Maronites often adopt French or other Western European given names (with biblical origins) for their children, including Michel, Marc, Marie, Georges, Carole, Charles, Antoine, Joseph, Pierre, Christian, Christelle and Rodrigue. Other common names are strictly Christian and are Aramaic, or Arabic, forms of biblical, Hebrew, or Greek Christian names, such as Antun (Anthony or Antonios), Butros (Peter), Boulos (Paul), Semaan or Shamaoun (Simon or Simeon), Jergyes (George), Elie (Ilyas or Elias), Iskander (Alexander), Hannah, Katrina (Catherine) and Beshara (literally Good News in reference to the Gospel). Other common names are Sarkis (Sergius) and Bakhos (Bacchus), while others are common both among Christians and Muslims, such as Youssef (Joseph), Ibrahim (Abraham), and Maryam (Mary). Some Maronite Christians are named in honour of Maronite saints, including the Aramaic names Maro(u)n (after their patron saint Maron), Nimtullah, Charbel or Sharbel after Saint Charbel Makhluf and Rafqa (Rebecca). Persecution and struggle Maronites were persecuted during the Byzantine empire, followed by the Arab conquests of the Middle East (Mount Lebanon) and finally by the Ottoman Empire. The Great Famine of Mount Lebanon, which occurred between 1915 and 1918, was caused by multiple factors. One being the Ottoman policy of acquiring all food products produced in the region for the Ottoman army and administration, and the barring of any produce from being sent to the Maronite Christian population of Mount Lebanon, effectively condemning them to starvation.BBC staff (26 November 2014).

The National. Retrieved 2018-11-18. The death toll among Maronite Christians and people of Mount Lebanon, mainly due to starvation and disease, is estimated to have been 200,000.Harris 2012, p.174. Maronite Christians felt a sense of alienation and exclusion as a result of Pan-Arabism in Lebanon. Part of its historic suffering is the Damour massacre by the PLO. Until recently, the Cyprus Maronites battled to preserve their ancestral language. The Maronite monks maintain that Lebanon is synonymous with Maronite history and ethos; that its Maronitism antedates the Arab conquest of Lebanon and that Arabism is only a historical accident. The Maronites experienced mass persecution under the Ottoman Turks, who massacred and mistreated Maronites for their faith, disallowing them from owning horses and forcing them to wear only black clothing. The Ottoman Empire's WW1 policies, in combination with Allied Forces Naval blockade, resulted in the death of hundreds of thousands of maronites of Mount Lebanon, with total fatalities estimated between 100-300 thousand people that died from malnutrition, disease and starvation. The Lebanese Druze also persecuted the Maronites, and massacred in excess of 20,000 of them in the mid-1800s. However, agreements have been held with the Druze. Moreover, the Maronites later emerged as the most dominant group in Lebanon, a status they held until the sectarian conflict that resulted in the Lebanese Civil War.

HistoryManor= The Pilkington family can be traced from about 1200. The senior line acquired the manor of Bury when Roger Pilkington who died in about 1347, married Alice Bury. Roger Pilkington and his father, also Roger, were present with Thomas, 2nd Earl of Lancaster, at the Battle of Boroughbridge in 1322. The older Roger was imprisoned and fined, his son secured pardon by undertaking military service abroad. His son Sir Roger Pilkington (1325–1407) served under Henry of Grosmont, 1st Duke of Lancaster in 1355, and under John of Gaunt in 1359–60 and 1369. The Pilkingtons built a house with a moat between 1359 and 1400 and were granted a licence to crenellate the manor house at Bury in 1469 when it became known as Bury Castle. Roger's son Sir John Pilkington (d. 1421) was granted custody of the manors of Prestwich and Alkrington. He married Margaret (d. 1436), heir of John Verdon of Brixworth, Northamptonshire, soon after the death of her first husband, Hugh Bradshaw of Leigh. Margaret's son from her first marriage, William Bradshaw, died in 1415, leaving a daughter, Elizabeth. In 1430 Margaret settled the manors of her inheritance which included Stagenhoe in Hertfordshire, Clipston, Northamptonshire and Brixworth in Northamptonshire, and Bressingham in Norfolk, on her Pilkington sons, John, Edmund (d. about 1451), and Robert (d. 1457). Four years after the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1489, Sir Thomas Pilkington of Pilkington lost his estates by Royal Attainder to the Stanleys, who received the title 'Earl of Derby'. Sir Thomas Pilkington was granted Royal pardon in 1508 Governance Following the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834, Pilkington formed part of the Bury Poor Law Union. In 1866, a Local board of health was established for the Whitefield area of Pilkington, which had begun to urbanise and expand into a town in its own right. In 1885 part of Pilkington was merged into the Municipal Borough of Bury. Following the Local Government Act 1894, the township of Pilkington was dissolved and its area divided between the then County Borough of Bury, Radcliffe Urban District, Whitefield Urban District, Outwood township and Unsworth township. Geography It was bounded on two sides, the southwest and north, by the River Irwell, and encompassed the settlements of Blackford Bridge, Cinder Hill, Hollins, Besses o' th' Barn, Outwood, Ringley, Stand, Unsworth, and Whitefield. The township was abolished in 1894.

He was dressed in same uniform and carried his old rifle and dusty knapsack that he carried in review of 1865, Washington, D.C. The 1st Massachusetts Volunteer Heavy Artillery Regiment was a unit that served in the Union Army during the American Civil War. It was originally raised as the 14th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry Regiment. History14th Mass Infantry= The 14th Massachusetts Infantry began its recruitment in spring 1861, with most of its members coming from Essex County. They were mustered in on 5 July 1861, and left the state on 7 August for Washington, DC, where it would serve in its defenses until the end of the year. Colonel William B Greene, a West Point graduate and a veteran of the Florida Indian Wars, resigned in October, and was replaced as leader of the unit by Col Thomas R Tannatt, who transferred over from the 16th Regiment Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry. =Reorganization as artillery= On 1 January 1862, the regiment was reorganized and became a heavy artillery regiment. As artillery units required more men, fifty additional soldiers were added to each company and two additional ones were formed. They served in several military garrisons around Washington, including forts Woodbury, Tillinghast, Craig, Albany, and DeKalb. =Early skirmishes= On 26 August 1862, the regiment was sent to the front, and was present at the Second Battle of Bull Run, though it did not participate. During the Union retreat from the battlefield, Confederate cavalry overtook the 1st Massachusetts, capturing the surgical staff, the wagoners, and others. The doctors were quickly released, while the others were later paroled.Mass. in the War, pg 723 A battalion of two companies were detached (two more joined a month or two later) on 27 September 1862 and sent to Maryland Heights, where they were to serve until December 1863. When the Union army abandoned its position at Winchester, VA in June 1863, Company I stayed behind to destroy the guns and ammunition, and 44 men were captured on 10 June. At this time, Company H was covering the army's retreat from Harpers Ferry.Higginson, pg 170 =First engagement= On 17 May 1864, many heavy artillery regiments filled in as infantry units and joined the Army of the Potomac as part of Grant's 1864 campaign. In their first real engagement as a regiment, they engaged Ewell's Division at Harris Farm Engagement, on the Fredericksburg Road near Spotsylvania, VA on 19 May 1864. In this battle, they lost 55 killed, 312 wounded, and 27 missing.Mass in the War, pg 726 In reserve during the Battle of North Anna on 23–26 May 1864, losing only 1 killed, they moved on to Cold Harbor, losing two members during the trench warfare there from 4–12 June. =Siege of Petersburg= The regiment took part in the assault on Petersburg on the 16 June 1864, and lost 25 killed and 132 wounded. They remained as part of the siege of the city until April 1865. During this time, they were also involved in the Battle of Globe Tavern (or the 2nd Battle of Weldon Railroad), when 185 men were captured when a Confederate offensive flanked the division, and the Battle of Hatcher's Run. =Lee's surrender= Following Lee's surrender in April 1865, the 1st Massachusetts Heavy Artillery returned to Washington, DC and stationed the forts until they were mustered out in August. They returned to Boston on the 20th, and were encamped at Gallop's Island until the 25th, when they were paid and discharged.

Documented life He was presumably born in the old Ottonian city of Nijmegen, then in the Duchy of Guelders, which was incorporated in the modern Netherlands in 1543 after the definitive victory of the Dukes of Burgundy in a serie of conflicts knows as the Guelders Wars. He probably trained there in the workshop of his father, the artist Willem Maelwael (his uncle was also an artist), and is recorded as an artist in 1382.For more details on this typically concentrated family of artists, see d Guest, pp. 260–61. He was the uncle of the famous manuscript illuminators, the three Limbourg brothers, whom he introduced to Philip's service around 1400. Malouel also worked as an illuminator, but seems mostly to have produced larger works.Janson Malouel is recorded as working in Paris painting armorial decorations on cloth (probably for banners) for Isabelle of Bavaria, Queen of France, in 1396–97, but by August 1397 he was in Dijon, the capital of the Duchy of Burgundy, where he succeeded Jean de Beaumetz (d. 1396) to the position of court painter to Philip, with the rank of valet de chambre. He retained these positions until his death, with a salary higher than that of Beaumetz or the sculptor Claus Sluter, and lived in Dijon.concise Grove In 1405, soon after the death of Philip, he returned to Nijmegen to marry Heilwig van Redinchaven, bringing her back to Dijon. Another visit of over two months was recorded in 1413. In 1415 he died in Dijon, leaving Heilwig and four children. She received a pension from the Duke, and returned to Nijmegen, where she became involved in lengthy litigation over Malouel's estate there.Noviomagus family history Attributed works Among a number of other commissions, many for decorative painting in the palaces, Malouel is recorded as receiving in 1398 the wood for five altarpiece panels for the Chartreuse of Champmol, Philip's new dynastic burial place near Dijon, as well as painting the Well of Moses there, sculpted by Claus Sluter, the base of which survives with some of its colouring.Snyder, 70 From 1401, Herman of Cologne, perhaps a specialist gilder, is recorded as Malouel's assistant, or perhaps foreman of a number of apprentices. Painting the \\"Well\\", and gilding all the upper parts, was a large job, on which they were occupied between 1401 and 1404. Malouel also painted Philip's tomb at Champmol, when the sculptors finally finished it after Sluter's death. Malouel's oeuvre on panel remains controversial; the most generally accepted painting of his to survive is the Pietà tondo in the Louvre, the first true tondo of the Renaissance, though this is not accepted by Châtelet.The tondo is the only work in the Louvre that they attribute to Malouel, on which point they are \\"sans doute\\" (see website link). For Châtelet (p. 16) \\"the one certain work\\" is the Louvre St Denis altarpiece; he suggests Henri Bellechose did all or most of the tondo as Malouel's workshop assistant. This has Philip's coat of arms painted on the back, so should predate his death in 1404, and the \\"unusual iconography of the piece clearly links it to [Champmol]\\",Snyder, 69 which was dedicated to the Holy Trinity, who all appear. The style of the work mixes Northern and Sienese elements, in a fashion characteristic of the International Gothic court art of the period.Snyder, 69 Although painted in the traditional tempera, the work uses transparent glazes in a way that was to be greatly developed in the work of Jan van Eyck after Malouel's death. Another of Phillip's Netherlandish artists, Melchior Broederlam, was already producing works partly in oil paint for Champmol. The large (162 x 211 cm) altarpiece, also in the Louvre, of the Martyrdom of St Denis with the Trinity (or The Last Communion and Martyrdom of Saint Denis), also from Champmol, may have been begun by Malouel but completed by Henri Bellechose (his only known work), after Malouel's death. The ducal accounts record the provision of pigments (but not gold) to Bellechose to complete (\\"parfaire\\" = \\"perfect\\") a \\"painting of the life of St Denis\\", known to have been a subject of Malouel's, and some see a difference in style among the figures, while others do not. Snyder and Châtelet support Malouel's participation, but this is disputed, the case against being set out in an article of 1961 by Nicole Reynaud (in French). For Châtelet the St Denis altarpiece and the large tondo in the Louvre are two of the five altarpieces commissioned in 1398.Snyder, 70 and Châtelet, 16–18 and 191 – against Malouel's involvement are concise Grove, and it is not mentioned on the Louvre website. Châtelet, 16–18 discusses the issues most fully. He feels the painting would have been painted from the top of the image downwards, so the upper portions are by Malouel. Bellechose, who is not documented before Malouel's death, succeeded him as valet and court painter; Châtelet suggests he may have been in his workshop for years, and suggests he was responsible for the large tondo over ten years earlier, thus reversing the traditional attributions for these two famous works.Châtelet, 20 Malouel is also believed to have been the originator of a portrait image of Philip of about 1400 which survives only in versions believed to be later. He is recorded as working on a portrait of John the Fearless for the King of Portugal in 1413,A rare & often cited record of a portrait commission from that date. Since the quantities of materials were small, portraits normally escape notice in the accounts and there were also portraits of Philip and John in the choir at Champmol (as we know from when Philip the Good ordered one of him to be added). A later version in the Musée Condé in Chantilly has been suggested as a copy of the Malouel image type of John.Joconde image A large Madonna and Child, unearthed in 1960 in Berlin and now on loan to the Gemäldegalerie, Berlin, has also been attributed to Malouel, as has another in the Louvre.Images of the two Madonnas It is believed the Berlin picture was one wing of a diptych opposite a portrait of John the Fearless, which would be the first known example of this format, later very common in Netherlandish painting.Snyder, 70 It was perhaps also for Champmol.The Berlin Madonna is described in detail in: Gelfand, pp. 41–47. The work was originally published, attributed and proposed as half a diptych in: Meiss, Millard, and Colin Eisler. \\"A New French Primitive.\\" The Burlington Magazine 102 (1960): 234 ff. (not seen). Gelfand (p.44) prefers the theory that a portrait of Philip the Bold sighted in Champmol in 1791 was the companion to the Berlin Madonna. Châtelet (p. 20) accepts it as by the same hand as the higher parts of the St Denis altarpiece, for him Malouel, and not by the artist of the large Louvre Pietà tondo. A number of other works are, or have been, attributed to Malouel or his workshop, including a smaller Pietà tondo in the Louvre,image from Insecula the \\"Antwerp-Baltimore polytych\\",Snyder, 72–73; Châtelet, 21–22 and 190-91; One of the Baltimore panels in the Walters Art Museum – the first photo is the Annunciation – the Baptism of Christ is shown in the enlarged view.

The district contains nine municipalities. It now host an important seaside resort. It also gives its name to one of the beaches in the region of Oran.  History  Centuries ago, Ain el Turk was a plain called El Eurfa which extends from St Roch till Les Andalouses. Over the centuries, the population of El Eurfa plain (known later as Ain el Turck) has significantly increased. Two types of people lived there and cohabited, nomadic people who practice transhumance, and sedentary or sedentarized tribes who practiced agriculture and beekeeping. The nomads wandered between the plains of El Eurfa, Boutlelis and Messreghinn, except in some special cases they did not go beyond the Sabkha in the South and the forest Madagh in the West. They lived together and traded with each other.

This allows the deck to be extremely low compared with other trailers. It offers the ability to carry legal loads up to tall, which other trailers cannot. Lowboys are used to haul heavy equipment such as bulldozers, industrial equipment etc.  History  The first lowboy trailer was invented in the 1920s; it featured a riveted gooseneck and solid rubber tires. The first detachable gooseneck trailer, referred to as an RGN (Removable goose neck), was invented in 1958.RGN trailers- Accessed 2012-04-06  Types  The lowboy trailer comes in several types, for a wide range of tasks. Some types are: * Fixed gooseneck (FGN): allows a longer deck length and has the lightest weight. These are lower trailers than normal, with low-profile tires, usually with drop ramps in the rear to facilitate loading of equipment, but are not actually considered \\"lowboys\\". The neck is arched in such a way, that it when lowered, it becomes a ramp thus allowing the front tires of equipment to be pulled onto the deck.Fixed goose neck trailer- Retrieved 2012-04-06 * Fixed-neck: the neck is fixed to trailers; offers the lightest weight, but sacrifices the ability to detach and load over the front * Hydraulic detachable gooseneck (hydraulic RGN or HRGN)): fastest and easiest to detach, at the expense of weight and deck length. It is the most common and versatile of lowboy trailers; the gooseneck is detached using large hydraulic cylinders to raise and lower the trailer and a small cylinder shores the neck to the truck, removing the neck so a large piece of equipment can be driven over the front onto the deck of the trailer for transport. The hydraulics can be run from the truck auxiliary or from a pony motor mounted in the neck of the trailer.\\\\- Hydraulic Detachable Gooseneck * Mechanically-detachable gooseneck (mechanical RGN or MRGN): while usually lighter than the hydraulic detachable gooseneck, users sacrifice ease and speed of detaching. Used for long specialty hauls.Mechanical removable gooseneck - Retrieved 2012-04-06 * Mechanical folding gooseneck (MFGN): The deck folds down to ground level to provide a ramp for from trailer loading.Mechanical folding gooseneck- Retrieved 2012-04-06  Features  Lowboy trailer features include: = Suspension types = * Spring ride: lowest cost; however, it has a rougher ride and adds more stress to the trailer * Air-ride: smoother ride, adding to the life of the trailer frame. Air rides can also be adjusted for a higher or lower deck height. * Hydraulic suspension: an oil-filled system, allowing wide variation of axle movement * Independent suspension: a double wishbone, hydraulic suspension, which offers more stability, greater steering angle and more travel = Structural types = * Main structural steel type: mill rolled beams save money; although being around heavier, they also reverse camber after a few years due to the much- lower strength of the main beams. * T1 or A514 beams save weight and allow more versatile engineering of the trailer; they are cut to the highest- strength shape possible and welded together.

HighBeam New technologies in farm equipment and grain handling, including GPS (global positioning systems) and the introduction of \\"Super- Elevators\\", dramatically changed the day to day experience of Canadian grain producers. In the face of great challenges to preserve their way of life, many Canadian agriculture producers picketed and protested any and all governmental sites where business related to agriculture was conducted at the Federal level including C.I.G.I headquarters in downtown Winnipeg, MB. In the early nineteen nineties, a rift was formed between the usually amicable American and Canadian agriculture sectors. The level of Canadian grain that was exported to the US suggested the possibility of an unfair trading advantage to the benefit of the Canadian farmers, a claim that later was shown be to unsubstantiated. By 2002, the face of Canadian agriculture had changed considerably from what had existed in the 1980s. Most Canadian agricultural producers were now diversifying away from the traditional crops of wheat, oats and barley to include a much higher percentage of oilseed and specialty crops. These changes called for an expansion of the services and technical areas of support at C.I.G.I. Specifically, in the area of technical services and support a new emphasis had been placed on understanding the consumer needs of the Asian market leading to many large scale tours in Western Canada offered and coordinated, under Tremere's direction, by \\"the Institute\\" for Asian agriculture representatives as well as the addition of the instant noodle manufacturing capacity at the C.I.G.I. site located in Winnipeg, MB.

Early life and education Richard Clarke Cabot was born May 21, 1868, in Brookline, Massachusetts, one of five sons of James Elliot Cabot and Elizabeth (Dwight) Cabot.\\"Cabot, Richard C. (Richard Clarke), 1868-1939. Papers of Richard Clarke Cabot : an inventory,\\" Harvard University archives. Accessed Jan. 5, 2016. James Cabot was a philosopher and Harvard University professor who also trained as a lawyer and biographer, and was a friend of Ralph Waldo Emerson. Professional career Cabot at work. Cabot studied philosophy at Harvard University before switching to medicine. Inspired by the beliefs of John Dewey, Cabot felt more drawn to action than contemplation, and he admired the work of Teddy Roosevelt and Jane Addams. After completing his studies in 1892, he turned down the role of the first bacteriologist at Massachusetts General Hospital to work in the hospital's much less prestigious outpatient department. At this time, outpatient wards dealt mostly with people who couldn't afford inpatient treatment, or for the treatment of incurable chronic conditions such as tuberculosis or diabetes. This involved working populations who lived in unhealthy, overcrowded accommodation, often recent migrants. He changed the way that the outpatient department was run, believing that economic, social, family and psychological conditions underpinned many of the conditions that patients presented with. He envisaged that social workers would work in a complementary relationship with doctors, the former concentrating on physiological health, and the latter on social health. In addition to this, he saw that social work could improve medicine by providing a critical perspective on it while working alongside it in an organisational setting. In 1905 Cabot created one of the first positions of professional social worker in the world, given to Garnet Pelton, and then to Ida Maud Cannon.Beder, J. (2006) Hospital Social Work: The interface of medicine and caring. Routledge: New York Although Clarke credited his approach as similar to that of Anne Cummins in London.Baraclough, J. (2004-09-23). Cummins, Anne Emily (1869–1936), social worker. Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. Retrieved 3 Jan. 2018, see link The hospital refused to support the hiring of social workers, and Cabot had to pay their wages himself. Pelten developed tuberculosis herself soon after taking up the position and was forced to retire. Cannon stayed in the position for forty years and became Head of Social Work at the hospital. Cabot and Cannon pioneered many programs to improve the health of patients, including art classes for psychiatric patients, low-cost meals for patients and research on the social factors that increased a person's likelihood of developing tuberculosis. In 1917 Cabot took up a position in the Medical Reserve Corps for a year. He returned briefly to Massachusetts General Hospital in 1918 and then left to take up the position of chair at Harvard's Department of Social Ethics in 1919. At this time, the hospital agreed to pay the wages of social workers, as up to this point, Cabot had paid the wages of thirteen social workers over the last 12 years. He went on to write about his experiences in his book Social WorkCabot, R.C. (1919). Social Work, webpage: Google-Books-dsC. He is also credited with discovering Cabot rings, and for describing, along with his colleague, Locke, the eponymous Cabot-Locke murmur, a diastolic murmur occasionally heard in severe anemia, unrelated to heart valve abnormalities. Cabot established a tradition of teaching conferences at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) that featured generating differential diagnoses, and founded the long-standing feature of Case Record of MGH in New England Journal of Medicine.  Family and personal life  Cabot's paternal grandfather, Samuel Cabot, Jr., became a sailor at age 19 and married Elizabeth Perkins, daughter of a successful Boston trader. Samuel Cabot III later took over the running of the firm. Richard married Ella Lyman, and both held Transcendentalist views. This philosophy, as well as his parents' commitment to philanthropy, had a strong influence on Richard. Around the end of the 19th Century, such ideals were out of favor, with the dominant beliefs at the time being social Darwinism.Gehlert, S. in Gehlert, S. and T.A. Browne (2006).
