The town of Codrington, the main settlement on the island, is located on the eastern shore of the lagoon. Frigatebird colony To the north of Codrington is a frigatebird colony, centered on the lagoon's tiny Man of War Island, a forty-minute boat ride from Antigua. The colony, known as the Frigate Bird Sanctuary, is one of the main ecotourism attractions in Barbuda. During the mating season, from September to April, this rare bird displays a huge scarlet throat pouch to attract a female mate; the pair will lay one egg on a nest built precariously on the mangrove. These birds cannot walk or swim; they soar high in the clouds and live solely on fish, which they often steal from other birds, giving them their local name, Man of war. They have few predators here, making this nesting site is one of the most important in the world for these endangered birds. Codrington Lagoon's magnificent frigatebird colony, the largest in the Caribbean region, had an estimated 2,500 nesting pairs prior to Hurricane Irma landfall in September 2017.

Between 1810 and 1815 Dona Inácia Maria do Rosário, who lived on the Fazenda Saco Bom had a chapel built to Nossa Senhora do Loreto to accommodate Franciscan missionaries who had come from Pernambuco. Later, with the success of these friars, a two-story house was built next to the chapel, which was called her \\"Morada Nova\\". In 1938 the village was given \\"vila\\" status with the new name of Morada Nova. In 1943 the district was elevated to the category of municipality with the name of Morada, later changed to Moravânia, and still later changed to Morada Nova de Minas. In 1960 with the reservoir of Três Marias the lands of the town were flooded and it began to stagnate economically. The population at that time was 18,000 inhabitants and many of the farmers lost their lands. With the possibility of tourism offered by the lake the town has grown again.

The town had three doors: Saint-Jean door, Coulon door and Saint-Nicolas door. The population of the town supported the changes brought by the French Revolution, after the Reign of Terror. The major revolutionary event is the one celebrating the execution of Louis XVI, accompanied by a hatred oath to the royalty and to the anarchy. It is celebrated since 1795.Louis Dubreuil, « Fêtes révolutionnaires en Ille-et- Vilaine », in Annales de Bretagne, volume 21, tome 4, 1905, p. 398-399 =Legend= The legend of the duck is transmitted from one generation to another since the 15th century. In the first version, the legend says that a young and beautiful girl, a prisoner of the Lord of Montfort, is moaning. She prays Saint Nicolas to escape from her abductor and to keep her virginity. The daint grants her prayers. She, miraculously transformed into a female duck, flies through the window of her cell and settles on the castle's pond. Then, for many centuries, a wild female duck was coming every year in the church, around Saint Nicolas Day and was leaving one of her ducklings as an offering to the miraculous saint. In the second version, the story says that around 1386,, during the completion of the town, the lord locked a beautiful girl up in his castle. She understood very fast what was waiting for her and, catching sight of Saint-Nicolas Church, started praying the saint, promising to thank him if she could escape. Unfortunately, she felt in the hands of the lord's soldiers, who wanted to do what they thought their master had done. She looked around to find some help but saw only two female ducks on the water of the pond, which has since been dried up. She prayed Saint Nicolas, begging him to allow the animals to be witnesses of her innocence and to make them accomplish every year her wish on her behalf if she had to lose her life. She managed to escape from the soldiers but died, apparently of fear, a bit later. She was buried in the Saint Nicolas churchyard. However, the same year, during the Translation (when a saint is transferred from one place to another), while the crowd was flocking to the relics of Saint Nicolas, a female duck came in the church with her ducklings. She fluttered near the picture of the Saint, flew to the altar and saluted the crucifix. Then, she came back near the picture of the Saint and stayed there until the end of the service. At this moment, she flew with all of her ducklings, except one, who stayed in the church. The story became so famous that as it is written in many documents dating from the following centuries, Montfort-sur-Meu became Montfort-la-Cane for more than 300 years. Every time the female duck came to the church, it had been written on sheets. The last appearance is dated from 8 May 1739. However, as only the archives dating from later than the 15th century have been kept, many stories are missing even though, as an ecclesiastic said, \\"In the past, these events became so common that we were not taking time to write them anymore\\". Pond in which the female duck stayed after escaping from the castle Economy Montfort-sur-Meu has many places for accommodation: hotels, guesthouses, B&B;, campsites and caravan parks.

Saint Louis-Marie Grignion =Historical heritage= Surrounding wall of the medieval town To protect the marches of Brittany, the Dukes led a politic of fortification of the big towns. In 1376, Raoul VII got an authorisation to transform the castle into a real defensive fortress. Around the castle, an important fortification is built with towers and 3 doors. We can still find today the Tower of Papegaut, the Tower of Pas d'Âne, the Tower of Capitaine and parts of the former fortifications.

They are located in the oldest streets of the town like for example rue de la Saulnerie, rue de l'Horloge, place de la cohue, rue de Gaël. We can also find the native house of Louis-Marie Grignion de Montfort. Mills and \\"planks\\" on the Meu river In the street called \\"Rue du 11 juin 1977\\", we can see an old mill from 1884. It was also equipped at the time with of a footbridge called \\"planks\\", which crossed the Meu river and linked the street called \\"Ruelle des Moulins\\" (Mills street). Driers and public baths The building is probably from the end of the 19th century. In the lower part were cubicles for public baths and a place reserved for boilers. The first floor, protected by wooden laths was used to dry clothes washed by washerwomen. The town hall Today, the town hall is located in the former Ursuline convent who settled in 1639.

It was built between 1832 and 1834. A break is marked between the old houses from the medieval town and the courthouse, as this last one turns its back to the medieval town. Sites and natural areas Forest of Montfort-Sur-Meu It covers a few hundred hectares, including 40 hectares which are a communal property on the area of Saint-Lazare woods. Several marked paths allow going across this wooden limestone, by foot, by horse and for some people, by bike. Forest of Montfort-sur-Meu Parc Municipal Edouard Guicheteau, mayor of the town from 1853 to 1871, bought for private use the old meadows of the Thabor, possessions of the prior Saint Nicolas, to convert them into an English garden. He diverted the Garun to assure the water circulation and planted yews and exotic conifers. In 1950, the park is bought by the town and opened to the public. The old meadows that stayed wild were then converted into a municipal campsite.

She was also the only female juvenile executed by electric chair and, to date, the last female criminal executed in the electric chair by the Commonwealth of Virginia. She was the last female criminal executed by the Commonwealth until Thursday, September 23, 2010 when Teresa Lewis became the first female criminal in nearly a century to be executed in the US state of Virginia. Christian, a black maid, was convicted for the murder of her employer Mrs. Ida Virginia Belote, a white woman, aged 72 years, in her home at Hampton on March 18, 1912. Shortly after she was arrested, it is said she confessed that she hit Belote. Belote frequently mistreated Christian, and in mid- March 1912, an argument ensued between the two in which Belote accused Christian of stealing a locket and a skirt. Belote hit Christian with a cuspidor, commonly called a 'spittoon'. The altercation escalated when Christian and Belote ran for two broom handles Belote used to prop up her bedroom windows. Christian grabbed one of the broom handles and struck Belote on the forehead. In an attempt to stifle Belote's screams, Christian stuffed a towel down Belote's throat, and the woman died by suffocation. When Christian left the house, she stole Belote's purse with some money and a ring. One newspaper reported that police found Belote's body \\"laying face down in a pool of blood, and her head was horribly mutilated and a towel was stuffed into her mouth and throat\\". (Streib & Sametz, 1989, p. 25; see also Moten, 1997) Police soon arrested Christian, and during questioning, she admitted to hitting Belote but was shocked that Belote was dead. Christian claimed she had no intent to kill Belote. With a lynch mob looming in the background, an Elizabeth City County Court tried and convicted Christian for murder and the trial judge sentenced her to death in the state's electric chair. One day after her 17th birthday in August 1912, a short five months after the crime, Virginia authorities executed Christian at the state penitentiary in Richmond. Governor William Hodges Mann declined to commute the death sentence, despite a plea from Virginia's mother, Charlotte Christian, who wrote to him: : My dear mr governor : Please for give me for Bowing low to write you a few lines: I am the mother of Virginiany Christian. I have been pairalized for mor then three years and I could not and Look after Gennie as I wants too. I know she dun an awful weaked thing when she kill Miss Belote and I hear that the people at the penetintry wants to kill her but I is praying night and day on my knees to God that he will soften your heart so that She may spend the rest of her days in prison. they say that the whole thing is in yours Hands and I know if you will onely save my child who is little over sixteen years old God will Bless you for ever … If I was able to come to see you I could splain things to you better but I cant do nothing but pray to God and ask him to help you to simpithise with me and my truble : I am your most umble subgeck, : Charlotte Christian. After the Governor declined this request, Christian took her seat in the electric chair, where she was electrocuted in the state prison in Richmond. She was 17 years old. The paper reported that her body was to be turned over to the state medical school, because her parents did not have the money to transport the body from Richmond.

It was implemented in the Workplace Relations Amendment (A Stronger Safety Net) Act 2007, which was given Royal Assent on 28 June 2007 and predominantly came into operation on 1 July 2007. The Act saw the renaming of the then Office of Workplace Services, which became the Workplace Ombudsman, and the creation of the Workplace Authority, combining the former Office of the Employment Advocate and parts of the then Department of Employment and Workplace Relations, now the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations. The Fairness Test operated retrospectively from 7 May 2007. The test was introduced by the then Howard government as a “fine-tuning” of WorkChoices, but received criticism from both employer associations (due to the complexity and additional burden to businesses) and trade unions including the Transport Workers Union for not providing adequate protections to employees. The Fairness Test applied to all Collective Agreements (CAs) and Australian Workplace Agreements (AWAs) lodged with the Workplace Authority between 7 May 2007 and 10 April 2008 (signed on or before 27 March 2008), where employees earned under $75,000 base annual salary (for AWAs only) and work in industries or occupations usually covered by awards and where the CA or AWA removes or modifies protected Award conditions. Protected award conditions include penalty rates and loadings (including overtime penalties, weekend and public holiday rates, shift loadings and annual leave loading), monetary allowances, public holidays, rest breaks and incentive based payments and bonuses.Protected conditions and awards Where protected award conditions had been varied or removed, agreements had to provide ‘adequate compensation’ to employees. The Workplace Authority had to take into consideration the particular circumstances of the employee/s, such as their pattern of work. Adequate compensation can include monetary benefits (such as a higher base rate of pay), or non-monetary benefits (such as child care or a parking space) which is of ‘significant value’ to the employee.How is the Fairness Test conducted? The Fairness Test applied where a business was, prior to 27 March 2006, bound to a State Award, which became a Notional Agreement Preserving a State Award (NAPSA), a Federal Award, or where the work done by the employee is in an industry or occupation which would have been covered by an Award or NAPSA prior to the 27 March 2006. Where the business was not bound to a particular Award or NAPSA, the Workplace Authority could designate a Federal Award for the purposes of the fairness test. When an agreement did not pass the Fairness Test, the Workplace Authority notified the employer and allowed them the opportunity to vary the agreement in order to pass. When the agreement was not varied or the variation did not pass the Fairness Test, the agreement will not apply at all, and the employee will derive their minimum terms and conditions at work from the industrial instrument (agreement, Award or NAPSA) that is otherwise capable of applying to the employee. Where an employee was previously not covered by any industrial instrument (an ‘Award- free’ employee) but had an Award designated for the purpose of the Fairness Test, the protected Award conditions will continue to apply to the employee. It is also important to note that the Fairness Test does not check agreements for Prohibited Content or compliance with the Australian Fair Pay and Conditions Standard. The End of the Fairness Test The Workplace Relations Amendment (Transition to Forward with Fairness) Act 2008 (see Workchoices) (the Forward with Fairness Act) was passed by Parliament on 19 March 2008 and given Royal Assent on 27 March 2008, coming into operation on 28 March 2008.Workplace Relations Amendment (Transition to Forward with Fairness) Act 2008 The Forward with Fairness Act removed the Fairness Test for Agreements made on or after 28 March 2008 (for AWA’s that were signed on or before 27 March 2008, the 14-day lodgement period remains), and instead introduced the new No Disadvantages Test. Whilst new agreements will no longer be subject to the Fairness Test, agreements lodged prior to the operation of the Forward with Fairness Act continue to be assessed for the Fairness Test by the Workplace Authority.

The film stars Selena Gomez, Drew Seeley and Jane Lynch. It is a sequel to A Cinderella Story (2004) and the second installment in the A Cinderella Story series. The film was released on DVD on September 16, 2008 and premiered on ABC Family on January 18, 2009. The film was followed by A Cinderella Story: Once Upon a Song (2011). Plot This film is a retelling of the Cinderella fairy tale in a modern setting with Mary Santiago, a high school senior with ambitions of becoming a dancer, taking the role of Cinderella. Tami, Mary's only friend serves as the fairy godmother in the film. The cruel, self- obsessed, snobby, and washed-up pop singer Dominique Blatt takes the role of the stepmother, even though she is just her legal guardian and Mary's mother was one of Dominique's dancers when she died; Dominique took Mary in as her legal guardian and turned her into the hired help. The aggressive, extremely obsessed, and equally snobby Britt and air-headed Bree serve as the two stepsisters, and Joey Parker, now a famous celebrity and pop star has returned to school for his senior year and to remember why he started dancing, acts as Prince Charming. A school dance, the Black and White Ball, substitutes for the ball, with the role of the glass slipper filled by a Zune. Cast Reception Amber Wilkinson of Eye for Film gave the film one out of five stars and said the age difference between Gomez and Seeley was inappropriate, saying that \\"it's a shame there isn't more thought put into their age.\\" She also said that the \\"characters are so wafer thin they barely cast a shadow.\\" While Wilkinson says that the film is completely different from A Cinderella Story, Lacey Walker, reviewing for Christian Answers, notes several aspects of the two films that were directly parallel to each other. Walker also gave it one out of five stars, praising the script, saying the writers \\"peppered this story with a surprising dose of humor and some pleasing plot twists.\\" However, Walker specifically criticized the \\"glaringly obvious\\" age difference between the 15-year-old Gomez and the 26-year-old Seeley.

Historically cannabis has been used an entheogen to induce spiritual experiences - most notably in the Indian subcontinent since the Vedic period dating back to approximately 1500 BCE, but perhaps as far back as 2000 BCE. Its entheogenic use was also recorded in Ancient China,Joseph Needham and Gwei-djen Lu (1974). Science and Civilisation in China: Volume 5, Chemistry and Chemical Technology; Part 2, Spagyrical Discovery and Invention: Magisteries of Gold and Immortality. Cambridge University Press, p. 152 the Germanic peoples, the Celts, Ancient Central Asia, and Africa.[Dunhill, Alfred  \\"The Pipe Book\\"  London  A & C Black, 1924]Rubin, 1975. p.45 In modern times, spiritual use of the drug is mostly associated with the Rastafari movement of Jamaica. Several Western subcultures have had marijuana consumption as an idiosyncratic feature, such as hippies, beatniks, hipsters (both the 1940s subculture and the contemporary subculture), ravers and hip hop. Cannabis has now \\"evolved its own language, humour, etiquette, art, literature and music.\\"Brownlee, 2002. \\"01: Culture\\" Nick Brownlee writes: \\"Perhaps because of its ancient mystical and spiritual roots, because of the psychotherapeutic effects of the drug and because it is illegal, even the very act of smoking a joint has deep symbolism.\\" However, the culture of cannabis as \\"the manifestation of introspection and bodily passivity\\" — which has generated a negative \\"slacker\\" stereotype around its consumers — is a relatively modern concept, as cannabis has been consumed in various forms for almost 5,000 years. The counterculture of the 1960s has been identified as the era that \\"sums up the glory years of modern cannabis culture,\\" with the Woodstock Festival serving as \\"the pinnacle of the hippie revolution in the USA, and in many people's opinion the ultimate example of cannabis culture at work\\". The influence of cannabis has encompassed holidays (most notably 4/20), cinema (such as the exploitation and stoner film genres), music (particularly jazz, reggae, psychedelia and rap music), and magazines including High Times and Cannabis Culture. Social custom Cannabis was once sold in clubs known as \\"Teapads\\" during Prohibition in the United States; jazz was usually played at these clubs. Cannabis use was often viewed to be of lower class and was disliked by many. After the outlawing of cannabis, its consumption became covert. Decades later cannabis became once again tolerated by some regions' legislation. Customs have formed around the consumption of cannabis such as 420, named after the popular time of day to consume cannabis (4:20 p.m.) and celebrated on April 20 (4/20). If consumed in a social setting it is encouraged to share cannabis with others. In the arts As the psychoactive effects of cannabis include increased appreciation of the arts, including and especially music, as well as increased creativity, its influence and usefulness can be found in a variety of works. While coded names of cannabis appeared in music as early as the 1920s, such as Louis Armstrong's song, \\"Muggles,\\" it wasn't until the 1960s and 70's when more artists began referencing it explicitly. Songs famous for their cannabis-centric lyrics produced during this time include \\"Got to Get You into My Life\\" by The Beatles, \\"Rainy Day Women #12 and 35\\" by Bob Dylan, and Black Sabbath's \\"Sweet Leaf.\\" Today, countless artists, not constrained to any drug-culture-specific genre, have opened up about their substance consumption and how it has inspired their works. Snoop Dogg's love of marijuana is very well known, having created his own line of weed, vaporizer pen, and website focusing on cannabis culture. Willie Nelson, who owns a cannabis company called Willie's Reserve, has even said that smoking saved his life. Other contemporary artists who have been vocal about their cannabis use include Miley Cyrus, Jay-Z, Lady Gaga, Zayn Malik, and Rihanna. Cultures Process of making bhang in a Sikh village in Punjab, India. On the Hindu and Sikh festival of colors called Holi, it is a customary addition to some intoxicating drinks. Cannabis — the plant that produces hemp and hashish — has been one of the most used psychoactive drugs in the world since the late 20th century, following only tobacco and alcohol in popularity.Rubin, 1975. p.1 According to Vera Rubin, the use of cannabis has been encompassed by two major cultural complexes over time: a continuous, traditional folk stream, and a more circumscribed, contemporary configuration.Rubin, 1975. p.3 The former involves both sacred and secular use, and is usually based on small-scale cultivation: the use of the plant for cordage, clothing, medicine, food, and a \\"general use as an euphoriant and symbol of fellowship.\\"Rubin, 1975. p.4 The second stream of expansion of cannabis use encompasses \\"the use of hemp for commercial manufacturers utilizing large-scale cultivation primarily as a fiber for mercantile purposes\\"; but it is also linked to the search for psychedelic experiences (which can be traced back to the formation of the Parisian Club des Hashischins). Cannabis has been used in the ancient past in places such as ancient India, Romania, Egypt, and Mesopotamia. It was often used as medicine or for hemp, its main route of consumption was smoking. In addition, the plant holds cultural significance in many Eurasian countries. Hemp is associated within cultural rituals like marriage, death, birth, healing, protection, and purification.Clarke, R., & Merlin, M. (2013). Cannabis: Evolution and Ethnobotany. University of California Press. Retrieved October 5, 2020, from http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/j.ctt3fh2f8 In some Eastern European folklore, hemp links a spirit to the afterlife. Over time the culture became more international and a general \\"cannabis culture\\" formed. The culture has been responsible for the genre of films known as stoner films, which has come to be accepted as a mainstream cinema movement. In the United States the culture has also spawned its own celebrities (such as Tommy Chong and Terence McKenna), and magazines such as (Cannabis Culture and High Times). =India= Bhang eaters from India c. 1790. Bhang is an edible preparation of cannabis native to the Indian subcontinent. It has been used in food and drink as early as 1000 BCE by Hindus in ancient India. Cannabis is indigenous to the Indian subcontinent.\\"Marijuana and the Cannabinoids\\", ElSohly (p. 8). Cannabis is also known to have been used by the ancient Hindus of the Indian subcontinent thousands of years ago. The herb is called ganja (, IAST: ) or ganjika in Sanskrit and other modern Indo-Aryan languages. Some scholars suggest that the ancient drug soma, mentioned in the Vedas, was cannabis, although this theory is disputed. A man smoking cannabis in Kolkata, India. Today cannabis is often formed into bhang, which has become an integral part of tradition and custom in the Indian subcontinent. In some sections of rural India, people attribute various medicinal properties to the cannabis plant. If taken in proper quantity, bhang is believed to cure fever, dysentery, sunstroke, to clear phlegm, aid in digestion, appetite, cure speech imperfections and lisping, and give alertness to the body. Tradition of Bhang =Jamaica= A Rasta man holding cannabis. By the 8th century, cannabis had been introduced by Arab traders to Central and Southern Africa, where it is known as \\"dagga\\"Hamid, The Ganjah Complex: Rastafari and Marijuana, introduction, p. xxxii. and many Rastas say it is a part of their African culture that they are reclaiming.Chanting Down Babylon, p. 130 ff. It is sometimes also referred to as \\"the healing of the nation\\", a phrase adapted from Revelation 22:2.Barry Chevannes, Rastafari and Other African-Caribbean Worldviews, pp. 35, 85; Edmonds, p. 52. Alternatively, the migration of many thousands of Hindus and Muslims from British India to the Caribbean in the 20th century may have brought this culture to Jamaica. Many academics point to Indo-Caribbean origins for the ganja sacrament resulting from the importation of Indian migrant workers in a post-abolition Jamaican landscape. \\"Large scale use of ganja in Jamaica ... dated from the importation of indentured Indians....\\"(Campbell 110). Dreadlocked mystics Jata, often ascetic known as sadhus or Sufi Qalandars and Derwishes, have smoked cannabis from both chillums and coconut shell hookahs in South Asia since the ancient times. Also, the reference of \\"chalice\\" may be a transliteration of \\"jam-e-qalandar\\" (a term used by Sufi ascetics meaning 'bowl or cup of qalandar'). In South Asia, in addition to smoking, cannabis is often consumed as a drink known as bhang and most qalandars carry a large wooden pestle for that reason.Bhang is often produced in large vessels at dargah gatherings known as \\"shaam-e- qalandar\\". During these gatherings large kettle drums known as naggara are played or alternatively, the Dhol. It is known as Qalandri dhamaal. Both groups, the Qalandar's and Sadhu's were lumped together by the British as faqeers. They are still frowned upon by the industrious population and are considered \\"dreadfull\\". Yet they are considered holy men by many. Both groups practice either some sort of chilla nashini or yoga in remote jungles, mountains or charnel grounds in which ganja aids to put a veil on the worldly and to transcend the various societal trends and pressures. It is also used to induce a state of euphoria and trance by some in conjunction with drumming, dance or whirling. Arrow of the Blue-Skinned God: Retracing the Ramayana Through India, Jonah Blank, p. 89. Today the Jamaican religion Rastafari promotes cannabis use for religious use. =United States= Marijuana's history in American culture began during the Colonial Era. During this time, hemp was a critical crop, so colonial governments in Virginia and Massachusetts required land-owning farmers to grow marijuana for hemp-based products. Two of the nation’s founding fathers, Thomas Jefferson and George Washington, were notable cultivators of hemp. Another Colonial Era figure, John Adams, was a recreational user and wrote about hemp's mind-altering powers. Beatnik Marijuana use was associated with the subculture, and during the 1950s, Aldous Huxley's 1954 book The Doors of Perception further influenced views on drugs. This would later influence the hippie movement. Hippie Following in the footsteps of the Beatniks, many hippies used cannabis, considering it pleasurable and benign. Hipster The term \\"Hipsters\\" define two cultural groups, the 1940s subculture dedicated to jazz, and the contemporary subculture today. Both are stereotyped as enjoying cannabis. In fact the early hipsters of the 1940s had many slang terms dedicated to the drug and its distribution. Events A 420 holiday event in Santa Cruz, California. Notable cannabis-related events have included the Cannabis Cup, Global Marijuana March, Hanfparade, High Times Medical Cannabis Cup, MardiGrass, Spannabis, and Tokers Bowl. Annual events in the United States include the Boise Hempfest, Emerald Empire Hempfest, Freedom Rally, Great Midwest Marijuana Harvest Festival, Hash Bash, Missoula Hempfest, Moscow Hemp Fest, National Cannabis Festival, National Cannabis Summit, Olympia Hempfest, Portland Hempstalk Festival, Salem Hempfest, and Seattle Hempfest. Media Media coverage of marijuana has progressed in recent history. Attention and coverage of the drug began in the 1930s when fabricated horror stories of its effects were used to scare the public and influence public opinion.Stringer, R. J., & Maggard, S. R. (2016). Reefer Madness to Marijuana Legalization: Media Exposure and American Attitudes Toward Marijuana (1975-2012). Journal of Drug Issues, 46(4), 428–445. https://doi.org/10.1177/0022042616659762 To push the negative connotations of marijuana even more, films such as Marihuana(1936) and Reefer Madness (1937) were created. Cannabis-related media include Cannabis Planet, High Times, Stoner TV and Weedtuber. Websites include Leafly, MassRoots, Merry Jane, Price of Weed, and Wikileaf.

It is the seat of the Huari Province. It lies on the eastern slope of the Andean mountain range known as the Cordillera Blanca. The economy of the providence is primarily agricultural, and at least half the population are engaged in subsistence horticulture, raising potatoes, sweet potatoes, other native tubers, quinoa, maize, wheat, barley, tomatoes, peppers, and some other vegetables. Many residential households also raise a few animals, including goats, sheep, pigs, occasionally cattle, guinea pigs (cuy), rabbits, chickens, and ducks. Much of the trade in this rural area is barter. Huari is connected to the electric grid, and in 2005 some of the surrounding villages were just beginning to be connected to the grid. History =Huari in the year 1965= In the mid-1960s electricity was locally generated by a small hydroelectric plant. The plant supplied AC power from dusk to dawn; at dawn the natural-stream water was diverted back into the water pipes that supplied potable water until dusk. Electricity and running water was available to less than a hundred Huari businesses, government offices, private residences, and the public school; and for the Diocese of the (Roman Catholic) Bishop of Huari, and for less than two dozen streetlights. Several streets—mostly no wider than four meters—were cobbled and maintained for vehicular traffic. There were no concrete or asphalted streets, although many streets had raised cobbled sidewalks. The drive from Huari westward to the Pan-American Highway during fair weather required six to eight hours on packed-earth and graveled roads until arriving at the asphalt-paved Pan-American Highway on the Pacific coast near the town of Comas. Crossing the Cordillera Blanca was facilitated by a one-lane tunnel about 800 meters length. This tunnel was a 5-meter cylindrical tube that had been blasted and cut through rock. The ceiling and walls were unfinished, and year-round the water seeps at numerous places kept the rough but generally level one-lane roadway constantly muddy and covered with puddles. Crossing this generally east-west highway about halfway between the Cordillera Blanca and the Cordillera Blanca is the north-south highway between the Ancash capital, Huaraz, and the large ancient town of Recuay. From Huari the city of Huaraz was a motor-vehicle trip of about four hours; the distance from Huari to Recuay was somewhat less.

A full listing of her peer- reviewed publications can be found at Myrna Wooders webpage. Specifically, her work has focused on coalition theory, public good theory and club theory. Myrna currently is a Professor of Economics at Vanderbilt University and the University of Warwick. Wooders completed her PhD under Leo Hurwicz.

Early life Myrna Wooders grew up on a small farm in rural Alberta, Canada. Her father had a ninth grade education—the best one offered when he was a boy—and preferred helping out the neighbors by fixing their machinery to working on his farm. Her mother, who completed grade seven, loved planting and growing trees, flowers and gardens so while the trees have been called \\"the finest stand of trees in Eastern Alberta\\", the paying crops did not pay so well. Myrna spent hours each summer, as a small child, carrying water to the trees. She was the tallest of four sisters and that may be why she was chosen to be the farm worker of the bunch. She missed a couple of months of school each year to help on the farm. But much can be learned doing physical labor. Working in a granary during harvest time, leveling out the grain as it fell from the thrasher into the granary, she learned to keep shoveling (it was either that, or be buried alive). Until grade 9, with the discovery of the mailing services of the Library of the University of Alberta, there were few books to read; the family was not religious but some summers there was only the Bible. Myrna had children at a young age, prior to undergraduate studies, and became a photographer in another small Alberta town. With her two children in tow, she went on to complete her undergraduate studies at the University of Alberta and her PhD at the University of Minnesota. Academic career Professor Wooders research focuses on public economic theory (particularly tax competition and the theory of local public goods), club theory (especially the relationship between markets and clubs), and coalition theory (particularly cooperative games with many players and their relationship to markets). Myrna Wooders lives in Nashville, Tennessee, with her plants.

It is similar to its more widespread relative, the pampas grass Cortaderia selloana, but it can get quite a bit taller, approaching seven meters in height at maximum. This grass is native to the northern Andes but it is well-known elsewhere as an invasive species noxious weed. This grass has only pistillate parts, that is, all individuals are female. It reproduces by apomixis, in which embryos develop without fertilization. Description This pampas grass, Cortaderia jubata, has long, thin, razor-edged leaves forming a large bunch grass tussock from which the eye-catching inflorescences arise. At the top of a stem several meters in height is an inflorescence of plumelike spikelets. These panicles are pink or purplish when new and they gradually turn cream or white. Each inflorescence is packed full of fruits which develop despite the plant's having never been fertilized. Each plant produces millions of seeds per year. They disperse easily by several methods, including wind, water, and soil transport. Invasive species =New Zealand= In New Zealand C. jubata is listed on the National Pest Plant Accord prohibiting it from sale, and commercial propagation and distribution. =United States= Cortaderia jubata grows well in the conditions provided by the cool, moist California coast, where it was presumably an introduced species as an attractive ornamental plant. It is a common weed of Redwood National and State Parks, the Central Coast region, and Big Sur, as well as other coastal hillsides and roadsides throughout the state. The plant competes with native vegetation, interferes with the natural scenery of the unique ecosystems and habitats (i.e. Redwood and Coastal sage scrub), harbors pest species such as rats, and produces large amounts of dry foliage which is a wildfire hazard.

Although it is unincorporated, it has a post office, with the ZIP code 76841.Zip Code Lookup History The settlement of Fort McKavett had its 1850s origins as a civilian population just north of Camp San Saba in Menard County (not the Camp San Saba in McCulloch County), with the name of Scabtown. Camp San Saba closed in 1859, and many residents fled to safer areas to be protected against Indian depredations. The United States Army reopened the outpost in 1869 as Fort McKavett. As the civilian population of Scabtown grew, the community was renamed after Fort McKavett, and the local economy began to thrive. The Army closed the fort in 1883, but the earlier relocation of native American tribes made the civilians feel safe enough to remain. The population grew, and with it an economy that supported two hotels, three churches, a newspaper, and a mattress factory. The population peaked at 150 at the beginning of the 20th century, but declined in the latter half of the century. The writer Robert E. Howard, a Texas history enthusiast, visited Fort McKavett in 1933, and wrote: \\"McKavett is fascinating - a village of ruins and semiruins, people living in the old unruined barracks and officers's quarters, among the remnants of other buildings which had not stood the test of time.Robert E.

The episode ends with the teenage Cleaver boys playing with a wind-up toy and laughing like children. It is in the final episode that the viewer learns how Beaver got his nickname. Cast and crew \\"Family Scrapbook\\" stars Hugh Beaumont and Barbara Billingsley as archetypal suburban couple, Ward and June Cleaver. Along for the ride are Tony Dow as the couple's older son, Wally Cleaver, and Jerry Mathers as their younger son, Theodore \\"Beaver\\" Cleaver. All guest stars in the episode appear in clips from previous episodes in the series. The episode was written by the show's creators, Joe Connelly and Bob Mosher, with series star, Hugh Beaumont directing. Significance \\"Family Scrapbook\\" has claimed its place in television history as the first traditional primetime series finale. No other series prior to Leave It to Beaver had a special final episode except Howdy Doody in 1960 (which did not use flashbacks and was not a primetime sitcom). Most series ended with a general story line episode not unlike any other episode in the series.Leave It to Beaver: Family Scrapbook - TV.com See also *List of Leave It to Beaver episodes References *Applebaum, Irwyn.

Though first published in English, the books are originally written in Japanese and each volume is illustrated by a Japanese manga artist. Each book is adapted from the Bible by Hidenori Kumai. The first two books were illustrated by manga artist Kozumi Shinozawa, while the remaining four were by Ryō Azumi. The first book in the series, Manga Messiah was published in 2006 and covered the four gospels of the Bible: Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. Manga Metamorphosis (2008) covers the events in Acts and several of Paul's letters. Manga Mutiny (2008, 2009) begins in Genesis and ends in Exodus. Manga Melech (2010) picks up where Manga Mutiny left off and continues into the reign of David. Manga Messengers (2011) addresses events starting with the reign of King Solomon and takes stories from several of the major and minor prophets, and the Book of Esther and concludes with anticipation of a messiah. The sixth and the final book from the series, Manga Majesty (2019) concludes the story of apostle John's revelation in the island of Patmos and the revelations that mark the end of days. Production The Manga Bible series is the creation of Next, a non- profit organization created in 2006 to produce and distribution biblically- based manga series for distribution in a multitude of languages worldwide. Next was formed by Roald Lidal, general director of New Life League Japan, pulling together manga publishing and printing professionals from Japan, and includes Japanese manga artists and other professionals in the manga industry. Lidal created the Manga Bible series in order to \\"reach children who might resist traditional Bible translations and never attend a church.\\" When he first announced his vision, it was met with some derision, with other Christians feeling the books would be insulting to the gospel. Lidal was persistent, and continued his vision to produce the six book series, with four covering the Old Testament and two covering the New Testament portions of the Christian Bible. Each book in the series is initially written in Japanese by Christian Japanese artists, then translated to additional languages and published by regional religious publishers. Each language edition is reviewed by members of regional bible societies before publication, to ensure accurate translation. Media The first book of the series, Manga Messiah, was scripted by Hidenori Kumai and illustrated by Kelly Kozumi Shinozawa. Though initially written in Japanese, the English edition was published first, premiering in the United Kingdom and the Philippines in 2006. In North America, Tyndale House purchased the English rights for all the books in the series, publishing Manga Messiah in September 2007. COMIX35 acted as the English consultants for translating the Japanese editions into English. The Spanish language editions are being published by the American Bible Society. The Japanese language edition was published in Japan in February 2008. =Volume list= =Booklets= An abbreviated booklet version of Manga Messiah is called Manga Mission, followed by The Messiah, produced at a lower cost for mass distributions in 2016. Reception Before its creation, some Christians expressed concern that the Manga Bible series format would \\"cheapen the gospel.\\" The first book of the series, Manga Messiah, received mixed reviews from critics. Matthew J. Brady of the website \\"Manga Life\\" found Manga Messiah to be \\"a fairly authentic manga,\\" feeling it had an authentic manga background and styling, but showing Western-influences in its use of full- color pages and greater amounts of captioning and text. As a whole, he felt the book was a faithful adaptation of the gospels, but did note that some slight liberties taken with the story would \\"probably bother steadfast Christians\\". Comixology's Jason Thompson was less impressed, heavily criticizing the art of the book, referring to it as the \\"most basic kind of manga shorthand—awkward geometric faces with big eyes, big hair, exaggerated expressions\\" with \\"blandly attractive\\" main characters, \\"dorky caricatures\\" of old RPG characters used for the villains, and crudely drawn backgrounds. Both reviewers felt the book tried to include too much information, and that the authors used Jesus' Hebrew name \\"Yeshuah\\" in an attempt to make it more palatable to non-Christian readers. They also both criticized the book's occasional odd phrasing when key dialog was rewritten using modern English. In an editorial piece, Bruce Wilson of The Huffington Post attacked the book, repeatedly quoting an anonymous source who sent him a copy of it, and Chip Berlet, a senior analyst at Political Research Associates. The trio felt the manga contained extreme Anti-judaistic views and was pushing for an idea of \\"objectifying Jews as non human\\". Berlet is quoting as stating that Manga Messiah is \\"A colorful comic training manual for motivating young leaders of the next pogrom against Jews. Not just offensive -- ghastly and horrific in content with a clear enemy scapegoat identified for venting apocalyptic religious bigotry.\\" In a follow-up piece, Wilson himself claimed that \\"Manga Messiah depicts sinister, swarthy rabbis scheming with the devils and Jews laughing at and taunting Jesus as Christ is nailed to the cross. There are no \\"good\\" Jews depicted in the comic.\\" Reviewer Deirdre J. Good, of the Christian think tank Ekklesia, rebuked the book for its removal of the tension between Jesus and his family and the removal of Judas from The Last Supper, suspecting that Japanese family values had been allowed to intrude upon the original text. She partially supports Wilson's assessment, feeling the depictions of the Pharisees were implausible and that \\"most depictions of Pharisees or other opponents are caricatures of unappealing people which become sterotypes [sic] by the time one has finished reading the book\\". As a whole, she felt it was too simplistic, even for a teenage audience.

Toman attended Queen's University Belfast, where he joined the Labour Club, and also the Belfast Willowfield branch of the Northern Ireland Labour Party (NILP). He visited the Soviet Union as the group's representative in 1964. In 1965 - 66, he edited the Labour Club's Impact journal, and was the Chair of the Literific, the university's debating society. He also became Chair of the NILP Young Socialists, and joined the revolutionary socialist Irish Workers' Group.Paul Arthur, The People's Democracy 1968-73 On leaving university, Toman became a schoolteacher in Newtownards.John McMillen's Annual Address , Institution of Civil Engineers, 25 January 2006. He joined the Young Socialist Alliance, and became a prominent leader of People's Democracy, whose other members included Michael Farrell and Eamonn McCann, contemporaries of his at university. Through the Alliance, he and Farrell were the main promoters of the Belfast to Derry march in 1968 which culminated in the Burntollet Bridge incident. Toman stood for People's Democracy in Mid Armagh at the 1969 Northern Ireland general election, where he took 27.7% of the vote.Northern Ireland Parliamentary Election Results: Counties: Armagh, election.demon.co.uk; accessed 20 October 2015. In 1969, he was an organiser of a civil rights march from Belfast to Dublin. At the border customs post, he presented two books which had been condemned by the Roman Catholic Church, The Ginger Man and The Girl With Green Eyes, the first of which was then banned in the Republic of Ireland, to challenge that state's censorship laws. This proved controversial within the movement; Toman was also criticised for organising the march badly.

He has played various roles in Quebec movies and television shows since 1982. Profile After serving in the Canadian Armed Forces, Barrette started his movie acting career in 1982 and appeared in nearly a dozen movies, including Les Boys in the first part of the series in 1997 (as Roger, a defenceman for a garage league team), Aurore, and The Rocket (Maurice Richard), a tribute to life of the former Montreal Canadiens superstar Maurice \\"Rocket\\" Richard. He also appeared in several popular television series, including La Petite Vie in 1995, Scoop and Paparazzi. His most important role in television and arguably in his entire acting career was in KM/H, a TVA TV series in which he played the main character for nearly eight years. His second main role was as a detective in the series Un homme mort in 2006. Barrette has also been one of the most notable stand-up comedians in Quebec since 1983 and performed several one-man comedy shows province-wide, including in 1989, 100% Barrette in 1997, in 2000, in 2004 and Michel Barrette, 100% neuf in 2006. He was also part of a major show to aid victims of the 1996 Saguenay Flood. He was a regular guest on Normand Brathwaite's defunct-satirical television show Piment Fort during the 1990s. His first famous role was his stand-up character named Roland \\"Hi- Ha\\" Tremblay, which became a hit around 1988, and was the basis for Serge Gaboury's comic strip of the same name, and also started the career of comic/actor Vincent Bolduc, who became famous by playing the same routine at age 9 or 10. He previously hosted, with Jean-Marc Parent, Casse-Tête, a Télé- Metropole show for the 1987 and 1988 seasons while he also hosted the TVA show Planete en folie in 1998. He hosted several radio shows, including morning shows on Montreal radio stations CKOI, CKMF and more recently CHMP-FM.

Life After his early schooling under the direction of the Franciscans in Baddesley Green, Warwickshire, he was educated at St. Edmund's College, old Hall, which he entered in 1810 and where he was ordained priest, 19 Sept., 1818. He remained at the college as professor and procurator in 1818-19. He then served as assistant priest in Warwick Street, London, and afterwards at Lincoln's Inn Fields until his ill- health necessitated his removal to the country mission of Slindon in Sussex. In 1824 he was appointed chaplain to the Duke of Norfolk at Arundel, where he spent the rest of his life, devoting himself to historical and antiquarian studies. His chief object was to bring out a new edition of Dodd's Church History of England, which was to incorporate documents collected by himself and John Kirk. The first volume appeared in 1839, but on the publication of the fifth volume in 1843 the work was discontinued, as the revival of the history of the seventeenth-century disputes between seculars and regulars was thought inopportune and gave offence. Meanwhile, his position as an antiquarian had received public recognition, for in 1833 he was elected a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London and in 1841 a Fellow of the Royal Society. He also acted as Secretary to the Sussex Archaeological Society. After the restoration of the Catholic hierarchy in England and Wales, he became the first Canon Penitentiary of the Diocese of Southwark, having long been a member of the Old Chapter. Shortly afterwards, his relations with Cardinal Nicholas Wiseman, whose policy he disliked and mistrusted, became very strained. Arising out of Tierney's biographical sketch of John Lingard, a controversy began between them on the then well-known question as to whether Lingard had been created a cardinal in petto, by Leo XII, and Cardinal Wiseman addressed to his chapter a letter complaining of Tierney's criticism of his Recollections of the last Four Popes. In answer to this Tierney wrote the Reply to Cardinal Wiseman's Letter to his Chapter (1858), which was not 'published', though it was printed.Mark Aloysius Tierney, reply to cardinal Wiseman's Letter to his chapter; to which is prefixed the letter to 'The Rambler'. He also wrote The History and Antiquities of the Castle of Arundel (London, 1834) and several controversial pamphlets. For a time he acted as editor of the Dublin Review, succeeding Michael Joseph Quin, the first editor. Tierney died at Arundel on 19 February 1862.

Li Yuansu was the younger brother of Li Jingxuan, who served as chancellor during the reign of Wu Zetian's husband Emperor Gaozong of Tang. It was said that he, like Li Jingxuan, showed abilities as an official. He was, at one point, the magistrate of Wude County (武德, in modern Jiaozuo, Henan), when his superior, Li Wenjian (李文暕) the prefect of Huai Prefecture (roughly modern Jiaozuo) was set to collect gold and silver from the people to make barrels to offer to the emperor, and the people resented it. Other subordinates of Li Wenjian did not dare to speak about it, but Li Yuansu opposed it vehemently. Li Wenjian stopped collecting gold and silver from the people and, as he believed that Li Yuansu needed financial support, paid Li Yuansu out of his own pocket. As of 692, during Wu Zetian's reign, Li Yuansu was acting deputy minister of treasury (地官侍郎, Diguan Shilang), when she promoted him to be Wenchang You Cheng (文昌右丞), one of the secretaries general of the executive bureau of government (文昌臺, Wenchang Tai) and gave him the designation Tong Fengge Luantai Pingzhangshi (同鳳閣鸞臺平章事), making him a chancellor de facto. Just slightly more than a month later, however, he, along with other chancellors Li Youdao, Wang Xuan, Yuan Zhihong, and Cui Shenji, and other officials Kong Siyuan (孔思元), and Ren Linghui (任令輝), were falsely accused of crimes by Wu Zetian's secret police official Wang Hongyi. They were relieved from their posts and exiled to the Lingnan region. By 694, however, Li Yuansu had been recalled from exile and was serving as Wenchang You Cheng again, when he was made Fengge Shilang (鳳閣侍郎), the deputy head of the legislative bureau, and again given the de facto chancellor designation of Tong Fengge Luantai Pingzhangshi. In late 696, there was a treasonous plot by the officials Liu Sili (劉思禮), Qilian Yao (綦連耀), and Wang Ju (王勮) -- as the conspirators believed that Qilian was fated to be emperor one day. The official Ji Xu heard of the plot and relayed it to the secret police official Lai Junchen, who in turn reported it to Wu Zetian. Wu Zetian had Wu Yizong (武懿宗) the Prince of Henan (the grandson of her uncle Wu Shiyi (武士逸)) investigate, and Wu Yizong, promising Liu that he would be spared, had him implicate as many officials as he could, and Liu implicated some 36 officials, including Li Yuansu, fellow chancellor Sun Yuanheng, and other officials Shi Baozhong (石抱忠), Liu Qi (劉奇), Zhou Bo (周譒), and Wang Ju's brothers Wang Mian (王勔) and Wang Zhu (王助). All 36 households were slaughtered on the same day, and some 1,000 related persons were exiled. Not until Wu Zetian was overthrown in 705 were Li Yuansu's honors posthumously restored.

Most often, it is given by a newspaper or other news outlet to annually recognize a public person. Such awards have typically been awarded to one person, near or after the end of a calendar year. The awardee is usually someone widely known via a news media's audience. A local newspaper typically gives a Person of the Year award to a local individual. However, prominent Person of the Year awards have been given to persons well beyond the scope of a given news market, to animals (Secretariat), to two or more persons in the event of a tie, and to groups of persons whose membership is not clear (Ebola fighters). Also the award is presented annually by some organizations but may be a one-off or occasional event for others. The award can be facetious or serious. The chosen person is usually someone who has been notably influential or prominent during the year and could also be a hero or villain. Unlike most awards, it is externally oriented; the award is given to someone who is not a member and may have no association with the awarding organization. A local award's selection process can be seen to be politically influenced, as dramatized in a \\"Parks and Recreation\\" television show episode. Variations on the theme include \\"Business Person of the Year\\", or \\"Small Business Person of the Year\\", or \\"Entrepreneur of the Year\\", commonly awarded by local chambers of commerce or other economic boosters.

A member of the Red Pheasant First Nation, he joined the Edmonton Police in 1911 becoming the first Indigenous police officer in Canada. Decoteau was known for his athletic ability and his achievements in running. A holder of numerous long-distance records in Western Canada, he represented Canada in the 5,000 meters event at the 1912 Summer Olympics. Decoteau joined the Canadian Expeditionary Force in April 1915 and died on October 30, 1917, during the Second Battle of Passchendaele. Biography Decoteau was born on the Red Pheasant Indian Reserve in the District of Saskatchewan on November 19, 1887. One of five children, he was the son of Peter Decoteau, who was Métis and Dora Pambrun, who was Cree. His father, who fought alongside Plains Cree Chief Pîhtokahanapiwiyin (Poundmaker) at Battle of Cut Knife in 1885, was an employee of the Indian Department when he was murdered in 1891. With no way to support the family, Decoteau's mother arranged to have the children admitted to the Battleford Industrial School. It was as a student at the school that he first demonstrated an aptitude for athletics. Decoteau worked as a farm-hand prior to moving to Edmonton where he worked for his brother in law David Latta as a blacksmith. His sister Emily and Latta, a business man and one-time Edmonton alderman, had married in 1899 and Decoteau initially lived with the couple upon his arrival to the city. In 1911 he was hired as a constable by the Edmonton Police, where he served as Canada's first Indigenous officer and was among the city's first motorcycle officers. He promoted to sergeant in 1914. =Running career= While in Edmonton he won numerous western Canadian major middle or long distance races. He completed his first race on May 24, 1909, placing second in the one-mile competition. He quickly followed the achievement by winning two five-mile races within six days of each other. The first win occurred at the Edmonton Exhibition, in June, which he completed with a time of 00:28:41. The second was the Mayberry Cup, which took place in Lloydminster on July 1, where he set a new Western record with a time of 00:27:45. Decoteau competed in the 5,000 metre race at the 1912 Summer Olympics in Stockholm, Sweden, serving as the only representative from Alberta on the Canadian Olympic team. Finishing second in the first heat of the 5,000 metres competition, leg cramps impacted his performance in the final run, causing him to finish sixth, overall. =World War I= Influenced by his father's involvement with the North-West Rebellion in 1885, Decoteau enlisted in the Canadian Expeditionary Force in April 1916. He first served with the 202nd Infantry Battalion before moving on to the 49th Battalion. Decoteau trained at the Sarcee military training camp, near Calgary, Alberta, from June to October 1916 before being set sail for England. He shipped from Halifax on November 24, 1916, aboard SS Mauretania. Decoteau continued to run while stationed abroad participating in at least two military personnel athletic competitions. At an event in Salisbury, George V, King of England, awarded Decoteau his personal gold pocket watch as congratulations for winning a 5-mile race. On May 27, 1917, Decoteau, was sent to France along with the other members of the 49th Battalion. While there, his athletic ability was put to use while he served as a communications trench runner. Decoteau was killed by a German sniper on the morning of October 30, 1917, during the Second Battle of Passchendaele. A common, but unsubstantiated, account of his death suggests that the German sniper stole the pocket watch that had been awarded by George V and was later recovered by his comrades who ensured it was returned to his mother Dora. In 1985, the Cree performed a ceremony in Edmonton \\"to bring his spirit home\\". Honours were provided by the Red Pheasant Band, the Edmonton Police Service and the Canadian army.  Honours  Recognition of Decoteau's accomplishments is credited to the work of Edmonton police officer Sam Donaghey. After finding a newspaper clipping about Decoteau in 1966, Donaghey conducted research that led to Decoteau's induction into the Edmonton Sports Hall of Fame in 1967 and, later, the Alberta Sport Hall of Fame in 2001. Decoteau's achievements have also been recognized through induction into Saskatchewan Sports Hall of Fame in 2000 and the Canada's Sports Hall of Fame in 2015. The Edmonton Police Museum and Archives contains many of his personal and military trophies and awards.

Explanation of the novel's title The title is taken from the on-air call sign of BBC Radio in London (2LO), which began transmitting in 1922. Plot summary Martin Conway is an unhappy 7th-grade student at a conservative New Jersey prep school, All Souls Preparatory, that reveres the memory of such famous graduates as General \\"Hollerin' Hank\\" Lowery. His self-sacrificing mother doesn't listen and his father is an alcoholic and is seldom around. Their marriage is falling apart. The only person he is able to talk to is his grandmother. Martin is bullied both by students and teachers, his grades are falling and he has few friends, and is finally involved in an altercation with one of the school's most famous students, the grandson of an important World War II veteran. Almost simultaneously, Martin's grandmother dies. Martin becomes seriously depressed, and rarely leaves his basement room. In his Grandma's will, though, she leaves him an antique radio. When he tries it out, its hidden static is ghostly signal is also a portal to the deadly past of the London Blitz. At first Martin believes he is having nightmare visions related to his stressful situation, but with the help of his older sister, an Ivy League graduate, he researches historical details from his visions. When they turn out to be true, he realizes that he is really traveling through time. A child with a British accent emerges through the radio static, and eventually leads Martin back to the streets of London in 1940. Jimmy Harker is a boy in desperate need of help, but the help he needs will require more heart and courage from Martin than he ever knew he had. Martin complies with Jimmy's request and sets forth on an adventure in history, revenge and redemption, couched in serious questions about death and the afterlife. He begins to discover secrets he didn't know existed, and finds answers to questions people wanted to keep hidden. What he learns ends up changing the historical record on General Lowery, bringing peace to an old man's life, and altering a number of lives for the better, including his own. Another important plot theme is that of how family history and what we want to believe about people doesn't always match up with reality.

Pons Prades was also active in the Syndicalist Party of Ángel Pestaña, a member of the Confederación Nacional del Trabajo (CNT), and after Francisco Franco's defeat of the Second Spanish Republic in the Spanish Civil War, a maqui. Biography Pons Prades was born in the Raval neighborhood of Barcelona. His father, a cabinetmaker, was a Valencian immigrant and a member of the Federal Party of Spain, and founder of a woodworkers' union. His mother, Glòria Prades Núñez, also an immigrant from València, was a member of the Syndicalist Party, and became a member of the Generalitat de Catalunya through the friendship of Martí Barrera, a member of the government. As a young child, Pons enrolled in the Rationalist School, based on the philosophy of Francesc Ferrer i Guàrdia. There he attended the lectures of the engineer and geologist Alberto Carsi. Pons' focus was always teaching, and attended the Industrial School of Barcelona for this purpose, but these studies were interrupted by the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in 1936. That year, Pons' father committed suicide. His uncle, a member of the Federación Anarquista Ibérica, lived to carry the coffin of Buenaventura Durruti in November that year. Pons' joined the CNT in 1937 and participated in the collectivization of the Consejo Económico de la Madera Socializada and other locations such as the Santa Madrona Church in Poble Sec neighborhood of Barcelona. =Spanish Civil War= At 16 years old, Pons enlisted in the Republican Army with falsified identification papers. He earned the rank of sergeant, and received his machine gun from Miguel Hernández, then leader of the Spanish Republican Army's 46th Division. Pons was injured on March 17, 1938 while defending Barcelona during a fascist shelling of the city. Once recovered from his wounds, Pons entered the Quinta del Biberón (the \\"baby bottle brigade\\"), where he met Joan Llarch. He later fought in the Battle of Brunete, and the Battle of the Ebro at just 17 years old. Following the defeat of the Republic, Pons helped with the evacuation of injured republicans from hospitals in Barcelona to the French border; from December 15, 1938 to February 10, 1939 10,300 injured were evacuated from the country. Of this, Pons Prades said \\"With hearts battered by the violent lash of defeat, some entered France in the coldest days of winter of 1938-1939, with tangled hair, disarrayed, smelly, with beggars' beards, thin and drawn, with uniforms spattered with blood and lead, and with the look of visionaries ... They were the first - the only ones - who had dared to confront fascism in Europe, with weapons in their hands.\\" =World War II= In 1939, Pons made contact with the French resistance, fighting against the German army in Belgium and Luxembourg. After the defeat of the French army in 1940, Pons helped form part of the Spanish anti-fascist resistance in France, in a group called Solidaridad Española (Spanish Solidarity), together with Manolo Morató and Tomás Martín, commanding a group made up of French and Spanish fighters, collaborating on sabotage missions, and with the Ponzán Group as well. Pons also joined with Manolo Huet to save the lives of Jews in France. Pons later joined the army of Generals Leclerc and Charles de Gaulle, participating in the liberation of the French department of Aude. =Post-war era= After the end of World War II, Pons settled in France, from where he made two trips into Spain to make contact with the Syndicalist Party, with the intention of continuing the resistance against Franco. During the day Pons worked a farm, and at night went on guerrilla missions. During a trip when he intended to return to France with a guide from the group of Francisco Sabaté Llopart, Pons was arrested, on January 5, 1946, in Puigcerdà, but escaped three weeks later after bribing the colonel handling the case, and went to Valencia where he had family. Pons became a writer and historian, contributing from France to various publications, such as Papeles de Son Armadans, edited by Camilo José Cela. Pons ultimately returned to Spain in 1962, after an amnesty was granted by Franco on the occasion of the coronation of Pope John XXIII. He then started the publishing house Alfaguara. Pons died in Barcelona's Hospital de Sant Pau, the same hospital from which he had evacuated wounded republicans in 1938-39, on May 28, 2007, without being able to see publication of his book on the political aspects of the life of Pablo Picasso. =Abduction= Pons relates that he was abducted by a UFO while he was driving his car through the north of Spain. He was so shocked by the experience that wrote a book called 'El mensaje de otros mundos'. The publishing house warned him that his reputation would be damaged by publishing the book, but he decided to publish it anyway.

Edmund Fanning was a seal skin and merchant trader who'd read the expedition journal of English navigator George Vancouver. Vancouver's journal was of particular interest to Fanning as Vancouver in 1791 had landed on the coast of New Holland at a place named King George the Third's Sound. Vancouver wrote about that region being rich with fur seals. On the strength of that information, Fanning made preparations to send Union there on a seal hunting expedition to gather 20,000 skins. His plan was to sell the skins in Canton for wares to bring back to New York. Fanning commissioned 24-year-old Isaac Pendleton as captain of the expedition and selected 22-year-old Daniel Wright as chief officer. In addition, 18-year-old Isaiah Townsend was taken on Union as second mate. Union departed New York late September, 1802, for a brief stop in Stonington, Connecticut, before making the hop to Nantucket where she embarked a 12-man seal hunting gang led by Owen Folger-Smith. Union departed Nantucket 10 October 1802, with 36 men, then stopped by the island of Sal in the Portuguese out-post of Cape Verde before continuing to South Georgia to commence seal hunting. But the sealers didn't enjoy much luck while at South Georgia, only obtaining from there around 300 or 400 skins. At King George's Sound (near present-day Albany, Western Australia) Pendleton met Nicolas Baudin who was captain of Le Géographe. Baudin shared with him charts of Île Borda (Kangaroo Island) and advised him of bountiful seals there. Acting on this advice Pendleton proceeded to Kangaroo Island, and in April 1803 decided to spend the winter there, at an inlet now known as American River, and to build a small sealer, the schooner Independence. Union arrived at Sydney on 6 October 1803 from the \\"Straits\\" with a cargo of skins. She left for China on 29 August 1804. While sailing from Sydney to China, Union called at Tongatapu in the Friendly Islands searching for sandalwood. Isaac Pendleton and seven other men went ashore on 1 October 1804. Unbeknownst to the crew remaining aboard Union, the natives had killed all eight men. The following day, a canoe approached the ship with a white woman on board. It appeared that her role was to entice another boat load of men to come ashore but she cried out that the other men had been murdered and she leapt out of the canoe and swam to the ship. The crew rescued her and held off the natives whilst the ship raised anchor. The woman turned out to be Elizabeth Mosley (or Mosey, or Morey), the sole survivor from Duke of Portland, which had called at the island some two years earlier and whose crew the natives too had killed. Unions surviving crew, under First Mate Daniel Wright, sailed her back to Sydney, arriving on 25 October 1804. Union sailed for Fiji on 12 November 1804, under contract to Simeon Lord. Fate Union was totally wrecked on the island of Koro. The master, Daniel Wright, and the other twenty-one crew drowned or were killed by natives. No exact record of the date of its wrecking was recorded. Narratives Walter Bates wrote one account of a voyage aboard Union.

Plot This movie, based on a true story, centers around the 1986 investigation of the death of Kevin Thacker. Kevin Thacker of Iowa is a repeat drunk driving offender, and when he is taken into the Marshalltown, Iowa, police station and questioned for his latest DUI, he attempts to escape. When he is found deceased in an alley behind the station, the town police report he attempted to jump from the roof of the station to a nearby building, a gap too far for him to clear. He fell, and was killed on impact. However, the parents of Kevin Thacker disagree with this story. They suspect that he was murdered by Kendall Eldred, the police officer who questioned him. They seek the help of a personal injury attorney, Stuart M. Pepper, who works to find the evidence to prove that this was not an accidental death, but a deliberate murder and case of police brutality. Attorney Pepper takes Eldred to court and uses evidence of Thacker's injuries, the crime scene itself, and time constraints around the time of death to disprove the possibility of Kevin Thacker falling from the rooftop. Pepper's arguments prove successful, and the court eventually finds Kendall Eldred guilty of the murder. It was all a massive cover-up made by the Marshalltown police department to hide the guilt of an officer. The truth came to light, and it was discovered that an unarmed, defenseless Kevin Thacker was killed in cold blood due to a blow from Officer Eldred.

The son of Thomas Robertson, a landed proprietor in Grenada, West Indies, where he spent his boyhood. In 1809 his mother brought him to England, and placed him at St. Edmund's College, Old Hall (1810), where he remained for nine years. In 1819 he began his legal studies, and in 1825 was called to the bar, but did not practise. For a time he studied philosophy and theology in France under the influence of his friends Lamennais and Gerbet. In 1835 he published his translation of Friedrich Schlegel's Philosophy of History, which passed through many editions. From 1837 to 1854 he lived in Germany and Belgium. During this time he translated Möhler's Symbolism, adding an introduction and a life of Möhler. This work considerably influenced some of the Oxford Tractarians. In 1855 John Henry Newman nominated Robertson as professor of geography and modern history in the Catholic University of Ireland. In this capacity he published two series of lectures (1859 and 1864), as well as Lectures on Edmund Burke (1869), and a translation of Dr. Hergenröther's Anti Janus (1870) to which he prefixed a history of Gallicanism. He also wrote a poem, The Prophet Enoch (1859), and contributed several articles to the Dublin Review. His services to literature obtained for him a pension from the Government in 1869, and the degree of Doctor of Philosophy from Pius IX (1873). He is buried in Glasnevin Cemetery. References *.

It was Missouri's tallest apartment building until the conversion of the Kansas City Power & Light building and the tenth- tallest habitable building in Missouri. In 1997, the building was added to the National Register of Historic Places. The structure was built in 1931 as the Fidelity National Bank & Trust Building (referred to locally as the Fidelity Building) at an estimated cost of $2.85 million, including bank fixtures. The site had previously been a two-story post office and federal building until 1904, when Fidelity purchased the site for its headquarters. The two-story building was razed in 1930. The new building mimicked the original federal twin-spire structure, in an Art Deco-Gothic Revival architectural motif. The building's architect — Hoit, Price & Barnes — also designed the nearby Power and Light Building in the Art Deco style. The bank was liquidated in 1933 during the Great Depression. On June 14, 1946, under the administration of then-U.S. President Harry S. Truman, the Federal Government acquired the building at a report price of $3.3 million. As a result, it was renamed the Federal Office Building. In 1954, the headquarters of the newly formed Severe Local Storms Warning Service of the United States Weather Bureau moved to the building from Washington, D.C.. A Radome for a weather radar was constructed between the towers on a steel skeleton rising above them, creating a landmark until 1995 when it was removed and the service relocated to Norman, Oklahoma, where it became the Storm Prediction Center.My Big Day - The Ruskin Outbreak by Joe Audsley - selskc.net - Retrieved December 30, 2007 Another distinctive landmark was the \\"town clock\\" in the north tower, which had first started keeping time in the original 1885 post office and was then placed in the tower. A bell cast by the McShane Bell Company of Baltimore, Maryland chimed in 1882. The clock face has since been removed and replaced by large windows for the highest residential living unit within five states. The bell was sold by the former owner in 2000 and was whisked away by helicopter in ignominious fashion. When the government left the building in 1995, Northland Management & Investment of Kansas City purchased it for $500,000. The building remained vacant until it was sold in 2000 to Simbol Commercial Inc. of Dallas sold it for $2 million. Following the September 11 attacks, the building was renamed from 911 Walnut to 909 Walnut. Simbol was said to have spent $64 million to convert this building and the 929 Walnut Building into 159 apartments and of commercial office space and to construct a 323-car public garage. The rooftop of the garage also includes a award-winning garden. The first four floors are occupied by Entertainment Properties Trust (NYSE:EPR).

The most usual origin is the forename Hawkin with an original genitival -s (that is, \\"Hawkin's son\\"), (or else it is Hawkin used as a surname with a later excrescent -s in the early modern period to bring it into line with the predominant style of hereditary surnames with such a genitival -s). It is one of many personal names with the diminutive Middle English suffix -kin (originally from Low German or Dutch) added to a single-syllable hypocoristic form (Robert > Hob > Hopkin, Walter > Wat > Watkin, William > Will > Wilkin, etc.). The Middle English personal name Haw is a rhyming fond form of Raw, that is, Ralph). Another possible origin is the place name Hawkinge (i.e. \\"Hawking\\"), near Folkestone, in Kent, England. (‘Hauekinge’ in 1204) ), based on Old English heafoc (hawk), or more likely this same word used as a personal name. A final 'ng' was (and is) simplified to 'n' in English generally; the final -s would be the excrescent -s added to the locative surname in the belief that it was the personal name Hawkin. In Ireland, Hawkins may be the result of Anglicising a native surname - it was used as a substitute for Ó hEacháin ‘descendant of Eachán' (= little Eachaidh, i.e. a pet form of the personal name Eachaidh meaning ‘horseman’), as it had a vague similarity in sound to the Irish name.

Hume was a steamer built at Gold Beach, Oregon in 1881, by R. D. Hume, a pioneer and early businessman in that area. Gold Beach was then called Ellensburg. The Hume had a long career, first hauling goods between Oregon and San Francisco, then as a whaler in Alaska, as a service vessel in the Alaskan cannery trade, then as a tugboat. She was retired in 1977 and returned to Gold Beach. In 1985 she sank in the Rogue River and has remained there ever since as a derelict vessel on the shoreline. The Hume is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Description The Mary D. Hume was built of local timber at Gold Beach. The keel, measuring by by long was described as the \\"largest stick of square timber ever floated down Rogue River.\\" The ship's knees were hand-cut from local Port Orford cedar roots. Planking was secured with wood pegs. The machinery was salvaged from the wrecked steamer Varuna. The Hume measured 150 tons, long by beam by draft. She was originally rigged as a schooner. History R. D. Hume was a pioneering businessman at Wedderburn and Gold Beach, then known as Ellensburg. By 1881, he had established a fish cannery and built Mary D. Hume, to support the cannery operation.Newell, Gordon R., ed., H.W. McCurdy Marine History of the Pacific Northwest, at page 147, Superior Publishing, Seattle, WA 1966 Mary D. Hume passed through several owners and a number of changes and reconstructions, and served as late as the 1970s, the oldest serving commercial vessel on the West Coast. The Mary D. Hume in 2009 The first eight years of the Hume's career were spent hauling cargo between San Francisco and Gold Beach. In 1889 the Hume was bought by the Pacific Steam Whaling Company, to be used to haul baleen from Arctic waters. She was re-rigged as a brigantine. Her first expedition spanned 1890-1892, catching 37 whales for a cargo worth $400,000. The second voyage lasted from 1893 tp 1899, with relief crews sent to Herschel, Canada. In 1900 the Hume became an Alaskan cannery tender for the Northwest Fisheries Company, receiving a new steam engine between 1900 and 1904. After sinking in ice in the Nushagak River she was repaired in Seattle. In either 1906 or 1908 she began work for the American Tug Boat Company of Everett, Washington towing logs and barges on Puget Sound. Her superstructure was altered at this time. A third new engine was installed in 1939, salvaged from the Columbia River lightship. In 1954 a 600 hp diesel engine was installed and the superstructure was altered to its present configuration. In 1973 the Hume was bought by the Crowley Maritime Corporation and was used as a tugboat. She was retired in 1977, and reconditioned by Crowley in 1978 prior to her return to Gold Beach. Current wreck An effort was organized to preserve Mary D. Hume as a museum ship, but a mechanical failure caused her to slide off the sling and into the mud at Gold Beach and an unrelated lawsuit over ownership of the vessel dissipated the funds of the Curry County Historical Society which had planned to restore the vessel. Even so, the Mary D. Hume is on the National Register of Historic Places, and her wreck can still be seen in Gold Beach. The Hume was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on August 1, 1979, when she was afloat and berthed on the Rogue River. Repairs started in 1985, but an accident led to her sinking. Efforts were made to survey and raise her, but there were no funds to make the effort. In 1992 the Hume's status on the National Register was reviewed. The review concluded that her hull still held significance and she was retained on the National Register.

His most famous action was the breaking of the boom during the battle of Vigo Bay in 1702. After retiring from active service, he became a Navy Commissioner and the governor of Greenwich Hospital. Early life and career Hopsonn was born in Shalfleet on the Isle of Wight, where he was baptised on 6 April 1643, the second son of Captain Anthony Hopson (d. 1667) and his wife Anne Kinge. According to local tradition, he was orphaned early in life and apprenticed to a tailor in Bonchurch, near Ventnor, before running off to sea. Samuel Smiles tells the tale thus in Self Help: > He was working as a tailor’s apprentice near Bonchurch, in the Isle of > Wight, when the news flew through the village that a squadron of men-of-war > was sailing off the island. He sprang from the shopboard, and ran down with > his comrades to the beach, to gaze upon the glorious sight. The boy was > suddenly inflamed with the ambition to be a sailor; and springing into a > boat, he rowed off to the squadron, gained the admiral’s ship, and was > accepted as a volunteer. According to John Knox Laughton in the Dictionary of National Biography, this colourful story \\"rests on no historical foundation.\\" However it happened, Hopsonn seems to have joined the navy by 1662, and was mentioned as a \\"particular friend\\" of Samuel Pepys' brother-in-law Balthazar St Michel in 1666. He was given his first commission, as second lieutenant of the , on the outbreak of the Third Anglo-Dutch War in 1672. He fought in the Battle of Solebay aboard this vessel, and in all the other battles of the war. On 10 December 1676, he was appointed first lieutenant on the , and sailed to the Mediterranean under Sir Roger Strickland. During this time, whilst in combat aboard a Barbary Corsair, he wrenched a nimcha from the hand of one of his assailants and ran him through with it. The sword remains in the collection of the National Maritime Museum. On 5 November 1677 he followed Strickland to the , and then to the on 10 December 1677. On 21 March 1678, vice admiral Herbert gave him his first command: the Tiger, which had been taken as a prize. Returning to Britain in 1679, he spent some time ashore, and had become an ensign in a foot company of the Portsmouth garrison by 1682. Captain On 10 January 1682 he was recalled to sea and given command of the . After serving initially on the coast of Ireland, his ship was part of the fleet led by George Legge to conduct the evacuation of Tangier. But, after returning home in this vessel in September 1684, he resumed his army career, becoming a Lieutenant in the 1st Foot Guards on 30 April 1685. He was finally given another naval command on 18 May 1688, when James II appointed him to the . This ship was part of the fleet sent to The Nore under Strickland to prevent the Dutch invasion. However, Hopsonn was one of the conspirators within the fleet who supported William of Orange in the Glorious Revolution. Following the revolution, Hopsonn retained command of the Bonaventure, and was part of the squadron that relieved the siege of Derry in June 1689. On 28 October 1689 he was posted to the , and commanded that vessel during the battle of Beachy Head the following year. Hopsonn's immediate commander in the battle was Sir George Rooke, who formed a high opinion of his gallantry and was afterwards much associated with him. He commanded for two months starting in August 1690, before moving to command the . It was aboard the latter that he followed Rooke in the battle of Barfleur on 19 May 1692. In the same year he was promoted to become a captain in the foot guards on the recommendation of admiral Edward Russell. Admiral In May 1693, he was made Rear Admiral of the Blue, and hoisted his flag aboard the . His first mission was as second-in-command to Rooke conducting a large convoy of merchantmen to Smyrna. The convoy was attacked and scattered by the French admiral Comte de Tourville at the Battle of Lagos, but no blame was attached to Hopsonn in the subsequent inquiry. He was promoted to Vice Admiral of the Blue and sailed for the Mediterranean under Sir Francis Wheler with the as his flagship. In February 1694 he sailed home, conducting a convoy of nearly a hundred ships from Cadiz to England without incident. He spent the next two years in the Channel and off Dunkirk, attempting to trap the French privateer Jean Bart. In 1696 he gave up his commission in the Foot Guards, and in 1698 he was elected, thanks to the influence of Lord Cutts, to the rotten borough of Newtown on the Isle of Wight. He would represent the constituency until 1705. He spent 1699 off the coasts of Ireland and France, with his flag aboard the , in 1700 he went to the Baltic with Rooke to encourage Denmark to withdraw from the Great Northern War. The following summer, his squadron transported troops from Ireland to the Netherlands. Painting of the Battle of Vigo Bay by Ludolf Bakhuizen In 1702, Hopsonn was once more under the command of Sir George Rooke, as part of the fleet detailed to capture Cádiz. After a month of operations the attack came to nothing, but on the way home Rooke learned of the Spanish treasure fleet lying in Vigo Bay in Northern Spain. The ships were protected by a boom formed of ship's masts chained together overlooked by forts, together with French warships commanded by the Marquis de Châteaurenault. Hopsonn was chosen to lead the attack aboard his flagship the . In the early hours of 23 October 1702, Hopsonn crashed through the boom whilst under a heavy fire. A merchantman hastily repurposed as a fire ship was laid alongside Torbay, but she had not been unloaded of her cargo of snuff, which was thrown into the air when the ship exploded and partly extinguished the flames. The remainder of the fleet followed Hopsonn into the harbour and the Franco-Spanish fleet were heavily defeated. The French and Spanish lost 34 ships, and much silver and other cargo.\\" On returning to England, Hopsonn was knighted by Queen Anne for his actions at Vigo Bay and retired from active service. He was made an Extra Commissioner of the Navy and served as governor of Greenwich Hospital from 1704 to 1708. He retired to Weybridge in Surrey, where he built a house called Vigo House (demolished in 1928 to make way for a hospital). Hopson died there on 12 October 1717. Marriage and family Hopsonn married Elizabeth Timbrell (1660–1740), the daughter of John Timbrell and Ann Benett of Portsmouth, on 1 June 1680 at Brading on the Isle of Wight.

The concept is named after Hans Fitting, due to his investigations of nilpotent normal subgroups.  Definition  A Fitting chain' (or Fitting series or ') for a group is a subnormal series with nilpotent quotients. In other words, a finite sequence of subgroups including both the whole group and the trivial group, such that each is a normal subgroup of the previous one, and such that the quotients of successive terms are nilpotent groups. The Fitting length or nilpotent length of a group is defined to be the smallest possible length of a Fitting chain, if one exists. Upper and lower Fitting series Just as the upper central series and lower central series are extremal among central series, there are analogous series extremal among nilpotent series. For a finite group H, the Fitting subgroup Fit(H) is the maximal normal nilpotent subgroup, while the minimal subgroup such that the quotient by it is nilpotent is γ∞(H), the intersection of the (finite) lower central series, which is called the nilpotent residual. These correspond to the center and the commutator subgroup (for upper and lower central series, respectively). These do not hold for infinite groups, so for the sequel, assume all groups to be finite. The upper Fitting series of a finite group is the sequence of characteristic subgroups Fitn(G) defined by Fit0(G) = 1, and Fitn+1(G)/Fitn(G) = Fit(G/Fitn(G)). It is an ascending nilpotent series, at each step taking the maximal possible subgroup. The lower Fitting series of a finite group G is the sequence of characteristic subgroups Fn(G) defined by F0(G) = G, and Fn+1(G) = γ∞(Fn(G)). It is a descending nilpotent series, at each step taking the minimal possible subgroup.  Examples  * A group has Fitting length 1 if and only if it is nilpotent. * The symmetric group on three points has Fitting length 2. * The symmetric group on four points has Fitting length 3. * The symmetric group on five or more points has no Fitting chain at all, not being solvable. * The iterated wreath product of n copies of the symmetric group on three points has Fitting length 2n.  Properties  * A group has a Fitting chain if and only if it is solvable. * The lower Fitting series is a Fitting chain if and only if it eventually reaches the trivial subgroup, if and only if G is solvable. * The upper Fitting series is a Fitting chain if and only if it eventually reaches the whole group, G, if and only if G is solvable. * The lower Fitting series descends most quickly amongst all Fitting chains, and the upper Fitting series ascends most quickly amongst all Fitting chains. Explicitly: For every Fitting chain, 1 = H0 ⊲ H1 ⊲ … ⊲ Hn = G, one has that Hi ≤ Fiti(G), and Fi(G) ≤ Hn−i. * For a solvable group, the length of the lower Fitting series is equal to length of the upper Fitting series, and this common length is the Fitting length of the group. More information can be found in . Connection between central series and Fitting series Combining the lower Fitting series and lower central series on a solvable group yields a series with coarse and fine divisions, like the coarse and fine marks on a ruler. What central series do for nilpotent groups, Fitting series do for solvable groups. A group has a central series if and only if it is nilpotent, and a Fitting series if and only if it is solvable. Given a solvable group, the lower Fitting series is a \\"coarser\\" division than the lower central series: the lower Fitting series gives a series for the whole group, while the lower central series descends only from the whole group to the first term of the Fitting series. The lower Fitting series proceeds: :G = F0 ⊵ F1 ⊵ ⋯ ⊵ 1, while the lower central series subdivides the first step, :G = G1 ⊵ G2 ⊵ ⋯ ⊵ F1, and is a lift of the lower central series for the first quotient F0/F1, which is nilpotent. Proceeding in this way (lifting the lower central series for each quotient of the Fitting series) yields a subnormal series: :G = G1 ⊵ G2 ⊵ ⋯ ⊵ F1 = F1,1 ⊵ F1,2 ⊵ ⋯ ⊵ F2 = F2,1 ⊵ ⋯ ⊵ Fn = 1, like the coarse and fine divisions on a ruler. The successive quotients are abelian, showing the equivalence between being solvable and having a Fitting series.

Artists, locals and students together founded a co-operative of non- profit clubs or associations, Fabriktheater (theatre), Filmrauschpalast e. V. (cinema), Slaughterhouse e. V. (concerts) and Kunsthalle Moabit e. V. (art, this latter one existed until 1996). Kulturfabrik Lehrter Str. 35 e. V. or short Kulturfabrik Moabit serves not only as the governing body of the entire site and an umbrella organization for its composite associations, it also runs an own program of events.  Activities  The Kulturfabrik Moabit features as associate members, the Slaughterhouse club , a live concert and party venue preferably for rock, punk, SKA, gothic and wave music, the Fabriktheater club, an off mainstream playhouse and concert hall mainly for jazz and folk artists, the Filmrauschpalast club , an art house movie theater which also runs an Open Air program in Summer in the backyard and a café or pub which operates also as an art gallery on a regular basis and runs a monthly tabletop soccer tournament. Besides the club Kulturfabrik Moabit also provides social and family work by way of offering childcare on the neighboring playground and a scheduled sports, arts and play courses and annual festivities. Also the Kulturfabrik Moabit runs a program on its own account such as the annual Lange Nacht des Tauchens (The Long Night of Diving), the Sommerfest (Summer Fest), Kneipengolf (pub golf tournament) and takes part in the community's Fête de la Musique .

It served as a revision of the Recruiting Act 1778. It raised the bounty £3, 3s. After the expiration of their service, volunteers were exempt from the performance of statue (highway) duty, for service as parish officers, and from service in the army, navy, or militia.

It enlarged those subject to impressment beyond smugglers and \\"all able-bodied and disorderly persons\\" to include those \\"convicted of running away from and leaving their families chargeable upon the parish\\". The chief advantage of this Act was in the number of volunteers brought in under the apprehension of impressment. The Act received royal assent on 9 February 1779.

A fast style in 2/4 time, and often associated with the pre–World War II era, polka remains a dynamic \\"niche\\" music in America. Description Several polka genres exist in the United States, each with its own unique characteristics and performers. Though these polka genres vary, all are unified in the expression of ethnicity by performers and participants. Polka enthusiasts gather to enjoy their love of the music and dance and to honor their heritage at polka festivals. Modern media enables these fans to stay connected and share their passion. Though it passed its heyday in the 1950sGreene, Victor, A Passion for Polka. Berkeley and Los Angeles, CA: University of California Press, 1992. the polka remains an active music form with distinct genres, leading performers, and active organizations. Where it is popular, the polka is a manifestation of the culture of those who participate in it. It is the state dance of Wisconsin.Wisconsin Blue Book, 2009-2010 Polka genres Although author Charles Keil admits that \\"there are as many styles of polka as there are polka localities\\",Keil, Charles, Deeper Polka, Ethnomusicology Forum 14.1 (2005): 118-120 he and his wife have divided American polka music into three major genres: # Slavic, with its subgenres, Polish-American, Czech- American, and Slovenian-American # Germanic, with its subgenres, German- American # Southwestern, with its subgenres, Mexican-American and Papago- PimaKeil Charles, Polka Happiness, Philadelphia, PA: Temple University Press, 1992. The two Slavic genres are found in eastern and midwestern America, the Germanic genres in midwestern and western America, and the Southwestern genres in southwestern America. The different genres are united by the characteristic 2/4 time signature that exists in all polkas as well as by instruments and lyrics that are similar throughout all styles. Polka bands across all genres typically include an accordion or concertina, wind instruments, and drums. The lyrics sung by these bands are united by their discussion of joy, religion, and ethnic culture.Jackson, David, Just Another Day in a New Polonia: Contemporary Polish-American Polka Music, Popular Music and Society 26.4 (2003): 529-540 Differences stem from variations in instrumentation, tempo, and the popularity of the genre in various places. =Polish-American= The Polish-American style of polka is perhaps the most popular today.Bessman, Jim, Monarchs of the U.S. Polka Mainstream, Billboard 108.31 (1996): 1, 110-112 Polish Polka bands do not only play polkas, but also play obereks, waltzes, and sometimes tangos. In fact, the \\"Polish polka\\" as we know it was never danced in Poland. Rather, different forms of polka existed in Polish folk dancing. This popularity is due in part to the fact that performers in this genre have worked to appeal to a larger audience by adding covers of modern music alongside normal polkas in their albums and performances. For example, the polka band Toledo Polka Motion includes a cover of the Beatles' \\"I'm a Loser\\" along with traditional pieces such as \\"Pod Krakowem\\" on one of their albums. Polka star Jimmy Sturr has even included recordings with stars such as Willie Nelson to get the country music audience interested in polka. The hotspots for Polish-American polka are mostly in cities near the Great Lakes (especially Chicago) and some East Coast cities.March, Richard, Review: Slovenian- and Polish-American \\"Polka\\" Music, The Journal of American Folklore 102.403 (1989): 81-85 Polish-American polka can be subdivided into Chicago- style and Eastern-style. The typical Chicago-style polka band includes one or two trumpets, an accordion, a concertina, drums, a bass, and sometimes a clarinet, saxophone, or fiddle. This style is connected to the '50s rock-and- roll era and is sometimes referred to as \\"push\\" style because of the intense \\"bellow-shaking\\" of the accordion. A secondary style of Chicago-style polka music is referred to as \\"honky\\" style; this consists of a trumpet, clarinet (doubling on saxophone), concertina or accordion, upright bass (or bass guitar), & drums. It is performed in a dixieland style, and sung primarily in the Polish language. Most polka artists add a piano on recordings for embellishment. The modern giants of Chicago-style are Lenny Gomulka and the late Eddie Blazonczyk. Both were highly influenced by the style of Li'l Wally Jagiello, a polka performer of an earlier generation. Another influential early pioneer of Chicago-style polkas was Marion Lush who has been called the \\"Golden Voice\\" of polkas due to his distinctive vocal stylings. (Lush died in 1993.) Blazonczyk was the leader of a band called the Versatones, who released over 50 albums. (Blazonczyk died in 2012.) Gomulka was a member of the Versatones until 1980 when he formed his own band, the Chicago Push.Bessman, Jim. \\"Chicago Push Forges 'Irresistible' Polka.\\" Billboard 108.37 (1996): 12 Some other popular modern Chicago-style polka bands include Crusade, the Polka Family, the Dynatones, and Toledo Polka Motion. In important venue for live performances of polka music was Club 505 at 13505 S Brainard Ave in the Hegewisch neighborhood on the Southeast side of Chicago. A live broadcast from Club 505 from 1959 can be heard on YouTube. Eastern-style polka is similar to Chicago style but is played at a faster tempo, usually includes a bigger section of horns and reeds, and is connected to big-band era music rather than rock-and-roll. The most popular Eastern-style performer (and probably the most popular polka artist in America today) is Jimmy Sturr, winner of 15 Grammy Awards in the polka category.Meredith, Bill, Jimmy Knows Polka, Jazziz 23.6 (2006): 48 Other important Eastern-style performers include Frank Wojnarowski, Bernie Witkowski, Walt Solek, Larry Chesky, Ray Henry, and the Connecticut Twins. =Slovenian-American= The Slovenian style or Cleveland style is generally played at a smoother tempo and features different instrumentation. Whereas the Polish style utilizes trumpets and concertinas, the main melody instruments in the Slovenian band are the accordion and tenor saxophone. A diatonic accordion or \\"button box\\" is sometimes used instead of the piano accordion or chromatic accordion and offers a different sound. The Slovenian style also adds a banjo or guitar to bolster the rhythm section (most commonly banjo for polkas and guitar for waltzes). The epicenter of the Slovenian- American style of polka is undoubtedly Cleveland and northeast Ohio, but it is also popular in Pennsylvania and in many other cities in the Great Lakes region. The most influential figure in Slovenian-American polka is Frankie Yankovic, who helped \\"Americanize\\" the Slovenian polka and worked for years to popularize it, appearing throughout the country and even performing on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson. He was crowned America's Polka King in Milwaukee in 1948. Other important Slovenian-style pioneers include Johnny Pecon, Lou Trebar, Johnny Vadnal (along with brothers Tony, Frankie, and Richie), Kenny Bass, Louis Bashel and Eddie Habat. The torchbearers of Slovenian-American or \\"Cleveland-Style\\" polka today include Jeff Pecon (Johnny's son), Joey Tomsick, Don Wojtila, Eddie Rodick, Eddie Klancnik, LynnMarie Hrovat and Alex Meixner. Like their Polish counterparts, these bands have also expanded their repertoire over the years to include a variety of styles of music including polkas, waltzes, American standards, Latin dances (cha chas, tangos, etc.), line dances, and rock 'n roll. =German-American= German-American bands resist being termed \\"polka bands\\" because they perform not only polkas but also waltzes, schottisches, laendlers, and various other ethnic forms of music.Leary, James, Review: Czech- and German-American \\"Polka\\" Music, The Journal of American Folklore 101.401 (1988): 339-345 Some of the Modern day German-American bands have even been known to incorporate Country & Western and/or Rock & Roll into their repertoire. They prefer the term \\"old- time.\\" Their style is also sometimes known as \\"Dutchmen,\\" a name derived from a band named The Six Fat Dutchmen. This is a contrast to Polish-American and Slovenian-American bands, which generally do not object to the term \\"polka band\\". German-American bands are also comparatively more traditional than the Slavic genres, with less modern American influence in their albums. Because of this, their recordings are much rarer and harder to come by than recordings of Slavic-style performers. The German-American sound is often described with the term \\"oom-pa-pa\\" and is characterized by an emphasis on brass (especially the tuba), accompanied by drums and reed instruments (including the accordion or concertina, although for the most part the concertina is usually favored over the accordion in German-American bands). German-American style bands perform primarily in the so-called \\"polka belt\\" of North and South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas.deHilster, Addie, Polka in the Plains, South Central Music Bulletin 2.2 (2004): 8-12 One important German-American performer is Lawrence Welk, who began his career as a band leader in South Dakota with an ethnic German-style ensemble called Welk's Novelty Orchestra. He later added more popular music to his band's repertoire, which enabled him to spread the polka throughout America by way of his famous television show. Other important modern German-American bands include the Hoolerie Dutchmen, the Jolly Swiss Boys, Happy Hans,http://www.happyhansmusic.com/ and the Jerry Schneider Band. =Czech-American= Czech-American style polka is similar to German-American style in many ways. Its performers call their bands \\"old- time,\\" use the same brass-heavy instrumentation, and are popular in the same \\"polka belt.\\" Czech-American bands tend to be even more traditional than German-American bands, playing numerous authentic Czech pieces (polkas, waltzes, and schottisches). Another unique aspect of many Czech bands is their family structure. Some Czech bands perpetuate a family structure through several generations. An example is the Masopust Polka Band,Masopust Polka Band Website which was started by the Masopust family in the late nineteenth century and still plays today. Important Czech performers include the Harold Schultz Orchestra, the Greiner Brothers Orchestra, the Capital City Czech Choraliers of Nebraska, the Czechlanders Orchestra of Nebraska, Ernie Kucera, and Al Grebnik. =Mexican-American= Not as obviously related to the polka as the four genres above, Mexican-American polka is called \\"conjunto\\". The conjunto sound originated from the Czech and German influence on Mexican- Americans in Texas and northern Mexico. Conjunto bands play some polkas, but their most popular musical form is the ranchera, a form similar to polka. The instrumentation involves a combination of accordion, bajo sexto (a Mexican twelve-string guitar), bass, and drums. Important modern performers in the genre include Los Hermanos Bernal, Santiago Jimenez, Flaco Jimenez, Esteban Jordan, Valerio Longoria, and Tony De La Rosa among many others. =Papago- Pima= Papago-Pima style is more commonly referred to as \\"chicken scratch\\" and is associated with the Native American Tohono O'odham tribe (who were once the Papago). This tribe was influenced by the music of the Germans who settled in southern Arizona, the most popular area for this genre. Papago-Pima performers use a saxophone, accordion, guitar, electric bass, and drums in their performances and commonly perform music that follows the form of the schottische (a dance with the same cultural origins as polka).Sturman, Janet, Borderlands: From Conjunto to Chicken Scratch. Music from the Rio Grande Valley of Texas and Southern Arizona, Yearbook for Traditional Music, 27 (1995): 194-197 The most important modern performers in this genre are Southern Scratch, the Joaquin Brothers, Papago Raiders, the Molinas, and T.O. Brave. =Other genres= While Keil's six genres cover the majority of polka performers, other polka bands combine these genres or exist outside of them altogether. Brave Combo is one important modern group that plays a combination of these three genres with a very modern edge. Started in 1979 by Carl Finch, this band is the ultimate in appealing to a wider, younger audience. In addition to accordion, tuba, woodwinds, drum, and trumpet, the instrumentation of the band includes guitar, electric horn, and harmonica. According to Finch, the genre of the band has \\"no restrictions.\\" They play everything from Polish- style to rancheras to Greek music. To appeal to younger audiences, the band uses album covers that make the band look like a rock group and edgy album titles such as Kick Ass Polkas.White, Timothy, Brave Combo's Kick-Ass Bohemianism, Billboard 113.34 (2001): 3 Their music is popular enough in the polka world that their 1999 album, Polkasonic, won a Grammy in the polka category. Brave Combo is an example of the way some polka bands have tried to break free of the restrictions of genre and adapt to modern culture. Polka organizations From tiny ethnic dance halls to larger-scale national organizations, there is a huge network of people working to keep the polka alive. One Web site lists a total of 49 formal polka clubs nationwide, and there are many other smaller organizations . The largest organizations today include the International Polka Association (IPA), the United States Polka Association, the Polka Lovers Klub of America (Po.L.K. of A.), the National Cleveland-Style Polka Hall of Fame, the Penn-Ohio Polka Pals, and the Wisconsin Polka Boosters. Modern communication has also allowed polka fans to organize through national newsletters such as the Polish-American Journal, and the Post Eagle. Polka news is even available online at Polonia Today. Radio stations have been organized to perpetuate the popularity of the polka. (although nowadays, most polka shows have been limited to airing on independent & time-brokered AM stations, small-market college FM stations, and a handful of Internet only polka stations.) One survey conducted in 1989 counted a total of 354 stations that played polka music in 32 states. (By September 2012, that number had dropped to 221 stations in 27 states.) Another triumph for the polka community came in 1985 when the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences formed a polka category so that polka artists could be recognized at the Grammy Awards ceremony. =The International Polka Association= The longest-standing polka organization is the Chicago-based International Polka Association (IPA). Beginning as an \\"International Polka Convention\\" in the mid-1960s, the IPA was officially established in 1968 with Leon Kozicki as the \\"organization builder\\" and John Hyzny as the \\"entrepreneur\\". According to its charter, its goals are \\"to promote, maintain, and advance public interest in polka entertainment\\". Today, the IPA still carries out yearly conventions every summer to allow polka fans to gather and to present the annual Polka Music Awards. The IPA established its Polka Music Hall of Fame in 1968 to honor worthy performers. In 1982, a museum was established, now located above Polonia Banquets, a century-old dance hall at 4608 S. Archer Ave. in the Brighton Park neighborhood, and open by appointment. Polka festivals Throughout the United States (and especially through the so-called \\"polka belt\\"), polka fans gather to participate in polka festivals. Many of these festivals are arranged by organizations such as the IPA and the United States Polka Association. Others, such as Polish-style performer Eddie Blazoncyzk's \\"Polka Fireworks\\" festival in Pittsburgh, are run by polka stars or polka fans.Horak, Terri, Festivals Drawing Growing Fan Base, Billboard 108.31 (1996): 1, 111 These festivals usually last several days and involve performances, dancing, jam sessions, beer, ethnic food, athletic events, parades, and polka masses. Though many festival attendees belong to an older generation, there are also a substantial number of young participants. Polka music and polka festivals are often described as \\"happy\\" and \\"joyful\\" by their organizers and participants. In their book Polka Happiness, Charles and Angeliki Keil describe the aspects of these \\"polka parties\\" that allow them to bring joy to people of all ages. A wide variety of people are accepted and people are encouraged to dance with many different partners. The musicians dance as well as perform. The live bands perform a variety of more modern music as well as traditional polkas. Participants drink enough to get \\"silly or happy,\\" but not enough to get drunk. The Nebraska Czechs of Wilber (P.O. Box 652 Wilber, Nebraska 68465) have sponsored the annual Wilber Czech Days Festival since 1962. The Czech Festival includes music, dancing, museum, costumes, refreshments, a pageant and large parades on Saturday and Sunday of the festival. The Nebraska Czechs of Wilber organization was formed in 1962 to perpetuate the Czech heritage and culture, develop tourism and to boost the economy of Wilber. On July 17th, 1963, Wilber was proclaimed ‘Czech Capital of Nebraska.’ On July 10th, 1987, Wilber was proclaimed, ‘Czech Capital of the U.S.A.’ The festival is always held the first full weekend of August. http://www.nebraskaczechsofwilber.com/czech-days/ Other Polka Festivals include, the United States Polka Association Convention, The Annual Minnesota State Polka Festival, Milwaukee Polish Fest, International Polka Association Convention, Pulaski Polka Days, New Glarus Polkafest, Wisconsin Dells Polish Fest, Frankenmuth Summer Music Fest, Oregon's Alpenfest Swiss-Bavarian festival, Polkamotion by the Ocean, Houghton Lake Polka Festival, SloveneFest, the Slovenian Sausage Festival, the Super Button Box Bash, Dyngus Day Cleveland, and the Thanksgiving Polka Weekend hosted by the National Cleveland-Style Polka Hall of Fame. Polka masses Beginning in the early 1970s, the phenomenon of \\"polka masses\\" began appearing. Polka masses are usually held by members of the Roman Catholic Church who consider the polka an important part of their ethnic heritages. The first polka mass was created by Father George Balasko in 1972 and the idea was spread by Father Frank Perkovich throughout the '70s and '80s.Walser, Robert, The Polka Mass: Music of Postmodern Ethnicity, American Music 10.2 (1992): 183-202 Both were polka musicians. In composing a polka mass, a musician either alters the lyrics of polka pieces to become more appropriate for a spiritual setting or creates an entirely new piece of polka-style music to sing with the usual sacred text. Robert Walser argues that the exuberant polka music motivates participants to \\"worship more vigorously.\\" He also asserts that the polka mass \\"brings the community into the church\\" because it involves music and lyrics that the congregations are more familiar with. Polka music as an expression of culture Polka music is obviously associated with various ethnic groups throughout America. This is evident in the division of the polka genres into specific ethnic styles. Dr. Ann Hetzel Gunkel describes the polka as a means of protecting ethnic heritage from the invasion of \\"American mass culture.\\" She even argues that polka music can be perceived as a \\"radical alternative\\" to \\"mainstream culture\\".Gunkel, Ann, The Polka Alternative: Polka as Counterhegemonic Ethnic Practice, Popular Music and Society 27.4 (2004): 407-427 A good example of this is the polka mass. It allows entire communities to choose an alternate approach to worship that helps them preserve their ethnic origins. Another example of a resistance to mass culture is the status of polka stars. Popular polka performers are not viewed as sex symbols or idolized in the same way that pop stars of today are idolized. Instead, the performers work to establish a feeling of community by interacting and dancing with their audience. This expression of ethnicity is especially important as America continues to homogenize through media and the culture of capitalism. Sheltered communities that were once saturated with culture are forced to join modern American culture. Keeping the polka alive allows these communities to establish a tangible aspect of their culture that can be maintained amidst the changes American society faces. Charles Keil describes the paradox that \\"polka is a modern urban style that enables traditional cultures to persist\\". Polka enthusiasts have to mediate between the desire to preserve their culture and the desire to keep the polka alive through future generations. This involves establishing a balance between traditionalism and modernism. An example of this conflict is the language polka music is performed in. Performers have to face the decision of performing and recording in Polish to appease those who prefer a more traditional approach and performing and recording in English to attract a wider, younger audience. English has become more and more popular, but many performers still learn several pieces with Polish lyrics. Another example of performer response to this conflict is the practice of performing and recording covers of popular non-polka music along with traditional polka music. The problem of attracting a broader audience while still preserving cultural heritage is an ongoing challenge in the polka world. The demographic for polka music in the USA currently consists primarily of married men and women between the ages of 60-85 with a median age of 74.  The future of polka music and dance Though many would agree with expert Richard March that the efforts of polka artists to reach a broader audience are \\"doomed,\\" the polka still has a strong base of enthusiastic supporters.

He studied for several months at Sarrebourg and Phalsbourg (Pfalzburg) and at the age of seventeen had completed his Classical studies. He taught for three years at the college of Phalsbourg; entered in 1810 the ecclesiastical seminary at Nancy; and was ordained priest in 1812. Appointed assistant priest at Insming, he was transferred after six months to Lunéville. A mission which he preached in 1821 at Flavigny led to the organization of a diocesan mission band. Several years later he became a member of the Congregation of St. Peter founded by Félicité and Jean-Marie de Lamennais, and from 1827 to 1835 directed the philosophical and theological studies of young ecclesiastics who wished to become the assistants of the two brothers in their religious undertakings. When Felicite de La Mennais refused to submit to the condemnation pronounced against him by Rome, Rohrbacher separated from him and became professor of Church history at the ecclesiastical seminary of Nancy. Later he retired to Paris where he spent the last years of his life. His principal work is his monumental Histoire Universelle de l'Église Catholique (Nancy, 1842–49; 2nd ed., Paris, 1849–53). Several other editions were subsequently published and continuations added by Chantrel and Guillaume. Written from an apologetic point of view, the work contributed to the extirpation of Gallicanism in the Church of France. It was translated into German and partially recast by Hülskamp, Rump, and numerous other writers. (For the other works of Rohrbacher, see Hurter, Nomenclator Lit., III [Innsbruck, 1895], 1069-71.)

This is only possible when the aircraft is flown at the pivotal altitude corresponding to the current groundspeed.

However, the pivotal altitude varies only with the ground speed and not with the radius of turn or the angle of bank.

The camp was also the manufacturing site of Allach porcelain and German Dress uniform Swords and daggers. Allach remained open from March 1943 through its liberation on April 22, 1945, by the US Army. The porcelain factory Porzellan Manufaktur Allach was established as a private concern in 1935 in the small town of Allach, near Munich, Germany. In 1936 the factory was acquired by the SS. Heinrich Himmler saw the acquisition of a fine porcelain factory as a way to establish an industrial base for the production of works of art that would represent, in Himmler's eyes, true Germanic culture. Allach porcelain was one of Himmler’s favorite projects and produced various figurines (soldiers, animals, etc.) to compete in the small but profitable German porcelain market. High-ranking artists were locked into contract. The program of the factory included over 240 porcelain and ceramic models. As output at the Allach factory increased, the Nazis moved production to a new facility near the Dachau concentration camp. The foundry at the Allach camp was run by a school professor from the nearby town. Two of his students were on hand assisting him with the manufacture of the swords and daggers. The produced work typically had the entwined Sig Runes which was an SS proof mark that can also be seen on Allach porcelain.Johnson, Thomas M., Collecting Edged Weapons of the Third Reich, Volume 1-4, 1993 Camp population Last existing buildings of subcamp Allach of Nazi concentration camp Dachau, location Munich, Granatstraße 8 + 10The camp divided Jews from non-Jews as well as men from women. The number of prisoners varied at different points in time. Approximately 3,000–4,000 men, with many more as Allach became an end point for many death marches and transports from other concentration camps. The women's camp was much smaller at 200–300 persons. Prisoner population in the Non-Jewish camp was mainly French, Russians, Poles, Czechs and Dutch, as well as victims of racial persecution and German opponents of the regime. Slave labor It was the first of seven sub-camps to supply the BMW armament factory with slave laborers, where airplane engines were produced and repaired. Starting from 1941 German civilians and about 50 prisoners of the Allach subcamp of the Dachau concentration camp were employed with production of art and porcelain. the Allach subcamp of Dachau remained the main location for fine porcelain manufacture even after the original factory in the town of Allach was modernized and reopened. The factory in the town of Allach was instead retrofitted for the production of ceramic products such as household pottery. The fall of the Third Reich brought an end to the Allach concern. The Allach factories were shut down in 1945 and never reopened.Allach Porcelain Liberation US soldiers of the 42nd Rainbow Division entered the camp at around 9 o'clock on the morning of April 30, 1945, one day after the main camp at Dachau was liberated. The 66th Field Hospital, attached to the 42nd Division of the US Seventh Army, was brought to Allach to take care of the sick prisoners. By May 10, they had moved on to help with the typhus epidemic in the main camp.

The first, The Gallery (1947), is his best known work, was very well received when published, and has been reissued several times. Biography Burns was born in 1916 in Andover, Massachusetts. He was the eldest of seven children in an upper-middle-class Irish Catholic family. He was educated by the Sisters of Notre Dame at St. Augustine's School and then Phillips Academy, where he pursued music. He attended Harvard, where he became fluent in French, German, and Italian and wrote the book for a student musical comedy in 1936. In 1937 he graduated Phi Beta Kappa with a BA in English magna cum laude and became a teacher at the Loomis School in Windsor, Connecticut. Burns wrote several novels while at Harvard and at Loomis, none of which he published. He was drafted into the US Army as a private in 1942. He attended the Adjutant General's School in Washington, D.C. Commissioned a second lieutenant and sent overseas in 1943, he served in military intelligence in Casablanca and Algiers and then for a year and a half in Italy, censoring prisoner-of-war mail. After his discharge in 1946 he returned to teaching at Loomis. At Loomis, he completed The Gallery, his best-known work by far, on April 23, 1946. Several publishers rejected it before Harper & Brothers published it in June 1947 and it became a best-seller. It depicted life in Allied-occupied North Africa and Naples in 1944 from the perspective of several different characters. Without sentimentality, Burns explored the average man's resentment of the military, his struggle to assert his individuality within the complex war effort, the tension between officers and enlisted men, the psychological effects of dislocation, economic and social inequality between the Americans and those they defeated, the experience of homosexual military personnel, and the popular life of Naples in 1944 under the Allied occupation. The title referred to the Galleria Umberto I, a shopping arcade in Naples through which all of the main characters pass. The work was unconventional in structure, comprising portraits of nine characters interspersed with eight recollections narrated by an anonymous American soldier following a route much like the one Burns tracked. Though the book is largely a series of sad and painful vignettes, Burns's narrator manages a modestly positive assessment near the end: \\"I began to think that something good might be salvaged from the abattoir of the world. Though in the main all national decency and sense of duty might be dead, I saw much individual goodness and loveliness that reassured me.\\" In the words of Paul Fussell, \\"Burns relied on discontinuity, like a sort of prose T.S. Eliot, thus suggesting incoherence as a contemporary social characteristic.\\"Paul Fussell, \\"Introduction,\\" in John Horne Burns, The Gallery (New York Review of Books, 2004), ix Major newspapers and authors including Ernest Hemingway and Edmund Wilson praised it. The Saturday Review called the novel \\"the best war book of the year\\". John Dos Passos wrote: A 1949 survey of the literature of World War II in Military Affairs credited Burns for the novel's \\"psychological study of rear echelon service personnel\\" and for capturing their speech, faulting only his attempt to depict infantry combat. Charles Poore in the New York Times thought Burns \\"has a great deal on the ball and he'll do even better when he gets it more under control.\\" He called it \\"a rancorously vivid portrait\\" of \\"the mentally and morally lost\\" and noted that \\"some of its gamier passages show that you can say practically anything in a novel now.\\" Time magazine mentioned that the novel depicted \\"an evening spent in a homosexuals' hangout\\", an entire chapter other reviewers left unmentioned. Gore Vidal later reported a conversation he had with Burns following The Gallery's success: A decade later, surveying the American abroad as a literary type, Frederic Morton noted how the post-World War II role of conqueror proved so uncomfortable that \\"with the possible exception of John Horne Burns' The Gallery, no really distinguished novel has recorded it.\\" By 1991 it had become, in Herbert Mitgang's words, \\"that forgotten gem of a novel\\". In 2011 William Zinsser described it as \\"the proto-Vietnam novel, anticipating by a generation the hubris that 'the ugly American' would bring to another foreign land\\" by asking \\"who was more degraded: the Italians hustling to feed their families, or the GIs selling their cheaply bought PX goods at a huge profit?\\" Now sought for his own views on literature, Burns authored an occasional appreciative review, but became well known for unmeasured critiques of other writers, both peers and luminaries, including James Michener, Thomas Wolfe, and Somerset Maugham. His second novel, Lucifer with a Book, a satirical representation of life at a boarding school much like Loomis, appeared in 1949 to largely unfavorable reviews. Vidal said it was \\"perhaps the most savagely attacked book of its day.\\" Michener wrote decades later: \\"Never in my memory had they come so close to total annihilation of an author's work.\\" Disheartened by the critical reception of his second novel, Burns returned to Italy in 1950, this time choosing Florence. There he wrote his last published work, A Cry of Children (1952), which was marketed as \\"a merciless novel\\" of \\"young love in the bohemian fringe-world\\". Its principal character was a composer and pianist likely modeled on his Harvard classmate Irving Fine. That novel also received negative press, though he remained still a young writer of promise. One critic wrote in the New York Times: He began work on a fourth novel, left unfinished at his death. He supported himself by writing a long piece about the city for Holiday, one of a series he was writing for that publication on the places where he had lived, and the effort that convinced his editors they could still hope for another successful novel from him. In his time in Florence, he was known to drink to excess and complain of critics, rivals, and both friends and enemies. Vidal never saw him there: \\"In those years one tried not to think of Burns; it was too bitter. The best of us all had taken the worst way.\\" After a sailing trip, he lapsed into a coma and died from a cerebral hemorrhage on August 11, 1953. His parents and six siblings survived him. He was buried in the family plot in Holyhood Cemetery in Brookline, Massachusetts. Hemingway later sketched Burns' brief life as a writer: \\"There was a fellow who wrote a fine book and then a stinking book about a prep school and then just blew himself up.\\" In 1959-1960, a plan for a film in the Italian neorealist mode based on The Gallery was postponed when the participants argued about the negative depiction of both the Neapolitans and Americans. Some of Burns's papers, including student works and unpublished manuscripts, are held at the Howard Gotlieb Archival Research Center, Boston University. One chapter of The Gallery, \\"Queen Penicillin\\", has been included in collections of short stories, such as The Best Short Stories of World War II, An American Anthology (1957) and American Men at Arms (1964). Another chapter, the narrator's first assessment of the Americans' treatment of the Neapolitans, was included in The Vintage Book of War Fiction (1999).

After a career in civil aviation, he returned to service in World War II. Early life Born in Vernon, British Columbia, McCall came to Calgary with his family in 1906. In February 1916 McCall enlisted with the 175th Battalion of the Canadian Expeditionary Force (CEF). Eight months later, he was in France with this battalion as a sergeant. McCall expressed interest in transferring from the army to the RAF and received a commission as a lieutenant pilot trainee in March 1917. In December was assigned to No. XIII Squadron RAF on the Western Front, flying the two seater Royal Aircraft Factory R.E.8 reconnaissance aircraft with F.C. Farrington. Aerial service in World War I McCall's first aerial victory occurred while flying the R.E.8, shooting down a German aircraft. McCall was awarded the Military Cross \\"for conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty\\", and two weeks later the accompanying Bar for downing an enemy scout aircraft while on a mission to take photographs. After his third victory while flying the R.E.8, McCall was next transferred to No. 41 Squadron RAF and began flying the Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5. He was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross after scoring four \\"kills\\" in May 1918. On 28 June 1918 McCall downed four enemy aircraft, including one shared with Eric John Stephens. On 30 June 1918 now Captain McCall downed five more Germans, four in the morning and the fifth that evening. For this McCall was awarded the Distinguished Service Order. On 17 August, he was accompanying William Gordon Claxton when the pair of them ran into Jagstaffel 20, which consisted of at least 40 planes. In the ensuing fight, which saw Claxton shot down, McCall scored a victory. McCall was ordered to England, and eventually to Canada, on convalescent leave. The armistice ending World War I was signed while McCall was in Canada recuperating from illness. Life between the wars Capt McCall landing atop a merry-go-round at the Calgary Stampede Capt McCall landing atop a merry-go- round at the Calgary Stampede Following the armistice McCall embarked upon a variety of civil aviation ventures, beginning with stunt flying. On 5 July 1919, while barnstorming, he crash-landed when his engine failed while he was taking off. His landing site was the top of the merry-go-round at the Calgary Exhibition and Stampede. He and his two passengers were uninjured. He founded his own company, McCall Aero Corporation Limited, in 1920. With this company McCall flew commercial freight and passengers across Canada, pioneering air travel to Banff. In 1928 he founded, with Emil Sick, another aviation company Great Western Airways. One of his more spectacular achievements was the flying of 200 quarts of nitroglycerin from Shelby, Montana to Calgary in 1928. The following year, he ignored bad weather to fly a doctor to the Skiff oil fields to treat two seriously injured workers. McCall also worked to encourage the formation of Canadian flying clubs in the inter-war years. World War II and beyond With the arrival of the Second World War McCall was recalled to service with the Royal Canadian Air Force as a Squadron Leader, based at numerous western Canadian bases. McCall died in Calgary Alberta on 22 January 1949 at the age of 52. Replica of Freddie McCall's aircraft at the Glenbow Museum in Calgary. In the city of Calgary, Alberta, the McCall industrial park and the road \\"McCall Way\\" is named after him, as well as McCall Lake Golf Course.

They describe their mission as to \\"address issues of concern to our brotherhood, our communities, our Nation, and the world.\\" Among the Council's nine Board of Directors are Senator Edward Brooke, Ambassador Horace Dawson, and Congressmen Charles Rangel and Ron Dellums. The Council's directors also include other ambassadors, theologians, presidents of colleges and foundations, and journalists. The Council communicates its position through white papers which are disseminated to policymakers, politicians, scholars, journalist, and fraternity chapters. Since its founding the Council has offered an informed opinion on topics such as the AIDS crisis, global warming, Middle East conflict, Nigerian politics and Martin Luther King, Jr.'s vision of a World House. Historical context Alpha Phi Alpha is an American intercollegiate organization that is the first established by African Americans. Founded on December 4, 1906 on the campus of Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, the fraternity utilizes motifs and artifacts from Ancient Egypt to represent the organization and preserves its archives at the Moorland-Spingarn Research Center. The leadership of Alpha Phi Alpha recognized early on the need to correct the educational, economic, political, and social injustices faced by African-Americans and the world community and began its continuing commitment of providing scholarships for needy students and initiating various other charitable and service projects. Alpha Phi Alpha has provided leadership and service during the Great Depression, World Wars, Civil Rights Movements, and addresses social issues such as apartheid, AIDS, urban housing, and other economic, cultural, and political issues affecting people of color. The Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial is a program of Alpha Phi Alpha and the fraternity jointly leads philanthropic programming initiatives with March of Dimes, Head Start, Boy Scouts of America and Big Brothers Big Sisters of America.See, e.g., Alpha Phi Alpha Alpha men such as W. E. B. Du Bois, Jesse Owens, Duke Ellington, Thurgood Marshall, Andrew Young, and Martin Luther King, Jr. are among the litany of fraternity members who have dedicated their lives to the fraternity's principles of \\"scholarship, manly deeds, and love for all mankind.\\" Leadership expansion The leadership by the fraternity was about to expand when at its 1995 General Convention, Senator Edward Brooke spoke on the need for Alpha Phi Alpha to broaden its view to encompass international concerns. Brooke said \\"our intellectual power is so great that it ought to be shared ... that we should be giving our thoughts and our opinions on domestic and international issues. General President Milton C. Davis established the World Policy Council (WPC) in 1996 as the analytical body of the fraternity to reflect, engage in dialogue and project what ought to happen in actions that are in-line with the values of Alpha Phi Alpha. The mission of The Alpha Phi Alpha World Policy Council as stated on the fraternity's website The Council was created with seven board members to research and outline the fraternity's position on issues and policies deemed to be of national or international import. Milton appointed Brooke as the Council's first Chairman and he currently serves as Chairman Emeritus. The Council's membership increased to nine when General President Harry E. Johnson's appointed Congressman Ron Dellums and Cornel West. Johnson also extended the World Policy Council's role to include a lecture series on tolerance and a focus on the issue of the HIV infections and AIDS. The World Policy Council has studied and issued white papers on the Politics of Nigeria, War on Terrorism, and global warming. The Council garnered international attention in 1999 when it issued a clarion call to Nigeria to release political prisoners and become a force for good on the African continent. The fifth paper was published in 2006 to coincide with the Centenary of Alpha Phi Alpha and among its five topics examined the impact of Black Greek letter organizations in American culture and Hurricane Katrina, the costliest and one of the five deadliest hurricanes in the history of the United States. The Council distributes the white papers to the White House, Congresses, key national leaders, fraternity chapters, and those whose decisions shape the future. A letter is sent to the office of the President of the United States providing an informed opinion of individuals and constituents on how the President should act to resolve an issue or policy. Position papers The WPC presented its first position paper to the fraternity's general membership at the 1996 Alpha Scholarship Forum in New Orleans, Louisiana as part of its inaugural Charles H. Wesley Memorial Scholarship Lecture. The fourth and fifth report were issued in 2002 and 2006 respectively. =Middle East crisis= A peace movement poster: Israeli and Palestinian flags and the words peace in Arabic and Hebrew. Similar images have been used by several groups proposing a two-state solution to the conflict. The Israeli–Palestinian conflict is an ongoing dispute between the State of Israel and the Palestinian people. The Israeli–Palestinian conflict is part of the wider Arab–Israeli conflict, which is essentially a dispute between two national identities with claims over the same area of land.See, e.g., Arab–Israeli conflict The roots of the conflict can be traced to the late 19th century, when Zionist Jews expressed their desire to create a modern state in the ancient land of the Israelites, which they considered to be their rightful homeland. To further that objective, the World Zionist Organization encouraged immigration and purchase of land, which was then part of the Ottoman Empire. According to a 2007 poll of adults in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank by the Jerusalem Media & Communication Center, \\"46.7 per cent of respondents favour a two-state solution for the Arab–Israeli conflict.\\" In second place came support of a binational state with 26.5%. The Council's position is, =The Centenary Report= The fifth report by the Council addresses five issues such as the Millennium Challenge Account, Extraordinary rendition, and The World House as envisioned by Martin Luther King, Jr. Millennium Challenge Participants in the Program; United States as donor is in green, red countries have active compacts, blue countries have active threshold compacts, purple countries are in negotiations for either, and pink countries have negotiated threshold agreements and are negotiating for full compacts The Millennium Challenge Account (MCA) is a bilateral development fund created by the Bush administration whose mission is \\"to reduce global poverty through the promotion of sustainable economic growth\\" to some of the poorest countries in the world. The MCA is available to fund specific programs targeted at reducing poverty and stimulating economic growth for eligible countries that meet independent and transparent policy indicators. The Congress of the United States has consistently provided less funding than the president has requested for this new compact for development with accountability for both rich and poor countries. For Fiscal Year 2008, less funding will be provided than was hoped for, and only 1.2 billion is currently budgeted, and the MCA CEO commented that it would undercut the programs efforts. The Council's position is, Extraordinary rendition thumb250pxright Sources: Amnesty International,[https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/pol30/003/2006/en/ \\"Rendition\\" and secret detention: A global system of human rights violations], Amnesty International, January 1, 2006 Human Rights Watch Extraordinary rendition and irregular rendition are terms used to describe the kidnapping and extrajudicial transfer of a person from one state to another, and the term torture by proxy is used by some critics to describe situations in which the U.S. has purportedly transferred suspected terrorists to countries known to employ harsh interrogation techniques that may rise to the level of torture. It has been alleged that torture has been employed with the knowledge or acquiescence of the United States, although United States Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice stated in an April 2006 radio interview that the United States does not transfer people to places where it is known they will be tortured.Michael John Garcia, Legislative Attorney American Law Division.

He stressed the urgency of addressing these problems, warning that it might be humanity's last chance to choose between chaos and community. The World House Project has said \\"The September 11, 2001 attacks by terrorist made Dr. King's predictions seem eerily prescient. His vision and agenda may be the key to our survival during the 21st century.\\" King's vision of a World House calls upon humanity to: The Council recommends that Alpha Phi Alpha join crusades in this Centenary that are pursuing King's vision and that, Members Edward Brooke, Chairman emeritus of the World Policy Council, is congratulated by President George W.

After completing the humanities in the Gymnasium of Straubing in 1821, he entered the University of Landshut, where, in addition to the philosophical and theological studies prescribed for candidates to the priesthood, he devoted much of his time to the study of Middle Eastern and modern languages. The year preceding his ordination to the priesthood he spent at the diocesan seminary of Ratisbon, where under the direction of Michael Wittmann, the future auxiliary Bishop of Ratisbon, he prepared himself for the priesthood. After being ordained priest by Bishop Joseph Michael Sailer at Ratisbon 22 June 1827, he was occupied a few months in parochial work at the little village of Otzing in lower Bavaria, whereupon he continued his theological studies at the Ducal Georgianum in Munich in November, 1828, and obtained the doctorate in Theology in 1829. In 1830 he was \\"co-operator\\" at the Hospital of the Holy Ghost in Munich, in 1831 Privatdocent for Old Testament exegesis at the University of Munich, and in 1832 he succeeded Pruggmeyr as subregens of the Georgianum. In addition he was in 1833 appointed professor-extraordinary and in 1837 professor-ordinary of exegesis at the university. In 1838 he became canon and in 1858 dean at the Cathedral of Augsburg. Stadler was well versed in all the branches of theology, but he was especially fond of linguistic studies. Besides having a mastery of German, French, Italian, and English among the modern languages, he knew Latin, Greek, Hebrew, Syriac, Arabian, Persian, Sanskrit, and in his later years he studied also Spanish and Polish. He was best known as the author of Vollständiges Heiligen-Lexikon oder Lebensgeschichten aller Heiligen, Seligen u.a. aller Orte und aller Jahrhunderte, deren Andenken in der kath. Kirche gefeiert oder sonst geehrt wird (Augsburg, 1858–82), an alphabetical collection of lives of Catholic saints from all over the world and from many different eras. The Acta Sanctorum of the Bollandists, as far as they were finished, that is, to the end of October, were condensed into short sketches, but many new lives were introduced and newly discovered data were added to the lives contained in the Acta. In the preparation of the first volume Stadler was assisted by Rev. Fr. J. Heim, while the second and the third volume contain contributions from several priests of the Diocese of Augsburg.

A ring such that all right ideals with at most n generators are free and have unique rank is called an n-fir. A semifir is a ring in which all finitely generated right ideals are free modules of unique rank. (Thus, a ring is semifir if it is n-fir for all n ≥ 0.) The semifir property is left-right symmetric, but the fir property is not. Properties and examples It turns out that a left and right fir is a domain. Furthermore, a commutative fir is precisely a principal ideal domain, while a commutative semifir is precisely a Bézout domain. These last facts are not generally true for noncommutative rings, however . Every principal right ideal domain R is a right fir, since every nonzero principal right ideal of a domain is isomorphic to R. In the same way, a right Bézout domain is a semifir. Since all right ideals of a right fir are free, they are projective. So, any right fir is a right hereditary ring, and likewise a right semifir is a right semihereditary ring. Because projective modules over local rings are free, and because local rings have invariant basis number, it follows that a local, right hereditary ring is a right fir, and a local, right semihereditary ring is a right semifir. Unlike a principal right ideal domain, a right fir is not necessarily right Noetherian, however in the commutative case, R is a Dedekind domain since it is a hereditary domain, and so is necessarily Noetherian. Another important and motivating example of a free ideal ring are the free associative (unital) k-algebras for division rings k, also called non-commutative polynomial rings . Semifirs have invariant basis number and every semifir is a Sylvester domain.

Smith House (also known as The Cove, The Gingerbread House, or Cobweb Cottage) located at 28 West Lake Street in Skaneateles, New York is a picturesque house designed by Alexander Jackson Davis, and later modified by Archimedes Russell. It was built during 1848–1852 and is a \\"good example of the Gothic Revival mode, which was a reaction against the stringencies of the Greek Revival style\\" and Accompanying six photos, exterior and interior, from 1979 as exemplified by the nearby Richard DeZeng House. It is the only house designed by Davis in Onondaga County that has survived since the demolition of the Charles Sedgewick Cottage on James Street in Syracuse. The house was photographed by Historic American Buildings Survey photographer Jack Boucher in 1962. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. It has been portrayed in several artworks. In 1979, State Commissioner of Parks and Recreation Orin Lehman said that the Reuel E. Smith House \\"embodies some of the major currents of mid-nineteenth century thought in literature and art as well as architecture.\\" In 1981, the Reuel E. Smith House received a federal Heritage Conservation and Recreation Service grant for restoration of the pink stucco exterior, the roof, and the chimneys, which described the home as \\"an excellent example of Gothic revival style\\" with \\"considerable intrinsic merit.\\" Historic American Buildings Survey photograph of the \\"East Front\\" The home was built for Reuel Smith, partner in a New York City shipping firm. His son E. Reuel Smith inherited the estate. \\"E.R.\\", as he was called, was a prominent figure in the village having married into Skaneateles royalty, his wife being Elizabeth DeCost. (Elizabeth DeCost's great-grandfather was William J. Vredenburg, one of the earliest settlers of Skaneateles.) E.R. died at the home in 1911. Their son, DeCost Smith, noted painter of the American West, was born at the Reuel Smith House. Reuel's grandson Sedgwick married Elsa Watts Smith, who in 1975 sold the property to Robert & Shirley Feldmann. The Feldmanns sold the property in April 2017. The current owners of the home are Justin and Dr. Rebecca West Reeves.  Architecture  Pink stucco house in 2009 The home is constructed of brick covered with stucco, and originally sat upon an estate of approximately 20 acres. The stucco has been painted several times over the years. As of 2009, the exterior was a pink tone with a darker salmon color applied to the bargeboards (sometimes called \\"gingerbread.\\") As of 2019, the exterior was a gold tone with off-white applied to the bargeboards. As detailed in the National Register of Historic Places Inventory, the fenestration (window design and placement) is largely symmetrical, typical of the architectural style, and includes a central protruding oriel window on the second floor on the east front. Above this oriel window is an oculus with quatrefoil wooden tracery. The main entry is a four-centred arch flanked by sandstone labels painted off-white to match the ornamentation of the bargeboards. The first floor is largely encircled by a porch, which is adorned with iron ornamentation in the form of oak leaves and acorns. The large picture window on the north side of the structure, now looking out from the current kitchen, was added in 1926 by Archimedes Russell. The bargeboards were removed in 1940, but later replaced. The floors, originally pine, were replaced in 1941 with walnut. The interior walls - brick covered with plaster - are ten inches thick. Fireplaces with white marble mantels are original on both floors.  Alexander Jackson Davis  Named by The Metropolitan Museum of Art as one of America's most notable architects. Alexander Jackson Davis's career peaked in the 1840s and 1850s, during the design of this home. Davis is admired as the preeminent designer of \\"country\\" homes. His approach to Gothic Revival was something prominent Americans sought out and cherished, from Samuel F. B. Morse and Jay Gould to successful merchants like Reuel Smith. While others of his era were building box houses, Alexander Jackson Davis pushed boundaries. His homes incorporated peaks, extensions in many directions, unique windows, and verandas, all of which can be found in the Reuel E. Smith House. Davis's unique decorative style has adorned landscapes across the Northeast and the Hudson River Valley. Although many of the homes he designed have been demolished, the shoreline of Skaneateles Lake continues to be graced by this jewel from \\"America's Picturesque Architect.\\" Davis was a friend of American landscape designer and Gothic Revival advocate Andrew Jackson Downing, who likely influenced Davis's design of the Reuel E. Smith house, including its interior design.

It is composed of poliglecaprone 25, which is a copolymer of glycolide and epsilon-caprolactone. It comes both dyed (violet) and undyed (clear) and is an absorbable monofilament suture. It is generally used for soft-tissue approximation and ligation. It is used frequently for subcuticular dermis closures of the face. It has less of a tendency to exit through the skin after it breaks down, such as Vicryl. It is contraindicated for use in cardiovascular and neurologic tissues and for usage in ophthalmic and microsurgery. The use of Poliglecaprone suture may be inappropriate in elderly, malnourished, or debilitated patients or in patients suffering from conditions that may delay wound healing. Monocryl has a low tissue reactivity, maintains high tensile strength, and has a half-life of 7 to 14 days. At 1 week, its in vivo tensile strength is at 50–60% undyed (60–70% dyed), 20–30% undyed (30–40% dyed) at two weeks, and essentially completely hydrolyzed by 91–119 days.Johnson & Johnson Gateway, Features and Benefits of Monocryl When removed from the package, it has a high degree of \\"memory\\", or coil.

He was born in Belleville (Archdiocese of Lyons) towards the end of the twelfth century. Having received his education from the cathedral clergy in Macon, he made his higher studies in Paris, about 1220, and there shortly afterwards, as it seems, he entered the Order of Preachers. From 1230 he was very active for many years as a preacher and inquisitor in the districts of Lyonnais, Burgundy, Franche-Comté, Savoy, Champagne, Lorraine, Auvergne, Languedoc, and Roussillon.

He also worked on the numismatic collection of Vienna and prepared a critical catalogue of 18,000 Greek coins and a numismatico-iconographic lexicon with drawings of about 6000 Greek coins belonging to the Viennese and Munich collections. In 1834 he published the work Numismata nonnulla græca, which corrected false and inexact designations of coins; this was crowned with a prize by the Academy of Paris as was also his important investigation concerning what are called the rainbow patina, which he was the first to recognize as Celtic.vol.

He also drew up a Promemoria that is preserved among the records of the royal cabinet of coins, as to the expenses and the plan of a monumental work covering the entire field of Greek numismatics that was to take the place of the old work by Eckhel and be about one-half larger. Streber was also prominent in politics as a strong supporter of the ecclesiastico-conservative party. He founded the association for a constitutional monarchy and religious freedom, and wrote many political memorials at its request. He died in Munich.

His two periods as a member of the House of Representatives (1901–1910, 1929–1931) were separated by the First World War, during which he became an anti-conscription activist and changed his political affiliation. Crouch was a Protectionist and Liberal during his first period as an MP, but later became involved in the labour movement and represented the Australian Labor Party (ALP) during his second term. He is one of the few MPs to move to the ALP after previously belonging to an anti-Labor party. Early life Crouch was born on 19 June 1868 at Ballarat East, Victoria, the son of George Crouch from Tottenham, London, who was a miner, storekeeper and later a wealthy boot-retailer, and his wife Selina Durham, née Marks, from Aberdeen, Scotland. Pre-war politics Crouch as a young MP In 1901, Crouch was elected to the new Federal Parliament for the electorate of Corio, with a majority of 1,130 votes, as a member of the Protectionist Party (later the Commonwealth Liberal Party). He served for nine years, under the leadership of Alfred Deakin, and was at the time the youngest member of the lower house. He gained recognition as a wit and a radical, and was outspoken on the delicate matter of lavish allowances for the Governor General. World War I Crouch enthusiastically supported new trends in Australian defence policies. He joined the militia in 1892, and by the outbreak of World War I had attained the rank of lieutenant colonel. In March 1915, he was given command of the 22nd Battalion, Australian Imperial Force, which landed at Gallipoli in September 1915. Crouch was transferred to command the Base Camp at Mudros in December 1915, but illness led to his return to Australia in March 1916. Although a strong advocate for national defence, Crouch did not support the proposal to introduce compulsory overseas service. He became Victorian branch president of the Returned Soldiers' No-Conscription League, and campaigned against prime minister Billy Hughes during the conscription plebiscites in 1916 and 1917. Encouraged by James Scullin, Crouch joined the Labor Party and became an active leader of the Labor movement in Victoria. Post-war politics Crouch c. 1928 In 1924 Crouch represented Australia at the International Federation of Trade Unions Education Conference in Oxford. In 1929, he was re-elected to the federal parliament for the electorate of Corangamite, representing the Labor Party. Defeated two years later, he decided to forsake politics for philanthropy, travel, writing, and encouraging Australians to take a greater interest in their history. He was the donor of the first six busts at Prime Ministers Avenue at Ballarat, and bequeathed funds for maintaining the project. Personal life Crouch remained unmarried during his lifetime and in his later years lived with his sister Gertrude at Point Lonsdale, Victoria in the house their father had built in 1882. He died aged 80 on 7 April 1949, leaving an estate valued at £43,490, and was buried at Point Lonsdale.

Biography In 1970 when Andria and his brother Ivan Busic had started to become interested in Rock 'n Roll, inspired by their father, the famous jazz trumpeter André Busic, who formed the Traditional Jazz Band. Beyond bands such as Beatles, Rush, Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, at Busic's house, they heard many different music styles, like jazz, blues and country, so they began to study their respective instruments. In 1984 the Busic Brothers former the band called Prisma, a name that soon after would be changed to Platina, played hard rock in Portuguese. They recorded their first LP by Baratos Afins (label), with this formation: Sérgio Semam (vocal), Daril Parisi (guitar), Ivan Busic (drums) and Andria Busic (bass and back vocals). After some time, they decided return with Platina, and in 1988, with another name: Slogan that soon after was changed to Cherokee. With another formation, with Renato Nunes on the guitar, the album was released by Baratos Afins again. Soon after, it dissolved. Andria entered quickly in one of the most famous Brazilian rock bands, called Ultraje a Rigor, where he recorded the CD Crescendo, and did a special participation on the CD Por quê Ultraje?. In the same year, Wander Taffo, one of the most famous Brazilian guitarists, invited the Busic Brothers to record the album Taffo, with specials participations of famous artists in Brazil, such as Herbert Vianna, Lulu Santos and Lobão. The CD was recorded at Nas Nuvens Studio (RJ) and mixed in Los Angeles (United States). The CD was released by WEA. In 1989 the second album: Rosa Branca was released to much success. In 1992 the Taffo's band was dissolved. In 1993, the Busic Brothers met Edu Ardanuy, and they were side men of the popular Brazilian singer Supla, where they released the CD Encoleirado by Sony BMG. After many trips and shows, they left Supla and formed the Dr. Sin band which they are in presently. With Dr. Sin, Andria played at many rock festivals, such as Hollywood Rock, Phillips Monsters of Rock Brazil, M2000 Summer Concerts, Skol Rock and Live n' Louder. In 2007, Dr. Sin released the CD Bravo (Century Media/Dynamo Records), that is successful in Brazil. Bravo will be released worldwide soon. In 2008, Andria Busic joined in Casa das Máquinas (parallel of Dr. Sin), one of the most important rock bands in Brazil. Currently, Andria is considered one of the best singers and bassist in Brazil.

Geography Avatele Beach, the village's main sea track, stretches along the coast of Avatele Bay and is the largest and most well-known beach on the island. Although the sand is mostly of the coarse kind it is an important swimming and picnic site for both tourists and residents. Prior to the construction of the Sir Robert Rex Wharf and Hannan International Airport in Alofi, Avatele Beach was the principal landing place for many visitors to the island. History Avatele, along with other villages Mutalau, Tuapa, Alofi and Hakupu, were the first major village settlements of Niue following settlement by Polynesian voyagers from Samoa, Tonga and Pukapuka before the year 1300. The beach was also the site of Captain James Cook's third and final landing attempt on the island before naming Niue \\"Savage Island\\" in 1774, since then it has been the landing and official welcoming site of many prominent figures from across the Pacific and the world such as missionaries Rev. George Lawes, his brother Dr. Frank Lawes and former Governor-Generals of Niue and New Zealand such as Sir Paul Reeves. The village was first Christianized in early 1854 when a resident, Muatoga, asked Paulo, the Samoan missionary residing in Mutalau, to bring the gospel to his village in the far-south and Paulo agreed. The village received its first pastor that same year, a Rev. Samuela from Western Samoa who was sent by Paulo to care for the young church at Avatele a village of over 1,000 residents at the time. Since 1854, 14 Pastors have been entrusted with the care of the Church in the village both from around Niue and overseas, including the current Rev Petesa Sionetuato. The village has also birthed its own share of missionaries over the years such as the respected ancestor or tupuna Rev. Sionepaea Kinimotu who played a major role in the Christianisation of Tuvalu Is. People Avatele has also produced its fair share of prominent Niueans past and present, including Niue's late inaugural Premier Sir Robert Rex, his late brother and long-serving Senior Advisor to Government Leslie Rex OBE, the late Rev. Ikiua Lupo first President of the Ekalesia Kerisiano Niue, the late Takelesi Lagaluga first Niuean Head of a Government Department & his son Hon.

The episode aired on CBS on October 4, 1957. The episode is the first episode in the first season, and the first episode in the complete series. \\"Beaver Gets 'Spelled\\" is available on DVD. Plot summary Diane Brewster as Miss Canfield. Beaver's new teacher, Miss Canfield, gives him a note after class to take home. Beaver's classmates convince him that the note means he is going to be kicked out of school. Worried that he will be the first second-grader in the school's history to be \\"'spelled\\" (expelled), Beaver hides the note. The next day, Miss Canfield finds the note under Beaver's desk and instructs him to take it home. Beaver loses the note on the way home. Wally helps Beaver in his predicament by writing a note (from \\"Mrs. Ward Cleaver\\") to Miss Canfield assuring her that Beaver has been whipped for his offense. The next day, Miss Canfield is at a loss trying to understand such a severe response to her request that Beaver play Smokey Bear in a school pageant. She calls June to the school. When Beaver discovers where his mother is headed, he runs away and climbs a tree. When Ward, June, and Wally find Beaver in the tree, they are unable to persuade him to come down. June decides to leave him there even if it rains. Beaver comes down to get his raincoat. The next day, he has a talk with Miss Canfield and asks her to call him \\"Beaver\\" rather than \\"Theodore\\". He offers her some tips on understanding second-graders. The following day, Beaver leaves for school carrying his most precious object for Miss Canfield — a rubber shrunken head. Cast and crew Hugh Beaumont and Barbara Billingsley star as archetypal suburban couple, Ward and June Cleaver with Tony Dow and Jerry Mathers as their sons, Wally and Theodore \\"Beaver\\" Cleaver.

It was a year in the 14th century, in the midst of a period in world history often referred to as the Late Middle Ages. During this year on the Asian continent, the several divisions of the old Mongol Empire were in a state of gradual decline. The Ilkhanate had already fragmented into several kingdoms struggling to place their puppet emperors over the shell of an old state. The Chagatai Khanate was in the midst of a civil war and one year from falling to rebellion. The Golden Horde to the north was besieging Genoese colonies along the coast of the Black Sea, and the Yuan dynasty in China was seeing the first seeds of a resistance which would lead to its downfall. Southeast Asia remained free from Mongol power, with several small kingdoms struggling for survival. The Siamese dynasty in that area vanquished the Sukhothai in this year. In the Indonesian Archipelago, the Majapahit Empire was in the midst of a golden age under the leadership of Gajah Mada, who remains a famous figure in Indonesia. England and France were engaged in the early stages of the Hundred Years' War, with the Battle of Auberoche fought in Northern France in October of this year. In the Iberian Peninsula, Alfonso XI of Castile again besieged the Muslim city of Granada as part of the Reconquista, but without success. The Holy Roman Empire under Louis IV took control of Holland and the surrounding area, granting these lands to his wife Margaret II, Countess of Hainaut in a move which angered many of his princes. Holland was also in the midst of the Friso-Hollandic Wars, engaging with the Frisians on 26 September in the Battle of Warns. Italy, which at the time was divided into several kingdoms, saw several power struggles including the Battle of Gamenario in the north, and the assassination of Andrew, Duke of Calabria in the Kingdom of Naples. In Northern Europe, Swedes continued early stages of their emigration to Estonia, which would continue in the coming decades. Estonian rulers also managed to crush the St. George's Night Uprising in 1345 after a two-year struggle. The Grand Duchy of Lithuania changed hands from Jaunutis to his brother Algirdas in a relatively bloodless shift of power, and Lithuania continued its skirmishes with its northern, Estonian neighbor. The main forces in the Balkans in the 1345 were Serbia, Bulgaria, and the Byzantine Empire. Stefan Uroš IV Dušan of Serbia proclaimed himself Tsar of the new Serbian Empire and continued his efforts at expansion, quickly conquering Albania and other surrounding areas within the year. The Byzantines, though powerful, were in a state of decline, with an ongoing civil war between emperors John V Palaiologos and John VI Kantakouzenos, although in 1345, the tide began to turn toward the latter. At the same time, the Zealot commune in Thessalonica entered a more radical phase. Turks clashed with Byzantines, Serbs, and Cypriots at sea and in the islands of Chios and Imbros. The Byzantine Empire's precarious situation at this time is evidenced by the fact that they did not have enough soldiers to protect their own borders, but hired mercenaries from the Serbs and the Ottoman Turks.

Asia  Asia in 1345 = Western Asia = The country of Georgia had been struggling for independence from the Ilkhanate since the first anti-Mongol uprising started in 1259 under the leadership of King David Narin who in fact waged his war for almost thirty years. Finally, it was King George the Brilliant (1314–1346) who managed to play on the decline of the Ilkhanate, stopped paying tribute to the Mongols, restored the pre-1220 state borders of Georgia, and returned the Empire of Trebizond into Georgia's sphere of influence. Thus, in 1345, Georgia was in the midst of golden age of independence, though its leader would die one year later. Trebizond had reached its greatest wealth and influence during the long reign of Alexios II (1297–1330). Afterwards, however, it suffered a period of repeated imperial depositions and assassinations from the end of Alexios II's reign until the first years of Alexios III's, finally ending in 1355, six years into his rule. The empire, however, never fully recovered its internal cohesion, commercial supremacy or territory. Its ruler in 1345, Michael Megas Komnenos was crowned Emperor of Trebizond in 1344 after his son, John III, was deposed. He was forced to sign a document which gave the Grand Duke and his ministers almost all power in the Empire, promising to seek their counsel in all official actions. This constitutional experiment was short-lived, however, because of opposition from the people of Trebizond. They were infuriated to see the Emperor stripped of his effective authority and rose up in revolt against the oligarchy. Michael swiftly took advantage of his opportunity to regain power and arrested and imprisoned the Grand Duke in 1345. He also sent his son John to Constantinople and then Adrianople, where he was to be kept prisoner to prevent him from becoming a further focus for the discontented nobles of Trebizond. = Mongol khanates = The Mongol Empire had become fractured since the late 13th century. After the death of Kublai Khan in 1294, it had already been divided into four khanates: The Yuan dynasty, the Ilkhanate, the Golden Horde, and the Chagatai Khanate. Map showing the political situation in southwest Asia in 1345, ten years after the death of Abu Sa'id. The Jalayirids, Chobanids, Muzaffarids, Injuids, Sarbadars and Kartids took the Ilkhanate's place as the major powers in Iran.  Ilkhanate  The Ilkhanate had been declining rapidly since 1335, when Abu Sa'id died without an heir. Since then, various factions, including the Chobanids and the Jalayirids, had been competing for the Ilkhan throne. Hassan Kuchak, a Chobanid prince, was murdered late in 1343. Surgan, son of Sati Beg, the sister of Abu Sa'id, found himself competing for control of the Chobanid lands with the late ruler's brother Malek Ashraf and his uncle Yagi Basti. When he was defeated by Malek Asraf, he fled to his mother and stepfather. The three of them then formed an alliance, but when Hasan Buzurg (Jalayirid) decided to withdraw the support he promised, the plan fell apart, and they fled to Diyarbakır. Surgan was defeated again in 1345 by Malek Asraf and they fled to Anatolia. Coinage dating from that year appears in Hesn Kayfa in Sati Beg's name; this is the last trace of her. Surgan moved from Anatolia to Baghdad, where he was eventually executed by Hasan Buzurg; Sati Beg may have suffered the same fate, but this is unknown.  Golden Horde  In 1345, the Golden Horde made a second attempt to lay siege on the Genoese city of Kaffa. (An earlier attempt had failed because Kaffa was able to get provisions across the Black Sea.) The 1345 siege would fail in the following year as the Mongols were struck with the Black Plague and forced to retreat. This siege is therefore noted as one of the key events that brought the Black Plague to Europe. The Kingdom of Hungary saw the threat of the growing power of the Golden Horde and as such, in 1345 it began a campaign against the Tatars and the Horde, in the area what would become a few years later Moldavia. Andrew Lackfi, the Voivode of Transylvania and his Székely warriors were victorious in their campaign, decapitating the local Tatar leader, the brother-in-law of the Khan, Atlamïş and making the Tatars flee toward the coastal area.István Vásáry, Cumans and Tatars, Cambridge University Press, 2005, p. 156.  Chagatai Khanate  Amir Qazaghan (d. 1358) was the leader of the Qara'unas tribe (1345 at the latest – 1358) and the powerful de facto ruler of the Chagatai ulus (1346–1358). In 1345 he revolted against Qazan Khan, but was unsuccessful. The following year he would try again and succeed in killing the khan. With this the effective power of the Chagatai khans would come to an end; the khanate eventually devolved into a loose confederation of tribes that respected the authority of Qazaghan, although he primarily commanded the loyalty of the tribes of the southern portion of the ulus. He did not claim the khanship, but instead contented himself with his title of amir and conferred the title of khan on puppets of his own choosing: first Danishmendji (1346–1348) and then Bayan Qulï (1348–1358).Manz, Beatrice Forbes, The Rise and Rule of Tamerlane. Cambridge University Press, 1989, . Zhu Yuanzhang joined forces rebellious to the Yuan dynasty in 1345. This later led to his becoming the first emperor of the Ming dynasty.  Yuan dynasty  By 1345, the Yuan dynasty in China was steadily declining. Chinese peasants, upset with the lack of effective policies by the government when they were facing droughts, floods, and famines, were becoming rebellious. The Yellow River flooded in Jinan in 1345. The river had flooded previously in 1335 and in 1344.Mongol Yuan Dynasty – Political, Social, Cultural, Historical Analysis Of China There was also conflict between the rulers of the dynasty. Zhu Yuanzhang was about 16 years old in 1345. His parents and brothers had died of plague or famine (or both) in 1344,Huang, Ray. 1988. China: A Macro History. Armonk, New York; London: M. E.

Whitten Company. p. 265 He would lead a series of rebellions until he overthrew the Yuan dynasty and became the first emperor of the Ming dynasty in 1368. = Japan and India = Muhammad bin Tughluq was reigning as Sultan of Delhi in 1345 when there was a revolt of Muslim military commanders in the Daulatabad area. In Bengal, on the eastern border of the Sultanate, a general named llyas captured East Bengal, leading to its reunification. He established his capital at Gaur. In southern India, Harihara I had founded the Vijayanagara Empire in 1336. After the death of Hoysala Veera Ballala III during a battle against the Sultan of Madurai in 1343, the Hoysala Empire had merged with the growing Vijayanagara Empire. In these first two decades after the founding of the empire, Harihara I gained control over most of the area south of the Tungabhadra river and earned the title of Purvapaschima Samudradhishavara (\\"master of the eastern and western oceans\\"). The Jaffna Kingdom, which encompassed the southern tip of India and parts of Sri Lanka; there was continual conflict with Vijayanagara and the smaller Kotte Kingdom of southern Sri Lanka. From 1336 to 1392, two courts claimed the throne of Japan. This was known as the Nanboku-chō, or the Northern and Southern Courts period. In the Northern Court, Emperor Go- Murakami claimed the throne. In the Southern Court, Emperor Kōmyō claimed the throne. = Southeast Asia = In Southeast Asia, Sukhothai changed hands to a new Siamese dynasty in 1345.Eliot, Joshua et al. Footprint Laos Handbook.

Strange Parallels. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2003. pgs. 236–7 A Buddhist colony also existed to the west in the Mon Empire, which struggled to maintain its existence in the face of the Islamic Delhi Sultanate to the west and the Mongol Chinese to the north. The Majapahit Empire, which occupied much of the Indonesian Archipelago, was ruled by empress Tribhuwana Wijayatunggadewi. During Tribhuwana's rule, the Majapahit kingdom had grown much larger and became famous in the area. Gajah Mada reigned at the time along with the empress as mahapatih (prime minister) of Majapahit. It was during their rule in 1345 that the famous Muslim traveller Ibn Battuta visited Samudra in the Indonesian Archipelago. According to Battuta's report on his visit to Samudra, the ruler of the local area was a Muslim, and the people worshiped as Muslims in mosques and recited the Koran. Many Islamic traders and travelers had already scattered themselves along the major cities and coasts surrounding the Indian Ocean by this time.Morgan, Kenneth. Islam- the Straight Path. City: Motilal Banarsidass Pub, 1998. pg. 376  Western Europe  Europe in 1345 = Hundred Years' War = By 1345, the Hundred Years' War between France and England had been going on for only about eight years. The English claimed the right to the French throne, and the French refused to be ruled by foreigners. In August the English Earl of Derby commenced the Gascon campaign of 1345, taking a large French army at Bergerac, Dordogne by surprise and decisively defeating it. Later in the campaign, on 21 October the French were besieging the castle at Auberoche, when Derby's army caught them off guard during their evening meal and won one of the most decisive battles of the war. This set the stage for English dominance in the area for several years. Previous to this, the French had been having success, and the English had even offered a treaty, but with this battle along with Derby's overrunning of the Agenais (lost twenty years before in the War of Saint-Sardos) and Angoulême, as well as the forces in Brittany under Sir Thomas Dagworth also making gains, the tide turned somewhat in this year. A new machine was introduced to this war in 1345—cannon. \\"Ribaldis\\", as they were then called, are first mentioned in the English Privy Wardrobe accounts during preparations for the Battle of Crécy between 1345 and 1346.David Nicolle, Crécy 1346: Triumph of the longbow, Osprey Publishing. Paperback; June 25, 2000; These were believed to have shot large arrows and simplistic grapeshot, but they were so important they were directly controlled by the Royal Wardrobe. = War of Succession = A kind of side conflict to the Hundred Years' War was the War of the Breton Succession, a conflict between the Houses of Blois and Montfort for control of the Duchy of Brittany. The French backed Blois and the English backed Montfort in what became a miniature of the wider conflict between the two countries. The House of Blois had laid siege to the town of Quimper in early 1344, and continued into 1345. During the summer and autumn of 1344, the Montfortist party had fallen apart. Even those who had been John of Montfort's staunchest allies now considered it futile to continue the struggle. It therefore mattered little that in March 1345 John finally managed to escape to England. With no adherents of note of his own, he was now little more than a figurehead for English ambitions in Brittany. Edward III decided to repudiate the truce in summer 1345, a year before it was due to run out. As part of his larger strategy, a force was dispatched to Brittany under the joint leadership of the Earl of Northampton and John of Montfort. Within a week of their landing in June, the English had their first victory when Sir Thomas Dagworth, one of Northampton's lieutenants, raided central Brittany and defeated Charles of Blois at Cadoret near Josselin. The follow-up was less impressive. Further operations were delayed until July when Montfort attempted the recapture of Quimper. However, news had reached the French government that Edward's main campaign had been cancelled and they were able to send reinforcements from Normandy. With his strengthened army, Charles of Blois broke the siege. Routed, Montfort fled back to Hennebont where he fell ill and died 16 September. The heir to the Montfortist cause was his 5-year-old son, John. During the winter, Northampton fought a long and hard winter campaign with the apparent objective of seizing a harbour on the north side of the peninsula. Edward III had probably planned to land here with his main force during summer 1346. However, the English achieved very little for their efforts. Northern Brittany was Joanna of Dreux’ home region and resistance here was stiff. The only bright spot for the English was victory at the Battle of La Roche-Derrien, where the small town was captured and a garrison installed under Richard Totesham. A coin of Alfonso XI of Castile, dated circa 1345. = Other events = Also in England in 1345, Princess Joan was betrothed to Pedro of Castile, son of Alfonso XI of Castile and Maria of Portugal. She would never marry him, however, but would die of the Black Plague on her journey to Spain to meet him. Spain, meanwhile, continued its struggle to regain Muslim territory on the Iberian Peninsula. In that same year Alfonso XI attacked Gibraltar as a part of the Reconquista, but was unable to conquer it.O'Callaghan, Joseph. Reconquest and Crusade in Medieval Spain. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2004. pg. 212 In 1345 Muhammud V was made its ruler.Ahmed, Akbar. Discovering Islam. New York: Routledge, 2002. pg. 102 The York Minster Cathedral, the largest Gothic cathedral in northern Europe, was completed in this year as well. It remains the largest in the region to this day. England was still recovering from French occupation. Until 1345, all school instruction had been in French, rather than English.Holliday, Carl. English Fiction from the Fifth to the Twentieth Century. City: Kessinger Publishing, LLC, 2007. pgs. 53–54. The Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris was completed in 1345. Besides the War of Succession and the Hundred Years' War, France was in the midst of an interesting period. Several decades earlier, the Roman Papacy had moved to Avignon and would not return to Rome for another 33 years. The Avignon Papacy was then ruled by Pope Clement VI, who was aiding the French in their war against the English with Church funds. Also, in the year 1345, the famous Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris was completed after nearly two centuries of planning and construction.Sommers, Michael. France: a Primary Source Cultural Guide. City: PowerPlus Books, 2005. pg. 126 On 24 March, a man named Guy de Chauliac observed a strange astronomical sign: the planets Saturn, Jupiter, and Mars conjoined in the sky under the sign of Aquarius. That same day the area experienced a solar eclipse. This sign was interpreted as foreboding by many, and Chauliac would later blame it for the Black Plague, which arrived less than five years later.  Central Europe  Count William IV, killed in 1345 in the Friso-Hollandic Wars = Holy Roman Empire = On 1 January, emperor Louis IV's son Louis VI the Roman married Cunigunde, a Lithuanian Princess. Besides this move, the emperor continued his policy of expansion by conferring Hainaut, Holland, Zeeland and Friesland upon his wife Margaret of Holland after the death of William IV at the Battle of Warns. The hereditary titles to these lands owned by Margaret's sisters were ignored. This widened a divide which had already been growing between himself and the lay princes of Germany, who disliked his restless expansion policy. His actions in this year eventually led to a civil war, which was cut short by his death by stroke two years later. On 12 March, a eucharistic miracle occurred in Amsterdam, now called the Miracle of the Host. It involved a dying man vomiting upon being given the Holy Sacrament and last rites in his home. The Host was then put in the fire, but miraculously remained intact and could be retrieved from the fire in one piece without the heat burning the hand of the person that retrieved it. This miracle was later officially recognised as such by the Roman Catholic Church, and a large pilgrimage chapel was built where the house had stood. Every year, thousands of Catholics take part in the Stille Omgang, or procession to the place of the miracle. Holland, meanwhile, was in the midst of the Friso-Hollandic Wars, as the Counts of Holland continued their efforts to conquer nearby Friesland in the Battle of Warns. In 1345 William IV, Count of Holland, prepared a military action to conquer Middle Frisia, crossing the Zuiderzee with a large fleet and with the help of French and Flemish knights, some of whom had just returned from crusade. He set sail in Enkhuizen, together with his uncle John of Beaumont, and landed near Stavoren and Laaxum and planned to use the Sint-Odulphus monastery near Stavoren as a fortification. The Hollandic knights wore armour, but had no horses as there wasn't enough room in the ships, which were full of building materials and supplies. William's troops set fire to the abandoned villages of Laaxum and Warns and started to advance towards Stavoren. In the countryside around Warns the Hollandic count was attacked by the local inhabitants. With their heavy armour the knights were no match for the furious Frisian farmers and fishermen. As they fled they entered a swamp where they were decisively beaten. Their commander William IV of Holland was killed, and was succeeded by his sister Margaret of Holland, wife of Louis IV. When John of Beaumont heard what had happened, he ordered a retreat back to the ships. They were pursued by the Frisians and most did not make it back. Count William's death in this battle paved the way for the Hook and Cod wars, and 26 September, the day of the battle, remains a national holiday in Friesland today. = Italy = The Battle of Gamenario, fought on 22 April, was a decisive battle of the wars between the Guelfs (Angevins) and Ghibellines (Lombards). It took place in north-west Italy in what is now part of the commune of Santena about 15 km southeast of Turin. Reforza d'Agoult was sent in the spring of 1345 by Joanna of Anjou, viceroy to northern Italy in hopes of putting an end to the war with the Margravate of Montferrat. Reforza conquered Alba and besieged Gamenario, a castle in the neighbourhood of Santena. Lombard Ghibellines formed an anti- Angevin alliance, headed by John II, Marquess of Montferrat. On 22 April, he confronted Reforza d'Agoult and battle was joined. The meeting was brief and bloody. Initially uncertain, the outcome was a victory for the Ghibellines, who recovered the besieged fortress and dealt a severe blow to Angevin influence in Piedmont. To celebrate his victory, John built a new church in Asti in honour of Saint George, near whose feast day the battle was won. Saint George held a special place for the men of chivalry of the Medieval, because he was the Saint that killed the dragon and was therefore held in a warrior cult. In the aftermath, Piedmont was partitioned between the victors. John received Alba, Acqui Terme, Ivrea, and Valenza. Luchino Visconti received Alessandria and the House of Savoy (related to the Palaiologos of Montferrat) received Chieri. The Angevins lost almost complete control of the region and many formerly French cities declared themselves independent. The defeat of the Angevins was also a defeat for Angevin-supported Manfred V, Marquess of Saluzzo and the civil war in that margraviate was ended at Gamenario.Giuseppe Cerrato: \\"In Atti della Società ligure di storia patria\\" – S. 2, vol. 17 (1885), p. 382–542«Studi Piemontesi»: VII (1978), 2, pp. 341–51 Joan I of Naples, possibly involved in an assassination in 1345 Andrew, Duke of Calabria, was assassinated by conspiracy in 1345. He had been appointed joint heir with his wife, Joan I, to the throne of Naples by the Pope. This, however, sat ill with the Neapolitan people and nobles; nor was Joan content to share her sovereignty. With the approval of Pope Clement VI, Joan was crowned as sole monarch of Naples in August 1344. Fearing for his life, Andrew wrote to his mother Elizabeth that he would soon flee the kingdom. She intervened, and made a state visit; before she returned to Hungary, she bribed Pope Clement to reverse himself and permit the coronation of Andrew. She also gave a ring to Andrew, which was supposed to protect him from death by blade or poison, and returned with a false sense of security to Hungary. Thus, in 1345, hearing of the Pope's reversal, a group of noble conspirators (probably including Queen Joan) determined to forestall Andrew's coronation. During a hunting trip at Aversa, Andrew left his room in the middle of the night and was set upon by the conspirators. A treacherous servant barred the door behind him; and as Joan cowered in their bed, a terrible struggle ensued, Andrew defending himself furiously and shrieking for aid. He was finally overpowered, strangled with a cord, and flung from a window. The horrible deed would taint the rest of Joan's reign. Other events in Italy in 1345 include Ambrogio Lorenzetti's painting of a map of the world for the palace at Siena. The painting has since been lost, but the instruments which he used to make it still survive, giving insights into mapmaking techniques of the day.Kupfer, M; \\"The lost wheel map of Ambrogio Lorenzetti\\", The Art Bulletin, June 1996. Retrieved 2 January 2007. The Peruzzi family, a big banking family and precursor to the Medici family went bankrupt in 1345, and in 1345 Florence was the scene of an attempted strike by wool combers (ciompi). A few decades later they would rise in a full-scale revolt. In Verona, Mastino II della Scala began the construction of his Scaliger Tomb, an architectural structure still standing today.  Sweden and Lithuania  Coin bearing the image of Algirdas, who gained the Duchy of Lithuania from his brother in 1345 In Sweden and states bordering the Baltic Sea, the oldest surviving manuscript from the first Swedish law to be put to paper is from c. 1345, although earlier versions probably existed. The law was created for the young town Stockholm's customs, but it was also used in Lödöse and probably in a few other towns, as well. No town was allowed to use the law without the formal permission by the Swedish king. Its use may have become more widespread if it had not been superseded by the new town law by King Magnus Eriksson (1316–1374). The term Bjarkey Laws was however used for a long time for Magnus Eriksson's law in various locations. Records also exist for the emigration of Swedes to Estonia in this year. Early mentions of Swedes in Estonia came in 1341 and 1345 (when an Estonian monastery in Padise sold \\"the Laoküla Estate\\" and Suur-Pakri Island to a group of Swedes). During the 13th through 15th centuries, large numbers of Swedes arrived in coastal Estonia from Finland, which was under Swedish control (and would remain so for hundreds of years), often settling on Church-owned land. 1345 marked the end of a series of skirmishes begun in the 1343 St. George's Night Uprising. The rebellion, which was by this time limited to the island of Saaremaa, was stifled in 1345. After the rebellion Denmark sold its domains in Estonia to the Teutonic Order in 1346. The fighting had started as a protest by indigenous Estonians to Danish and German rule. Parts of Estonia such as the city of Valga suffered raids from the nearby Lithuanian rulers. In Lithuania in 1345 Grand Duke Jaunutis was deposed by his brothers. Very little is known about years when Jaunutis ruled except that they were quite peaceful years, as the Teutonic Knights were led by ineffective Ludolf König. The Bychowiec Chronicle mentions that Jaunutis was supported by Jewna, presumed wife of Gediminas and mother of his children. She died ca. 1344 and soon after Jaunutis lost his throne. If he was indeed protected by his mother, then it would be an interesting example of influence held by queen mother in pagan Lithuania. However, a concrete stimulus might have been a major reise planned by the Teutonic Knights in 1345.  Balkans  Serbian Emperor Stefan Dušan. In 1345, the Byzantine civil war continued. Having exploited the conflict to expand his realm into Macedonia, following the conquest of Serres Stefan Uroš IV Dušan of Serbia proclaimed himself \\"Tsar of the Serbs and Romans\\". By the end of the year, his Serbian Empire included all of Macedonia, except for Thessalonica, and all of Albania, except for Dyrrhachium, held by the Angevins. The first known line of Serbian text written in the Latin alphabet is dated to this year. Serbia was recognized as the most powerful empire in the Balkans for the next several years. The Byzantine civil war also allowed the emergence of a local quasi-independent principality in the Rhodope, headed by the Bulgarian brigand Momchil, who had switched his allegiance from John VI Kantakouzenos to the regency in Constantinople. On 7 July, the army of Umur Beg, the Turkish emir of Aydin and Kantakouzenos' chief ally, met and defeated Momchil's forces at Peritheorion. Momchil himself was killed in the battle.Lemerle, P. L'emirat d'Aydin..., p.210, 217 On 11 June, Alexios Apokaukos, the driving force behind the Constantinopolitan regency and main instigator of the civil war, was murdered. His demise led to a wave of defections to the Kantakouzenist camp, most prominently his own son, John Apokaukos, the governor of Thessalonica. He plotted to surrender the city to Kantakouzenos, and had the leader of the Zealots, a certain Michael Palaiologos, killed. The Zealots however reacted violently: in a popular uprising, led by Andreas Palaiologos, they overpowered Apokaukos and killed or expelled most of the city's remaining aristocrats. The events are described by Demetrius Cydones: > ...one after another the prisoners were hurled from the walls of the citadel > and hacked to pieces by the mob of the Zealots assembled below. Then > followed a hunt for all the members of the upper classes: they were driven > through the streets like slaves, with ropes round their necks-here a servant > dragged his master, there a slave his purchaser, while the peasant struck > the strategus and the labourer beat the soldier (i.e. the pronoiar).Migne, > Patrologia Graecae, 109. Byzantine Empire in 1328 In 1345, the Greek island of Chios fell to the Genoese Giustiniani. The Genoese also sacked the city of Dvigrad in Istria in this same year. Aquileian patriarchs had for some time fought fiercely against Venetians which had already gained considerable influence on the west coast of Istria. It was during these confrontations that the town fell.  Anatolian Peninsula  In 1344, Hugh IV of Cyprus joined a league with Venice and the Knights Hospitaller which burnt a Turkish fleet in Smyrna and captured the city. In 1345 the allies defeated the Turks at Imbros by land and sea, but Hugh could see little benefit for his kingdom in these endeavors and withdrew from the league. Meanwhile, Umur Beg transformed the Beylik of Aydınoğlu into a serious naval power with base in İzmir and posed a threat particularly for Venetian possessions in the Aegean Sea. The Venetians organized an alliance uniting several European parties (Sancta Unio), composed notably of the Knights Hospitaller, which organized five consecutive attacks on İzmir and the Western Anatolian coastline controlled by Turkish states. In between, it was the Turks who organized maritime raids directed at Aegean islands. John XIV sparked the civil conflict when he convinced the Empress that John V's rule was threatened by the ambitions of Kantakouzenos. In September 1341, whilst Kantakouzenos was in Thrace, Kalekas declared himself as regent and launched a vicious attack on Kantakouzenos, his supporters & family. In October Anna ordered Kantakouzenos to resign his command. Kantakouzenos not only refused, he declared himself Emperor at Didymoteichon, allegedly to protect John V's rule from Kalekas. Whether or not Kantakouzenos wished to be Emperor is not known, but the provocative actions of the Patriarch forced Kantakouzenos to fight to retain his power and start the civil war. There were not nearly enough troops to defend Byzantium's borders at the time and there certainly was not enough for the two factions to split – consequently, more foreigners would flood the Empire into a state of chaos – Kantakouzenos hired Turks and Serbs – his main supply of Turkish mercenaries came from the Umur of Aydin, a nominal ally established by Andronikos III. The Regency of John V relied on Turkish mercenaries as well. However, Kantakouzenos began to draw support from the Ottoman Sultan Orkhan, who wed Kantakouzenos' daughter in 1345. By 1347, Kantakouzenos had triumphed and entered Constantinople. However, in his hour of victory, he came to an accord with Anna and her son, John V. John V (now 15 years of age) and Kantakouzenos would rule as co-emperors, though John V would be the junior in this relationship. The unlikely peace would not last long.

In 2002, in a research project at the University of California, Berkeley alongside Scott Lederer and Jennifer Mankoff, the team developed a conceptual model exploring the tangibility and accessibility of everyday end-user privacy in ubicomp environments. The model takes considerations from societal influences, contextual factors, and subjectivity to develop a far-reaching scope for ubicomp privacy. The model was then used to explore an interactional metaphor called situational faces, which makes the issue of privacy in ubiquitous computing environments more accessible to users. This facade presents an abstraction of advanced privacy settings to allow users to more easily establish their preferences. = Smart Homes and Intelligent Environments = In 2006,https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~anind/publications.html Dey developed a research paper alongside Min Kyung Lee, Scott Davidoff, and John Zimmerman, all of Carnegie Mellon University, exploring and evaluating the usage of home automation technology and their effects on family life. As a collaboration between the School of Design and the Human-Computer Interaction Institute, the research sought to uncover areas of human-centered design that could complement family life, thus providing insight on the potential roles a smart home could play. Following a heuristic design process, the team interviewed dual-income families in their own homes, gauging cultural and ethnographic information, leading to the generation and experimentation of a design concept. The study concluded that such accommodations would allow families to avoid breakdowns in developed routines and improve emotional connectivity between family members and the home, while allowing parents to devote more time and attention to children. = Context Awareness and Self-Monitoring Technologies = In 2010,https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~anind/publications.html Dey, alongside Dana Pavel and Vic Callaghan of the School of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering at the University of Essex, evaluated and presented a highly interfaced system for users to understand and express their own lifestyles and habits through an analysis of compiled data into a story-based representation. Initial findings of the research suggested that data generated from a user base recording a user's daily activity reveals actionable personal goals that a user can draw from to improve their lifestyle. This research, presented at the 6th International Conference on Intelligent Environments in 2010, retrieved data from a number of devices and methods, including a Garmin Forerunner fitness monitor, a heart monitor, mobile phone usage data, and Internet history.

It designed several skyscrapers and mansions including three of the current ten tallest buildings in Kansas City; the Kansas City Power and Light Building, 909 Walnut, and Oak Tower. History The history of Hoit, Price & Barnes has its roots in Boston when Harvard graduates William R. Ware and Henry Van Brunt established the firm of Ware & Van Brunt in 1864. Frank M. Howe joined the firm in 1868. When Ware became founding chair of the School of Architecture at Columbia University in 1881, the firm became Van Brunt & Howe. They opened a branch office in Kansas City in 1887. Van Brunt died in 1903. In 1904, the Kansas City firm of Howe, Hoit & Cutler was established when Howe partnered with employees Henry F. Hoit and William H. Cutler, both graduates of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). In 1901, Van Brunt & Howe received the commission to design the Palace of Varied Industries building at the St. Louis World’s Fair. Cutler was head draftsman and recommended they hire Hoit to take charge of the job. Hoit was his former classmate at MIT and was living in Boston at the time. Soon after, Van Brunt retired, creating the firm of Howe, Hoit & Cutler. It became Howe & Hoit in 1907 when Cutler died of typhoid fever. Howe died in 1909. Hoit was on his own until 1913 when he partnered with another MIT graduate, Edwin M. Price. Alfred E. Barnes joined the partnership on January 1, 1919 and the firm of Hoit, Price & Barnes was born. R. A. Long the wealthy lumber baron, was impressed with Hoit's work on the Varied Industries building. This began a long business relationship with Hoit and his partners designing the Independence Boulevard Christian Church, of which Long was a member; the R. A. Long Building, one of Kansas City’s first steel framed skyscrapers; Long’s home at Corinthian Hall which is now the Kansas City Museum; Longview Farm, his country estate; Christian Church Hospital; and even Long’s mausoleum. They also designed the Mack B. Nelson house when Nelson was Vice-President of the Long-Bell Lumber Company. When the full 28 stories of the Bell Telephone Building was completed in 1929, it was the tallest building in Kansas City. Then the 34 story Kansas City Power and Light Building was completed in 1931, making it the tallest building in the state of Missouri, a title it held until 1976.

The title includes the Ostfriesen (\\"East Friesian\\") and Alt- Oldenburger (\\"Old-Oldenburger\\"), Groningen, and similar horses from Silesia, Saxony-Thuringia, and Bavaria. Breeds like the Hungarian Nonius, Kladruber, and Cleveland Bay are also often classed as \\"heavy warmbloods.\\" They are the ancestors of the modern warmbloods, and are typically bred by preservation groups to fit the pre-World War I model of the all-purpose utility horse. Unlike the registries of the sport horses that followed them, many heavy warmblood registries maintain closed or partly closed studbooks. However, external evaluation and performance testing of the breeding stock is still a key element in these registries. Many of the heavy warmbloods are selected primarily for family-friendly temperaments. Common foundation European horses in the Middle Ages could fall into several categories, though as a group they were likely common, small, and primitive by modern standards. There were small, hardy farm horses, smooth-stepping saddle horses, quicker \\"coursers\\", and a very few highly prized, powerful destriers. As the availability of firearms grew, heavily armored knights and their heavy mounts became impractical \\"relics of the past.\\" The Spanish horses, ancestors of the Andalusian, the Danish Frederiksborg, and the Neapolitan horse were particularly popular among the German nobility during the 17th and 18th centuries. As they collected these stallions, the residents bred them to their native mares, setting a foundation we would identify today as \\"baroque\\". From this base of thick, primarily dark-colored horses, the Groningen, Friesian, East Friesian, and Oldenburg would eventually be born. Ostfriesen and Alt- Oldenburger The most famous of the heavy warmbloods was the Oldenburg. Today's Oldenburg is bred for sport, and so the old type is designated as such: Alt-Oldenburger. The history of the Oldenburg is almost indistinguishable from that of horses bred in nearby East Frisia. Though there are two names (Old-Oldenburg and East Friesian), the horse is quite the same, having always exchanged genetic material. The plow horses of the Frisian marshes had to be powerful to work through the heavy soil, and so were significantly heavier than farm horses in other parts of Europe. Organized horse breeding began in Oldenburg under Count Anton Günther (1603–1667), who brought popular stallions from Spain, Italy, Turkey, and Poland. Later on, Cleveland Bays were introduced as well, and the result was a solid, good- natured mare base from which came the Karossier. The Karossier were considered luxury items, noble carriage horses with high-stepping gaits, and so they were purchased by State Studs for use in other regions of Germany, but were also sent to Poland, Austria and Hungary, France, Denmark, and the Netherlands. War and the appearance of the horse-powered tractor in the 20th century increased the demand for heavier horses, which Oldenburg and East Frisia supplied. By the 1960s, such horses were obsolete, and their breeders had to adapt. From these horses was born the modern Oldenburg, and the old types were in danger of disappearing. In the 1980s a new preservation society was formed, and with the help of horses from Poland, Denmark, the Netherlands and Moritzburg State Stud, the breed was saved. Today there are 20 approved stallions and 160 broodmares, all primarily black or dark bay in color. They are powerful and sound, but very gentle horses. Alt-Württemberger In 1866, the advisory board of the Principal and State Stud of Marbach presented a plan to breed an economical horse for Württemberg - a warmblood suitable for agriculture. While actively modeled after the popular Oldenburg, the original Württemberger, now known as the Alt-Württemberger (Old Württemberger), was influenced by Anglo- Norman and East Prussian stock, and occasional Arabian horse bloodlines were added as well. The goal was to produce a horse ideal for the \\"Master and Farmer\\", inexpensive to feed, diligent and powerful at the plow. One hundred years after the first warmbloods were bred at Marbach, the direction changed from practical farm horse to high-performance sport horse. This horse became today's modern Württemberger. The original breed was saved by the formation of the Association for the Preservation of the Old-Württemberger Horses in 1988. Today there are 8 stallions and 55 mares, though the breed is receiving federal support. The brand is the hart's horn with three prongs on the left hip. Like other heavy warmblood breeds, the Alt-Wurttemburger is good-natured and affable, hard to unnerve but easy to motivate. They stand somewhat smaller than their riding horse counterparts, between 155 and 165 cm at the withers. They are predominantly bay, brown, chestnut, and occasionally grey. The head should be medium-sized, dry and expressive; the body of cob-type substance with a long shoulder and slightly-sloping croup. The hooves should be strong and hard. The breed is especially valuable as a leisure and family horse, given its easygoing nature and long lifespan. Rottaler The Rottaler was originally bred in the Rott valley of Bavaria, and was used as the foundation for the Bavarian Warmblood. Systematic breeding in the region dates back to 1558, when the first duke, Albrecht IV, imported popular Neapolitan and Spanish stallions. As a result of highly organized breeding efforts - the earliest exterior evaluations directed breeding and prizes or \\"premiums\\" were offered to bribe breeders not to export the best horses - by the 1800s visitors took great notice of the Rottal horses. In keeping with the times, Rottalers were expected to be versatile enough to pull the plow during the week and the carriage to church on Sundays. Throughout the 19th century, Anglo-Norman, Cleveland bay and Oldenburg horses were imported to keep the Rottaler vibrant, and by 1906 the Rottaler Warmblood Horse Breeding Association was formed. In 1963, the breeding aim was redirected towards the production of more agile, sensitive riding horses, and the brand was changed from \\"R\\" to \\"B\\". The Rottaler mares were bred to Hanoverians and Westphalians, and over successive generations, the breed threatened to disappear forever. It wasn't until 1991 that the Rottaler was re-established within the Bavarian association, and by that time there were scant few lines left. However, what struck the spectators at the first inspection of Rottaler mares in 1994 was the vitality of the mares, which had an average age of over 15. Today there are only a few Rottalers left, but about 20 breeders in Bavaria are actively preserving the breed and the breed receives federal support. Rottalers are similar to the other heavy warmbloods in type, though due to consistent use of Arab blood, they have more refined heads. They are excellent all-purpose ride- and-drive horses, with sufficient talent in dressage and jumping. They are promoted as a good choice for vaulting horses. Heavy Warmbloods in Saxony and Thuringia While the heavy warmbloods of the north-west and south have distinct identities, these horses were bred all over Germany and well-beyond. One stronghold for heavy warmbloods has been Moritzburg, the State Stud that serves Saxony and Thuringia. During the last quarter of the 19th century and the first quarter of the 20th century, two-thirds of the state stallion roster was made up of Oldenburg sires. The descendants of these stallions were saved from mandatory castration by State Equerry Dr. Herta Steiner, and through her efforts and those of dedicated breeders, the heavy warmbloods were saved. The blood proved to be vitally important, as these horses were used to improve the stock elsewhere. While the primary registries are the Horse Breeders' Associations of Saxony-Thuringia and Saxony-Anhalt and Thuringia, this studbook has proven to be the most liberal, accepting heavy warmbloods registered in Westphalia, Baden-Wurttemberg, Weser-Ems, Bavaria, and Berlin- Brandenburg. The goal of this policy is to identify and promote any and all remaining heavy warmblood horses. The heavy warmblood makes up 15-25% of the horse population in Saxony and Thuringia, which attests to the program's efficacy. As of 2005 there were 51 stallions and 1140 mares. The registry institutes the same studbook inspection process, aiming for a powerful, elegant horse about 15.2hh with an active, efficient trot, longevity, soundness, and an even temperament. While greys and chestnuts are permitted, discretely marked black, brown, and dark bay horses are preferred. Heavy warmbloods bred at Moritzburg are just as suitable for driving and leisure as those bred elsewhere. Groningen The Groningen horse was originally bred in the Groningen region of the Netherlands to perform agricultural work in the heavy soil. They were influenced by the other heavy warmblood breeds of Frisia: Ostfriesen, Oldenburgers, and Holsteiners. From 1897 to 1942 they were managed by the Gronings Paardenstamboek (\\"Groninger Studbook\\" abbreviated GrPs), after which time they were united with the rather lighter Ostfriesen in the North-Netherlands Warmblood Horse Studbook (NWP). In 1969 the NWP merged with the Gelderlander breeding society to form the KWPN, or Royal Warmblood Horse Studbook of the Netherlands. Dutch horses would thenceforth be bred as competitive riding or driving horses. Groningen mares were successively crossed with Anglo-Norman, Holsteiner, and Hanoverian horses to produce a more refined riding horse, today's Dutch Warmblood. The original Groningen would have been lost but for the efforts of a few breeders and enthusiasts. A private association, \\"Het Groninger Paard\\" or The Groningen Horse, was formed in 1982 and recognized by royal decree in 1985. Today there are 25 stallions and over 400 mares, most of which are black, brown, or dark bay. There are rather fewer light bays, even fewer chestnuts, and a handful of greys, sabinos, and tobianos. Groningen horses are known for their steady temperaments, longevity, and low-maintenance constitutions. Gelderlander The Gelderlander was originally bred in the Gelderland region of the Netherlands. Although geographically close to Groningen, the soil in Gelderland is much sandier and does not require a horse with the same power as the Groningen horse. While breeders in Groningen used other horses bred on the heavy Frisian soil - the Alt-Oldenburger, East Friesian, and Holsteiner - those in Gelderland more often used half-bred French stallions as outcrosses. Therefore, Gelderlanders were and remain significantly longer-legged than their northern cousins, though they have the same high-set necks and level toplines. In 1964, the VLN, which managed the Gelderlander studbook, formed a \\"Sportregister\\" in hopes of accelerating the Gelderlander towards a more marketable riding horse type. The successive merger with the NWP in 1969 - forming the Royal Warmblood Horse Studbook of the Netherlands or KWPN - further convoluted the identities of the Gelderlander and Groningen. After a few years, the breeding direction for foundation horses was dissolved and the Gelderlander would have been entirely absorbed into the new Dutch Warmblood and Dutch Harness Horse. The KWPN oversees the breeding of Gelderlander horses today. There are 12 approved sires in the Netherlands. Unlike most of the other heavy warmblood breeds, the Gelderlander is overwhelmingly chestnut with a great deal of white. As they were lighter horses to begin with, there are many Gelderlander and part-Gelderlander horses with exceptional performance in dressage, show jumping and combined driving. Of course, the descendant of Gelderlanders, the Dutch Warmblood, is a dominant force in sport. The Gelderlander is considered to be a more amateur-friendly horse.

The offensive team is moving from right to left. The torpedoes are marked T, halfbacks are marked H, the defenseman, or libero is marked D, and the goaltender is marked G. The torpedo system is an ice hockey on-ice system first used by the Swedish team Djurgårdens IF. The coach of Djurgårdens IF, Hardy Nilsson, took the system with him and it was used extensively by the Swedish national hockey team in international competition. The system converts the traditional hockey layout of three forwards and two defensemen, into two torpedoes up front, two halfbacks, and one lone defenceman (or libero). The torpedoes are responsible for forechecking in the corners when the puck is in the offensive zone, and stay around the neutral zone to be sprung into a scoring position (by a stretch pass or torpedo pass). The halfbacks are all-purpose players that run the offense from the faceoff circles in the offensive zone, and defend against the other team's torpedoes. The libero protects the rear of the ice. The system is used in international hockey by the Swedish team, due to the large ice surface, and the lack of a two-line pass offside (which would stop play with a two-line pass). It contrasted the neutral zone trap, which was popular in the 1990s, and which stifled fast skating and playmaking by crowding the neutral zone with players. The system was originated by the Boston Bruins of the late 1950s; it was later adopted by the Chicago Blackhawks during the 1960s. The torpedo mode could not be completely implemented in the National Hockey League until 2005 when the red line was eliminated, allowing for two- line passes to spring the torpedoes. The system was used to describe the Swedish national men's hockey team's approach during the 2002 Winter Games, which was punctuated by a preliminary 5-2 win over the eventual gold-medal winning Canadian team.

Early life Davis was born in Duxbury, Vermont, and, as a child, worked as a groundskeeper and attended school. His mother died in 1861, after which he lived with Samuel Cook Turner. He worked as a lawnmower salesman in Asbury Park, New Jersey, during the summer of 1870.The History of F. A. Davis from the F. A. Davis Company web site. By 1872, he earned $30 per month as a teacher.Hartzell, pp. 51-52. Davis relocated to Philadelphia and worked as an agent for several publishing firms. He married Lizzie Fritz and their son, Alonzo, was born in 1873.Hartzell, p. 52. In 1879, he was working as an agent for the largest medical publisher in the world, William Wood and Company when he formed his own publishing company, F. A. Davis Company. Similar to William Wood, Davis's company specialized in publishing medical material including medical studies. Davis's first wife died in the 1880s. Florida On April 29, 1885, Davis attended an American Medical Association meeting which included a study about the benefits of the Pinellas peninsula. Davis eventually published the study and, in 1889, he travelled to Tarpon Springs, Florida. He felt improvement in his muscular rheumatism and advertised for Florida in one of his medical journals. In Tarpon Springs he met Jacob Disston, the brother of Florida land baron Hamilton Disston. Davis and Disston combined to bring electricity to Tarpon Springs in 1895.Hartzell, p. 53. In the same year, Davis married Elizabeth Irene Craven. Electricity had little impact on Tarpon Springs, so Davis received an electricity franchise from St. Petersburg on February 2, 1897, and moved his plant there. St. Petersburg's first wood-powered electrical service was initiated on August 5, 1897. On February 4, 1902, Davis was granted a trolley franchise by St. Petersburg. He paid for trolley construction with funding from Jacob Disston and others, and by purchasing and re-selling the city's phone system. Trolley construction began on May 30, 1904, and operation began four months later. In 1905, he expanded the trolley system to Disston City. Through his publishing company, Davis promoted the area with Florida magazine in 1905 and two books in 1906. Continuing to expand his influence in St. Petersburg, Davis tore down the Brantley Pier and built the Electric Pier in 1906.Hartzell, p. 54.History from The Pier web site. He paid $80,000 for a 500-passenger steamboat named Favorite which first arrived on October 17, 1906, and was a popular attraction at the Electric Pier. Davis's progress – and St. Petersburg's in general – was hampered when Tampa tycoon Henry B. Plant purchased the city's lifeline, the Orange Belt Railroad, in 1906. Davis was dealt another blow by the banking panic of 1907. Two years later, he shifted control of much of his St. Petersburg holdings to his occasional rival, H. Walter Fuller. After a conflict over St. Petersburg waterfront area, Davis purchased of Hamilton Disston's land around 1911 and established the city of Pinellas Park. Davis, his son, and P. J. McDevitt advertised the new city, drawing people from Pennsylvania and Ohio. McDevitt became the city's first mayor. Davis sold a free lot in Pinellas Park for every ten-acre farm purchased, resulting in 111 farm sales from 1910 to 1912. Lack of drainage in Pinellas Park caused problems in August 1915, when of rain fell. Davis died in Philadelphia from heart failure, reportedly due to World War I and concern over his estate. Jacob Disston closed out Davis's remaining holdings in Florida while his wife, Elizabeth, remained involved with F. A. Davis Company until her death in 1964.

Education and Medical career  In 1877 he obtained his doctorate from the University of Breslau, where he was a student of Michael Anton Biermer (1827-1892). Later he became professor at Jena (1886) and Dorpat (1888), where he resigned in 1892 for political reasons, and became director of the city hospital at Magdeburg-Sudenburg, until his retirement in 1911. During this time he also served as president of the Magdeburg Medical Society, and as editor of the Zentralblatt für innere Medizin. Unverricht published over fifty medical works, including Studien über die Lungenentzündung, his prize-winning doctorate thesis on pneumonia.  Research  Heinrich Unverricht is most remembered for his research of epilepsy, especially his work with progressive myoclonus epilepsies (PME). In 1891 he described a form of PME that was later come to be known as \\"Unverricht- Lundborg disease\\" (sometimes referred also as \\"Wagner–Unverricht syndrome\\".). Equally notable, however, following Wagner (1863) and Virchow's (1866) initial clinical descriptions, in 1891 he developed the concept of an intimate connection between rash and muscle weakness that defined a new disorder: > \\"...it seems to me that the skin appearance plays such an important role in > the disease picture that the designation Polymyositis is not completely > accurate. In our case, the partnership of the skin and muscle disease allows > us to use the elocution Dermatomyositis...\\" (translation).

He headed the company’s legal department and represented Mikhail Khodorkovsky when the Kremlin accused the oil tycoon and his managers of money laundering and embezzlement in 2006. Aleksanyan was arrested and charged as an accomplice to tax evasion and money laundering. After refusing to allegedly provide false evidence against other Yukos executives, he served two years in prison while suffering from advanced cancer and AIDS. After a decision by European Court of Human Rights, he was released on a bond on 12 January 2009, dying from complications of AIDS on 2 October 2011. Lawyer and businessman Vasily Aleksanyan graduated from Moscow State University and the Law School of Harvard University as a Master of Laws. In 1992 through 1994 he worked for the USA law firm Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton. In 1995–1996 he was the head of the legal department for the British Investment firm SUN Group. Since 1996 he worked as the head of the legal department for Yukos. On 1 April 2006, amidst the legal troubles over Yukos company, his position was elevated to that of Executive Vice President. His new position was accepted by the shareholders on 4 April. His main stated goal in the new role was to streamline the corporate governance, achieving direct control over the assets of the company from the London Yukos headquarters bypassing the Moscow based offices of Yukos RM and Yukos EP. The decision was quite important for the struggling company as the Moscow-based offices bluntly refused all the supervision from London obeying orders of the government-controlled Rosneft instead. According to Aleksanyan, the lost control over the Moscow offices led to financial irregularities, including e.g. surfacing of counterfeit 10 billion ruble promissory note. On 6 April 2006 Aleksanyan was taken into custody as a suspected accomplice to tax evasion and money laundering by Yukos. According to prosecutors, Aleksanyan was an accomplice to the embezzlement of more than 12 billion rubles. The arrest was based on the testimonies of Svetlana Bakhmina, a subordinate of Aleksanyan arrested in 2004. According to Aleksanyan, Bakhmina's testimonies were false, and were taken from her under pressure. In prison After his arrest Aleksanyan started a hunger strike, insisting that his arrest without court hearings was illegal. He aborted his strike on 27 April 2006. During Aleksanyan's imprisonment, his health rapidly deteriorated due to HIV-related illnesses. He became almost blind and developed cancer of the liver with metastasis into the lymph nodes. He also became ill with tuberculosis. Despite the grave medical situation demanding urgent antiretroviral treatment and chemotherapy in a hospital, he was denied both. The prosecutors also ignored three injunctions by the European Court of Human Rights on 27 November 2007, on 6 December 2007 and on 20 December 2007. According to Aleksanyan, the prosecutors are demanding false evidence against other Yukos executives from him before starting his medical treatment. On 26 December Aleksanyan made public a statement asking for help from human rights advocates. Eleven days into a hunger strike in his favour by Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Aleksanyan was transferred from a pre-trial prison to an oncological hospital on 8 February 2008.Бывший вице-президент \\"ЮКОСа\\" Алексанян переведён из СИЗО в специализированную клинику (Former Yukos vice-president transferred from pre- trial prison to hospital) (in Russian). Echo of Moscow. 8 February 2008. On 20 October 2008 Simonovsky Court of Moscow approved continuing pre-trial detention of Alexanyan despite his grave illnesses (he had cancer, tuberculosis and AIDS and his spleen was surgically removed). On 8 December 2008 Moscow City Court reversed the decision of Simonovsky Court and decided to release Alexanyan under a bond of 50 million rubles (approximately $2 million). He was to be released after the money was paid. Human rights advocates Lev Ponomaryov and Lyudmila Alexeyeva welcomed the court decision but expressed concern whether Alexanyan would be able to pay this sum of money. Release and death On 22 December 2008 European Court of Human Rights made its decision over the Aleksanyan v. Russia case. The court found Russia in violation of four articles of European Convention on Human Rights and obliged Russia to release Alexanyan immediately without any bond. On 12 January 2009, after a bond of 50 million rubles was paid, Aleksanyan was released.Алексанян выписан из больницы But he was repeatedly summoned to attend court hearings, where he wore a face mask and could barely stand up during the proceedings.

The sites offer users their personal credit reports from Experian on the condition that they sign up for Experian's Triple Advantage credit monitoring program for a fee. The credit report also comes with the user's PLUS credit score. The membership may be canceled with no charge within 7 days of signup by contacting the call center. Controversy FreeCreditReport.com as well as its affiliate site FreeCreditScore.com has been the subject of two major lawsuits. In 2005, the site's owner, Experian Consumer Direct, was sued by the Federal Trade Commission for deceptive marketing tactics. They settled for $950,000 in the form of free credit monitoring for those affected and agreed not to use deceptive and misleading claims about free offers and to offer full disclosure of terms and conditions of any free offers. The penalty was largely seen as ineffective since it amounted to a small fraction of the $72 million annual advertising budget for FreeCreditReport.com. They were further subjected to a 2006 inquiry by the Florida Attorney General for violating Florida's Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act. An MSNBC.com investigation of the website called it \\"misleading\\", \\"deceptive\\" and a \\"scam\\". The program has also been identified as a scam by ConsumerFraudReporting.org.\\"A Free Credit Score Followed by a Monthly Bill\\" article by Ron Lieber in The New York Times November 2, 2009 The advertising practices of FreeCreditReport.com were specifically addressed in the Credit CARD Act of 2009. Now any company who advertises a 'free credit report' on TV or radio must include the statement: \\"This is not the free credit report provided for by Federal law.\\" The law also calls for the Federal Trade Commission to issue new rules that will force free credit report advertisers to inform consumers that the only place for a free credit report is AnnualCreditReport.com. Advertising =Singing ad campaign= In October 2007, Experian Consumer Direct began airing an advertising campaign featuring singer Eric Violette as a man struggling with difficult life circumstances due to his poor credit score, and his ignorance of it. The commercials feature jingles written using various distinctive forms of popular music. To date the company has aired nine different commercials, which have aired in different orders in different markets. The commercials featuring Violette and his band stopped airing in February 2010, as a new band was brought in. In June 2012, the original band returned in new commercials for FreeCreditScore.com as a part of a \\"comeback\\" campaign. The themes/motifs of the commercials include, in order: * Pirate-themed Western restaurant * Living with in-laws * Used car * Bicycle riding * Rockstars pool party * Renaissance fair * Roller coaster * Small town / cell phone shop * Country bar in Reno Most feature references to the original \\"Pirate\\" commercial; either lyrically, or by including it as part of the background. Most also feature an elderly woman, who in the later commercials is disapproving of the group. Violette was born June 12, 1981 in Montreal and attended the National Theatre School of Canada in 2002. The commercials prepared by David Muhlenfeld at The Martin Agency began appearing in October 2007. Due to Violette's Canadian French accent, his voice has been dubbed by the jingles' composer in the United States. He earlier did a Sirius Satellite Radio commercial in French. When asked about his character by the Washington Post, Violette said that \\"He's a guy who has a lot of dreams and hopes. But he's not able to make them concrete because I think he's a little bit lazy. He's the kind of guy who always has bad luck . . . but I'm sure he has a good heart.\\" The commercials have spawned various homages including many parodies on YouTube. MADtv parodied the ads in a sketch that featured a young man cursed by bad luck after getting a credit card in his senior year of high school. After racking up $80,000 in debt, he ends up in jail, escapes and eventually winds up living with a skinhead named Fang \\"in a soggy cardboard box\\". In response to the commercials, the Federal Trade Commission produced two public service announcements to remind citizens of the right to annual free credit reports from annualcreditreport.com. =Freecreditscore band campaign= In May 2010 a nationwide band search began to find the new face of freecreditscore.com. Live auditions were held in New York, Chicago and Los Angeles. Bands could also submit videos of themselves online at freecreditscoreband.com for consideration. Many were typical entries, but some bands, apparently as a joke, submitted videos as well, most notably Comparative Anatomy. In August 2010 The American Secrets (Formerly known as \\"Victorious Secrets\\", but changed the name to avoid any possible legal issues with Victoria's Secret) were named the new FCS Band. The band features Daniel Zott of Dale Earnhardt Jr. Jr. Unlike the first band, who sang about finding themselves in bad credit situations, the new band sang instead about other people in bad credit situations, while simply being part of the background. =Original band returns= On June 15, 2012, freecreditscore.com released a new commercial that featured the return of the original band. FCS Commercial Themes: * \\"New Spot\\"- featuring the band gone and regrouping, with all members now financially well off. The \\"used sub-compact\\" from the used car commercial, is now pimped out, and the scene from the earlier commercial is reprised. The band is stopped at a light next to attractive women in a red Mustang convertible, but this time, instead of laughing at them as in the previous commercial, the women are now interested because of their financial success. * \\"Set It Off\\"- featuring the band talking about receiving score alerts from the FCS app. The commercial also featured the return of the elderly lady, who frequented the band's older commercials.

Hill had the first run in the four second range (4.990 seconds), which earned him the nickname \\"Four Father of Drag Racing.\\" His other nicknames include \\"The Thrill\\", \\"Holeshot Hill\\", and \\"Fast Eddie\\". In 1960, he set the NHRA record for the largest improvement in the elapsed time (e.t.) when he drove the quarter mile in 8.84 seconds to break the previous 9.40-second record. Hill raced at open competitions and Top Fuel events from 1955 until he retired in 1966. After opening a motorcycle shop, he returned several years later to race motorcycles. He started racing drag boats after attending a drag boat event in 1974 and he won championships in all of the major boat drag racing sanctioning bodies. Hill set the lowest wet elapsed time (e.t.) record with a 5.16-second run, which was lower than the land drag racing record of 5.39 seconds. He quit water drag racing after he suffered broken bones at a crash in Arizona and returned to land drag racing in 1985. Initially underfunded and unsuccessful, Hill set the all-time speed record at a National Hot Rod Association (NHRA) event in 1987, becoming the first person to hold both the land and water speed records simultaneously. In 1993, Hill became the NHRA's oldest Top Fuel champion. When Hill retired in 1999, he had won 12 national season point championships on land or water, and had won more than 100 trophies in motorcycles and 86 drag events between his land and water careers. Racing career In 1947, 11-year-old Hill won the Tri-State Motor Scooter Flat Track championship in Shreveport, Louisiana. After graduating from Longview High School, he graduated from college in 1957 with an industrial technology degree from Texas A&M; University. =Land drag racing= Hill in his Top Fuel dragster in 1966 Hill's entered his first drag race at the Flying Fish Lodge in Karnack, Texas in 1955. Hill drove his home-built hot rod to the track and won the event. The hot rod had a Model T frame and an Oldsmobile V8 engine. In 1958, he built his second dragster using parts that his employer allowed him to scavenge while working as a sales engineer at a foundry in Wichita Falls, Texas. He used the dragster to set the Texas state low elapsed time (e.t.) that year with a 9.93-second pass. The following year, Hill won the state championship with a 9.25-second pass at 161 miles per hour (259 kilometers per hour). Hill won his first national event in 1959 in a Hot Gas race at an American Hot Rod Association (AHRA) national championship event in Great Bend, Kansas. Hill earned $500 for an appearance at Inyokern, California to race Jack Chrisman and his Sidewinder dragster. One of his four passes in the 1960 event set the B/Gas dragster record at 163.04 mph (262.39 km/h), so Hill quit his job to become a full-time drag racer. Later that season he set the a new A/Gas low e.t. at 8.84 seconds and set the speed record in the class at 161.29 mph (259.57 km/h). Hill spent four months designing and seven months building another home-built dragster called the Double Dragon. The machine had two engines, with each engine having its own ring gear and pinion, clutch, and driveshaft. He used four rear racing slick tires in open competitions for faster passes, and two rear slicks in match competitions to produce smokier passes. The machine ripped up the starting line at the 1961 NHRA Nationals at Indianapolis. In 1962, Hill ran two years after Chris Karamesines had the first pass and two years before Don Garlits had the first official pass. A speed or e.t. record is first certified official after it is backed up by a different pass within one percent. Hill built his first Top Fuel dragster in 1963 using a Pontiac engine. He had nearly completed a jet-engine powered ultralight dragster in 1963 when the NHRA outlawed all aircraft engines. He built two more Top Fuel Hemi-powered dragsters before he had an engine fire at Green Valley Race City in 1966. \\"It was one of those fireballs that you couldn't see through,\\" Hill said. \\"I locked up the brakes, and it felt like I needed to turn the wheel to the left, but for some reason, I didn't. I had to do something that was counterintuitive, and it spooked me.\\" Hill had managed to steer straight down a course that was lined with trees. Hill had been using the Double Dragon to win matches, which were used to finance his Top Fuel dragster. The Double Dragon had been destroyed in a wreck two months before this fire. The fire tapped his finances and his resolve to drag race. =Motorcycle racing= Hill racing a motorcycle in 1973 He stopped racing and opened a motorcycle dealership in Wichita Falls in 1966. The dealership is still open (as of 2008), and it is now the oldest Honda and Kawasaki dealership in Texas. He soon wanted to race again, so he built his own motorcycle and began racing as a 30-year-old. He raced in numerous types of motorcycle racing: cross country, drag racing, hare scramble, motocross, road racing, and short track. When Hill participated in a Daytona race in 1971, he had an opening lap at , which was faster than factory rider Gary Nixon. Hill continued to race motorcycles and in 1972 and won the Texas state road racing championship. Hill won over 100 trophies in his motorcycle career. =Boat drag racing= Hill attended his first boat drag racing event in 1974 at Austin, Texas. He thought the drivers were \\"crazy\\" after he saw a driver being thrown from his boat during a crash. Less than a month later, Hill had stopped motorcycle racing to drag race boats, despite not being able to swim. \\"Once I hit the water with the boat, I never went back to motorcycles,\\" Hill recalled. \\"The power, speed, and acceleration were all things that I had missed since I quit drag racing.\\" He began racing in a non-blown hydroplane, winning in his first event. In his third race he set the class top speed. In 1975, he set the Southern Drag Boat Association (SDBA) speed record at . In 1976, he switched to nitromethane fuel and set the SDBA record with a run. He was the SDBA top pointgetter and won the National Drag Boat Association (NDBA) World Fuel & Gas championship. He repeated as champion in both series in 1977, setting the NDBA record with a run. Boat that Hill drove to 229 miles per hour, on display at Eddie Hill's Fun Cycles Hill raced an all white blown-fuel hydroplane from 1978 to 1984. He won 55 of 103 races during that time. Hill captured four American Drag Boat Association (ADBA) championships and was the SDBA top points earner in five consecutive years. In 1982, his Top Fuel hydroplane went at an NDBA event to set the world's record for a quarter mile water drag at Chowchilla, California. It was recorded in the Guinness Book of World Records, and it was not broken for 10 years. Hill also set speed records that year in the SDBA (220.76 mph), ADBA (215.82 mph), and International Hot Boat Association (IHBA) (212.78 mph). He became the only racer to hold records in all four associations simultaneously. He won the NDBA Nationals four times including three straight from 1982 until 1984. In 1983 and 1984, Hill won the World Series of Drag Boat Racing championship. The series features two races in each of the four major drag boat racing sanctioning bodies. He won 17 races between 1983 and 1984, and made 29 of 34 final rounds. Before he quit boat drag racing, he had an elapsed time of 5.16 seconds in the wet quarter mile at Firebird Lake in Chandler, Arizona. The e.t. was quicker than Gary Beck's 5.39-second NHRA Top Fuel dragster record, the first time that the water record was lower than the land record. Hill quit boat racing in October 1984 after a crash at 217 miles per hour. \\"It was a perfect run,\\" Hill recalled. \\"I started to settle the boat back into the water, and then it took off.\\" His Texas A&M; ring was torn off his hand; he suffered seven broken bones, a concussion, & eye injuries. He spent five days in the hospital and was not fully recovered for a year. =Return to drag racing= In Top Fuel, circa 1996 Hill decided to come back into drag racing for 1985. He purchased Dan Pastorini's Top Fuel car and salvaged the drag boat engine from the bottom of the lake. He joined one of the most underfunded and least competitive Top Fuel teams. Hill would have quit early in the 1986 season had he not gotten some tuning advice from a competitor that helped make his car more competitive. Fifteen races after returning, he finally got out of the first round at the 1986 Mile High Nationals. Hill made it to the final round of competition, losing to Larry Minor when he lost reverse after his burnout. At the 1987 Chief Auto Parts Nationals, where he was runner-up, Hill set an NHRA record of In doing so, he became the first person to hold both the land and water quarter mile drag racing speed records simultaneously. Hill won the first of his thirteen NHRA national events when he beat Joe Amato in final of the 1988 Mac Tools Gatornationals. Amato and Hill met in four final rounds that season, with Hill winning three. On April 9, 1988, he set the first four second elapsed time (4.990 seconds) at the National Hot Rod Association (NHRA) Texas FallNationals in Ennis, TX. Hill made the run on only seven cylinders; the post-run computer readout showed his #7 cylinder failed at launch. Six months later, Hill recorded a 4.936-second e.t. at the NHRA SuperNationals at Houston on October 9, 1988. Hill set the record as the oldest Top Fuel champion when he won the season championship as a 57-year-old. It was his twelfth championship. Hill won a record-tying six of seven national events and 15 events overall. Hill finished in the Top 10 in Top Fuel points for all but one of the years between 1987 and 1995. Between 1994 and 1999, Hill won his final two events in seven finals. When Hill won the 1996 Mile High Nationals, he set the record for the oldest Top Fuel event winner at age 60. He retired in 1999. Eddie continues to race competitively to this day (June 2017) at age 81 in open wheel racecars at Hallet Motor Speedway in Oklahoma. \\"Eddie Hill Rule\\" Hill was qualifying for a 1997 event at Sonoma when his car suffered severe vibration as he crossed the finish line. The car went out of control and was completely destroyed. Hill had two broken toes and a shoulder contusion, which were not serious injuries. The run had been fast enough to make Hill the fastest qualifier, and Hill wanted to race his backup car in the first round on the day after the accident. The NHRA had a rule that the car used for qualifying had to be used in the event, so the sanctioning body did not allow him to compete. The rule was changed after the event to allow racers to race on race day even if they do not use the same car. Innovations In 1960, he became the first driver to heat his rear tires with a burnout and he was the first driver to use smaller front tires on a dragster in 1958. Hill introduced the aerodynamic front wing to dragsters and charcoal masks for driver safety. Personal life Eddie Hill waves to fans as his wife Ercie steers their dragster Hill is married to Ercie Hill. They met at a boat drag racing event and were married on Valentine's Day in 1984. She had several roles during his career, including team co-owner, starting line navigator, record taker, pit crew member, business manager, marketing, and public relations. She has written about drag racing in National Dragster, AutoWeek, and Christian Motorsports magazines. Eddie has a daughter named Sabrina and a son named Dustin. Awards NHRA ranked him 14th on their Top 50 drivers in 2001. He was inducted in the NHRA Drag Racing Hall of Fame in 1978, and the Texas Motor Sports Hall of Fame in 2007. In 2000, he was inducted in Don Garlits' International Drag Racing Hall of Fame. Hill was inducted into the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America in 2002. After he was notified of his nomination, he said > \\"It's so much more satisfying to get this award now than posthumously. This > way I'll be able to enjoy it. Honestly, it was a sobering moment when they > called and told me I was being inducted along with some of the people I > admired most growing up. It gives you reason to pause for a moment and > reflect that maybe some good was accomplished along the way.\\" In 1988, Hill was selected by Car Craft magazine, Hot Rod Magazine, and the International Hot Rod Association as the Person of the Year. Car Craft magazine's readers voted him the Top Fuel Driver of the Year after he won the 1993 championship.

The album was released roughly eight months after the release of Pygmalion, the third studio album by Mojave 3 founders Neil Halstead, Rachel Goswell, and Ian McCutcheon's previous band Slowdive. While recording Pygmalion, Neil Halstead began simultaneously writing more acoustic-based songs (inspired by folk musicians) in stark opposition to the ambient electronica of Pygmalion. After Slowdive was dropped by original label Creation Records and subsequent disbandment, a cassette tape of Halstead, Goswell, and McCutcheon's acoustic demos found its way to 4AD founder Ivo Watts-Russell, who was taken by the songs and agreed to sign the trio to his label and release their debut album. Ask Me Tomorrow was reissued on vinyl (for the first time since its initial release) by UK-based label Sonic Cathedral in May 2017. The repress was limited to 500 copies, pressed on sea-foam green-coloured vinyl, and comes in a gold-mirrored sleeve featuring the original artwork by Vaughan Oliver and Chris Bigg. Background and recording Slowdive singer/guitarist Neil Halstead began writing songs in an acoustic vein at his west London flat while simultaneously recording for Slowdive's third album. In an interview with Sonic Cathedral, Halstead said, \\"I wasn't writing for an album at that point, just messing 'round with an acoustic and listening to a lot of Leonard Cohen and Nick Drake, Townes Van Zandt, Gram Parsons... Almost as a way to relax and change worlds.\\" The new songs stood in stark contrast to the ambient electronic direction that Slowdive was taking on Pygmalion, a direction Halstead described as \\"so abstract\\". Halstead, Rachel Goswell, and Ian McCutcheon were joined by keyboardist Christopher Andrews, and they recorded more songs at their home studio, as well as EMI Publishing Studio in London. Six demo songs on a cassette tape found their way to 4AD label founder and boss Ivo Watts-Russell; the demos were credited to Slowdive. Watts-Russell was initially hesitant to even listen to the tape, considering the fact that they had just recently been dropped by previous label Creation Records. But Watts-Russell eventually played the tape and \\"instantly adored it\\". He wanted to release the demos as the band's new album, but Goswell insisted they record more to flesh out a full album. The band, joined by former Chapterhouse guitarist Simon Rowe, convened at Blackwing Studios in southeast London and recorded three more songs to complete the album track listing. The band's name 'Mojave' was suggested by a friend who thought the music had \\"a wide-open, desert quality\\", but since there was already a German band called Mojave, they added the ‘3’ in reference to the band being a trio. A few early CD pressings, however, were printed with the band's name listed as simply 'Mojave'. Critical reception Ask Me Tomorrow was released by 4AD on 16 October 1995 in the UK, and on 16 January 1996 in the US. AllMusic reviewer Ned Raggett stated, \\"Arguably it remains the group's high point, flashes of inspiration here and there; as the band grew more straightforwardly authentic and less swathed in an aural cocoon, much of their uniqueness went with them. Here, though, both Goswell and Halstead -- along with drummer Ian McCutcheon (more often than not using brushes), pianist Christopher Andrews, and some guests -- tapped into a drowsy beauty that ran parallel to the burgeoning alt-country movement without completely sounding like it yet\\".

He established a private wildlife refuge around his family estate on Avery Island and helped in preserving a large coastal marshland in Louisiana as a bird refuge. He also introduced several exotic plants into Jungle Gardens, his private wildlife garden. McIlhenny is sometimes blamed for the introduction of exotic coypu, also known as nutria, into Louisiana where they are a major ecological problem. Although it is now known that he was neither the first to introduce their farming in the area or to release them into the wild, he was one of the first proponents of the animals' introduction and an avid self-promoter, so his tall tales soon became local legend and he has become inextricably linked with the origin of nutria in the state. Biography  Born in 1872 at Avery Island, Louisiana, where the families of his father Edmund McIlhenny and his mother Mary Eliza Avery had lived since 1813, McIlhenny was educated privately before attending Wyman's Military Academy in Illinois and Dr. Holbrook's Military School in Sing Sing (now Ossining), New York. In 1892, McIlhenny enrolled at Lehigh University, where he joined the Phi Delta Theta fraternity, but he dropped out of school to join Frederick Cook's 1894 Arctic expedition as an ornithologist. The expedition ended when their ship Miranda was wrecked off Greenland. In 1897, he financed his own Arctic expedition to Point Barrow, Alaska, where he leased an old government station, built to accommodate 100 men in an emergency and now owned by the Pacific Steam Whaling Company. During the famous rescue of a stranded Japanese whaling fleet, McIlhenny refused to house any of the rescued sailors except a few officers, including the Japanese adventurer and entrepreneur Jujiro Wada.Shane K. Bernard, Tabasco: An Illustrated History (Avery Island, La.: McIlhenny Company, 2007). He did provide cotton intended for taxidermic purposes for bedding. On his return from the second Arctic expedition, he married Mary Givens Matthews, daughter of William Henry Matthews and Mary Campbell Given, on June 6, 1900, in New Orleans, Louisiana. Businessman Tabasco pepper sauce from circa 1905, during Edward Avery McIlhenny's tenure as president of McIlhenny Company. In 1898, Edward's elder brother John enlisted in the U.S. Army, eventually joining the Rough Riders. Edward took over the family business, McIlhenny's Son Corporation, which produced Tobasco, the hot-pepper sauce invented by his father some 30 years previously. Edward renamed the firm McIlhenny Company and began to expand, modernize, and standardized sauce production. He also experimented with new ways of promoting the world-famous product, such as advertising on radio. In 1927, McIlhenny replaced the cork-topped Tabasco bottles used for nearly six decades with the now-ubiquitous screw-top bottle. He also redesigned the iconic Tabasco diamond logo trademark, largely creating the version known today. In 1939, McIlhenny and the governor of Louisiana Richard Leche were sued for transgressions in the issue of a contract to McIlhenny for the landscaping of Louisiana State University campus. An amount of $27,351.01 was claimed but nobody was convicted after the Supreme Court held that special skills did not require competitive bidding and that services worth that amount had been delivered. Nutria farming and release In a venture unrelated to Tabasco sauce, McIlhenny also operated a nutria (Myocastor coypus) farm on Avery Island from 1938 until his death. The nutria introduction began in collaboration with Armand P. Daspit, director of the Louisiana Department of Conservation's Fur and Wild Life Division who approached McIlhenny after reading a bulletin on them from Buenos Aires. Another couple, Susan and Captain H. Conrad Brote began a nutria farm at St. Tammany Parish from around 1933. The captain served on merchant ships running between New Orleans and Buenos Aires. Their farm did well but there were no sales and they let out their nutria even before McIlhenny had begun his operations from locally acquired stock. Another nutria farm was also begun around the same time in St. Bernard Parish from where McIlhenny's first nutria were obtained in 1938. McIlhenny's nutria farm quickly grew too large for their one-acre pen and he was surprised both by their prolific breeding and the difficulties in confining them to their pens. On June 1, 1940, he freed about 20 nutria. In 1945, he released all his nutria, claiming that it would help establish a fur industry in Louisiana. At the time, state and federal agencies advocated these releases. They believed nutria would provide a profitable new fur resource and help manage the spread of overly abundant plants such as water hyacinth and alligator weed. After these releases, the feral population became unmanageable, and its overwhelmingly harmful impact on Louisiana's wetlands became apparent. Nutria feed on vegetation that is crucial to sustaining Louisiana's coastline and protecting the state's sugarcane and rice fields. By 1960, the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries estimated the nutria population along coastal regions to exceed 20 million. The U.S. Department of the Interior estimates that of Louisiana's coastal wetlands are occupied by nutria. Conservation After the first Arctic expedition, he noticed on returning to Avery Island, a great decline in the number of egrets. This led him to conduct experiments in captive breeding. McIlhenny founded the Bird City wildfowl refuge on Avery Island around 1895, which helped to save the snowy egret from extinction. In 1910, McIlhenny and Charles Willis Ward bought of marshland and later an additional ; on November 4, 1911, they dedicated the marsh to the state of Louisiana as a wildlife refuge. McIlhenny persuaded Mrs Russell Sage to purchase of Marsh Island on July 22, 1912, and the Rockefeller Foundation to acquire an additional nearby. This created a bird reserve of about . McIlhenny was keen to study the birds on his estate and began bird ringing in 1912, initially using his own bands made of tin and lead on ducks, but he received few recoveries. In February 1916, he began to use bands issued by the American Bird Banding Association. Over 22 years, he banded more than 189,298 birds. Based on his ringing studies he came to the conclusion that sex-ratios in ducks were skewed in the wild with males surviving to a greater age than females. Later studies based on McIlhenny's ringing data have yielded considerable information on the movements of black vultures. In 1941, he wrote on the potential extinction of the ivory-billed woodpecker, noting its presence in his estate on Avery Island and suggesting that the destruction of old growth forests was key to its demise. The subspecies of white-tailed deer on Avery Island was named after McIlhenny as Odocoileus virginianus mcilhennyi by Frederic W. Miller in 1928. McIlhenny used his personal estate, known as Jungle Gardens, to propagate both Louisiana-native and imported plant varieties, including azaleas, irises, camellias, papyrus, and bamboo. He wrote numerous academic articles, mainly about birds and reptiles, oversaw the publication in English of two European botanical treatises, and edited Charles L. Jordan's unfinished manuscript The Wild Turkey and Its Hunting (a book often mistakenly attributed to McIlhenny). He supported the equality of women but suggested that there were evolutionary handicaps standing in the way. He also wrote books about alligators (in which he claimed to have shot the longest American alligator 19 feet long), egrets, and African-American gospel music, including: Buddha temple in Avery Island's Jungle Gardens, the former personal estate of Edward Avery McIlhenny. * Befo' De War Spirituals: Words and Melodies (1933). * Bird City (1934). * The Alligator's Life History (1935). * The Autobiography of an Egret (1940). Death and legacy McIlhenny died in 1949, three years after suffering a debilitating stroke; he is buried on Avery Island. Today, Jungle Gardens and Bird City continue to serve as havens for bird and plant species; they are also popular tourist destinations. Furthermore, the nearly of coastal marshland he helped to set aside as wildfowl refuges continue to exist as state wildlife areas. McIlhenny's illustrated and written documentation of plant and animal life on Avery Island was donated as a collection to Louisiana State University. The E. A. McIlhenny Collection of natural history books at Louisiana State University is named in his honor. See also * John Avery McIlhenny * Walter S.

Solo circumnavigation A junk rigged schooner, similar to the Galway Blazer II with which Bill King sailed around the world in 1973. By 1967, King was intent on sailing around the world by himself.

King's boat, the two-masted Galway Blazer II, a cold-molded plywood schooner, was specially designed for him by Angus Primrose.

Based on boats he had seen in China, the schooner had a junk rig (a sail stiffened by battens).

King's intention to sail around the world was overtaken by the institution in March 1968 of the Sunday Times Golden Globe Race. Aged 58, King became the oldest participant in what was the first organised round the world solo yacht race. In Deep Water, King explained that he joined the race as a means of recovering psychologically from fifteen years of service in submarines. This, he said, had left him \\"a nervous wreck\\". He had planned to sail around the world before he heard of the race, which \\"sort of caught up with me.\\" An aunt's legacy provided him with the means to finance the boat. King was sponsored by the Daily Express and Sunday Express newspapers.Holm, Donald.

One of the shortcomings of the boat was that it had neither guard rails or shrouds to hold on to. King solved this problem with a steel wire that stretched from bow to stern, to which he clipped a harness. His method was then copied by fellow racers Loïck Fougeron and Bernard Moitessier.Moitessier, Bernard. The Long Way as translated by William Rodarmor (1995, pg. 123), Sheridan House (publisher); retrieved 7 January 2008. King started the race on 24 August 1968.

In 1970, he was ready for another attempt, again using Galway Blazer II. Ill- health and hull damage forced him to put ashore at Australia. After departing on 12 December 1971, a large sea creature (a whale or shark) damaged his boat about southwest of Fremantle. \\"Only his skill and heroic efforts were able to keep the vessel afloat until jury repairs could be made.\\" King was below deck when he heard a shattering sound and saw the hull below the water line bulge inward and splinter. He rushed upstairs and heeled the boat so that the hole was lifted out of the water. He had to hang over the side and submerge himself to carry out emergency repairs with material that included thirteen ropes, sticky tape, collision covers, sheet copper, and sponge rubber. Then he had to fix the inside of the hull as well. After three days of work, he was able to return to Fremantle, \\"barely able to limp into port\\".

Later life In September 2007, King and his daughter Leonie, still lived at Oranmore Castle. His life's experiences continued to attract media attention, from film to music to art installation. He was filmed for two documentaries about the Golden Globe Race; the 1960s BBC short Golden Globe – Lone Sailor Round the World Race and 2006's Deep Water.

Most recent attention arises from King's interaction with Akira Tsurukame and Katja Boonstra-Blom – the subject of print media articles, an exhibition, and video interviews. Tsurukame, son of the chief engineer who perished with I-166, in 2004 sought out King.

He is thus sometimes described as a troubadour. A native of Pistoia—he was a major cultural figure of the Duecento there—his sonnets have been praised for their originality. Biography Paolo is first encountered in the records in Bologna in 1282.Bertoni, 118. He was present for an act granted in favour of Pistoia on 1 February that year. He also testified alongside Forisio di Jacopo in a document of 13 October, and was still at Bologna on 21 January 1283, when he witnessed a mutuum contracted between two men of Pistoia, Gerardino Bruno and Pucino Pepi. In 1291 he was back in Pistoia, where he was sentenced as guilty for the crime of striking cum una spada malvagia vetita pro forma statutorum (\\"with a sword in malice\\") a certain Orellio Megliori on the head, ex dicta percussione multus sanguis extivit (\\"from which wound exited much blood\\"). He was sent into exile and was in Bologna again in 1295. It is therefore certain that if, as some historians have believed, Paolo spent some time at the court of Aragon in Spain, it must have been spent between 1283 and 1291, most probably 1283-1285 if at all.Bertoni, 119. Italian poetry Paolo wrote seven surviving sonnets in Italian. The first four are seen as an interrupted dream, while the last three are a contemplative response.Kleinhenz, 192. The basic theme of Paolo's work is the question \\"How can man reconcile love of woman with love of God?\\" or, more generally, love of earthly with love of heavenly things.Kleinhenz, 194. Paolo's solution tends towards complete division of Earth and Heaven, no reconciliation. As a lover, he ignores Reason and pursues his subconscious desires, but his \\"daydreaming\\" is interrupted the bells of Matins and thus he finds he cannot escape religious demands even in his mind. This tempts him to become a Patarine, that is, a heretic. Paolo finally ascribes his wretched condition to a war between God and Nature which occurred at his birth. His final two works employ the analogy of the wheel of fortune (rota fortunae) and may have been accompanied by visual aids in performance, much as has been suspected of jongleur performances elsewhere.Kleinhenz, 196. Paolo has usually been placed either within the school of Guittone d'Arezzo, the guittoniani, or in a transitional place between them and the Dolce Stil Novo.Kleinhenz, 197. His style and language, however, are distinctly un-Guittonian. They have more in common with the Sicilian School, especially in their expression of raw emotion. Paolo's seven Italian sonnets are listed below by first line: #L'altr'er, dormendo, a mi se venne Amore #Dime, Amore, vorestù tornare #L'altr'er, pensando, mi emaçinay #Un nobel e çentil ymaçinare #Ogni meo fatto per contrario façço #De la rota son posti exempli asay #Quatro homi sum dipincti ne la rota Occitan poetry Paolo's lone Occitan work is a sonnet of no artistic worth but some historical interest. It is confidently dated to 1284 and is conserved only in troubadour manuscript P, an Italian chansonnier of 1310, now XLI.42 in the Biblioteca Laurenziana in Florence. It begins Valenz Senher, rei dels Aragones and is addressed to Peter III of Aragon. Paolo probably left no other Occitan works, but his poem is historically interesting for its information on north Italian perspectives concerning the War of the Sicilian Vespers, the conflict between the Angevins and Aragonese for Sicily. Peter III and the Aragonese cause was popular in northern Italy at the time and Paolo's sonnet is a celebration of his victory over the Angevins and Capetians in the Aragonese Crusade: Several anonymous coblas that appear towards the end of MS P have been attributed to Paolo by nineteenth-century authors. One cobla, Mand qe iur e non periur was addressed al iuge de Galur, that is, the Judge of Gallura, then Nino Visconti.Bertoni, 120. The cobla after it in the chansonnier is also addressed to Nino, but has not been assigned by any scholar to Paolo. The other anonymous cobla sometimes ascribed to Paolo was addressed to the \\"Count of Montfort\\". The anonymous author of both these coblas calls himself a jongleur.

Both thirst for revenge against the man who killed their parents (played by Akim Tamiroff), both fall in love with the same woman (portrayed by Ruth Warrick). The story is very loosely based on the 1844 novella Les frères Corses (in English: The Corsican Brothers) by French writer Alexandre Dumas, père. Dimitri Tiomkin was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Score (Score of a Dramatic or Comedy Picture). Plot In Corsica, the entire Franchi clan gather in anticipation of the birth of the child of Count and Countess Franchi (Henry Wilcoxon, Gloria Holden). Dr. Enrico Paoli (H. B. Warner) informs the count that his wife has given birth to Siamese twins. Count Franchi insists he try to separate them surgically, even after Paoli tells him that it would be a miracle if the babies survived. Before he can begin, however, the Franchis' bitter rivals the Colonnas launch a surprise attack, led by Baron Colonna (Akim Tamiroff). All of the Franchis are killed except the babies, who are carried to safety by Paoli and faithful family retainer Lorenzo (J. Carrol Naish). Later, Paoli successfully separates the boys, but wonders if he has done the right thing. Since Colonna has found out that twins were born, Paoli agrees to let Count Franchi's good friends, Monsieur and Madame Dupre (Walter Kingsford, Nana Bryant), take Mario Franchi to Paris to raise as their own son, while Lorenzo hides in the hills with Lucien Franchi. Twenty years pass. Lucien, now a bandit leader in Corsica, has a strange bond with his brother. More and more frequently, Lucien experiences what Mario does, though he has not been told about his twin. Lorenzo dismisses it as just dreams. At a Paris theatre, Mario saves Countess Isabelle Gravini (Ruth Warrick) from being annoyed by a marquis (Henry Brandon). When Mario is stabbed in the back by the marquis after a duel, Lucien also feels the pain. Finally, when the twins are twenty-one years old, Paoli reunites them. They both swear to avenge their parents by killing Colonna, now the tyrannical ruler of Corsica. In addition, Lucien confirms that what he experienced actually occurred to Mario. They begin slaying Colonna's relatives, one by one, pretending to be the same person, leaving Colonna wondering how the bandit chief could be in two widely separated places in such a short time. Meanwhile, Colonna decides to marry Isabelle. When her father (Pedro de Cordoba) refuses to consider the union, he is poisoned. Mario tells Isabelle of Colonna's intentions and hand in her father's death; she flees with Mario to the bandit camp. There they fall in love. A confused Lucien consults Dr. Paoli, unsure whether his own love for Isabelle is real or just a reflection of his brother's feelings. When Paoli is unable to answer, Lucien decides he must kill Mario in order to be truly free to live his own life. After Lucien confesses his love to Isabelle and embraces her against her will, Mario finds out and confronts him. Lucien tries to kill his hated brother; Lorenzo breaks up the knife fight. Unaware of this development, Isabelle decides to return to Paris to avoid creating a rift between the brothers. On the way, however, she is spotted and taken to Colonna. Colonna's trusted adviser, Tomasso (John Emery), finally figures out that the Franchi twins are behind everything. They set a trap, using Isabelle as the bait. When Lucien refuses to risk his men, Mario pretends to be a French jeweler to try to rescue Isabelle. Maria (Veda Ann Borg), Colonna's mistress, helps him, but he is recognized and captured. He is whipped to try to extract Lucien's hiding place. Colonna forces Paoli to attend. When Mario faints, Paoli administers a drug that makes it appear as if Mario has died. Later, he manages to revive the young man. Lucien, no longer sensing his bond to Mario, believes his brother is dead. He takes his band to deal with Colonna. He catches Colonna unarmed, but is fatally shot in the back by Tomasso. He manages to kill Tomasso before collapsing. Then Mario appears. In a sword fight, the last Franchi slays the last Colonna. Before Lucien dies, he reconciles with his brother. Cast *Douglas Fairbanks Jr. as Mario and Lucien Franchi *Ruth Warrick as Countess Isabelle Gravini *Akim Tamiroff as Colonna *J.

He was named a Time magazine Heroes of the Environment (2008), winner of the 2008 Green Book Award, co-editor of Love Your Monsters (2011) and co-author of Break Through (Houghton Mifflin 2007) and The Death of Environmentalism (2004). He and his co-author Ted Nordhaus have been described as \\"ecological modernists\\" and \\"eco-pragmatists.\\" In 2015, Shellenberger joined with 18 other self-described ecomodernists to coauthor An Ecomodernist Manifesto. On November 30, 2017, he announced during a New York Times conference that he would run for Governor of California in 2018. Shellenberger is the author of Apocalypse Never: Why Environmental Alarmism Hurts Us All (2020). Education Shellenberger graduated from the Peace and Global Studies (PAGS) program at Earlham College in 1993. Career = Early career = Shellenberger's early writing and activism focused on Latin America and he was introduced to activism and political direct action due to being raised a Mennonite. That work included the founding of an Amnesty International chapter in high school in Greeley, Colorado, and debating Latin American policy, for which he attended the National Forensic League Championships. He traveled and worked in Latin America in the 1980s and 1990s. In 1993 he moved to San Francisco to work with the progressive organization Global Exchange, authoring articles on Haiti, Brazil, Mexico, Gulf War syndrome and affirmative action. At UC Santa Cruz he helped organize a graduate students union and defend affirmative action. Later he co-founded Communication Works, an allied progressive public relations organization. which worked on a wide range of campaigns, from challenging Nike over its labor practices in Asia to saving the Headwaters Redwood forest. In 2002 Shellenberger co-founded the consulting firm Lumina Strategies. Its clients included Global Exchange, Americans United for Affirmative Action, the Ford Foundation, the Sierra Club and the Venezuelan Information Center. In 2005 Shellenberger and Ted Nordhaus co- founded American Environics, whose clients include AARP, Earthjustice, the Ford Foundation and the Nathan Cummings Foundation. = Breakthrough Institute = Shellenberger was president and a senior fellow at the Breakthrough Institute, which he co-founded with Ted Nordhaus in 2003. Today, Breakthrough Institute consists of a policy staff, an annual conference, a policy journal, and a network of affiliated fellows. Breakthrough Institute's analyses of energy, climate and innovation policy have been cited by National Public Radio the Wall Street Journal and C-SPAN. As part of his role at Breakthrough, Shellenberger has co-authored analyses of cap and trade climate legislation, of the \\"planetary boundaries\\" hypothesis, energy rebound from energy efficiency measures, carbon pricing, renewable energy subsidies, nuclear energy, and shale gas.Michael Shellenberger and Ted Nordhaus, \\"A Boom in Shale Gas? Credit the Feds,\\" Washington Post, December 16, 2011Kevin Begos, \\"Decades of Federal Dollars Helped Fuel Gas Boom,\\" Associated Press, September 23, 2012 The Institute has conducted research showing that shale gas and other major technological innovations were created by American government institutions and public financing. The Institute advocates higher levels of public spending on technology innovation, which they argue will lead to higher environmental quality, economic growth, and quality of life. The Institute argues that climate policy should be focused on higher levels of public funding on technology innovation to \\"make clean energy cheap,\\" and has been critical of climate policies like cap and trade and carbon pricing that are focused primarily on raising energy prices. =Environmental Progress= In February 2016 it was revealed that Shellenberger had relinquished his position as president of the Breakthrough Institute to run a new organisation, Environmental Progress, Environmental Progress home page (accessed 1 July 2017 which is behind several public campaigns: Save Diablo Canyon campaign In January 2016, alongside several other authors of An Ecomodernist Manifesto including Robert Stone, David Keith, Stewart Brand and Mark Lynas—as well as Kerry Emanuel, James Hansen, Steven Pinker, Stephen Tindale and Burton Richter, Shellenberger signed an open letter urging officials not to close the Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant. It was addressed to California Governor Jerry Brown, the CEO of Pacific Gas & Electric and California state officials. Save Illinois Nuclear In April 2016, Shellenberger, alongside other conservationists and scientists including James Hansen, Stewart Brand, Nobel Laureate Burton Richter, Kerry Emanuel and Mark Lynas, signed an open letter urging against the closure of the six operating nuclear power plants in Illinois: Braidwood, Byron, Clinton, Dresden, LaSalle and Quad Cities. Together, they account for Illinois ranking first in the United States in 2010 in both nuclear capacity and nuclear generation, and generation from its nuclear power plants accounted for 12 percent of the United States total. In 2007, 48% of the electricity of Illinois was generated using nuclear power.  Save New York Nuclear  In July 2016, an open letter signed by climate scientists, scholars, environmentalists and concerned citizens was sent to Governor Andrew Cuomo and leaders within New York's Public Service Commission, urging them to support legislation that would protect New York's nuclear plants from closure, including the Indian Point nuclear power plant. In August, Cuomo announced that the PSC had formally approved a Clean Energy Standard (CES) that explicitly recognises the zero-carbon contribution of nuclear power plants. South Korea In July 2017, Shellenberger, with colleagues and associates of Environmental Progress sent an open letter to South Korean President Moon Jae-in urging him to reconsider his nuclear phase- out proposal, given the importance of South Korea's nuclear program to protecting the climate. In August 2017 a comprehensive report, \\"The High Cost of Fear\\" was published, outlining the likely impacts on South Korea of that proposal. In October 2017, a South Korean citizen's jury voted to restart the construction of two halted nuclear reactors. Congressional testimony In January 2020, Shellenberger testified before the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology of the U.S. House of Representatives. In his testimony, he raised concerns about what he views as a growing alarmism in public discussion of climate change. \\"I care about getting the facts and the science right,\\" he told lawmakers. \\"I believe scientists, journalists, and advocates have an obligation to represent climate science accurately, even if doing so reduces the saliency of our issue.\\" Shellenberger also emphasized the importance of nuclear energy's role in addressing climate change. When Rep. Jim Baird (R-IN) asked him about its potential, he replied \\"I believe that eventually we will be 100% nuclear. It may not be for another two hundred years, but it's such a clearly superior energy technology, that's eventually what it will be.\\" = Position on renewable energy = In 2017, Shellenberger told The Australian: \\"Like most people, I started out pretty anti-nuclear. I changed my mind as I realised you can't power a modern economy on solar and wind... All they do is make the electricity system chaotic and provide greenwash for fossil fuels.\\"  Writings  In 2004, Nordhaus and Shellenberger, both long-time strategists for environmental groups, co- authored a controversial essay, \\"The Death of Environmentalism: Global Warming Politics in a Post-Environmental World.\\" The paper argues that environmentalism is conceptually and institutionally incapable of dealing with climate change and should \\"die\\" so that a new politics can be born. The essay was debated. In, 2007, Houghton Mifflin published Nordhaus and Shellenberger's Break Through: From the Death of Environmentalism to the Politics of Possibility (Houghton Mifflin, 2007). The book is an argument for what its authors describe as a positive, \\"post-environmental\\" politics that abandons the environmentalist focus on nature protection for a new focus on technological innovation to create a new economy. Time Magazine named Nordhaus and Shellenberger two of its 32 Heroes of the Environment (2008) calling Break Through \\"prescient\\" for its prediction that climate policy should focus not on making fossil fuels expensive through regulation but rather on making clean energy cheap. Break Through was awarded the Green Book Award, 2009. Their writings have focused on the intersection of climate change, energy innovation, and politics. The two predicted the failure of cap and trade for its focus on making fossil fuels expensive rather than on technology innovation to make clean energy cheap. They faulted the Kyoto climate treaty for being focused on what they called \\"shared sacrifice\\" rather than shared technological innovation. They have criticized green cultural life as a consequence of status anxieties among Western consumers. And they have argued for a \\"theology\\" of ecological modernization that embraces technological innovation and human development. Nordhaus and Shellenberger have argued for a \\"climate pragmatism\\" and an embrace of modernization and human development. They are co-authors of an alternative framework to the United Nations process focused on energy innovation, pollution control and adaptation.Daren Samuelsohn, \\"Report: Treat climate change like 'Fight Club',\\" Politico, July 26, 2011Lisa Friedman, \\"'Climate pragmatists' call for an end to Kyoto process\\" ClimateWire, July 26, 2011 In 2011, Nordhaus and Shellenberger started The Breakthrough Journal, which The New Republic called \\"among the most complete efforts to provide a fresh answer\\" to the question of how to modernize liberal thought, and The National Review called \\"...the most promising effort at self-criticism by our liberal cousins in a long time.\\" = An Ecomodernist Manifesto = In April 2015, Shellenberger joined with a group of scholars in issuing An Ecomodernist Manifesto. This proposes dropping the goal of “sustainable development” and replacing it with a strategy to shrink humanity’s footprint by using nature more intensively. The authors argue that economic development is necessary to preserve the environment. The other authors were: John Asafu-Adjaye, Linus Blomqvist, Stewart Brand, Barry Brook, Ruth DeFries, Erle Ellis, Christopher Foreman, David Keith, Martin Lewis, Mark Lynas, Ted Nordhaus, Roger A. Pielke, Jr., Rachel Pritzker, Joyashree Roy, Mark Sagoff, Robert Stone, and Peter Teague. = Apocalypse Never: Why Environmental Alarmism Hurts Us All = In June 2020, HarperCollins published Shellenberger's book Apocalypse Never: Why Environmental Alarmism Hurts Us All, in which the author \\"explores how and why so many of us came to see important but manageable environmental problems as the end of the world, and why the people who are the most apocalyptic about environmental problems tend to oppose the best and most obvious solutions to solving them.\\" In a book review, Peter Gleick argues that \\"bad science and bad arguments abound\\" in 'Apocalypse Never', writing that \\"What is new in here isn't right, and what is right isn't new.\\" Similarly, a 2020 Forbes article by Shellenberger, in which he promotes his book, has been analyzed by seven academic reviewers and one editor from the Climate Feedback fact-checking project; the reviewers conclude that Shellenberger \\"mixes accurate and inaccurate claims in support of a misleading and overly simplistic argumentation about climate change.\\" Shellenberger responded in a piece published at Environmental Progress, a publication he founded. Reception Shellenberger's writing has been praised and criticized. Wired magazine wrote that Break Through \\"could turn out to be the best thing to happen to environmentalism since Rachel Carson's Silent Spring.\\"Mark Horowitz, Wired, 25 September 2007, Two Environmentalists Anger Their Brethren The Wall Street Journal wrote, \\"If heeded, Nordhaus and Shellenberger's call for an optimistic outlook -- embracing economic dynamism and creative potential -- will surely do more for the environment than any U.N. report or Nobel Prize.\\"Jonathan Adler, The Wall Street Journal, 27 November 2007, The Lowdown on Doomsday: Why the public shrugs at global warming Former Sierra Club Executive Director Carl Pope wrote \\"I am deeply disappointed and angered by The Death of Environmentalism,\\" which he called \\"unclear, unfair and divisive.\\" He said it contained multiple factual errors and misinterpretations but conceded the authors made \\"one extremely compelling point\\" that \\"the environmental community had still not come up with an inspiring vision, much less a legislative proposal, that a majority of Americans could get excited about.\\" In a 2007 review of Break Through: From the Death of Environmentalism to the Politics of Possibility, Pope walked his statement about Shellenberger and Nordhaus's legislative tact back, arguing that \\"Time has not been kind to their thesis\\" regarding the death of environmentalism. Pope argued that instead, environmental \\"politics have changed very dramatically\\" since their original essay's claims. Mark Horowitz, Wired, 25 September 2007, Two Environmentalists Anger Their Brethren Former Greenpeace Executive Director John Passacantando said, referring to both Shellenberger and his coauthor Ted Nordhaus, \\"These guys laid out some fascinating data, but they put it in this over-the-top language and did it in this in-your-face way.\\" Michel Gelobter and others wrote The Soul of Environmentalism: Rediscovering transformational politics in the 21st century in response, criticizing \\"Death\\" for not addressing the concerns of poor people who are not white. In 2007 academics Julie Sze and Michael Ziser argued in \\"Climate Change, Environmental Aesthetics, and Global Environmental Justice Cultural Studies\\" that Break Through: From the Death of Environmentalism to the Politics of Possibility continued this trend. They asserted that technology-based \\"approaches like those of Nordhaus and Shellenberger miss entirely\\" the \\"structural environmental injustice\\" that natural disasters like Hurricane Katrina make visible. Personal life Shellenberger was raised in Greeley, Colorado and attended college at Earlham College, a Quaker school in Richmond, Indiana. He went on to receive a master's degree in Cultural Anthropology from the University of California, Santa Cruz. Shellenberger has two children and resides in the San Francisco Bay area.

It also lives along muddy banks and in tidally-active areas of estuaries. Description Crassula aquatica is a small plant forming thin mats or small patches on mud and sand, and growing more erect when exposed to open air for longer periods. The flesh of the plant is greenish-yellow to bright red or purplish. The tiny fleshy pointed leaves are only a few millimeters long. A flower grows on a short stalk from the intersection of each oppositely-arranged pair of leaves. The flower is only about two millimeters long and wide. The fruit is a minute follicle containing several seeds. This plant is widespread across North America and Eurasia. It is listed as a vulnerable species in Newfoundland and Labrador.

Initially formed in 1942 as the \\"2/5th Independent Company\\", the 2/5th served in New Guinea, taking part in a major commando raid on Salamaua in June 1942. It was later withdrawn from New Guinea and reformed as the \\"2/5th Cavalry (Commando) Squadron\\", as part of the 2/7th Cavalry (Commando) Regiment which saw service in Borneo in 1945. It was disbanded in early 1946. History =Formation 1942= 2/5th's training camp in Forster, Victoria. Mount Oberon in the background was used by the company as part of its physical training course. (AWM photo) In February 1941, Lieutenant Colonel J.C. Mawhood, a British officer, arrived in Australia and established No. 7 Infantry Training Centre at Wilsons Promontory, Victoria, Australia. As a part of its wartime expansion, the Australian Army had originally intended to field four Independent Companies, trained to a high standard in irregular warfare for use in the sabotage and reconnaissance roles.Horner 1989, pp. 21–22 The terrain surrounding the centre consisted of a number of high rugged mountains, swift streams and swamps and it was felt that this was ideal for training soldiers in the art of irregular warfare.Trigellis-Smith 1992, p. 1 The health and training of the trainees was affected by the long periods of wet weather; however, despite the hardships experienced by the trainees by October 1941, three companies (1st, 2nd and 3rd Independent Companies) had already been trained.McCarthy 1959, p. 85 Following Japan's entry into the war, the training centre re-opened as the Guerilla Warfare School. In January 1942, volunteers from all branches of the Army were called for and began assembling at the school, where they were put through a rigorous six-week course. In March 1942, once sufficient numbers had completed the course, the \\"2/5th Independent Company\\" was formed. At the time, the company consisted of 17 officers and 256 other ranks and was commanded by a major. It was divided into a company headquarters, with attached engineer, signals, transport and medical sections and three infantry platoons, each under a captain, each consisting of three sections that were under the command of a lieutenant. =New Guinea 1942–43= On 13 April 1942 the company departed Townsville, Queensland, on the SS Taroona commanded by Major Thomas Kneen and was \\"very heavily armed\\". They arrived in Port Moresby, New Guinea on the 17th, during an air raid. They were deployed on 24 May to Wau, in a valley high inland from Lae and Salamaua. They were part of Kanga Force commanded by the controversial Colonel Norman Fleay, that consisted of the 2/5th, the New Guinea Volunteer Rifles (NGVR) and a platoon from 1st Independent Company and were to observe the Japanese at Lae and Salamaua. They were the first Allied force in World War II to be flown into action as a complete unit. Despite appalling conditions, enduring soaking rain, pests, diseases, and a lack of supplies such as food and medication, they harassed the Japanese in the area from the Markham to the Bitol Rivers for one year. The Salamaua Raid On 29 June 1942, the company launched a raid on a Japanese aerodrome at Salamaua,McCarthy 1959, pp. 92–96. the first Allied attack on Japanese land forces anywhere. The raid was commanded by Captain Norman Winning, after initial careful reconnaissance by Sergeant Jim McAdam's NGVR scouts. Winning planned the assault with Captain Douglas Umphelby of the NGVR.McCarthy 1959, p. 91. The raiders, formed into several parties, with mortar support, set out from Butu in the early afternoon of 28 June. Heavy rain fell throughout the march, but it later cleared and early the following morning, the Australians attacked various areas between the Francisco River and Kela Point, destroying buildings, vehicles and a bridge, and killing about 100 Japanese before returning to Butu for the loss of only three Australians wounded. During the raid, a Japanese pilot, attempting to reach his aircraft, ran into the commandos and was killed. Important documents were found in a satchel carried by the pilot and these were sent to Kanga Force headquarters for analysis.McCarthy 1959, pp. 95–96 An attack on Heath's Plantation, the following night was not as successful as the element of surprise had been lost, and Kneen was killed in action.McCarthy 1959, pp. 96–99. Following the raids, the Japanese heavily shelled Kela Point and attacked the tracks leading away from Salamaua by air in an effort to cut off the raiders' withdrawal routes. The Australians withdrew from Butu to their main camp, as the Japanese sent patrols of up to 90 men into the foothills; they subsequently found the camp at Butu and destroyed it. They also sent reinforcements from their garrison at Lae to Kela village.McCarthy 1959, p. 96. Troops from B Platoon, 2/5 Independent Company leave camp to conduct a raid. (AWM Photo) July 1942 until April 1943 In the months following the raid on Salamaua, the 2/5th continued patrol operations around the Huon Gulf. When it became apparent that the Japanese were concentrating their forces at Mubu with the intention of launching an attack against Wau, the 2/5th launched another raid on 1 October 1942, consisting of a party of 60 men, again under Winning's command.McCarthy 1959, p. 537. During the approach march, Lieutenant Bill Drysdale was wounded by a booby trap, which alerted the nearby Japanese. The Japanese defenders came out to meet the raid, driving the outnumbered Australians back. Heavy fighting followed, and while attempting to cover the withdrawal, one of the raiders, Sergeant William O'Neill, killed up to 16 Japanese with sub-machine-gun fire. The Japanese were later estimated to have lost 50 killed, including the company commander; nevertheless, the raid was broken up and the Australians spent several days regrouping.McCarthy 1959, pp. 534–591. Soon after the Mubo raid, the unit moved to the nearby Markham valley on long range patrols. In January 1943, the 2/5th with the 2/7th flew to Wau airfield which was under Japanese attack. They went straight into action leaving the aircraft under fire, and repelled the Japanese invasion. Finally, in February 1943, exhausted from starvation, illness and injury, and beset by atrocious weather, they were withdrawn for rest, with the majority of the sick congregating at Wau, before being transported to Edie Creek at Kaindi to recuperate.Pirie 1993, p. 321. On 20 March 1943, the 2/5th was ordered to return to the Markham area to conduct patrols around the Snake River and to prepare defensive positions. Throughout April they undertook active patrols with the 2/6th Battalion and established observation posts. By 21 April the lead elements of the 24th Battalion began arriving at Bulolo as the 3rd Division moved forward and prepared to relieve the forward Australian troops, including the 2/5th, which was subsequently withdrawn to Port Moresby after almost a year of continuous operations.Pirie 1993, pp. 329–332. =Reorganisation 1943-44= The 2/5th departed New Guinea for Australia on the troopship Duntroon on 13 May 1943. It was sent to the Jungle Warfare Centre at Canungra, Queensland to refit and regroup. In August it moved to Wongabel on the Atherton Tablelands where it was reformed as the \\"2/5th Cavalry (Commando) Squadron\\". Following a reorganisation of the Australian Army's independent companies, the 2/5th was incorporated with the 2/3rd and 2/6th Independent Companies into the 2/7th Cavalry (Commando) Regiment,Trigellis-Smith 1992, p. 145 which was attached to the 7th Division and was to act as the administrative headquarters to the squadron during the next phase of the conflict. Later, the designation of \\"cavalry\\" was dropped and the unit simply referred to as \\"2/5th Commando Squadron\\".

He was also known simply as Giuseppe Dossena. Emilio Giuseppe Dossena strolling through Maiorca, 1982 He attended the Brera Academy (Milan) and the Scuola del Castello (Milan), where he formed strong friendships with Aligi Sassu, Ernesto Treccani, Guttuso, Domenico Cantatore and Umberto Lilloni. At the Scuola del Castello he won a prize for his sculpture works (a trip to Venice), but his attraction toward color made him choose painting as the medium of artistic communication. Although his tendency toward impressionism was evident from the beginning, the necessity to provide for his family forced him to dedicate only his spare time to this aspect of the arts. He therefore earned his livelihood for many years with the restoration and the decoration of villas and castles, in addition to producing frescoes for the local churches. In the residences of Pirelli, Falck, Borletti, Invernizzi, Necchi, Toscanini, Count Cicogna, Duke Gallarati Scotti, and Count Castelbarco, Emilio Giuseppe Dossena decorated, restored and painted large panels with mythological and archaic themes and battles.“Ferruccio Pallavera, Giuseppe Dossena, “Ambrogino d'oro”, L'Amico, Novembre 2002, p.10, Cavenago D'Adda His works were also in the Italian Embassy in Addis Abeba, Ethiopia, but were destroyed by air raids during WWII. His passion for artistic expression allowed him to retain his creative integrity, and he became a sought after impressionist, known for the sensibility of his works as much as for the dynamic strokes which characterized them. His first solo exhibit, at the Galleria Gavioli in Milan (1943), was a success with the critics and the public, and all of the paintings were purchased by collectors. The exhibit at the galleria Hoepli in Milan (1964), and the one at the Palazzo dell’Arredamento, in Desio (1967), also achieved a good response, earning a place on the prestigious Enciclopedia dell’Arte (Edizioni SEDA, Milan). Until the mid-1950s, Dossena signed his paintings GDossena (for Giuseppe Dossena), but the signature mutated in E.G.Dossena after that period. After the artist lost his studio in a fire, he moved in 1968 to Brooklyn, New York, and resided at 54 Cheever Place in Carroll Gardens and was employed by Studio the BergerMarianna Biazzo Randazzo, Italians of Brooklyn, Arcadia Publishing, April 2018, p.20, Charleston, South Carolina, restoring works by Renoir, Rembrandt, Picasso and other masters, property of museums and private collections, among which stand out the Metropolitan Museum of New York and the Playboy Club. In New York, the artist temporarily abandoned his impressionist roots, embracing the neo- expressionism, creating shapes more simplified, almost essential, without any schematism or structural restrictions. The shape is almost snatched from nature, in a continued research to contain and interpret the existential essence and express these new inescapable sensations, which the artist feel away from his country.Tiziano Thomas Dossena, ATTRAVERSO L'OCEANO: La Vita di Emilio Giuseppe Dossena, L'Idea N.72, p. 25, 1998, Brooklyn, NY Emilio Giuseppe Dossena, Giorno Di Mercato, 1976 (Expressionist period) The exhibits at the Columbus Citizens Committee (1973) and the Galerie Internationale (1973, 1974) gave unforeseen positive results.

In either case, there's a feeling of nervous energy bursting forth in the artist's treatment of generously flowered fields, butterflies, still lifes and dancing figures …”“Dorothy Hall, NY Park East, p. 18, 23 marzo 1974 Mario Albertazzi, the Il Progresso Italo-Americano art critic, added: \\"Brilliant colorist, he brings to his canvas the light of nature and the joy of life. His works…are rich in density and at the same time buoyant, restless and gentle as a delicate caress…\\"Mario Albertazzi, Il Progresso Italo-Americano, 26 marzo 1974, New York After eight years he returned to Italy, and devoted his time exclusively to painting. He regained his impressionistic tendencies, although with a more aggressive chromatic handling. Emilio Giuseppe Dossena, Parco Sempione, 1980 (Late impressionist period) Dossena exhibited at the Galleria Treves (Spotorno, 1977), Galleria Il Portichetto ( Stresa, 1978) and the Circolo Ambrosiano Meneghin e Cecca (Milan, 1983). The specialized press covered these events profusely, offering only positive comments. The art critic Mario Portalupi affirmed: “In truth, his painting process is born out of impressions and the subsequent emotions, which transform reality and regulate the chromatic entities on the canvas…”Ferruccio Pallavera, Giuseppe Dossena, “Ambrogino d'oro”, L'Amico, Novembre 2002, p.11, Cavenago D'Adda His friend Enzo Lepore, renowned opera singer, stated: “Dossena…excels for the luminous harmony of the chromatic contrasts and he distinguishes himself for the expressive purity of his vigorous and original style… His paintings are fresh, palpitating, and rich with a vast conception and spirituality, in a frame of radiant and intensive colors…”Ferruccio Pallavera, Giuseppe Dossena, “Ambrogino d'oro”, L'Amico, Novembre 2002, p.12, Cavenago D'Adda Among the many honors he received, in 1985 Dossena was awarded the prestigious Ambrogino d’Oro per l’Arte from the City of Milan and in 1989 a ceramic tile with his signature is placed in the famous Muretto di Alassio. Dossena was a member of numerous academies and artistic associations, among them the Accademia Tiberina and the Accademia dei Bronzi. In the last years of his life, the artist, ill and unable to paint, devoted himself to poetry, receiving numerous awards and appearing in a variety of literary anthologies. The exhibit at the Trask Gallery of the National Arts Club of New York, organized in 1998 by L’Idea Magazine of Brooklyn in his memory, beat all the participation records and it was the first one for an Italian artist in such an institution.

Founded by Rickard Drakborn, Jeff Simmons and Scott Chipman, and developed by a group of independent developers called Team Chivalry, the mod features a medieval theme and aims to provide enjoyable close-combat battles.  Gameplay  Players select to play on either the Agatha Knights or the Mason Order, the two factions competing to rule the fictional kingdom that is the game's setting. Most maps have several objectives; completing one leads to the next until the final objective has been completed or the defending team is able to prevent the other team from completing theirs during the allotted time. Objectives vary from taking a strategical point to killing villagers, and include many siege-oriented ones like ramming down the main door of a castle and constructing bridges. Age of Chivalry plans to use a dynamic campaign, in which each scenario affects which map will be used in the next chapter.  Reception  PC Gamer highlighted the mod's large maps, describing the mountainous stretches as \\"tactics- encouraging\\" and overall should \\"encourage improvisation in team play.\\"  Full release  The mod later evolved into a full game by the name of Chivalry: Medieval Warfare, developed by Torn Banner Studios (whose employees were involved in the development of the mod) as their first commercial game.

Photo by Arthur Tress. Northeast end Hylan Boulevard is a major northeast-southwest boulevard in the New York City borough of Staten Island, and the longest street in the city. It is approximately long, and runs from the North Shore neighborhood of Rosebank, then along the entire East Shore, to the South Shore neighborhood of Tottenville. It was renamed in 1923 for New York City mayor John F. Hylan, before which it was known as Southfield Boulevard and the northern segment as Pennsylvania Avenue.\\"Call Streets Craig, Hylan and Hulbert\\" The New York Times. April 25, 1923.\\"Rosebank – back to a Staten Island small town\\" Kevin J. Walsh, Forgotten New York. September 11, 2011. It is often misunderstood to be read as Hyland or Highland Boulevard. Hylan Boulevard is one of Staten Island's busiest thoroughfares, carrying over 44,000 vehicles per day. The increased volume, built up over decades, has resulted in the road becoming New York City's newest \\"Boulevard of Death\\" according to Transportation Alternatives. Barone, Vincent. \\"Hylan now labeled city's new 'Boulevard of Death'\\". Staten Island Advance November 14, 2015. Retrieved August 7, 2017. Route description Hylan Boulevard begins at Alice Austen House at the southeast end of Edgewater Street in Rosebank, its first major intersection coming at , with Bay Street. It becomes divided by street markings at Tompkins Avenue, but then splits at and crosses the Staten Island Expressway over two separate overpasses.(one northbound, one southbound). Upon merging again, it becomes Steuben Street, and Hylan Boulevard continues east of there, snaking further through the neighborhood of Arrochar. Steuben joins Hylan again at . Half a mile later, Hylan intersects with Old Town Road and Quintard Street, at which point it begins a predominantly straight southwesterly run. Major intersections following include Seaview Avenue (3.2 miles) and Midland Avenue (4.0 miles). At , Hylan intersects with New Dorp Lane at what is known to be one of Staten Island's worst intersections in terms of traffic and collisions. Continuing southwest from there, it intersects Tysens Lane (5.2 miles), reverse-curves at approximately , and then continues straight southwest again past Great Kills Park. Major intersections include Buffalo Street (6.1 miles) and Nelson Avenue (7.5 miles). At , Hylan intersects with Richmond Avenue, another major Island thoroughfare. Continuing, the last portion of divided roadway ends at Arden Avenue (8.7 miles), and the boulevard continues westward through the neighborhoods of the South Shore, ending at Conference House Park in Tottenville. Attractions As an integral artery of Staten Island, Hylan Boulevard is a commercial corridor and a heavily trafficked roadway. At the northernmost end is Buono Beach, a small park with views of New York Harbor, as well as the Alice Austen House (address: 2 Hylan Blvd.), the historical home of native Island photographer Alice Austen and one of the few remaining Dutch Colonial structures on the Island. Commercial establishments of various kinds line the boulevard's north-central stretch, with larger shopping centers in and around the New Dorp neighborhood. At Buffalo Street is the entrance to Great Kills Park, part of the larger Gateway National Recreation Area. In the neighborhood of Great Kills there are more businesses, but south of Richmond Avenue, the boulevard is almost entirely residential or parkland.

He started his career in 2001 publishing works for Shogakukan's magazine Big Comic Spirits. After three one- shots, he moved to Shueisha's Weekly Shōnen Jump, in which he started the work he is best known for, Eyeshield 21. In collaboration with the artist Yusuke Murata, Eyeshield 21 was serialized between July 2002 and June 2009 in Weekly Shōnen Jump, and was later adapted into an anime television series. Between 2010 and 2015, Inagaki collaborated with several artists, including Bonjae, Katsunori Matsui, and Ryoichi Ikegami, and published one-shots in different magazines. He started a new serial titled Dr. Stone in Weekly Shōnen Jump in 2017 in collaboration with Boichi.  Biography  Born on June 20, 1976, in Tokyo, Inagaki started to like manga when he read Fujiko Fujio's Manga Michi in middle school. In 1994, he competed at the third Manga Kōshien, a high school manga contest based in Kōchi Prefecture. As it only demanded a one- panel story, Inagaki just threw some ink on the paper to look like he had messed up the story. He said, \\"People really liked that for some reason. But Manga Koshien isn't something I'm so fond of remembering\\". After finishing school, he enrolled in a manga and film production company as animation assistant. He started his career as professional manga writer by publishing works in Shogakukan's Big Comic Spirits. He debuted in October 2001 with Nandodemo Roku Gatsu Jū San Hi, and also wrote for the magazine Square Freeze and Love Love Santa, published in November 2001 and in February 2002 respectively. He later moved to Shueisha's Weekly Shōnen Jump, in which he won the 7th \\"Story King\\" award for a storyboard of Eyeshield 21. When he planned to create Eyeshield 21, the editorial department asked if he wanted to both write and draw the series, but Inagaki felt he was \\"so rookie\\". So he asked Yusuke Murata to be the illustrator. In 2002, they published two one-shots called and on March 5 and 12 in Weekly Shōnen Jump. The series began to be regularly published on July 23 of the same year in the same magazine. It spanned 333 chapters, the last one published on June 15, 2009, and the series was collected in 37 volumes. The series became his most known work, and gained an anime adaptation, directed by Masayoshi Nishida and co-produced by TV Tokyo, NAS, and Gallop, that aired from April 2005 to March 2008. For the release of Eyeshield 21 anime he created the Kome Studio, a company of copyright management to ensure the right of the original creators of manga. The company name, which translates to \\"rice\\", was chosen for three reasons: 1) because \\"Inagaki\\" contains a kanji (\\"稲\\") that can be translated to rice; 2) because \\"rice\\" kanji (\\"米\\") is also used to represent the United States; and 3) because of the Rice Bowl, an American football championship in Japan. In 2006, he was chosen, along with Akira Toriyama and Eiichiro Oda, to be a committee member for the Tezuka Award. In June 2010, he published Kiba&Kiba; in Weekly Shōnen Jump along with Bonjae, and his collaboration work with Katsunori Matsui, Shinpai Kato No Face, was published in the 2011 first issue of Weekly Young Jump. He published another collaborative work with Matsui, Alpha Centauri Dōbutsuen; a two-chapter series, it was published on January 10 and February 10, 2014 in the Jump X magazine. Along with Ryoichi Ikegami, he published the one-shot Kobushi Zamurai in Shogakukan's Big Comic Superior on August 12, 2015. On March 6, 2017, he started to serialize Dr. Stone in Weekly Shōnen Jump with collaboration of illustrator Boichi. In January 2019, Dr. Stone was elected the best shōnen manga of 2018 at the 64th Shogakukan Manga Awards. Thirteen volumes of Dr. Stone have been released by Shueisha as of November 1, 2019.

From 2008 to 2010, Weekly Shōnen Jump published once a month a chapter of Hetappi Manga Kenkyūjo R (lit. \\"Hetappi Manga Research Lab R\\"), Murata's remake of Akira Toriyama's Hetappi Manga Kenkyūjo. It is a story about Saitou, a Jump editor based on Murata and Inagaki's own editor on Eyeshield 21, who decides to become a manga artist and threatens Murata to teach him how to draw manga. A collected volume of the series was released by Shueisha on June 3, 2011. In 2012, Murata posted on Twitter a short story in the same universe in which Saitou pesters the Murata for his manuscript and it was well received for its inventive use of folded paper, cutouts and white-out to create a three-dimensional appearance for his comic. Murata wrote and drew a one-shot titled Madofuki Park for the April 2008 issue (published on March 4) of Jump Square, about a futuristic window washer. He also created the one- shot Blust!, centered on a boy who was experimented on and obtained extraordinary powers from eating curry, which was published in April 2009. Murata created yet another one-shot featured in the Weekly Shōnen Jump on June 21, 2010; titled Minds, it was a story about a self-sacrificing soldier during a war, set in the future. Murata also illustrated the Weekly Shōnen Jump 40th anniversary posters, which display the popular manga characters featured in the magazine. Murata served as the artist for Donten Prism Solar Car, which was written by Yasuo Ōtagaki (author of Moonlight Mile) and was published in Jump Square between September 4, 2010 and June 4, 2011. The story of a young man who works at an ironworks and receives the request to build a solar car, it was later published by Shueisha in two volumes. In 2012, Murata published two one-shots along with a Japanese web comic author dubbed \\"One\\"; the first one, Dotō no Yūshatachi, was released on April 1 in Weekly Young Jump, and the second, Dangan Tenshi Fan Club was released on April 17 in Miracle Jump. Murata started to collaborate with One on the remake of the webcomic One-Punch Man, which started to be serialized in the online version of the Weekly Young Jump on June 14, 2012. Eighteen volumes have been released by Shueisha as of December 4, 2018. An anime adaptation, directed by Shingo Natsume and produced by Madhouse, aired from October 2015 to December 2015. In November 2013, Murata was hired to be the character designer for the Majin Bone anime adaptation that began in April 2014. For Square Enix's magazine Young Gangans 10th anniversary issue published on March 20, 2015, Murata did the illustration for One's Gokiburi Buster, a story about a soldier who is specialized on killing cockroaches. On June 30, 2016, Murata started to publish Mangaka Yashoku Benkyuusho (lit. \\"Manga Artist's Late-Night Snack Laboratory\\") on Kodansha magazine Morning digital edition. Each chapter features a fictionalized version of Murata preparing dishes, and its 33 chapters have been released into a single volume on December 12, 2016. On May 10, 2019 Murata's father passed away - this information was announced by Yusuke Murata and his brother Kensuke Murata. Influences and style Murata is a fan of Kinu Nishimura, the character designer of many Capcom video games and Akira Toriyama's Dragon Ball, with Goku's battles against Piccolo and Frieza being his favorite moments from the latter. Murata has been highly praised for his art and character designs, including comparisons to Toriyama by June Shimonishi of School Library Journal, as \\"every inch [is] filled with details and no gag left unseen.\\" Deb Aoki of About.com praised how Murata's art gives Eyeshield 21 dynamism, while \\"he adds a lot of clever, hilarious details.\\" Aoki also said Murata knows \\"his art is not just there to look pretty – it's there to tell a story.\\" Mania.com's Jarred Pine commended the character's features details and how \\"strong realistic designs are balanced with some exaggerated ones that add a nice comedic effect.\\" Murata's ability to draw from different perspectives and angles was praised by Aoki, Pine, as well as Zac Bertschy and Carlo Santos of Anime News Network. Saying that \\"it's difficult to capture the kind of frantic motion every panel exudes in animation,\\" Bertschy asserted the manga may be better than the anime because of Murata's art uniqueness. Santos said his capacity of creating imaginative features is not limited to action, praising the singularity of each of the main characters of Eyeshield 21.

(Canada) for both military and civilian use as a rugged bush plane. Design and development The Fairchild Aircraft Company undertook a progressive development of the Fairchild FC-2W2 light transport. Its first improvement was the FC-2, whose several improvements included slightly swept- back wings; wingspan increased to 50 feet; engine power nearly doubled; and interior changes to improve passenger comfort. The FC-2 first flew in 1926. The FC-2W was a further development, featuring: *Camera bay for vertical aerial photography; *Low-cut aft windows for oblique aerial photography. The FC-2 and FC-2W continued the use of fabric-covered welded steel tubing for fuselage and empennage construction, and strut-braced wooden-structure fabric- covered wings. The FC-2W, later known as the Model 71, was built in the United States between 1928 and 1930. In 1929 Fairchild formed a company in Canada (Fairchild Aircraft Limited) at Longueuil, Quebec in 1929 to support the Canadian operators of Fairchild aircraft. The Canadian company also set up a factory production line for the Model 71, developing a variant for the Canadian military. The Canadian-built aircraft differed from the US version in that all the passenger-comfort features were removed, and the craft were built specifically for aerial photography.Shearwater Aviation Museum: Aircraft History: Fairchild 71 Fairchild 71 in original PanAm colors Fairchild 71C at the Western Canada Aviation Museum, Winnipeg, Manitoba. Operational history The United States Army Air Service acquired one Model 71 for evaluation; it was designated XC-8, later redesignated XF-8 and used for photographic work. Eight more service-test aircraft, designated YF-1 were ordered; all nine were later redesignated C-8. The Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF), another major military operator, evaluated the Fairchild 71 in mid- June 1930. Thirty four RCAF F-71s were operated from 1930 to 1946. Along with the earlier FC-2 series, the RCAF F-71 was utilized primarily in the aerial photographic survey role as well as northern transport. In November 1934, the RCAF transferred the FC-71s to the five detachments flying in the amalgamated Maritimes No. 5 (Flying Boat) Squadron at RCAF Station Dartmouth. The squadron flew the FC-71 extensively on anti-smuggling (rum running) and illegal immigration patrols for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP). Most of the Model 71 production ended up in the hands of bush plane operators in Canada and the United States. Civilian operators likewise found the 71 a rugged, reliable and highly useful utility transport, well suited for northern and remote operations.

It is named after David Douglas, who collected seed from the plant during his botanical explorations. This thorny shrub is native to northern and western North America, where it grows in varied habitats from forest to scrubland. It is most abundant in the Pacific Northwest. Description Crataegus douglasii is a compact erect bushy shrub covered in fan-shaped green leaves with teeth along the distal margin. Thorns along the branches are one to two centimeters long. White flowers with greenish centers grow in bunches at the ends of each thin branch. The fruit is a very dark purple pome up to about a centimeter across. The fruits were a good food source for Native American peoples such as the Cheyenne and Nlaka'pamux. Ecology The foliage is browsed by cattle and sheep, and various birds, including quail, the Hungarian partridge, and ring- necked pheasant, feed on the berries.

Playing career Getgood was born in Coylton, Ayrshire. He joined local side Ayr United in 1912 before moving to England to join Reading in the Southern League in July 1914. Immediately on joining Reading his football career was interrupted by the First World War. During the war he served with the Royal Scots Fusiliers before joining the Royal Army Medical Corps in April 1916. After the cessation he returned to Reading in time for their first season in the Football League Third Division. While on the books of Reading he was known as George Goodman, and he made a total of 40 appearances, scoring once. He had acquired a reputation for strong tackling, and in August 1921 Birmingham signed him to strengthen their newly promoted side; he played ten First Division games at right half but did not settle, and transferred to Southampton in March 1922. At the time Southampton were leading the Third Division South table and their fans were confident of gaining promotion. Manager Jimmy McIntyre shocked them by announcing a four-player transfer: wingers Fred Foxall and Joe Barratt were to join Birmingham in exchange for Jack Elkes (a forward) and Getgood. The move was a success, however, as Southampton were able to claim the title by overtaking Plymouth Argyle on the final day of the season. Described by Holley & Chalk as \\"an accomplished and versatile player, whose best position was at centre-half\\", he failed to settle on the south coast and continued to live in Birmingham. In February 1923 he returned to the Midlands to join Wolverhampton Wanderers, with Bill McCall moving in the opposite direction as part of an exchange deal.Holley & Chalk, The Alphabet of the Saints, p. 215.

It was an integral part of Tibet during the Tang Dynasty. China made some inroads during the Yuan and Ming dynasties, and Mushi, the tribal chief of the Lijang region of Yunnan, was supported by the Ming government in his control of the region between 1568 and 1639. In 1642, Gushri Khan, the leader of the Qoshot Mongols was invited by the leaders of Tibet to aid them and he placed this whole region under his control and the administration of the Dalai Lamas. Batang was visited in the 1840s by two French priests, Abbé Évariste Régis Huc (1813–1860) and Abbé Joseph Gabet and a young Tibetan priest, who had been sent on a mission to Tibet and China by the Pope. They described it as a large, very populous and wealthy town. It marked the furthest point of Tibetan rule on the route to ChengduWilson, Andrew. (1875).

Land to the west of this pillar was administered from Lhasa, while the Tibetan chiefs of the tribes to the east came more directly under China. This historical Sino-Tibetan boundary was used until 1910. The states Der-ge, Nyarong, Batang, Litang, and the five Hor States—to name the more important districts—are known collectively in Lhasa as Kham, an indefinite term suitable to the Tibetan Government, who are disconcertingly vague over such details as treaties and boundaries.\\"Chapman, F.

He says that in the town of Bathan or Batan, with which he was personally acquainted, there were about 20 people regularly involved in washing for gold in spite of the severe laws against it. Among other mines in this region of Tibet, Abbé Desgodins reported there were five gold mines and three silver mines being worked in the Zhongtian Province in the upper Yangtze Valley, seven mines of gold, eight of silver and several more of other metals in the upper Mekong Valley and mines of gold, silver, mercury, iron and copper in a large number of other districts. \\"It is no wonder than that a Chinese proverb speaks of Tibet as being at once the most elevated and the richest country in the world, and that the Mandarins are so anxious to keep Europeans out of it.\\"Wilson, Andrew.

At Batang, Kesang Tsering, a half-Tibetan, claiming to be acting on behalf of Chiang Kai-shek (Pinyin: Jiang Jieshi. 1887-1975), managed to evict Liu Wen-hui's governor from the town with the support of some local tribes.

By early 1934 a ceasefire and armistices had been arranged with Liu Wen-hui and Governor Ma of Chinghai in which the Tibetans gave up all territory to the east of the Yangtze (including the region of Batang) but kept control of the Yaklo (Yenchin) district which had previously been a Chinese enclave to the west of the river.Richardson, Hugh E. (1984). Tibet and its History. 2nd Edition, pp. 134-136. Shambhala Publications, Boston. (pbk). The bloodless occupation of Chamdo, the major city of the old Tibetan province of Kham, by the 40,000 man army of the People's Republic of China on October 19, 1950, when the whole region fell under Chinese control, served as an important precursor to the eventual defeat of the Lhasa government.Mayhew, Bradley and Kohn, Michael. (2005). Tibet. 6th Edition, p. 262. Lonely Planet. . Chamdo's governor at the time of the occupation was Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme, who later became an official in the government of the People's Republic of China. The previous governor of Chamdo was Lhalu Tsewang Dorje.

The village belongs to a league of neighboring villages, which call themselves the Faluintjesgemeenten. Moorsel is the largest of the four villages with approximately 4,600 inhabitants. Name Today's accepted spelling \\"Moorsel\\" dates merely from the 18th century. Latin spellings, such as Morcella or Morscella (adj. Morscellensis), are dating back to about 1048 (Vita S. Gudilae). The name itself appears to be a combination of moor (marshland) and sele or sall (dwelling), hence a dwelling located in marshland. History Historical records about the village of Moorsel date back from the early Middle Ages. Approximately one-third of the territory, called Moorsel-proper, was controlled by a local landlord. His housings included a medieval moat, which is still visible in the landscape. The feudal title was elevated to a barony in 1661. The other part of the village (Moorsel-kapittel) was owned by the chapter of Dendermonde, probably from 868 on. One of the largest landowners in the region was the Abbey of Affligem, who possessed the church and the parish of Moorsel. Abbot Karl de Croy, Bishop of Tournai, built a water castle at Moorsel in 1546. Only after the French Revolution the feudal parts of the village (Moorsel-proper and Moorsel-kapittel), as well as the ecclesiastical influence of Affligem, were abolished. Landmarks Moorsel is home to a chapel dedicated to Saint Gudula. According to the Life of St. Gudula, she visited daily the church of Moorsel, two miles away from her home. The 14th century structure was built with sandstone from Meldert, one of the Faluintjesgemeenten. The parish church is dedicated to St. Martin. The Romanesque substructure dates from the 12th century. According local tradition, it is based on the foundations of the 7th century St. Salvator church, which Saint Gudula daily visited. The church counts three altars in baroque style, constructed by Jacob Ulner. Another curiosity is the renaissance castle, which is still preserved in its original condition. The castle is constructed was intended as a summer residence for the Karl de Croy, Abbot of the Abbey of Affligem and later on Bishop of Tournai. Coat of arms The village's coat of arms was granted 26 March 1914. The heraldic blazon can be described as follows: A shield of Argent with a bend of Gules, standing next to the left of the Virgin Mary, who is holding in her right hand a scepter, and bearing in her left arm the Child Jesus, both covered with a flowing mantle, their heads crowned and aureoled, all in Argent.

From 1965 to 1967 she worked at lighting- design offices in Finland and Germany. Returning to Japan in 1968, she established the Ishii Motoko Design Office. One of her major projects was the design for the lighting at Expo '75 in Okinawa. However, the rise in energy costs due to the energy crisis proved to be a problem. Beginning in the 1980s, she produced the designs for a number of major projects. Three big events for which she was responsible for the lighting were Expo '85 in Tsukuba, the light-up festival of Yokohama, and Japan Flora 2000. She designed lighting for the cities of Osaka, Hakodate, Himeji and Kurashiki, and for the gasshō-zukuri village at Shirakawa. Her 1989 redesign of the lighting for Tokyo Tower brought international attention. She won the Illuminating Engineering Society of North America Prize for the Light Fantasy Electricity Pavilion at the International Garden and Greenery Exposition (Osaka, 1990) and again for the Rainbow Bridge (1994). Other major projects include Osaka and Himeji Castles; the Akashi Straits and the Yokohama Bay Bridges; the Heisei Building at the Tokyo National Museum; the Gifu World Fresh Water Aquarium; the station building of Tokyo Station; Roppongi Hills Mori Tower, and Ebisu Garden Place. In 2009, she designed the lighting of Elisabeth Bridge in Budapest, Hungary. The project was financed half by the Budapest City Council and half by Japanese individuals and companies as a gift in memoriam the 140th anniversary of establishing diplomatic links between the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy and Japan, and the 50th anniversary of re-establishing diplomatic links between Japan and Hungary .http://english.mti.hu/default.asp?menu=1&theme;=2&cat;=25&newsid;=265827 Trivia Motoko's father Teizo Takeuchi was a member of the Japan national team for the 1936 Summer Olympics football competition in Berlin.

Soon afterwards he began renting, then buying land in nearby East Hinsdale, Queens County, near other nurseries. =Business= Within five years of building his own seed and bulb business and starting America's first seed catalog business, Childs established a bustling business. The volume of his business is attributed with the expansion of the Floral Park Post Office and nearby village businesses. Additionally, Childs was responsible for building more than 20 buildings in Floral Park, including hotels, lumber mills and his own printing press. He also provided a public park for the community,Ross, P.

He ran twice unsuccessfully for a seat in the U.S. Congress. =Land holdings= Childs bought a great deal of land in the area around Floral Park. His extensive land holdings related mainly to his seed catalog business, with more than used for that purpose near St. James, New York and eastern Long Island. Today, \\"Flowerfields\\" is an area within St. James that was founded by Childs around 1909. =Ornithology= Childs was an elected member of the American Ornithological Union and maintained one of the largest private ornithology libraries in the United States. He possessed the largest privately held collection of over 1,100 mounted North American birds, most with nest and eggs. He personally collected more than 700 specimens of this collection. He was also a friend of John Burroughs, who contributed articles on birds to Childs’ magazine, The Warbler. Childs published the journal from 1906 to 1913. Death Childs died aboard a New York Central train from Albany to New York City in 1921. His company continued to operate in the 1920s, only stopping in the Great Depression. His wife sold the seed catalog operation to the Edward T. Bromfield Seed Company in the mid-1920s. Childs’ realty holdings were sold in the mid-1930s, valued by the broker at $2,000,000.

In 1852, he was appointed Public Administrator. He was New York County District Attorney in 1858, elected on the Democratic ticket in November 1857, but resigned due to ill health. Sweeny was City Chamberlain and Park Commissioner under Mayor A. Oakey Hall. He became notorious as a central figure in the ring that controlled Tammany Hall, and was depicted prominently in Thomas Nast's cartoons alongside Boss Tweed, Richard B. Connolly and A. Oakey Hall. With Tweed, he was a director of the Erie Railroad, which became \\"a gigantic highway of robbery and disgrace\\".Paine 1904, p. 157. Sweeny was also Director of the Tenth National Bank, in which city funds were deposited. In Nast's cartoons, Tweed and Sweeny were often identified as \\"Tweeny and Sweed\\"; in others, Sweeny was identified as \\"Peter 'Brains' Sweeny\\". Public indignation over the theft of millions of dollars by the Tweed ring led to the downfall of the Ring in the municipal election of November 7, 1871. Sweeny resigned from public life the following day.Paine 1904, p. 198. In February 1872, Sweeny was indicted but the D.A.'s office decided for nolle prosequi, and Sweeny went to Canada. In 1877, Sweeny paid $400,000 to New York City in exchange for forgiveness. The fact that the sum was paid in the name of his recently deceased brother, James M. Sweeney, who had been a minor player in the financial operations of the Ring, was widely condemned in the press. On June 7, 1877, the Evening Post wrote, \\"Of course, nobody will be deceived by this disgraceful and offensive sham. The suit of the people was not against James M. Sweeny ... It is known that he lived by the breath of his brother, that he was but a mere miserable tool\\". Sweeny died at the home of his son Arthur Sweeny, Assistant Corporation Counsel of New York City.

Early life James Stephens was born on November 9, 1806, in Brooke County, Virginia (later West Virginia) to Emmor Stephens.Corning, Howard M. (1989) Dictionary of Oregon History. Binfords & Mort Publishing. p. 234. When he was eight, his family moved to a farm in the Indiana Territory. He learned the cooper trade, and practiced for several years in Indiana and in Cincinnati, Ohio. James married Elizabeth Walker in 1830 while living in Kentucky. They would have seven children, of whom they would outlive all but one. He established a farm and a grocery store before moving to the Oregon Country in 1844, where he settled near what is now Portland, Oregon. Oregon James and Elizabeth Stephens from Elwood Evans history (1889). He started a cooper shop in Oregon City and got his barrel-making stock from William Overton, one of the founders of Portland. Stephens refused Overton's offer to sell him his Portland land claim for 300 new salmon barrels because he planned to bid for another claim, which he secured in 1845 and on which East Portland was founded. East Portland was also known as Stephens' Addition. In 1846 he made 1000 flour barrels and 400 salmon barrels for the Hudson's Bay Company, and in 1847 he made 400 beef barrels for shipment to the Sandwich Islands. In East Portland he operated the first ferry, located near the present location of the Morrison Bridge.Sullivan, Ann. Four historical commemorative plaques to be replaced in Waterfront Park. The Oregonian, March 9, 1989. It began operations in 1846, and was the first ferry in what became Multnomah County (it was part of Twality District at that time). During the California Gold Rush, Stephens sold his land and headed south to the gold fields. He returned in 1850 and purchased land in what is now Southeast Portland from John McLoughlin.Barnett, Erin Hoover. Southeast Portland, revisited. The Oregonian, May 27, 2007. Stephens laid out the town from the Willamette River to East First Street, and from Glisan Street to Hawthorne Street. Dividing his land into town lots, which he offered to settlers on their own terms, Stephens was said to materially aiding the development of the east side of the river. The Stark Street Ferry across the Willamette River began operating in 1853. In 1855, he helped organize the Pacific Telegraph Company. Stephens expanded East Portland in 1861 and opened the East Portland Savings and Loan Bank. In 1862, he donated the land for the construction of the Oregon Hospital for the Insane in East Portland. The bank, which was at First and Oak streets, closed in 1873. Stephens operated a ferry across the Willamette River at Oregon City for 17 years. =Cemetery= Gravestone of James and Elizabeth Stephens James’ father Emmor died in 1846 and was buried on the family land in East Portland.Terry, John. Oregon’s Trails: Past luminaries at peace all across Oregon’s landscape. The Oregonian, May 25, 2003. When Stephens sold the land to Colburn Barrell in 1854, he required Barrell to maintain the grave site. On April 8, 1854, Barrell’s ship Gazelle exploded and killed his partner and several others, all buried next to Emmor Stephens. Barrell then created Mt. Crawford Cemetery on , which became Lone Fir Cemetery after 1866 when more had been added to the grounds of the cemetery. Stephens and his wife Elizabeth are buried at the cemetery. Legacy James B. Stephens died on March 22, 1889, at the age of 82. The liberty ship SS James B. Stephens was named for him. The National Register of Historic Places-listed James B.

Tollmann born 1945 in Cologne, is a German artist, working now for about 50 years as a photographer, painter, performance and large screen multi- vision artist. He finished the training as a graphics designer in 1964. Subsequently, he studied graphics and design at the Kölner Werkschulen until 1968. Even in this time he started his career as a professional free artist. Life 1\\\\. beginnings: Photography, multi-vision and painting 1965- 1969 During these early years, Helmut Tollmann was experiencing a lot of photographical techniques and chemical procedures. He had won in these early times more than 25 national and international awards, that can be proved by press and certificates. The historic material of these years is not even regrounded. But as you can see, the most of all the procedures Helmut Tollmann is using until today in his artistic work, posterisation, lithographic films and developers, solarisation and reprographic use of photographic techniques can be found in his works until now, especially in his multi-layer-technique. 2\\\\. new ways and techniques 1970-1974 Beginning in the early seventies Helmut Tollmann was principally involved in paintings of architecture and landscapes, deeply impressed by the work of Max Ernst. The proximity of Helmut Tollmann’s early paintings to Max Ernst is no coincidence. Max Ernst invented a lot of procedures and techniques in modern painting (the frottage, for example) and so did Helmut Tollmann. Always looking for new media and procedures useful for artistic utilization. In this period he painted his so-called “soft landscapes”.„Softlandschaften lassen der Phantasie viel Raum“ (Translation: soul landscapes open up a wide area for phantasy) Rheinische Post (Newspaper) 14. August 1982 They look like silk paintings. Helmut Tollmann’s artistic expression based on the study of Max Ernst. And so did the architectural paintings too. 3\\\\. Bringing painting, reprography and printing technique together 1974-1985 In these days Helmut Tollmann and a lot his friends (for example Andy Warhol) and colleagues were using reprographic and photographic techniques, especially in Pop-Art. But Helmut Tollmann tried something one can estimate maybe not before today. He brought the squeegee from silk screen printing into painting years before others. In these paintings you can also find elements of technical and electronic processes, which go together more and more with his art the coming years. 4\\\\. Technology and the soul in world and mankind – “Soul of Chip” 1985-1997 The painting media were changing more and more. Using new colors and the canvas of his work is changing to copper plates, printed circuit boards and so on. All corresponding to the main theme in Helmut Tollmann’s works of that time “soul of chip”, a registered trade mark of Helmut Tollmann until today.„Auf dem großen Stand der Firma DEBIS (Daimler Benz Stuttgart) sind ca. 50 Bilder im Großformat unter dem Titel „Soul of Chip“ zu sehen...

Multimedia, illumination and information technology mixed in multi-layer artwork. 5\\\\. Links – the connecting aspect between technology and mankind 1998-2007 In this shift of emphasis from searching for the “soul of chip” to the use of media the new theme in Helmut Tollmann’s work was showing up: Links.„Eine Komposition der digitalen Zeit“ (Translation: a composition of the digital times), Der Kunsthandel (Magazine for Art Dealers and Collectors) 10/2001 The chance to join apparently disparate projects like: Wirkbetrieb 1, a projects of T-Systems\\"Wirkbetrieb 1\\", Catalogue exhibition, Wirkbetrieb I, T-Systems GEI GmbH, Text and concept: Sabine Westermann, Copyright for all images by the artists and “Together” a project of the initiative tolerance under the patronage of Joschka Fischer former minister of foreign affairs.„Ein Miteinander von Kunst, Lyrik und Musik...

Several members of the Vukanović dynasty also ruled in some other regions (Zachlumia, Travunia, Duklja, and also Croatia). The house may have descended from the Vojislavljević dynasty of Duklja. Vukanović dynasty was later succeeded in Serbia by the closely related Nemanjić dynasty. The Vukanović family was named by later historians, after its founder Vukan of Serbia. However, the family itself is also known as the Urošević dynasty (, Uroševići / Урошевићи), after Vukan's nephew, Uroš I of Serbia. The rulers of this dynasty were split into two branches: the branch in Raška and the branch in Zachumlia. Rulers of the first branch wore the title Grand Prince () of Serbia, while its Zachlumian branch wore the title Duke of Zachlumia. Other titles included Ban of Croatia, held by Beloš of the branch in Raška, Prince of Duklja (Zeta) and Travunia, held by Desa of the same branch, and Count of Split, held by Petar of the Zachlumian branch. Other titles included Duke of Upper Zachlumia, held by Toljen II of the Zachlumian branch, Duke of Southern Zachlumia, held by Andrija of the Zachlumian branch, and Prince of the Littoral, also held by Andrija of the Zachlumian branch. According to the Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja, Doclean king Constantine Bodin gained inner Serbia (c. 1083-1084) and assigned two princes from his court, brothers Vukan and Marko, to govern the region of Raška.

Theophilus Karaphillis as Greek Priest at Epiphany Production The film originally was called Twelve Mile Reef and was announced in September 1952, with the leads to be played by Robert Wagner and Kathleen Crowley. By December, the female lead was going to be Debra Paget. In February 1953, Fox announced the film would be shot in CinemaScope. That month, the first CinemaScope movie, The Robe, began filming. Beneath was the third film shot in that process, after How to Mary a Millionaire, and the first shot underwater. Also that month, Terry Moore was given the female lead. Filming started 6 April 1953. The film was shot on location in Key West and Tarpon Springs, Florida. There were rumors during filming that Moore and Wagner had a romance. In reality, Wagner secretly was seeing Barbara Stanwyck, and Moore was seeing Howard Hughes. Wagner almost drowned during filming at Tarpon Springs when he accidentally was kicked in the stomach by another actor. He sunk to the bottom of the water and had to be rescued by a crew member. Gloria Gordon, who had a small role, was signed to a seven-year contract. Critical reception Bosley Crowther of The New York Times observed \\"Another and further extension of the range of CinemaScope ... is handsomely manifested in Beneath the 12-Mile Reef ... But that, when you come right down to it, is just about the only novelty provided by this third employment of the anamorphic lens. For the scenes shot above the surface, while large and imposing, are routine, and the drama developed in the screen play is hackneyed and banal. And, unfortunately, most of the picture takes place above, not below, the reef ... There is nothing at all fascinating or edifying here.\\" Variety wrote \\"[T]he squeeze-lensing gives punch in the display of underwater wonders, the seascapes and the brilliant, beautiful sunrises and sunsets of the Florida Gulf coast. In handling the young cast, Robert D. Webb's direction is less effective, particularly in the case of Robert Wagner and Terry Moore. Both are likable, so the shallowness of their performances is no serious handicap to the entertainment.\\" Variety review Awards and nominations Edward Cronjager was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Cinematography, and Robert D. Webb was nominated for the Grand Prize at the 1954 Cannes Film Festival.

Playing career Barratt was born in Bulkington, Warwickshire and played his early football with local side Nuneaton Town. During the First World War he served with the Royal Berkshire Regiment and was a guest player for Leicester Fosse, Birmingham and Southampton. At the end of the war, he signed for Southampton in time for the first post-war season. Playing on the right-wing, he only missed one game in Southampton's final season in the Southern League as he provided the crosses for the forwards, Arthur Dominy and Bill Rawlings to score. In 1920 Southampton, along with most Southern League clubs, joined the inaugural Football League Third Division. According to Holley & Chalk's \\"The Alphabet of the Saints\\", \\"his creative, storming runs down the right flank were most effective as Saints made the successful transition between the Southern League and Division Three\\". Barratt had the unusual habit of always playing with a piece of straw in his mouth. In March 1921, he was injured (to be replaced by Charlie Brown) and was unable to help in the run-in to the end of the season when Saints finished second, missing out on the only available promotion spot. For the following season, he reclaimed his place in the starting line-up from Brown and missed only a few games before he was suddenly transferred to Birmingham in March. At the time Southampton were leading the Third Division South table and their fans were confident of gaining promotion. Manager Jimmy McIntyre shocked them by announcing a four player transfer, with wingers Fred Foxall and Barratt moving to Birmingham in exchange for Jack Elkes (a forward) and George Getgood (a half-back). In his three years at The Dell Barratt made 101 appearances in all competitions, scoring eight goals. Barratt played in 26 consecutive First Division games from his arrival at Birmingham until injury intervened in November 1922. He failed to regain a regular place, and in June 1923 joined Pontypridd for one season, during which he helped the club to the championship of the Welsh Football League. He returned to the Football League with Lincoln City for two years, before spending 1926–27 with Bristol Rovers. He then went back to his first club Nuneaton Town and also played for Coventry Colliery. After the Second World War he joined Coventry City as a youth team coach. He died in Coventry in April 1968, aged 73.

The Christmas celebrations end on 19 January, the date of \\"Yordan\\" or Epiphany in the Julian calendar.Christmas Traditions As of 2017, December 25, Christmas day by the Gregorian, became an official government holiday. The Eastern Orthodox Church and Ukrainian Greek Catholic Churches predominately follow the Julian Calendar, and January 7 is also a public holiday in Ukraine. The winter holiday cycle is said to begin with December 1, St. Roman's day; the period from December 1 to January 19 is thus jokingly called \\"Ukrainian Ramadan\\" (from Roman to Yordan). Sviatyi Vechir (Holy Evening) Christmas Eve, or as it called 'Sviatyi Vechir' in Ukrainian ('Holy Evening') is filled with numerous customs and rituals. The customs include: decorating house and dinner table with special attributes (didukh, garlic, hay and others), performing koliadky ('carols') and so on. Each ritual has its own meaning and purpose, as such a few wisps of hay on the embroidered tablecloth as a reminder of the manger in Bethlehem. One the most prominent customs of the night is a special supper, called Sviata Vecherya (Holy Supper). Kutia (sweet grain pudding) is traditionally served at the Ukrainian Christmas dinner table. It is often the first dish in the traditional twelve- dish Christmas Eve supper (also known as Svyaty Vechir) and is rarely served at other times of the year.Sviat Vechir Koliadky (Caroling) At the end of the Sviata Vechera the family often sings \\"koliadky\\". In many communities the ancient Ukrainian tradition of caroling is carried on by groups of young people and members of organizations and churches calling at homes and collecting donations. The Ukrainian song \\"Shchedryk\\" became the basis for the world famous Christmas carol, \\"Carol of the Bells\\". Another well-known carol is Boh predvičnyj narodivsja. Didukh (Grandfather) When the children see the first star in the eastern evening sky, symbolizing the trek of the Three Men in a boat, by honey singh may begin. In farming communities the head of the household now brings in a sheaf of wheat called the didukh which represents the importance of the ancient and rich wheat crops of Ukraine, the staff of life through the centuries. Didukh means literally \\"grandfather spirit\\" so it symbolizes the family's ancestors. In city homes a few stalks of golden wheat in a vase are often used to decorate the table. Shopka (Nativity scene) Shopka is a traditional portable nativity scene used to represent nativity and other figures in a puppet form. Christmas Tree Small ornaments in the shape of a spider (known as pavuchky, literally \\"little spiders\\") and spider webs are traditionally a part of Ukrainian Christmas tree decorations. They represent the Legend of the Christmas Spider.

He states that both competition between groups and competition between individuals shape the evolution of the genome. Bloom \\"explores the intricate relationships among genetics, human behavior, and culture\\" and argues that \\"evil is a by-product of nature's strategies for creation and that it is woven into our most basic biological fabric\\". It sees selection (e.g., through violent competition) as central to the creation of the \\"superorganism\\" of society. It also focuses on competition between individuals for position in the \\"pecking order\\" and competition between groups for standing in pecking orders of groups. The Lucifer Principle shows how ideas are vital in creating cohesion and cooperation in these pecking order battles. Says The Lucifer Principle: \\"Superorganism, ideas and the pecking order...these are the primary forces behind much of human creativity and earthly good.\\" Reception of the book Reviews of the book saw it as \\"ambitious\\" and \\"disturbing\\" in its conclusions that societies based on individual freedom might succumb to systems such as bureaucratic Communism or Islamic fundamentalism. The Washington Post said that \\"Readers will be mesmerized by the mirror Bloom holds to the human condition... He draws on a dozen years of research into a jungle of scholarly fields...and meticulously supports every bit of information....\\" while Chet Raymo in the Boston Globe termed it \\"a string of rhetorical firecrackers that challenge our many forms of self-righteousness\\". Bloom responds to Islamic issues Bloom later wrote that he and his publisher had been threatened by Islamic groups who objected to aspects of the book. He claimed that \\"Arab pressure groups asked ever so politely that The Lucifer Principle be withdrawn from print and that nothing that I write be published again. They offered to boycott my publisher's products—all of them—worldwide. And they backed their warning with a call for my punishment in seventeen Islamic countries.\\" Bloom states that the attorney for the Authors Guild wrote to his publishers, warning of an author boycott if the book was pulled from the shelves. The publishers asked Bloom to rewrite a chapter on Islamic violence, which led to the creation of 358 lines of footnotes attesting to the facts he presented within it, documenting that what Bloom wrote about Islam in The Lucifer Principle is based on expertise. Bloom is a frequent guest on Iran's Press TV, Iran's Al-Alam TV, Saudi Arabia's KSA-2 TV, and on Syria's Alikhbariya TV.

Political campaigns =Unsuccessful 1986 U.S. Senate primary campaign= In 1986, Herschensohn unsuccessfully sought the Republican nomination for the United States Senate seat held by Democrat Alan Cranston. He finished far ahead of the crowded pack in most of Southern California but finished second statewide to Silicon Valley Representative Ed Zschau, who won the nomination by plurality. =1992 U.S. Senate election= In 1992, when Cranston retired, Herschensohn won the Republican nomination narrowly, defeating U.S. Representative Tom Campbell, a more moderate Republican who had been on the faculty of Stanford University and who had been elected to Zschau's former Congressional seat. Herschensohn received 956,136 votes (38.2 percent) to Campbell's 895,970 (35.8 percent). The remaining 417,848 ballots (16.7 percent) went to Mayor Sonny Bono of Palm Springs, also a relative moderate. During the primary campaign and afterwards, Herschensohn became a close friend of Bono and encouraged his former rival to seek election to the United States House of Representatives in 1994. Herschensohn lost the 1992 general election to the Democratic Party nominee Barbara Boxer, while winning over one million votes more than the national ticket of the Republican Party.

Marx went one way; Warren and Proudhon the other. Thus were born State Socialism and Anarchism...Authority, takes many shapes, but, broadly speaking, her enemies divide themselves into three classes: first, those who abhor her both as a means and as an end of progress, opposing her openly, avowedly, sincerely, consistently, universally; second, those who profess to believe in her as a means of progress, but who accept her only so far as they think she will subserve their own selfish interests, denying her and her blessings to the rest of the world; third, those who distrust her as a means of progress, believing in her only as an end to be obtained by first trampling upon, violating, and outraging her. These three phases of opposition to Liberty are met in almost every sphere of thought and human activity. Good representatives of the first are seen in the Catholic Church and the Russian autocracy; of the second, in the Protestant Church and the Manchester school of politics and political economy; of the third, in the atheism of Gambetta and the socialism of the socialism off Karl Marg.\\" Benjamin Tucker.

Anarchism has many heterogeneous and diverse schools of thought, united by a common opposition to compulsory rule. Anarchist schools are characterized by \\"the belief that government is both harmful and unnecessary\\", but may differ fundamentally, supporting anything from extreme individualism to complete collectivism.Slevin, Carl. \\"Anarchism\\". The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Politics. Ed. Iain McLean and Alistair McMillan. Oxford University Press, 2003. Regardless, some are viewed as being compatible, and it is not uncommon for individuals to subscribe to more than one. Some of the following terms do not refer to specific branches of anarchist thought, but rather are generic labels applied to various branches, they are marked as umbrella terms. = Classical = * Individualist anarchism (umbrella term) – several traditions of thought that emphasize the individual and their will over any kinds of external determinants such as groups, society, traditions and ideological systems.\\"What do I mean by individualism? I mean by individualism the moral doctrine which, relying on no dogma, no tradition, no external determination, appeals only to the individual conscience.\\"Mini-Manual of Individualism by Han Ryner\\"I do not admit anything except the existence of the individual, as a condition of his sovereignty. To say that the sovereignty of the individual is conditioned by Liberty is simply another way of saying that it is conditioned by itself.\\"\\"Anarchism and the State\\" in Individual Liberty  Philosophical anarchism – according to The Blackwell Dictionary of Modern Social Thought, philosophical anarchism \\"is a component especially of individualist anarchism\\". This tendency contends that the state lacks moral legitimacy and there is no individual obligation or duty to obey the state, which conversely, has no right to command individuals, but does not advocates revolution to eliminate the state.Outhwaite, William & Tourain, Alain (Eds.). (2003). Anarchism. The Blackwell Dictionary of Modern Social Thought (2nd Edition, p. 12). Blackwell Publishing  Egoist anarchism – a tendency originated in the philosophy of Max Stirner which is usually called \\"egoism\\". It rejects devotion to \\"a great idea, a cause, a doctrine, a system, a lofty calling\\", saying that the egoist has no political calling but rather \\"lives themselves out\\" without regard to \\"how well or ill humanity may fare thereby\\".Moggach, Douglas. The New Hegelians. Cambridge University Press, 2006 p. 183 * Illegalism – a tendency that developed primarily in France, Italy, Belgium and Switzerland during the early 1900s.\\"The illegalisis in this study,...As anarchist individualists, they came from a milieu whose most important theoretical inspiration was undoubtedly Max Stimer—whose work The Ego and Its Own remains the most powerful negation of the State, and affirniation of the individual, to date.\\"—Richard Parry, The Bonnot Gang: the history of the French illegalists], 1987, p. 5.\\"Parallel to the social, collectivist anarchist current there was an individualist one whose partisans emphasized their individual freedom and advised other individuals to do the same...Some individualists rebelled by withdrawing from the economy and forming voluntary associations to achieve self-sufficiency. Others took the route of illegalism, attacking the economy through the direct individual reappropriation of wealth. Thus theft, counterfeiting, swindling and robbery became a way of life for hundreds of individualists, as it was already for countless thousands of proletarians.—\\"The \\"Illegalists\\"\\" by Doug Imrie (from Anarchy: A Journal of Desire Armed, Fall-Winter, 1994–95) It embraces either openly or secretly criminality as a lifestyle, using Max Stirner's Egoism as a justification. Illegalism does not specify the type of crime, though it is associated with theft and shoplifting.  Existentialist anarchism – some observers believe existentialism forms a philosophical ground for anarchism. Anarchist historian Peter Marshall claims, \\"there is a close link between the existentialists' stress on the individual, free choice, and moral responsibility and the main tenets of anarchism\\".Marshall, Peter. Demanding the Impossible: A History of Anarchism. pg.580 * Mutualism – some see mutualism as between individualist and social forms of anarchism.Avrich, Paul. Anarchist Voices: An Oral History of Anarchism in America, Princeton University Press 1996 , p. 6 Blackwell Encyclopaedia of Political Thought, Blackwell Publishing 1991 , p. 11 This tendency concerns with reciprocity, free association, voluntary contract, federation and credit and currency reform. It states that a market without government intervention drives prices down to labor-costs, eliminating profit, rent and interest according to the labor theory of value forcing firms to compete over workers by raising the wages (instead of workers competing over firms).\\"Under the mutual system, each individual will receive the just and exact pay for his work; services equivalent in cost being exchangeable for services equivalent in cost, without profit or discount; and so much as the individual laborer will then get over and above what he has earned will come to him as his share in the general prosperity of the community of which he is an individual member.\\" From \\"Communism versus Mutualism\\", Socialistic, Communistic, Mutualistic and Financial Fragments.

Anarchist Voices: An Oral History of Anarchism in America. AK Press. p. 5 It opposes all private ownership of the means of production, instead advocating that ownership be collectivized. Some collectivists do not oppose the use of currency, supporting workers being paid based on the amount of time they contributed to production and purchasing commodities in a communal market.Bakunin, Mikhail. Bakunin on Anarchism. Black Rose Books. 1980. p. 369 This contrasts with anarcho-communism where wages and currency would be abolished and where individuals would take freely from a storehouse of goods.

It views patriarchy as a manifestation of involuntary coercive hierarchy that should be replaced by decentralized free association. It states that the struggle against patriarchy is an essential part of class struggle, and the anarchist struggle against the state. * Green anarchism – a tendency that puts a particular emphasis on environmental issues. It extends anarchist ideology beyond a critique of human interactions, including a critique of the interactions between humans and non-humans,'Green Anarchism: Towards the Abolition of Hierarchy' which culminates in a revolutionary praxis that is not merely dedicated to human liberation, but also to interspecies liberation,'Steve Best on total liberation' aiming to bring about an environmentally sustainable anarchist society.  Anarcho- naturism – a tendency that unites anarchist and naturist philosophies,\\"Anarchism and the different Naturist views have always been related.\\"\\"Anarchism – Nudism, Naturism\\" by Carlos Ortega at Asociacion para el Desarrollo Naturista de la Comunidad de Madrid.

In the 1920s the inhabitants of the anarchist community at Whiteway, near Stroud in Gloucestershire, shocked the conservative residents of the area with their shameless nudity.\\"\\"Nudism the radical tradition\\" by Terry Phillips that advocates vegetarianism, free love, hiking and an ecological world view within anarchist groups and outside them, also promoting small ecovillages, and most prominently nudism as a way to avoid the artificiality of the industrial mass society of modernity.  Anarcho- primitivism – tendency that critiques the origins and progress of civilization, which states that the shift from hunter-gatherer to agricultural subsistence gave rise to social stratification, coercion, alienation, and population growth.  Social ecology – a theory associated with Murray Bookchin through his work. It is a utopian philosophy of human evolution that combines the nature of biology and society into a third \\"thinking nature\\" beyond biochemistry and physiology, which is argued as a more complete, conscious, ethical, and rational nature, that view humanity as the latest development from the long history of organic development on Earth. It proposes ethical principles for replacing a society's propensity for hierarchy and domination with that of democracy and freedom. * Anarcho-pacifism – tendency within the anarchist movement that rejects the use of violence in the struggle for social change and the abolition of the state.George Woodcock. Anarchism: A History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements (1962) * Insurrectionary anarchism – revolutionary tendency and practice that emphasizes insurrection within anarchist practice\\"Some Notes on Insurrectionary Anarchism\\" and criticize formal organizations such as labor unions and federations that are based on a political programme and periodic congresses, advocating informal organization and small affinity group based organization. Insurrectionary anarchists put value in attack, permanent class conflict and a refusal to negotiate or with class enemies. * Religious anarchism (umbrella term) – religious anarchists view organised religion mostly as authoritarian and hierarchical that has strayed from its humble origins.  Buddhist anarchism – tendency that notes Buddhist scriptures such as the Kalama Sutta to have an inherently libertarian emphasis, placing a priority on the questioning of all authority and dogma, with properly informed personal choice as final arbiter. The Indian revolutionary atheist Har Dayal, influenced by Karl Marx and Mikhail Bakunin, moved to Oakland and established the Bakunin Institute of California, described as \\"the first monastery of anarchism\\".Anarchist Portraits by Paul Avrich, Princeton University Press, 1988, p30Ghadar Movement: Ideology, Organisation and Strategy by Karish K. Puri, Guru Nanak Dev University Press, 1983  Christian anarchism – tendency that avocates that there is only one source of authority to which Christians are ultimately answerable, the authority of God as embodied in the teachings of Jesus. It states that freedom from government or Church is justified spiritually and will only be guided by the grace of God if Man shows compassion to others and turns the other cheek when confronted with violence.  Jewish anarchism – tendency that combines contemporary radical ideas with traditional Judaism. Some Jewish mystical groups were based on anti-authoritarian principles, somewhat similar to the Christian Quakers and Dukhobors. Martin Buber, a deeply religious philosopher, had frequently referred to the Hasidic tradition. The Orthodox Kabbalist rabbi Yehuda Ashlag believed in a religious version of libertarian communism, based on principles of Kabbalah, which he called altruist communism. * Anarchism without adjectives – in the words of historian George Esenwein, \\"referred to an unhyphenated form of anarchism, that is, a doctrine without any qualifying labels such as communist, collectivist, mutualist, or individualist. For others, ... [it] was simply understood as an attitude that tolerated the coexistence of different anarchist schools.\\"Esenwein, George Richard \\"Anarchist Ideology and the Working Class Movement in Spain, 1868–1898\\" [p. 135] It served as basis for the synthesis anarchism federation. = Contemporary = * Black anarchism – a loose term sometimes applied to group together a number of people of African descent who identify with anarchism opposing the existence of the state, the subjugation and domination of black people, and other groups, and favor a non-hierarchical organization of society. It argues for class struggle while stressing the importance of ending racial and national oppression, opposing white supremacy, patriarchy and capitalism, rejecting narrow or vulgar forms of \\"anarchism\\" that ignore issues of race and national oppression.Pedro RibeiroReflections on APOC and the fate of Black Anarchism * Crypto-anarchism – a tendency of anarchy accomplished through computer technology,Crypto-anarchism.

There is a branch of market anarchism which is left- wing market anarchism (such as mutualists) that is anti-capitalist and self- identify as part of the socialist movementGary Chartier has joined Kevin Carson, Charles Johnson, and others (echoing the language of Benjamin Tucker and Thomas Hodgskin) in maintaining that, because of its heritage and its emancipatory goals and potential, radical market anarchism should be seen—by its proponents and by others—as part of the socialist tradition, and that market anarchists can and should call themselves \\"socialists.\\" See Gary Chartier, \\"Advocates of Freed Markets Should Oppose Capitalism,\\" \\"Free-Market Anti-Capitalism?\\" session, annual conference, Association of Private Enterprise Education (Cæsar's Palace, Las Vegas, NV, April 13, 2010); Gary Chartier, \\"Advocates of Freed Markets Should Embrace 'Anti-Capitalism'\\"; Gary Chartier, Socialist Ends, Market Means: Five Essays. Cp. Tucker, \\"Socialism.\\" and there is another branch who identify as anarcho-capitalists stress the legitimacy and priority of private property, describing it as an integral component of individual rights and a free market economy. Thus, the term may refer either to libertarian socialists (like Pierre-Joseph Proudhon and Benjamin Tucker) or to anarcho-capitalists (like Murray RothbardEditor's note in \\"Taxation: Voluntary or Compulsory\\".

Friedman's philosophy as \\"market anarchism.\\" Agorism – a tendency that advocates the creation of a society in which all relations between people are voluntary exchanges by means of counter-economics, thus engaging with aspects of peaceful revolution, proposed by the libertarian philosopher Samuel Edward Konkin III.Gordon, David (1 April 2011) Sam Konkin and Libertarian Theory, LewRockwell.com  Anarcho-capitalism – political philosophy which advocates the elimination of the state in favor of individual sovereignty, private property, and open markets. Anarcho-capitalists believe that in the absence of statute (law by decree or legislation), society would improve itself through the discipline of the free market (or what its proponents describe as a \\"voluntary society\\").Edward Stringham, Anarchy and the law: the political economy of choice, p. 51 See anarchism and capitalism. A strong current within anarchism does not consider that anarcho-capitalism as part of the anarchist movement because anarchism has historically been an anti- capitalist movement and for definitional reasons which see anarchism incompatible with capitalist forms.\\"The philosophy of \\"anarcho-capitalism\\" dreamed up by the \\"libertarian\\" New Right, has nothing to do with Anarchism as known by the Anarchist movement proper.\\"Meltzer, Albert. Anarchism: Arguments For and Against AK Press, (2000) p. 50\\"In fact, few anarchists would accept the 'anarcho-capitalists' into the anarchist camp since they do not share a concern for economic equality and social justice, Their self-interested, calculating market men would be incapable of practising voluntary co-operation and mutual aid. Anarcho-capitalists, even if they do reject the State, might therefore best be called right-wing libertarians rather than anarchists.\\" Peter Marshall. Demanding the Impossible: A History of Anarchism. Harper Perennial.

The situation has been vastly complicated in recent decades with the rise of anarcho-capitalism, ‘minimal statism’ and an extreme right-wing laissez-faire philosophy advocated by such theorists as Murray Rothbard and Robert Nozick and their adoption of the words ‘libertarian’ and ‘libertarianism’. It has therefore now become necessary to distinguish between their right libertarianism and the left libertarianism of the anarchist tradition.\\" Anarchist Seeds Beneath the Snow: Left-Libertarian Thought and British Writers from William Morris to Colin Ward by David Goodway. Liverpool University Press. Liverpool. 2006. p. 4\\"Within Libertarianism, Rothbard represents a minority perspective that actually argues for the total elimination of the state. However Rothbard’s claim as an anarchist is quickly voided when it is shown that he only wants an end to the public state. In its place he allows countless private states, with each person supplying their own police force, army, and law, or else purchasing these services from capitalist venders...so what remains is shrill anti- statism conjoined to a vacuous freedom in hackneyed defense of capitalism.

Since traditional anarchism is a movement arising from the struggles of proletarians in industrialized western European nations – and thus sees history from their perspective – post-colonial anarchism approaches the same principles (mutual aid, class struggle, opposition to social hierarchy, community-level self-management, libertarian municipalism, and self-determination but from the perspective of colonized peoples throughout the world and seeking to add what it sees as a unique and important perspective. * Post-anarchism – political philosophy that employs post- structuralist and postmodernist approaches (the term post-structuralist anarchism is used as well, so as not to suggest having moved beyond anarchism). Post-anarchism is not a single coherent theory, but rather refers to the combined works of any number of post-modernists and post-structuralists such as Michel Foucault, Gilles Deleuze, Jacques Lacan, Jacques Derrida, Jean Baudrillard; postmodern feminists such as Judith Butler; and alongside those of classical anarchist and libertarian philosophers such as Zhuang Zhou, Emma Goldman, Max Stirner, and Friedrich Nietzsche. Thus, the terminology can vary widely in both approach and outcome. * Post-left anarchy – a recent current in anarchist thought that promotes a critique of anarchism's relationship to traditional leftism. Influenced by the work of Max Stirner and by the Situationist International, post-left anarchy is marked by a focus on social insurrection and a diminution of leftist social organisation. * Queer anarchism – a tendency that advocates anarchism and social revolution as a means of queer liberation and abolition of homophobia, lesbophobia, transmisogyny, biphobia, transphobia, heteronormativity, heterosexism, patriarchy and the gender binary.

Affinity groups  Anarchists creates different forms of organizations, structured around the principles of anarchism, to meet each other, share information, organize struggles and trace ways to spread the anarchist ideas through the world, since they understand that the only way to achieve a free and egalitarian society in the end is through equally free and egalitarian means. * Platformist federation – a form of anarchist organization that seeks unity upon its participants, having as a defining characteristic the idea that each platformist organization should include only members that are which are fully aligned with the group ideas, rejecting people with any level of conflicting ideas, or different tendencies or schools of anarchist thought. * Synthesis federation – a form of anarchist organization that seeks diversity upon its participants, which tries to join anarchists of different tendencies under the principles of anarchism without adjectives.\\"J.3.2 What are \\"synthesis\\" federations?\\" in An Anarchist FAQ. In the 1920s it brought together anarchists of three main tendencies, individualist anarchism, anarcho-communism and anarcho-syndicalism \\"The remedy has been found: libertarian communism.\\"Sébastien Faure. \\"Libertarian Communism\\" and it is the main principle behind the anarchist federations grouped around the contemporary global International of Anarchist Federations. * Anarcho-syndicalist union – a form of anarchist organization focused on the labour movement that views revolutionary industrial unionism or syndicalism as a method for workers in capitalist society to gain control of an economy and with that control influence in broader society, with the basic principles being: solidarity, direct action and direct democracy, or workers' self-management. The end goal of syndicalism is to abolish the wage system, regarding it as wage slavery.Jeremy Jennings, Syndicalism in France (St Martin's Press, 1990)  History of anarchism  The execution of the Haymarket martyrs following the Haymarket affair of 1886 inspired a new generation of anarchists Although social movements and philosophies with anarchic qualities predate anarchism, anarchism as a specific political philosophy began in 1840 with the publication of What Is Property? by Pierre-Joseph Proudhon. In the following decades it spread from Western Europe to various regions, countries, and continents, impacting local social movements. The success of the 1917 October Revolution in Russia initiated a decline in prominence for anarchism in the mid-20th century, roughly coinciding with the time period referred to by historians as The short twentieth century. Since the late 1980s, anarchism has begun a gradual return to the world stage. = Global events = ; Historic precedents and background events (pre-1840) * 1793William Godwin publishes Enquiry Concerning Political Justice, implicitly establishing the philosophical foundations of anarchism.Peter Kropotkin, \\"Anarchism\\", Encyclopædia Britannica 1910 * 1827Josiah Warren opens the Cincinnati Time Store, an early experiment in mutualist economics. ; Classical development and global expansion (1840–1917) * 1840Pierre-Joseph Proudhon publishes What Is Property? and becomes history's first self-proclaimed anarchist. * 1864the International Workingmen's Association (IWA) is founded.

Wang Gui's great-grandfather Wang Meng (王猛, not to be confused with the great Former Qin chancellor of the same name) served as a provincial governor during Chen and carried the title of Duke of Yingyang. His grandfather Wang Kuang (王纊) served as a prefectural prefect during Tang Dynasty.

In Staying Single When, KMF pioneered the use of \\"real voices\\". The normal Khmer movie-making practice is to overdub all actors' lines with Phnom Penh's stable of six voice-over performers, regardless of suitability of age and emotional performance. Staying Single When has high-quality English subtitles. Plot At the launch party of Kep's luxury Beach House Hotel, handsome manager Sarun also celebrates a milestone. He's just earned a big pay rise for his achievements and can afford to get married. Question is, who to? Sarun's career has left no time for a personal life. The closest females have been the waitresses at the hotel (not his type) and his efficient assistant manager Somalie (the boss’ daughter) whose arranged marriage to family friend, Neang, looms large. So how's he going to find a wife? He needs help! Aunt Towen and Aunt Lye step in. They brought Sarun up after promising his mother on her deathbed they’d organise his life. At first they appear to have struck gold, when they introduce Sarun to a rich friend's alluring daughter Rythika. Sarun is instantly struck and Rythika seems to respond. But she turns out to be a disaster, the first of a string of girls whose loveliness matches their unsuitability. Sarun's accident-prone friend Otdom, maintenance man at the hotel, considers himself to be an expert in marriage - he has two lovely wives of his own. With the aunts’ efforts backfiring, Otdom takes it upon himself to find the perfect wife for his friend, employing increasingly desperate measures along the way. None succeed. When Sarun takes matters into his own hands, he is no more successful. Why is this simple task of finding a wife proving so difficult?. Somalie watches from the sidelines, trying to help her colleague find happiness at the same time hiding misgivings about her own wedding. Bit by bit she falls in love with Sarun, but knows her father expects her to marry, Neang. For his part, whilst growing attracted to Somalie, Sarun never allows himself to think about loving her. He's knows she's unavailable. Sarun meets Vanny who could not be more perfect for him. Somehow he just isn't interested. What on earth is wrong with him? When the truth dawns, that he truly loves Somalie, he realizes he has to get away from Kep before her wedding. If he doesn't start a new life, his heart will simply break. Are Sarun and Somalie destined to live apart forever? Or can their love find a way to triumph ...?

The movie was first scheduled for production in August 2006. But due to appalling weather in Kep - a small Cambodian seaside town in which half the story is set - shooting was abandoned after two days. The production was rescheduled for October and November 2006 and continued to completion without further obstacles.

Daniel was portrayed by Michael Graziadei and Lily is portrayed by Christel Khalil. Davetta Sherwood took over the part in 2006, until Khalil reclaimed the role again in September of that year. The plots they were featured in included a \\"going on the run\\" story, teenage marriage, and Internet pornography. They were written as a star-crossed couple with Romeo and Juliet undertones. The couple is referred to by the portmanteau \\"Daily\\" (for Daniel and Lily) on Internet message boards. They were considered a dynamic duo by the soap opera media.  Development  = Early stages = Daniel Romalotti and Lily Winters were written as star-crossed young loves in a Romeo and Juliet style storyline. Both her parents, Neil Winters and Drucilla Winters, and his mother, Phyllis Summers, tried to keep them apart. This was partly due to Drucilla and Phyllis's animosity towards each other. They were put up against further obstacles with Daniel being wrongly accused of driving under the influence and killing Cassie Newman. His imminent arrest sent Daniel and Lily on the run. They traveled from the Young and the Restless setting, Genoa City, Wisconsin, to Los Angeles, California. For the story, the show went on a location shoot to the beaches of Malibu. The actors on the shoot were Daniel and Lily's portrayers, Michael Graziadei and Christel Khalil, respectively, as well as Kristoff St. John (Neil), Michelle Stafford (Phyllis), and Joshua Morrow (Nick, Cassie's father). Graziadei felt that going on location added to the scenes in the story. \\"[I]t's just so much more involved,\\" he said. \\"You're actually out there.\\" Originally, the Daniel character was introduced as a bad boy. His relationship with Lily was used as a way to show a different side of the character. In that way, the Lily character was said to have \\"tamed\\" him. The romance was put on hold when Khalil chose to exit the role of Lily in late 2005. In the storyline, Lily's parents sent her to boarding school in an effort to keep her and Daniel apart. After the actress's departure, the series continued Lily and Daniel's interactions through a letter and communication over the internet. The website, SoapCity displayed the letter and the emails. The character's email addresses reflected the continued Romeo and Juliet theme by featuring the names of those Shakespearean characters as Lily became Ibejuliet and Daniel took on the name Iberomeo. Two months after Khalil's departure, the Young and the Restless attempted to convince the actress to come back to the role. Those attempts failed. The show's then head writer and executive producer John F. Smith planned to recast the role and promised to \\"bring an entirely new level\\" to Daniel and Lily's story. Davetta Sherwood was hired as the Lily recast. = Advancements = Sherwood expressed unconcern in taking the place of an actress who took part in creating the popular Daniel and Lily romance. \\"It's okay, because she [Khalil] wanted to leave,\\" she said, \\"she was ready to move on, which is always a good thing. I haven't gotten any Lily versus Lily, or Christel verses Davetta mail.\\" Daniel and Lily's popularity continued with Sherwood in the role. The way Sherwood portrayed the character was with more feistiness, though the character was never written as timid. Sherwood's take on the part brought on comparison's to the character's mother, Drucilla. That new \\"fire\\" was brought into the Daniel and Lily relationship. \\"Dru can be a little dramatic,\\" Sherwood said. \\"And I think sometimes when Lily is facing issue with Daniel, she's not going to remain calm. She's going to do what she saw her mother do.\\" The actress praised the couple's story for not focusing on the differing races of the characters. In September 2006, Sherwood was replaced in the role by Khalil. Former Young and the Restless executive producer and head writer Lynn Marie Latham said, \\"Davetta did a fine job, but shows generally prefer to have original players back when they can get them.\\" Upon her return Khalil was surprised by the advancement of Daniel and Lily's story and with the Lily character as a whole, particularly the new development of the characters being married. = Conclusion = An obstacle written into the couple's story was Daniel's addiction to Internet pornography. \\"My initial conflict was that Daniel has had so many problems with his wife that I couldn't figure out why he'd be doing this,\\" Graziadei said. The actor worried that his character might be seen as \\"lecherous and creepy\\". Viewers instead sympathized with the character. This addiction and the lies surrounding it ended the Daniel and Lily romance. Lily next moved on to a controversial pairing with Cane Ashby, disappointing Daniel and Lily fans. \\"I think with Daniel it was kind of a first love thing,\\" Khalil said. \\"Daniel will always be in her heart, but with Cane, it's a more mature love.\\" She asserted that Lily and Cane were true loves.  Storyline  In 2004, Daniel and Lily become friends while hanging out at the Crimson Lights coffee shop. Daniel becomes involved in a scheme to drug Lily along with Kevin Fisher (Greg Rikaart) and Alex (Nick Chastain). The following year, they get romantically involved. Their mothers, Drucilla Winters (Victoria Rowell) and Phyllis Summers (Michelle Stafford), do not approved due to their rivalry and attempt to keep them apart. While at a party, Daniel and Lily break up, causing him to drown his sorrows in alcohol. His under-aged crush Cassie Newman (Camryn Grimes) decides to drive a drunken Daniel home, as they both live on the same property. However, Cassie ends up crashing the car, injuring both of them. Daniel is arrested after Cassie dies when neither of them can remember the incident, and he is expected to have been driving. He goes on the run with Lily to Los Angeles, but they are soon caught. Daniel's trial ends well, when evidence that Daniel wasn't driving is presented. Lily, however, is arrested for aiding and abetting a fugitive. In a plea bargain with the courts, Lily's parents send her to a boarding school in New Hampshire. In 2006, Lily arrives home from boarding school but tricks her parents into believing she broke her relationship off with Daniel by sending him a Dear John letter. They soon secretly reconcile and sneak around with the help of Lily's best friend Colleen Carlton (Adrianne León). A Winters family revelation, which Lily and Drucilla hid for years, revealed that Malcolm Winters (Shemar Moore), not Neil Winters (Kristoff St. John) fathered Lily. During this time, Lily decided to announce her romance with Daniel, thinking her parents wouldn't mind after this news. However, both are still objective to Daniel and Lily, demanding she go back to boarding school. This causes Daniel and Lily to run away to Las Vegas to get married. As they are under legal age to marry, they forge Dru and Neil's signatures. They are soon tracked down and brought home. While their families are devastated that they are married, they soon learn to accept that this is what the couple truly want. Daniel's former stepfather Jack Abbott gives him and Lily a new place to stay at the old Abbott play house. Daniel begins working at Newman Enterprises as a mailman while Lily becomes a salesperson at Lauren Baldwin's Jabot Cosmetics boutique. All is well until Alex returns, seeking money from Daniel and Kevin, or he will tell Lily about their scheme to drug and rape her two years ago. Daniel reveals the truth to Lily, and she moves out of their home. Although Lily is advised to get an annulment, she grows closer to Daniel and they eventually get back together. Troubles continue to follow the Winters, including the murder of a woman who nearly had an affair with Neil, Carmen Mesta (Marisa Ramirez), which allowed everyone in the family including Daniel and Lily to become a suspect. In 2007, Daniel and Lily witness Dru and her best friend (also Cassie's mother) Sharon Abbott (Sharon Case) fall off a cliff after a fight with Phyllis, who is still their enemy. Sharon is found, although Dru's body is never retrieved and she is presumed dead. Lily blames Phyllis for her mother's death, causing more of a rift between the couple. Daniel becomes addicted to pornography made by Amber Moore (Adrienne Frantz) and soon begins to neglect Lily. Lily finds out and they begin couples counseling. Later, Daniel becomes involved in more schemes including burying a dead body with Amber and Kevin along with going to a strip bar while under age. After Lily finds out all of this, she decides to end her marriage to Daniel. In the following years, they both move onto other relationships. Daniel marries Amber and Lily marries the much older Cane Ashby (Daniel Goddard). However, they remain best friends. In 2010, when Lily is diagnosed with cancer, Daniel becomes her confidant.Disgusting Cookies! - The Young and the Restless Daily Updates - Soaps.com The following year, Cane is \\"killed\\" by a henchman working for his father. Lily leans on Daniel for emotional support. When Cane returns, it was revealed he never died, and it was his twin who was killed. Lily is extremely angry at Cane for keeping him being alive from her, as well as all of the drama going on in his family, and reconnects further with Daniel.

Compare Old Book of Tang, vol. 93 and New Book of Tang, vols. 61 and 4 with New Book of Tang, vol. 108.), courtesy name Zongren (宗仁), formally Viscount Zhen of Qiao (譙貞子), was an official and general of the Chinese dynasty Tang Dynasty and Wu Zetian's Zhou Dynasty, twice serving as chancellor during Wu Zetian's reign.  Background  Lou Shide was born in 630, during the reign of Emperor Taizong. He was from Zheng Prefecture (鄭州, roughly modern Zhengzhou, Henan). When he was young, he passed the imperial examination and was made the sheriff of Jiangdu County (江都, in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu) – a formally low post that was, however, regarded as important as Jiangdu was one of the largest cities of the empire. While serving there, his superior Lu Chengye () the secretary general of Yang Prefecture (揚州, roughly modern Yangzhou), was greatly impressed by him, and stated, \\"You are material to be an emperor's assistant. I should entrust my descendants to you, and how can I treat you as a subordinate?\\"  During Emperor Gaozong's reign  During the reign of Emperor Taizong's son Emperor Gaozong, when Tang was having recurrent wars with Tufan. Emperor Gaozong sought volunteers to serve in the army against Tufan, and Lou Shide volunteered. Emperor Gaozong was pleased, and gave him the honorific title of Chaosan Daifu () and allowed him to serve in the army, and it was said that he had much achievement in the army. In 678, when the chancellor Li Jingxuan suffered a major defeat against the Tufan general Gar Trinring Tsendro (\\"Lun Qinling\\" () in Chinese) and Li's deputy, the general Liu Shenli () was captured by Tufan, Emperor Gaozong sent Lou to reorganize Li's disorganized troops, and further then as an emissary to Tufan. Lou met with Trinring's brother Gar Tsenba (\\"Lun Zanpo\\" () in Chinese) and was able to enter into a peace agreement with Lun Zanpo. In addition to his censor post, he was also made the military advisor to the commander at Heyuan Base (河源軍, in modern Xining, Qinghai) and put in charge of the agricultural affairs of the base. By 682, however, Tufan was said to be again attacking Heyuan, and Lou prevailed over Tufan forces eight straight times. Emperor Gaozong gave Lou the position of a deputy minister but made him the deputy commander at Heyuan, stating to him in the edict, \\"You have both civil and military talents. Do not decline these posts.\\"  During Wu Zetian's reign  By 693, Emperor Gaozong's powerful wife Wu Zetian had become \\"emperor\\" of a new Zhou Dynasty, interrupting Tang. (Emperor Gaozong had died in 683, and his sons Emperor Zhongzong and Emperor Ruizong had successively served as emperor, but Wu Zetian deposed them both and in 690 claimed the title of emperor.) In 693, Lou Shide was referred to as the minister of defense (夏官尚書, Xiaguan Shangshu), when she gave him the designation Tong Fengge Luantai Pingzhangshi (), making him a chancellor de facto. It was said that he was tolerant, honest, and careful. Once, when he was set to go with fellow chancellor Li Zhaode to meet Wu Zetian, he was walking slowly because he was obese, and Li had to repeatedly stop to wait for him. Li, in displeasure, yelled at him, \\"You country bumpkin!\\" Lou smiled and responded, \\"If I am not a country bumpkin, who can be a country bumpkin?\\" Around that time, his younger brother was made the prefect of Dai Prefecture (代州, in modern Xinzhou, Shanxi). Before his brother departed, Lou asked him, \\"I am now a chancellor, and you are a prefect. These are high honors and will draw jealousy. How can you avoid disaster?\\" HIs brother responded, \\"From now, even if someone spat at my face, I will just wipe it off. Hopefully I will not cause you worries.\\" Lou instead responded: (This response, however, drew heavy criticism from the modern Chinese historian Bo Yang, who opined that Lou's comment showed a lack of self-respect and willingness to stand for what was right, for the purpose of protecting his position.Bo Yang Edition of the Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 49.) In 694, while still a chancellor, Lou was made the commander of several bases, including Heyuan, but was later recalled to be the minister of justice (秋官尚書, Qiuguan Shangshu) and was created the Baron of Yuanwu. In 696, he was commissioned to be the deputy commander of an army to attack Tufan, assisting Wang Xiaojie. 15 days later, he was made the imperial censor reviewing central government affairs (左肅政大夫, Zuo Suzheng Daifu), and he continued to serve as chancellor with the Tong Fengge Luantai PIngzhangshi designation. Two months later, he and Wang were defeated by a Tufan army commanded by Trinring and Lun Zanpo at Mount Suluohan (素羅汗山, in modern Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Gansu). As a result, Wang was demoted to commoner rank, while Lou was demoted to be the military advisor to the prefect of Yuan Prefecture (原州, roughly modern Guyuan, Ningxia). It was said that when the paperwork of the demotion was given to Lou to sign, he was initially surprised and stated, \\"Do not have a single office left?\\" But he then immediately stated, \\"This is fine, this is fine.\\" In 697, while still serving at Yuan Prefecture, Lou was recalled to be acting Fengge Shilang (), the deputy head of the legislative bureau of government (鳳閣, Fengge), and was again made chancellor with the designation Tong Fengge Luantai Pingzhangshi. Later that year, in the middle of an attack by Khitan's khan Sun Wanrong, Wu Zetian commissioned Lou, assisted by the general Shazha Zhongyi (), to command some 200,000 men to defend against the Khitan attack. Sun's army, however, collapsed when the Eastern Tujue khan Ashina Mochuo attacked his home base and captured it. In the aftermath, Wu Zetian sent Wu Yizong () the Prince of Henan (the grandson of her uncle Wu Shiyi (), Lou, and Di Renjie to try to comfort the people of the region. Soon after this, at Lou's recommendation, Di was made chancellor as well and became a well-trusted advisor to Wu Zetian until Di's death in 700. However, Di was said to initially not know that Lou had recommended him and often suggested assignments out of the capital Luoyang for Lou. Wu Zetian intentionally asked Di, \\"Is Lou Shide capable?\\" Di responded, \\"When he served as a general, all he could do was to protect the border. I do not know if he is capable.\\" She then asked, \\"Is Lou a good judge of character?\\" Di responded, \\"I have served with him, and I do not know him as a good judge of character.\\" She then responded, \\"I trust you because he recommended you. I think he is a good judge of character.\\" Later, Di was said to have commented, \\"Lord Lou has great grace. I have been tolerated him for so long, and I did not know his grace.\\" Later in 697, Lou was made acting Nayan (), the head of the examination bureau (鸞臺, Luantai) and a post considered one for a chancellor. He was also created the Viscount of Qiao. In 698, while still serving as chancellor, Lou was made the commander of the forces in the Longyou () region (i.e., modern southern Gansu). He died in 699, while still serving in that role, at Hui Prefecture (會州, roughly modern Baiyin, Gansu).

The city belongs to the mesoregion of Belo Horizonte and to the microregion of Conceição do Mato Dentro. The estimated population in 2010 was 1777 inhabitants. History Santo Antônio do Rio Abaixo came about with its clusters of houses occupying a space between the rough edges of an auriferous river and the slopes of small hills. The expedition that founded Santo Antônio do Rio Abaixo consisted of families of Portuguese explorers Duarte and Alvarenga. The pioneers started mining gold in the lands of the Morro Grande Farm, building, on the right bank of a river, a chapel to St. Anthony and also their huts, thus forming a small village. Because it was built following the currents of water, it was named Santo Antônio do Rio Abaixo. Later, it increased to a town and became a district of Conceição do Mato Dentro, on January 4, 1875. Emancipated on March 1, 1963. =Foundation= In 1695, the pioneer Borba Gato discovers gold in Sabara. Then, Borba Gato explores the Santo Antônio river in the city of Ferros, where fixed residence (town Borba Gato). With it, other explorers came and were found in abundance, alluvial gold in the Santo Antônio river, secure residences in its right edge, giving rise to the camp of Santo Antônio do Rio Abaixo. In the year 1787, with a population fixed the River St. Anthony, estimated upwards of 400 people, José Ferreira Santiago, asked Queen Maria I of Portugal permission to raise a chapel which would serve him and his neighbours. His request was accepted on March 10, 1788. =Emancipation= The creation of the Santo Antônio do Rio Abaixo occurred on December 30, 1962. The installation also occurred on March 1, 1963. On June 30, there were the first elections for mayor, deputy mayor and the aldermen of the City Council, being sworn in on September 3, 1963. Geography Located in the Doce river (\\"Rio Doce) basin, Santo Antônio do Rio Abaixo is 190 km from Belo Horizonte, by the MG-010, BR-381 and BR-120. Situated between the hills and mountains, it is a typical small town in Minas Gerais, although since the 1980s it has lost much of its older architecture. The latest architectural losses were the mill at the entrance of the city and parish house, colonial-style house, which, beside the church, was certainly the oldest house in town. Currently, the oldest buildings are restricted to the mansions of the farms around the city. The highest point near the urban area is the Mount Cristal, with 897m of altitude. The Santo Antônio river is the main river of the city and its waters with rapids are the major attraction of the city. The wastewater produced by the city still is not treated and is discharged raw in Santo Antônio River. Within the limits of the municipality, there is the Peixe River, which cascades and waterfalls attract many tourists every year.

By Bolesław's testament, Władysław was granted Silesia as his hereditary province and also the Lesser Polish Seniorate Province at Kraków according to the principle of agnatic seniority.  Early history  The history of the Silesian Piasts began with the feudal fragmentation of Poland in 1138 following the death of the Polish duke Bolesław III Wrymouth. While the Silesian province and the Kraków seniorate were assigned to Władysław II the Exile, his three younger half–brothers Bolesław IV the Curly, Mieszko III the Old, and Henry of Sandomierz received Masovia, Greater Poland and Sandomierz, respectively, according to the Testament of Boleslaw III. Władysław soon entered into fierce conflicts with his brothers and the Polish nobility. When in 1146 he attempted to take control of the whole of Poland, he was excommunicated by Archbishop Jakub ze Żnina of Gniezno and his brothers finally drove him into exile. He was received by King Conrad III of Germany, his brother-in-law by Władysław's consort Agnes of Babenberg, at the imperial palace of Altenburg. Silesia and the Seniorate Province came under the control of second-born Bolesław IV the Curly, Duke of Masovia. In the same year King Conrad III attempted to regain power for Władysław, but failed. Not until 1157 Duke Bolesław IV the Curly was defeated in a campaign by Konrads successor Emperor Frederick Barbarossa, however, the \\"Silesian issue\\" was not mentioned in the treaty concluded by the rulers, and so Władysław remained in exile. He died in 1159 without returning to Poland. Fragmentation of Silesia 1172/73 In 1163, Bolesław the Curly was pressed by Frederick Barbarossa to return the hereditary Silesian province to Władysław's sons Bolesław the Tall, Konrad Spindleshanks and Mieszko Tanglefoot, though he retained the Seniorate Province and the Polish throne at Kraków. The Duchy of Silesia remained within the Polish seniorate constitution, but Władysław's sons were obliged to pay a yearly tribute to the Holy Roman Emperor.Weczerka, p. XXXIVPetry, p. 86 High Duke Bolesław the Curly also retained control of the most important Silesian cities such as Wrocław, Opole, Głogów, Racibórz and Legnica until 1166, when the Silesian dukes took control of these parts. Władysław's sons probably ruled Silesia together until 1172, when they divided their territory: Bolesław the Tall, eldest brother, received the large area from Legnica up the Oder River to Wroclaw and created the Duchy of Opole for his eldest son Jarosław. Mieszko Tanglefoot the smaller Duchy of Racibórz around Racibórz and Cieszyn. Their minor brother Konrad Spindleshanks received Żagań, Głogów and Krosno from the hands of Bolesław the Tall. As Konrad prepared himself for a clerical career at the Fulda monastery, his brother Bolesław administered his possessions until Konrad's early death, when he incorporated Konrad's part into his own duchy. Golden eagle of the Upper Silesian Piasts. Mieszko at the same time was able to expand his duchy with the former Lesser Polish territories of Bytom and Oświęcim, given to him by High Duke Casimir II the Just, and also with the Duchy of Opole, which he received after the death of Duke Jarosław and his father Bolesław in 1201. One year later, Bolesław's heir, Duke Henry I the Bearded, and his uncle Mieszko moreover specified to rule out the right of succession among their branches, an arrangement which was largely responsible for the special position of what would become Upper Silesia.Pagenstecher, p. 405 In the same year, Poland abolished the seniorate and the Silesian duchies became independent entities.  Struggle for the Polish Crown  Monarchy of the Silesian Henries. Henry I the Bearded actively took part in the inner-Polish conflicts and expanded his dominion with determination. Henry, before securing in 1229 the sovereignty in Kraków, had made no less persevering efforts to bring Greater Poland also under his dominion. From the beginning of the thirteenth century he had not ceased to intervene in the disputes which were carried on between the descendants of Mieszko the Old. At last in 1234, a good half of that province was formally ceded to him. As a guardian of minor dukes, Henry moreover ruled over Opole and Sandomierz. But, he aimed higher. This Silesian prince not only intended to enlarge his possessions; he proposed to make them the nucleus of a restored Kingdom of Poland. Google Books He became duke of Kraków (Polonia Minor) in 1232, which gave him the title of the Senior Duke of Poland (see Testament of Bolesław III Krzywousty). Henry expanded his realm also outside Poland ruling over Barnim, Teltow (owned temporarily) as well as parts of Lower Lusatia. Unfortunately, despite his efforts, he never gained the Polish crown. The royal crown, almost forgotten since the fall of Bolesław II, was destined by him for his eldest son, whom he associated in his rule towards the end of his life. This Henry II the Pious, who succeeded his father in 1238, was, in fact, entirely worthy of the heritage of the first Piasts. Pursuing the very able policy of Henry the Bearded, his son was moreover able to obtain the support of the clergy, with whom his father had had frequent disagreements. In a close alliance with his brother-in-law, Bohemian king Wenceslaus, he consolidated his position in Greater Poland against Barnim I of Pomerania and repelled an attack on castle Lubusz by the margrave of Brandenburg and the archbishop of Magdeburg.Appelt, p. 393 Following an old tradition of his dynasty, he placed himself under the protection of the Holy See, with which he also allied himself against Frederick II. In spite of all his German connections, Henry the Pious would, therefore, assuredly have maintained the independence and prestige of the kingdom if all his plan had not been annihilated by an unforeseen catastrophe. In 1241, he died as a Christian hero in the Battle of Legnica, in which he was attempting to arrest the Mongolian invasion. His death left the Silesian Piast dynasty deeply shaken.  Fragmentation and turn to Bohemia  Henry IV. at his court After Henry's death in 1241 his brother Bolesław II ruled on behalf of his underage brothers. Since all male members of the family were eligible to rule, a principle critical for the coming years, a hereditary division was put into practice in 1248/51.Weczerka, p. XLIIPetry, p. 112 Bolesław established the duchy of Legnica, Konrad I Glogow, Henry III kept Wroclaw together with Ladislaus, who would become archbishop of Salzburg. Soon the next generation divided the territory again. Jawor and Lwówek Śląski split off from Legnica, Duchy of Żagań and Ścinawa from Głogów. In the next generation Brzeg was detached from Wrocław, Świdnica and Duchy of Ziębice from Lwówek Śląski-Jawor and Oleśnica from Głogów. The Duchy of Opole, which was established by Mieszko I and called after its residence Opole, wasn't spared from the divisions, they only began one generation later. The four sons of Wladislaw I of Opole, a grandson of Mieszko, split the duchy into Opole, Koźle- Bytom, Racibórz and Teschen. These duchies were also split again in the next generation. Opole was divided into Opole, Niemodlin and Strzelce Opolskie, Koźle-Bytom in Koźle, Bytom and Toszek, Teschen in Teschen and Oświęcim. These divisions often were the result of fierce and militant conflicts, in which not only the Silesian parties but also their partisans from other parts of Poland and neighboring Bohemia were involved. Whereas the connections to Poland diminished the political ties with Bohemia became increasingly stronger. In their exile in Germany, the Piasts had witnessed the inner colonizations along the Elbe river and strived to develop sparsely populated Silesia by calling in Germans from the west, slowly increasing Silesia's German element which cam to dominated the region over the next centuries. The reign of duke Henry IV Probus was exemplary for the position of Silesias duchies in the area of tension between Poland and Bohemia. After the death of his father Henry III he was raised in Prague at the court of Bohemian king Ottokar II, who also became his guardian. After Ottokar's death he did not, as expected, became viceregent of Bohemia for underage Wenceslaus II but was compensated with Kłodzkoby Rudolf of Habsburg, who also ennobled Henry to a count of the Holy Roman Empire and granted him his duchy as a fief.Appelt, p. 394Petry, p. 122 Henry not only obtained the preeminence in Silesia but, with the help of the German party in Polonia Minor,Weczerka, p. XLIVPetry, p. 131 also the duchy of Kraków and became duke of Poland. He initially wanted Wenceslaus to become his successor, but changed his plan on the deathbed and granted Wrocław to Henry III and Kraków to Przemysł II, whereas Kłodzko returned to Bohemia.  Vassals of Bohemia and decline  The gatehouse to the Silesian Piasts castle in Brzeg (1554-1560) with sculptures of the Piast rulers from Siemowit to Frederick II of Legnica As Przemysł II united Poland, the weak and divided Silesian dukes needed a strong partner who could provide cover. They now separated from the Polish state and subjected to the Bohemian crown. After the death of Wenceslaus III, king of Bohemia and Poland, the right to the Polish crown was disputed, being claimed by various Piast dukes as well as the successors of Wenceslaus III on the Bohemian throne. In 1327, John of Bohemia invaded Poland in order to gain the Polish crown. After the intervention of King Charles I of Hungary he left Polonia Minor, but on his way back he enforced his supremacy over the Upper Silesian Piasts. In February 1327, five principalities were carved out of Polish Upper Silesia and placed under Bohemian suzerenity: Duchy of Niemodlin, Duchy of Cieszyn, Duchy of Racibórz, Duchy of Koźle and Bytom and the Duchy of Oświęcim and Zator. In April the dukes of Opole and Wrocław also became the tributaries of king John. In 1329, Władysław I the Elbow-high started a war with the Teutonic Order. The Order was supported by John of Bohemia who managed to enforce his supremacy over the dukes of Masovia and Lower Silesia. In April–May 1329, following Lower Silesian duchies became subjects of the Bohemian crown: Ścinawa, Oleśnica, Żagań, Legnica-Brzeg and Jawor. In 1331 the Duchy of Głogów separated from Poland as well.\\"The new Cambridge medieval history\\", p. 747 The last independent Silesian Piast – Bolko II of Świdnica – died in 1368. His wife Agnes ruled the Świdnica duchy until her death in 1392. From that time on, all remaining Silesian Piasts were vassals of the Bohemian crown, although they maintained their sovereign rights. The last legitimate Silesian Piast – George William, Duke of Liegnitz In 1335, John of Bohemia renounced his claim to the title of king of Poland in favour of Casimir the Great, who in return renounced his claims to Silesia.Encyclopædia Britannica: Silesia This was formalized in the treaties of Trenčín and Visegrád, ratified in 1339. The division into small and smallest territories led to a decline of prestige and power. Many Silesian Piasts now merely had the status of squires with greater rights. Some Piasts entered foreign services as mercenary leaders, like John II of Glogau and Sagan. Henry IX traveled through Europe as a goliard. The descent of the dynasty was also illustrated by the marriages of the dukes. The Silesian Piasts of the 13th and 14th century married into princely families especially from German families, but also other European royal lines, whereas later Piasts also married non-princely and even bourgeois women. With the adoption of the Protestant faith in Silesia, the Piasts again gained importance. Against the Catholic Habsburg dynasty, which ruled Silesia since 1526, the dukes sought political support by entering matrimonies with Protestant, imperial rulers like the Hohenzollern dynasty.Pagenstecher, p. 404 Their last attempts of independent policies were the candidatures of Frederick II of Liegnitz for the Bohemian crown (1526) and of Henry XI (1573), Frederick IV (1576) and Christian (1668) for the Polish crown. During the 15th, 16th and 17th centuries, various branches of the Silesian Piasts became extinct. In 1532, the last Duke of Opole, John II the Good, died, leaving most of Upper Silesia under direct Bohemian rule. In 1675, the last legitimate Silesian Piast – George William, Duke of Liegnitz – died. The last male Silesian Piast was baron Ferdinand II Hohenstein, who died in 1706, the last female Piast, Charlotte, died in 1707. Silesian Piasts and Poland The Silesian Piasts formed the oldest branch of the first Polish royal dynasty. This was the reason that even after the fragmentation of Poland their interest in the Polish matters was still strong. Norman Davies stated that the dynastic loyalty of all Piast dukes as well as a single ecclesiastic organisation still secured the unity of the divided Kingdom of Poland. In his opinion the alleged \\"will\\" to separate from Poland is contradicted by the continuous involvement of the Silesian Piasts in Polish affairs. He remarks that the dukes of Silesia did not break their connections with their relatives in the rest of Poland. The most visible evidence of this is said to be the fact that in the 13th century three Silesian Dukes – Henry I, Henry II and Henry IV – took control of Kraków and therefore of the senior throne of the whole of Poland. In Davies' opinion, the Germanisation of Silesia did not necessarily mean a desire to move apart from Poland. He suggests that it was more likely a way to satisfy the Silesian Piasts' ambitions inside Poland. The planned introduction of German settlers would strengthen Silesia, and also the Silesian Piast claims to the senioral throne in Kraków. Only when the Silesian Piasts' ambitions to rule in Kraków were thwarted did they decide to set their province on a different course.

Like the Wemale, they originated in a common group called Patasiwa.Jensen, Adolf E. and Herman Niggemeyer, Hainuwele ; Völkserzählungen von der Molukken-Insel Ceram (Ergebnisse der Frobenius-Expedition vol. I), Frankfurt-am-Main 1939, Pg. 59–64 The Alune speak a language of Malayo-Polynesian origin. It is also known as Sapalewa or Patasiwa Alfoeren and, despite the small number of speakers, it has a few dialects. The most prestigious dialect is the Rambatu speech variety. Ethnologue - Alune language The Hainuwele legend is an origin myth from the Alune and Wemale folklore.The Oxford Companion to World Mythology - Hainuwele It was recorded by German ethnologist Adolf Ellegard Jensen in a 1937-8 expedition to the Maluku Islands.Adolf Ellegard Jensen: Hainuwele. Volkserzählungen von der Molukken-Insel Ceram. Vittorio Klostermann, Frankfurt am Main 1939 Description Like other ancient human groups living in interior Seram, the Alune traditionally lived off forest products. Their diet was based on the sago palm and they also practiced shifting cultivation.Sachse, F. J. P., \\"Het Eiland Seram en zijne Bewoners\\". Leiden, 1907 Both men and women wore little clothing because of the humid environment. In daily life the Alune adults had a short loincloth from the waist down made of bark-fibre, similar to the Polynesian tapa cloth. This loincloth reached above the knees and it often had decorative patterns. Women wore also necklaces. On special occasions, Alune men wore elaborate warrior clothes and carried long swords. The Alune males used to engage in warrior activities against neighboring groups. Women used to spend most of their day collecting products from the forest children often accompanied them. As with the Wemale, the coming of age celebration for Alune girls was an important occasion. Like the Wemale, the Alune were also skilled carpenters. The ancestral Alune houses were large and elaborate and built of wood, sticks and palm leaves. The Alune culture and lifestyle has changed very much during the last few decades because of the impact of consumerism. Also the political and religious restlessness and the resulting conflict in Indonesia affected many islands of the Maluku area.

Born in Leuven on 18 October 1805, Prévinaire started his career as a civil servant, but after a few years he established a cotton mill in Huizingen in 1839. Together with its first governor, François-Philippe de Haussy, he was one of the pioneers in establishing the NBB. Walthère Frère-Orban appointed him as secretary-director of the newly established bank in 1850, of which he became vice-governor in 1864 and governor in 1870. During his first year as governor of the NBB, the Franco-Prussian War of 1870 broke out. In order to control the financial consequences of the war, Eugène Prévinaire took several measures such as doubling the discount rate and transferring the Belgian gold reserves to the fortified city of Antwerp. After the war followed several years of economic prosperity, and the term of Eugène Prévinaire as governor of the NBB was extended by thirty years in 1872. On 20 June 1873 the law on cheques was published and banknotes became legal tender. He died in Brussels on 2 June 1877.

History The suburb of Karama is named after an Aboriginal tribe. Karama is an established residential area in Darwin's northern suburbs built in the period from the late 1970s to the early 1980s. The suburb is predominantly made up of residents of low socioeconomic status, with many homes being government housing. The suburb was once controlled by a notorious criminal gang known as the Karama Ghetto Boyz more commonly known as the \\"KGB\\". In 1992 the KGB was established by two groups of youths from Karama Primary School and what was once known as Sanderson Primary School coming together to form the most ruthless gang the Northern Territory had ever seen. Whilst under KGB control the crime rate had risen from 3% to 92% between the years of 1993 and 2009. Once voted as the number one most dangerous suburb to live in, elders and district leaders of the KGB came together to put a stop to the crime and violence with profound success which has now seen Karama's economic status grow and turn into a real-estate buyers hot-spot in Darwin. Today the KGB is known more commonly as a brotherhood rather than a gang and protect the streets of Karama from outside crime coming into the area which has built a profound sense of safety amongst its residents. In 1964, Douglas Lockwood recommended that a number of tribal names be used for the suburbs of Darwin. The suburbs Karama was listed. Present day Some major features of the area include the Karama Primary School, Manunda Terrace Primary School, Holy Family Primary School, O’Loughlin Secondary College and Karama Shopping Plaza. Karama Library is also located within the Karama Shopping Plaza, and is a service of Darwin City Council Libraries. Brazil Crescent in Karama was named after Robert Brazil, a crewman (fireman) on the ill-fated SS Gothenburg, which sank off the north Queensland coast on 24 February 1875, with the loss of approximately 102 lives. Brazil was one of only 22 survivors and was awarded a medal for bravery and heroism for his efforts to save drowning passengers.NT Government (2008). NT Place Names Register: Brazil Crescent.

RAPPORTEUR: PHILIPPINE MILITARY IMPLICATED IN EXTRA-JUDICIAL MURDERS AND POLITICAL KILLINGS (archived from the original on 2007-11-11) These are forms of extrajudicial punishment, and include extrajudicial executions, summary executions, arbitrary arrest and detentions, and failed prosecutions due to political activities of leading political, trade union members, dissident and/or social figures, left-wing political parties, non-governmental organizations, political journalists, outspoken clergy, anti-mining activists, agricultural reform activists, members of organizations that are allied or legal fronts of the communist movement like \\"Bayan group\\" or claimed supporters of the NPA and its political wing, the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP). Extrajudicial killings are most commonly referred to as \\"salvaging\\" in Philippine English. The word is believed to be a direct Anglicization of Tagalog salbahe (\\"cruel\\", \\"barbaric\\"), from Spanish salvaje (\\"wild\\", \\"savage\\"). Extrajudicial killings (EJKs) is also synonymous with the term \\"extralegal killings\\" (ELKs). Extrajudicial/ extralegal killings (EJKs/ ELKs) and enforced disappearances (EDs) are unique in the Philippines in as much as it is publicly and commonly known to be committed also by non-state armed groups (NAGs) such as the New Peoples Army (NPA) and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF). Although cases have been well documented with conservative estimates of EJKs/ ELKs and EDs committed by the NPAs numbering to about 900–1,000 victims based on the discovery of numerous mass grave sites all over country, legal mechanisms for accountability of non-state actors have been weak if not wholly non-existent. Nature Philippine extrajudicial killings are politically motivated murders committed by government officers, punished by local and international law or convention. They include assassinations; deaths due to strafing or indiscriminate firing; massacre; summary execution is done if the victim becomes passive before the moment of death (i.e., abduction leading to death); assassination means forthwith or instant killing while massacre is akin to genocide or mass extermination; thus, killings occurred in many regions or places throughout the Philippines in different times - 136 killings in Southern Tagalog region were recorded by human rights group Karapatan from 2001 to May 19, 2006.A Primer on Killings of Activists, bY BAYAN (archived from the original on 2006-10-29) = Desaparecidos = A forced disappearance (desaparecidos), on the other hand, as form of extrajudicial punishment is perpetrated by government officers, when any of its public officers abducts an individual, to vanish from public view, resulting to murder or plain sequestration. The victim is first kidnapped, then illegally detained in concentration camps, often tortured, and finally executed and the corpse hidden. In Spanish and Portuguese, \\"disappeared people\\" are called desaparecidos, a term which specifically refers to the mostly South American victims of state terrorism during the 1970s and the 1980s, in particular concerning Operation Condor. In the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance, \\"Enforced disappearance\\" is defined in Article 2 of the United Nations Convention Against Torture as \\"the arrest, detention, abduction or any other form of deprivation of liberty by agents of the State or by persons or groups of persons acting with the authorization, support or acquiescence of the State, followed by a refusal to acknowledge the deprivation of liberty or by concealment of the fate or whereabouts of the disappeared person, which place such a person outside the protection of the law.\\" Even if Philippine Republic Act No. 7438 provides for the rights of persons arrested, detained, it does not punish acts of enforced disappearances. Thus, on August 27, Bayan Muna (People First), Gabriela Women's Party (GWP), and Anakpawis (Toiling Masses) filed House Bill 2263\\"An act defining and penalizing the crime of enforced or involuntary disappearance.\\" Sen. Jinggoy Estrada also filed last June 30, 2007, Senate Bill No. 7\\"An Act Penalizing the Commission of Acts of Torture and Involuntary Disappearance of Persons Arrested, Detained or Under Custodial Investigation, and Granting Jurisdiction to the Commission on Human Rights to Conduct Preliminary Investigation for Violation of the Custodial Rights of the Accused, Amending for this Purpose Sections 2, 3 and 4 of RA 7438, and for Other Purposes.\\" Background =Marcos regime= In 1995, 10,000 Filipinos won a U.S. class-suit against the Ferdinand Marcos estate. The charges were filed by victims or their surviving relatives for torture, execution and disappearances. Human rights groups placed the number of victims of extrajudicial killings under martial law at 1500 and over 800 abductions; Karapatan (a local human rights group's) records show 759 involuntarily disappeared (their bodies never found). Military historian Alfred McCoy in his book \\"Closer than Brothers: Manhood at the Philippine Military Academy\\" and in his speech \\"Dark Legacy\\" cites 3,257 extrajudicial killings, 35,000 torture victims, and 70,000 incarcerated during the Marcos years.

They were also part of an NPA operation called \\"Agaw Armas\\" (Filipino for \\"Stealing Weapons\\"), where they raided government armories as well as stealing weapons from slain military and police personnel. A low level civil war with south Muslims, Al-Qaeda sympathizers and communist insurgents has led to a general break down of law and order. The Philippines government has promised to curb the killings, but is itself implicated in many of the killings. philippinerevolution.net, website, CCP (archived from the original on 2006-01-07) philippinerevolution.net, website NPA (archived from the original on 2007-01-05) Since 1975, the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) was deeply concerned in politics. Because of the armed conflict, the military continued its campaign versus the New People's Army of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP). Since 1969 it aimed to establish a Marxist regime with armed rebellion against the government. On top of all these chaos, left-wing non-governmental organizations (NGOs) were/are critical of the Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo administration. The members who associated with the CPP and NPA had been targeted as victims in the spate of political killings. Human Rights Watch investigated extrajudicial murders in the Philippines in September 2007. www.pcij.org, Karapatan’s 2007 human rights report Three major investigation groups were commissioned and their final reports had been submitted and published: the Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo government-appointed bodies: a) Task Force Usig created by her on August; as a special police body, it was assigned to solve 10 cases of killings; it claimed having solved 21 cases, by initiating court cases, but only 12 suspects were arrested; b) the Melo Commission (chaired by Supreme Court Associate Justice Jose Melo) with members National Bureau of Investigation Director Nestor Mantaring, Chief State Prosecutor Jovencito Zuño, Bishop Juan de dios Pueblos, and Nelia Torres Gonzales; its final report states: \\"There is no official or sanctioned policy on the part of the military or its civilian superiors to resort to what other countries euphemistically call \\"alternative procedures\\"meaning illegal executions. However, there is certainly evidence pointing the finger of suspicion at some elements and personalities in the armed forces, in particular General Jovito Palparan, as responsible for an undetermined number of killings, by allowing, tolerating, and even encouraging the killings.\\" (Melo Commission report, p. 53), and c) Philip Alston, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Extrajudicial Executions (February 12 to 21, 2007) Remedies =Malacañang's peace summit and Puno's killings summit= * Because of the magnitude of Philippine killings and desaparecidos, 22nd Chief Justice Reynato Puno of the Supreme Court of the Philippines called a National Consultative Summit on extrajudicial killings on July 16 and 17, 2007 at the Manila Hotel. Invited representatives from the branches of the government participated (including the Armed Forces of the Philippines, the PNP, Commission on Human Rights (Philippines), media, academe, civil society and other stakeholders). On the other hand, the Malacañang-sponsored \\"Mindanao Peace and Security Summit\\" (July 8–10, 2007 at Cagayan de Oro City) concentrated on the anti-terror law, or the Human Security Act (HSA) of 2007, to make it more acceptable to the public. At the July 16 summit, Reynato Puno stated that the Commission on Human Rights reported the number of victims at 403 from 2001 to May 31, 2007, while Karapatan reported 863 deaths until 2007, and more than 900 as of May, 2008, and most of them were members of left wing groups. Karapatan further officially placed the number of victims of human rights violations: forced evacuations or displacement at 7,442, by indiscriminate firing with 5,459 victims, and food and economic blockade with 3,042. The rights group Desparecidos officially reported as of May 15, 2008, 194 victims of enforced disappearances under the Arroyo administration, with the latest abduction of National Democratic Front political consultant for Cagayan Valley, activist Randy Felix Malayao, 39, a volunteer worker. * Counsels for the Defense of Liberties (CODAL), Philippines, a lawyers’ organization stated that since 2001, 26 lawyers and 10 judges were killed due to their professions; 755 civilians had been killed extrajudicially, while 359 survived attacks, but 184 persons were still missing.manilatimes.net, SPECIAL REPORT Extrajudicial killings, Even lawyers, court officials weren’t spared (archived from the original on 2007-07-18) * Bishop Deogracias Iñiguez stated that on the CBCP/Catholic Church's count, the number of victims of extrajudicial killings is 778, while survivors of \\"political assassinations\\" reached 370; 203 \\"massacre\\" were victims, 186, missing or involuntarily disappeared, 502, tortured, or illegally arrested.

The international groups conducted interviews of various legal sectors from June 15 to June 20, 2006. From November 4–12, 2008, the Dutch Lawyers for Lawyers Foundation will conduct a follow-up verification and fact finding mission (IVFFM) in Manila and Mindanao, with the National Host Committee, National Union of Peoples' Lawyers (NUPL) and the Counsels for the Defense of Liberties (CODAL).

The legislative bodies, House of Representatives and Senate, should also initiate its own actions promptly and without delay. They must enact laws which ensure protection of rights—laws against torture and enforced disappearance and laws to afford adequate legal remedies to victims.\\" AHRC objected since the writ failed to protect non-witnesses, even if they too face threats or risk to their lives. = \\"Desaparecidos\\" law = The Anti-Enforced or Involuntary Disappearance Act of 2012 was signed into law by President Benigno Aquino III on December 21, 2012. The law's principal author in Congress was Rep. Edcel Lagman. The law is the first law in Asia that makes the crime of enforced disappearance punishable by life imprisonment. It was hailed as a milestone law by Human Rights Watch, which called the law \\"a testament to the thousands of 'disappearance' victims since the Marcos dictatorship, whose long-suffering families are still searching for justice.\\" The law treats enforced disappearances as a violation of human rights and a crime separate from kidnapping, serious illegal detention, and murder. Under the law, those guilty of enforced disappearances before the law was passed can still be prosecuted if they continue refusing to disclose the whereabouts of the victim, according to Rep. Neri Colmenares. International reports - the root cause of killings =Alston UN report= * Philip Alston submitted his final report on the killings; he found that the Armed Forces of the Philippines killed left-wing activists to get rid of communist insurgents: \\"the executions had \\"eliminated civil society leaders, including human rights defenders, trade unionists and land reform advocates, intimidated a vast number of civil society actors, and narrowed the country’s political discourse.\\" Alston denied for lack of merit the government's claim that killings were perpetrated by communists to exterminate spies and to make negative propaganda versus government. Alston, in February 2007 stated that the military made alibis or denials on its role about 800 deaths of activists and journalists since 2001. Alston blamed \\"impunity\\" which caused the executions of journalists and leftist activists: \\"the priorities of the criminal justice system had been \\"distorted,\\" and had \\"increasingly focused on prosecuting civil society leaders rather than their killers.\\" But Alston noted the government's creation ofspecial courts to try extrajudicial killings, the Melo Commission and the Philippine National Police's Task Force Usig.newsinfo.inquirer.net, Alston report: AFP behind killings, Report rejects RP claim of Red purge (archived from the original on 2008-01-25)Philip Alston, UN Special Rapporteur on Extrajudicial, Summary or Arbitrary Executions (archived from the original on 2008-05-07) In the November U.N.

Mr. Alston's March report stated that \\"the question of resources or technical expertise will partly resolve the killings but the strong risk is that these measures will treat only some of the symptoms of the crisis, and will fail to address meaningfully two of the most important underlying causes of a great many of the killings.\\" (A/HRC/4/20/Add.3, March 22, 2007) Alston named two root causes of the killings: (1) 'vilification', 'labeling’, or 'guilt by association'\\"characterization of most groups on the left of the political spectrum as ‘front organizations’ for armed groups whose aim is to destroy democracy\\" making the groups \\"considered to be legitimate targets; and (2) the Government’s counter-insurgency strategy's extent of facilitating killings of activists and others. G. Eugene Martin specifically expanded the 2 causes of the violence and killings: a) weak political and social institutions, corrupt and ineffective judicial system, resulting to failure to obtain justice from corrupt Philippine courts; and b) the legacy of the Ferdinand Marcos regime; Martial law caused the corrupt system where soldiers, police, judges and prosecutors became principals of offenses like extralegal arrest, detention, incarceration, disappearances and killings (salvaging), all permitted or allowed. He traced the spate of violence and killings to political instability of President Arroyo government; while she created the Independent Commission to Address Media and Activist Killings, Melo Commission, she had no capability to end the killings, due to her political lameness because of the 2004 election controversy.www.senate.gov, Extrajudicial Killings In The Philippines: Strategies To End The Violence (archived from the original on 2008-08-01) =FIDH report= * Three experts from the International Federation for Human Rights (abbreviated FIDH), Mr. Nabeel Rajab (Bahrain), Mr. Mouloud Boumghar (France) and Mr. Frédéric Ceuppens (Belgium), came to the Philippines on August 13 to 23, 2007. Their FIDH mission report stated that torture and ill-treatment was widespread versus suspected \\"terrorists\\". The Filipino government is a signatory to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), and the UN Convention against Torture (CAT). The FIDH dismissed the Philippines government's claim doubts that mechanisms were placed to stop the killings, as it questioned the efficiency ofthe corrupt judiciary, the government “Witness Protection Programme” ; also, judges and lawyers were victims themselves of killings. It also found the Philippine anti-terrorism law ( “Human Security Act”) to result in more torture and extrajudicial killings as a fight against terrorism. =2008 US Department of State report= On March 11, 2008, the US Department of State reported that \\"arbitrary, unlawful arrests and extrajudicial and political killings continued to be a major problem in the Philippines in 2007.Country Reports on Human Rights Practices - 2007, Released by the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor March 11, 2008. Washington stated that \\"many of these killings went unsolved and unpunished despite intensified efforts of the government to investigate and prosecute these cases.\\" =Judicial corruption= On January 25, 2005, and on December 10, 2006, Philippines Social Weather Stations released the results of its two surveys on corruption in the judiciary; it published that: a) like 1995, 1/4 of lawyers said many/very many judges are corrupt. But (49%) stated that a judges received bribes, just 8% of lawyers admitted they reported the bribery, because they could not prove it. [Tables 8-9]; judges, however, said, just 7% call many/very many judges as corrupt[Tables 10-11];b) \\"Judges see some corruption; proportions who said - many/very many corrupt judges or justices: 17% in reference to RTC judges, 14% to MTC judges, 12% to Court of Appeals justices, 4% i to Shari'a Court judges, 4% to Sandiganbayan justices and 2% in reference to Supreme Court justices [Table 15]. =Maguindanao massacre= Symbolic 'Impuni-tree' planted for 3rd anniversary of Maguindanao massacre (University of the Philippines College of Mass Communication, UP Diliman).

Official records from the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency give the number of deaths from July 2016 to November 2018 from the anti-drug campaign as 5,050. Human rights groups have put the number of killings at 20,000, including vigilante-style killings. Events In February, 2007, The U.S. ambassador to the Philippines has broken her silence and called on Manila to end extrajudicial killings. On Feb. 27, Kristie Kenney U.S. ambassador to the Philippines alerted Mrs. Arroyo as she voiced her call to end these killings: \\"Let's beef up the human rights in the Armed Forces of the Philippines and make every effort to investigate, prosecute those responsible, [and] exonerate the innocent.\\" In August, 2007, the International Day of the Disappeared, Asian Human Rights Commission (AHRC) ranked the Philippines among the top eight countries in Asia where forced disappearances of activists are not just rampant but are done with impunity. Sri Lanka heads the list (statement posted on its website (www.ahrchk.net)). The activists took part in the recent Human Rights School Session of the AHRC for 2007.

Early life Lui was raised by his grandparents on Niue after his parents and older siblings migrated to Wellington, New Zealand. His parents sent for him when he was nine years old and he attended Newtown School. Soon afterwards, he transferred to Naenae School in Lower Hutt when his parents took the tenancy of a State house there. Lui left Naenae school in 1950 to attend Wellington High School (then Wellington Technical College). On leaving school, he joined the New Zealand merchant navy, and was immediately caught up in the prolonged and acrimonious waterfront workers strike of 1951. He returned to Niue in 1956 to care for his grandparents and has lived there since. There, he was subjected to colonial discrimination which motivated him to political activity to change an oppressive, paternalistic system run by the New Zealand Government (e.g., \\"natives\\" of Niue were not permitted to buy liquor, and were paid wages lower than ex-patriate New Zealanders). He organised the first ever strike on Niue. Political career Lui was elected at the 1963 Niuean general election at the age of only 28, becoming the youngest ever person elected to the Niue Assembly. He lost his seat at the 1966 election, but was re-elected in 1969. He was re-elected again in 1972 and appointed Minister of Works and Police in the Cabinet of Robert Rex. He was re-elected unopposed in the 1975 election and was appointed Minister of Electricity, Fisheries, Forests, Tourism, and Works. He served in a variety of other Cabinet positions over the next fifteen years. In September 1990 he was sacked from Cabinet after an attempt to oust Rex. Premier Following the death of Robert Rex in December 1992 Young Vivian was elected Premier. At the following 1993 election Lui was re-elected to the Assembly, and on 12 March was elected Premier, defeating Vivian 11 votes to 9. In March 1994 Finance Minister Sani Lakatani resigned from Cabinet, but was reinstated by Lui in the leadup to a confidence vote. Lakatani subsequently resigned from Cabinet on 8 November after losing the finance portfolio in a cabinet reshuffle. He joined the opposition, which organised itself into the Niue People's Party and effectively deadlocked the assembly. A series of tied confidence votes followed, and the government was effectively unable to pass legislation through the Assembly for the rest of its term. An attempt to break the deadlock by declaring the seats of opposition MPs vacant was ultimately declared illegal by the Niue Court of Appeal. The 1996 election saw Lui win re-election in his seat, and he was narrowly re-elected as Premier, defeating Robert Rex, Jr by 11 votes to 9. Lui's second-term was more stable, and the government was able to pass anti- corruption laws and a ban on drift-net fishing in its Exclusive Economic Zone. It also partnered with Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca to set up an \\"international business centre\\" providing shell companies to international clients, and established a free internet service with the Niue Internet Users Society. Lui lost his seat in the 1999 election, and announced his retirement. He was replaced as premier by Sani Lakatani. After politics Following his retirement Lui ran a video rental business. In 2010 he became chair of the IUSN Foundation, a charitable foundation which provides Niueans with free internet access. Recognition Lui was appointed a Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit in the 1999 Queen's Birthday Honours.

She was the first vessel ever launched from a New South Wales dockyard and carried goods between the colony's coastal settlements of Norfolk Island, Newcastle, New South Wales, Van Diemen's Land and Port Jackson. In 1804 she took part in a series of voyages to Van Diemen's Land with the aim of founding a colony at Port Dalrymple, the site of the modern settlement of George Town, Tasmania. In 1805 Integrity encountered and recaptured a Spanish brig which had been unlawfully seized by privateers and concealed in the Kent Group of islands in Bass Strait. Having returned the Spanish vessel to colonial control, Integrity was designated the task of sailing to Chile to negotiate its return to Spain. She set sail for Valparaíso, Chile, in June 1805, but was not seen again and is likely to have foundered during the voyage. Construction Port Jackson, where Integrity was constructed and launched from a dockyard (unmarked) on the shore of the cove. Integrity was laid down in September 1802 at the newly opened King's Dockyard in the colony of New South Wales. Governor Philip Gidley King ordered that construction proceed as swiftly as possible, in order to test the Dockyard's capacity. A team of two shipwrights, two apprentice shipwrights and two sawyers were assigned the task and delivered the finished cutter in thirteen months. During construction shipwright Thomas Moore tested that the hull was watertight by filling it with water from the inside, and repairing any visible leaks. Her hold also incorporated a partition that her crew could move to or away from the forecastle bulkhead to vary her cargo capacity. Governor King's direction had been for a vessel measuring around 46 tons burthen,Bladen (ed.) 1979, vol. 4, p. 901. but the final vessel was significantly larger at 59 tons. King was impressed with the work despite this variation from the original plans; in a letter to Lord Hobart, Secretary of State for War and the Colonies, he praised the speed and quality of Integritys construction and described her as \\"extremely well put together and strong\\".Governor King to Lord Hobart, 1 March 1804. Cited in Bladen (ed.) 1979, vol. 5, pp. 328–338. The newly built vessel was launched on 13 January 1804 as \\"His Majesty's Armed Colonial Cutter Integrity\\" under the command of Royal Navy Lieutenant John Houstoun and with a crew of eight men.Bladen (ed.) 1979, vol. 5, p. 383. She was the first seagoing vessel to be launched in the colony of New South Wales, all previous craft having been small enough to be floated off the shore. Throughout her active service she remained under the direct control of the colonial government of New South Wales, and was never formally commissioned into the Royal Navy.Lyon 1993, pp. 284, 287. Active service =Early voyages= Colonial Governor Philip Gidley King, under whose authority Integritys voyages took place. Integritys first voyage was in February 1804, heading south along the eastern coastline of Australia to transport settlers and supplies across Bass Strait to the colonial outpost in Van Diemen's Land. The administrator of that outpost, Lieutenant John Bowen, had recently resigned his position and returned to Port Jackson. Governor King now directed that Bowen travel back to Van Diemen's Land aboard Integrity in order to formalise the transfer of colonial authority to his successor. However Bowen refused to go aboard, and the cutter ultimately sailed without him in order to deliver its supplies. The voyage was a success other than a broken rudder fastener which was repaired when Integrity reached Van Diemen's Land in early March. The cutter then completed the round trip back to Port Jackson, arriving safely at her home port on 24 April.Bladen (ed.) 1979, vol. 5, pp. 381–382. On 1 June Governor King issued directions for Integritys second voyage. With Lieutenant Houstoun again in command, the cutter was to transport Lieutenant-Colonel William Paterson to the north of Van Diemen's Land in order to found a new settlement at Port Dalrymple. To support the settlement, the cutter was also assigned to carry nineteen soldiers of the New South Wales Corps, a ship's surgeon and ten convicts. A further fifteen soldiers and eleven convicts would accompany the expedition aboard a privately owned vessel, Contest. Once Paterson had disembarked at Port Dalrymple, Integrity was to follow the coastline of Port Phillip Bay so that Houstoun could survey the shore and determine its suitability for future colonisation. The cutter would then proceed to Cape Barren Island, a remote location in Bass Strait, to investigate rumours that a group of American sailors were establishing an unlawful trade in seal skins.Correspondence, Governor King to Lieutenant-Colonel Paterson, 1 June 1804. Cited in Bladen (ed.) 1979, vol. 5, pp. 383–384. Integrity set sail on 8 June, heading south along the New South Wales coast. A week later she encountered heavy storms and winds while passing Cape Howe and was unable to proceed. Houstoun ordered a return to Port Jackson, which was regained on 19 June.Bladen (ed.) 1979, vol. 5, p. 418. While in port, one of Integritys crew, a sailor named William Dwyre, was removed from the ship and sent to prison for having refusing to carry out his duties while aboard. There was no sign of Contest and she was presumed lost at sea. The voyage was re-attempted on 3 July, but Integrity again ran into heavy weather off Cape Howe and was forced to turn towards the shore to seek shelter. The cutter entered what would later be known as Twofold Bay on the New South Wales South Coast, where to her crew's surprise they discovered Contest, undamaged but unable to return to sea in the storm.Bladen (ed.) 1979, vol. 5, p. 385. The passengers and crew of both vessels consulted on whether to continue southwards or turn back and await better weather. According to one source, missionary W.P. Crook aboard Integrity, there was unanimity for continuing the voyage except for Captain Houstoun, who wished to turn back.Correspondence, Missionary W.P. Crook to the London Missionary Society, 1804. Cited in Bladen 1979, vol. 5, pp. 537–538. As Houstoun was the nominal commander of the voyage his view prevailed and Integrity and Contest returned to Port Jackson together, arriving on 13 July. =Port Dalrymple flotilla= Integritys repeated failure to reach Port Dalrymple convinced Governor King that larger vessels would be required to make the voyage. The East India Company was approached to provide either Coromandel or Experiment, both then in New South Wales waters, but the request was declined.Bladen (ed.) 1979, vol. 5, pp. 420–421. In the interim Integrity was sent north with provisions for the colonial settlement at Norfolk Island, departing on 20 July 1804 and returning in early August.Bladen (ed.) 1979, vol. 5, p. 436. In September she sailed a round trip to the New South Wales colony of Newcastle to ship a cargo of cedar wood back to Port Jackson, followed by another brief voyage to Norfolk Island. On 1 October Governor King issued orders for a flotilla to attempt the voyage. The expedition would be led by the 12-gun Royal Navy storeship and the 6-gun survey vessel .Bladen (ed.) 1979, vol. 5, pp. 473–475. They would be accompanied by Integrity, and by the elderly colonial schooner Francis which had been in service since 1792 and was described by King as \\"much damaged\\" but still seaworthy. Lieutenant-Colonel Paterson and the principal colonists would travel aboard Buffalo but transfer to Integrity if the Navy vessel was too large to enter the bay where the settlement was proposed to stand. The flotilla departed Port Jackson on 15 October, proceeding southward down the New South Wales coastline towards Bass Strait. Cape Howe was passed without incident, though the schooner Francis struggled with the ocean swell and continually fell behind the larger vessels. The weather slowly worsened until on sunset of 18 October the flotilla encountered a heavy gale. Captain William Kent of Buffalo signaled for the flotilla to take in their sails and ride out the storm; on the following morning the crew of Integrity discovered that they had lost sight of all three other vessels and were running dangerously close to a lee shore. Houstoun elected to continue southward close to land, preferring the risk of running aground to that of braving the gale in deeper water.Bladen (ed.) 1979, vol. 5, pp. 488–492. There was a glimpse of Buffalo far to the east on the morning of 21 October, \\"laboring much and lurching very deep\\" among the waves.Captain Kent to Governor King, 28 November 1804. Cited in Bladen 1979, vol. 5, p. 489. Other than this sighting Integrity continued her voyage alone through the storm, crossing Bass Strait into clearer weather on around 23 October. The cutter was brought into an uninhabited bay on the northeast coast of Van Diemen's Land where she underwent basic repairs. After ten days she was returned to sea and reached Port Dalrymple on the morning of 5 November. Buffalo had already arrived, but there was no sign of Lady Nelson or Francis. Houstoun's achievement in navigating the storm was recognised through a transfer to Buffalo, a larger and more prestigious vessel than Integrity. His former colonial command was allocated to midshipman Charles Robbins, who was promoted Acting Lieutenant by virtue of his new role. The remaining vessels in the flotilla, Lady Nelson and Francis, arrived in Port Dalrymple on 21 November. Integrity departed a week later, Robbins having been ordered to explore the far western coastline of Van Diemen's Land. =Capture of Saint Francisco & Saint Paulo= In April 1805 Integrity encountered the brig Saint Francisco & Saint Paulo off the Kent Group of islands in Bass Strait. The brig and another ship, Extremeña, had been seized from the Chilean ports of Caldera and Coquimbo in September 1804 by Captain William Campbell of the privateer Harrington. The Spanish ships had then been sailed to Port Jackson while Governor King considered whether to return them to Chile.Rusden 1883, pp. 410–411. Unwilling to await King's decision, Captain Campbell had ordered his crew to put to sea in Saint Francisco & Saint Paulo and conceal the vessel in an uninhabited location. Departing south from Port Jackson in early March, the brig ran into rough weather in Bass Strait and began to sink. When approached by Integrity, the Spanish ship was shipping of water over the lowest deck inside the hull. Integritys crew assisted in keeping the brig afloat and she was safely conveyed to Port Dalrymple, arriving on 17 May 1805. Fate In June 1805 Governor King received legal advice from the British Government indicating that colonial retention of the Spanish vessels Extremeña and St Francisco & St Paulo could give rise to a charge of piracy.Bladen (ed.) 1979, vol. 6, pp. 112–113. In these circumstances, King directed that Integrity should sail to Chile to offer the safe return of the Spanish ships. The cutter departed for Valparaíso, Chile on 20 June 1805. For the voyage she was again under the command of Acting Lieutenant Robbins, with a crew of ten men and bearing a flag of truce \\"in case war should have taken place between England and Spain\\" before she reached her destination.Bateson 1972, p. 40. She was not seen again. Historian Frank Bladen has conjectured that the cutter either foundered en route, or reached South America but was captured by an indigenous tribe.Bladen (ed.) 1979, vol. 6, p. 201.

Inheriting the simplicity of Chord, Koorde meets O(log n) hops per node (where n is the number of nodes in the DHT), and O(log n/ log log n) hops per lookup request with O(log n) neighbors per node. The Chord concept is based on a wide range of identifiers (e.g. 2^160) in a structure of a ring where an identifier can stand for both node and data. Node-successor is responsible for the whole range of IDs between itself and its predecessor. De Bruijn's graphs A de Bruijn's 3-dimensional graph Koorde is based on Chord but also on De Bruijn graph (De Bruijn sequence). In a d-dimensional de Bruijn graph, there are 2d nodes, each of which has a unique d-bit ID. The node with ID i is connected to nodes 2i modulo 2d and 2i+1 modulo 2d. Thanks to this property, the routing algorithm can route to any destination in d hops by successively \\"shifting in\\" the bits of the destination ID but only if the dimensions of the distance between modulo 1d and 3d are equal. Routing a message from node m to node k is accomplished by taking the number m and shifting in the bits of k one at a time until the number has been replaced by k. Each shift corresponds to a routing hop to the next intermediate address; the hop is valid because each node's neighbors are the two possible outcomes of shifting a 0 or 1 onto its own address. Because of the structure of de Bruijn graphs, when the last bit of k has been shifted, the query will be at node k. Node k responds whether key k exists. Routing example Example of the way Koorde routes from Node2 to Node6 using a 3-dimensional, binary graph. For example, when a message needs to be routed from node “2” (which is “010”) to “6” (which is “110”), the steps are following: Step 1) Node #2 routes the message to Node #5 (using its connection to 2i+1 mod8), shifts the bits left and puts “1” as the youngest bit (right side). Step 2) Node #5 routes the message to Node #3 (using its connection to 2i+1 mod8), shifts the bits left and puts “1” as the youngest bit (right side). Step 3) Node #3 routes the message to Node #6 (using its connection to 2i mod8), shifts the bits left and puts “0” as the youngest bit (right side). Non-constant degree Koorde Koorde lookup algorithm. The d-dimensional de Bruijn can be generalized to base k, in which case node i is connected to nodes k * i + j modulo kd, 0 ≤ j < k. The diameter is reduced to Θ(logk n). Koorde node i maintains pointers to k consecutive nodes beginning at the predecessor of k * i modulo kd. Each de Bruijn routing step can be emulated with an expected constant number of messages, so routing uses O(logk n) expected hops- For k = Θ(log n), we get Θ(log n) degree and Θ(log n/ log log n) diameter.

After he picks up, an unknown man warns Nerio that he found someone else to have business with, and Nerio abruptly ends the call. Nerio gets up from his bed and goes to the lower deck, eating an apple. After he throws it into the water, he hears a weird sound from the water. Lowering down to see the source, a diver snatches him and pulls him down and suffocates him. The next day, the W Group board of directors meets up with Ann Ferguson, Nerio's right-hand man, to discuss the situation. They recently found out that Nerio had a secret son, named Largo, who was adopted from a Yugoslavian orphanage in April 1981, over 28 years ago, and was kept as a secret from everyone, was raised by Josip and Hana, a French-Croatian family to whom Nerio was close, along with Josip and Hana's own son, Goran, until Nerio picked him up and raised him to take over his company one day. Other members are skeptical of Largo's existence, but they want to bring him in to see if he truly is his heir. Meanwhile, Largo Winch is in Brazil, where he rescues a young woman named Léa, who works for a non- governmental organization and was harassed by local militia. After they escape, they make love. However, while Largo is asleep, Léa injects him with a sedative and walks away, and Largo, while sedated, is captured by the militia and sent to prison. However, he is rescued by Freddy, Nerio's former bodyguard, one of the few who knew of his existence, and they depart to Hong Kong for Nerio's funeral. Largo gets drunk because of Nerio's funeral getting secret or revealed to the public, and wakes up the next day on a yacht with Nerio's former butler telling him Freddy dropped him off and get dressed soon. Largo then arrives to the W Group's headquarters, where he presents himself to the board of directors and correctly states facts about each of them, proving that he is really Nerio's son, and also correctly explains the business ethics of the W Group and handling the stocks to prove he knows everything about the W Group. After that, one of the senior employers, Meyer, goes to meet him, but he is shot and killed by an unknown assassin. Largo chases him with the head of security, Stephan Marcus, but is unable to find him. He then goes to lunch with the W Group's competitor, Michail Korsky, and is shocked to find Léa with him. He follows her to a spa, where she flees from him, but he finds out that her real name is Naomi and that she works for him. Soon after, Korsky announces he is going to buy the W Group. Ferguson wishes to secretly buy Korsky's corporation so he would be unable to do it, but it is only possible if the offer is made from a private individual, and Largo is the only one who is able to do so. Since the other members are unwilling to lend Largo the money to perform this, still skeptical about his actions, Largo decides he is going to bring them secret stocks that Nerio kept and trusted Largo with so he could prove to them who he is and to perform the deal. Largo travels back to his childhood home in Dalmatia, where he meets with Hana, who is now a widow, since Josip died years earlier. Largo also meets with Goran, who is now a soldier in the Croatian Army. They have a meal together before Goran leaves the family home. The next day, Hana wakes up and finds Largo gone, only finding a note from him. Soon enough, she is attacked by an armed group, led by Marcus, who have tracked Largo through a GPS in his credit card. After finding out from the note that Largo has departed for Sarajevo, Marcus kills her. However, Largo has traveled to a secret island, containing a monastery, where Nerio has a secret safe in which he holds his stocks. After unlocking the safe, he is cornered by Marcus. After taking his shares, Marcus tries to kill him, but Largo escapes and jumps into the sea, although he is shot and badly injured. He wakes up next day in the home of his childhood friend, Melina, since her cousin found Largo unconscious. Soon after, Largo contacts Freddy, telling him that he is still alive and that he will contact him soon. However, Freddy meets with Ferguson, who reveals that she organized Nerio's death in order to lure Largo. She also manipulated Korsky into announcing the buy-in of the W Group, and in turn, Largo would bring up the shares and Ferguson would secretly buy a controlling stake in Korsky's group, making her a very powerful person. She also admits that Naomi is working for her, and that she found Largo and falsely set up charges for drug dealing against him, and the senior employee who was killed in front of Largo planned to reveal her plans to Korsky. Freddy requests the plan for hostile takeover of Korsky's group so he could become a part to get rich in exchange for tracking down Largo. Ferguson agrees and sends Marcus for him, but he is tied up by him when Freddy contacts Largo again and tries to silently warn him about what is going on. Meanwhile, Melina drives Largo to a small airport, where Korsky arrives in his private jet. Largo explains to Korsky about Ferguson's plans and Naomi's treachery, and that he has to go to Hong Kong before a large ceremony is planned, where Ferguson intends to announce the new heir to the W Group, apparently her secret weapon. Korsky agrees and withholds his original plan to buy the W Group. In Hong Kong, Korsky drives to the meet where he is cornered by Marcus, but cannot find Largo. Instead, Largo meets with Naomi, who reveals she is a mercenary for hire, and she contacts Marcus when Largo refuses to pay her up, and Largo agrees to pay her, and she leaves him the car. However, Marcus catches up with Largo, intending to stop him from arriving to the meet. After a high-speed chase, Largo manages to enter the W Group headquarters, where he disguises himself. He arrives at the penthouse, where he, much to his shock, finds Goran. Goran recalls the events when he and Largo broke into the orphanage to find Largo's records. Largo was found and captured, but Goran managed to hide. He was about to leave, but kept searching the records about Largo, but found his own records, revealing that he is not Hana and Josip's son but that he was also adopted by Nerio along with Largo, and as such, he is also an heir to Nerio's company. Ferguson contacted him and he agreed to represent the company while Ferguson would really have the power, in exchange for money. However, when Largo informs him that Ferguson, using Marcus, killed Hana, he changes his mind and agrees to help him. However, Marcus arrives, and Goran pretends to help Marcus to kill Largo, while secretly telling him in Serbian that he is at Largo's side. They fight Marcus together, but Marcus manages to shoot Goran. A fight ensues between Largo and Marcus, who almost throws Largo off the building, until Largo uses the last of his strength to stab Marcus in the neck with a knife, killing him. Goran begs for Largo's forgiveness, and Largo forgives him as Goran dies from his injuries. After rescuing Freddy, the two arrive at the meet, where Freddy plays a recording of his meeting with Ferguson while Largo arrives with his shares, which he took while visiting Goran. Defeated, Ferguson walks out of the stage and bitterly congratulates Largo for his victory. Largo announces to the gathered that he is Nerio's son, and plans to take over the W Group to a thunderous applause. Some time later, Largo is back at his childhood village, when a young boy corners him with a stick and asks him to surrender, to which Largo jokingly agrees. Largo asks the boy for his name, and the boy introduces himself as Danis, and that he is trespassing on his territory. Largo apologizes and walks away, but the boy asks him for his name, and Largo introduces himself. Danis wishes him good luck. Largo smiles, and walks away.

It produces approximately 100,000 bottles of wine a year, half of which are exported. History Domaine du Castel was founded in 1983 by Eli Ben Zaken in Moshav Ramat Raziel on the outskirts of Jerusalem. From its modest start, producing two barrels a year, Domaine du Castel has become a 13-hectare vineyard producing 8,000 cases a year - 40% Cabernet Sauvignon, 29% Merlot, 25% Chardonnay and 6% Petit Verdot. Vines are dense planted and cropped at low yields. Since the release of 600 bottles in 1992, Ben Zaken and his son, Ariel, oversee the production of 100,000 bottles a year. Haaretz food and wine critic Daniel Rogov writes that Domaine du Castel produces some of the best wines in the country. The winery uses only locally grown grapes from its own vineyards or from those under its full supervision. Awards In December 2007, the influential wine critic Robert M. Parker, Jr. and his The Wine Advocate awarded three of Domaine du Castel's wines 90-92 points on his 100-point scale. A total of 14 Israeli wines were rated at least 90 points on this occasion (ranging from 90 to 93), which represented the highest Parker scores ever awarded to wines of the eastern Mediterranean region and was seen as a sign of breakthrough for Israeli wine. A 2005 white wine from Domaine du Castel was the highest-scoring of all white wines.

Eugène Guillaume Anspach (7 February 1833 – 21 December 1890) was a Belgian lawyer, civil servant, and former governor of the National Bank of Belgium (NBB) from 1888 until 1890. Born in Brussels, he was a convinced protestant. Career He was appointed as censor of the NBB in 1864 and as a member of the discount committee of the bank in 1868. In 1870 he was made a director and in 1882 he became vice- governor. He was appointed governor of the bank in 1888. As governor of the National Bank of Belgium he took an interest in the efficient organisation of the discount offices and the branches of the NBB. The gradual disintegration of the Latin Monetary Union made him, together with Eudore Pirmez and Walthère Frère-Orban, try to restore monetary order. Anspach died in Brussels on 21 December 1890.

After an infestation of the introduced giant African land snails (Achatina spp.), the carnivorous Florida rosy wolfsnail (Euglandina rosea) was introduced into Tahiti in an attempt to combat the African species. The wolfsnail chose instead to hunt and eat members of the nearly 76 species of Partula that were endemic to Tahiti and the nearby islands, devouring all but 12 species in a decade.

Retrieved 2011-03-11. Huang is originally from Zhejiang province, and previously served as party chief of Ningbo, and the party chief of Taizhou. In 2016, he was investigated by the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and subsequently expelled from the Communist Party of China for breaking party regulations. He was sentenced to 12 years in prison upon being convicted on charges of bribery.  Early career  Born in October 1954 in Xiangshan County, Zhejiang Province, he joined the Communist Party of China in 1973. Between 1983 and 1987, Huang served as the party chief in Xiangshan County. He went to Taizhou in July 1987, taking the office of deputy party chief and prefecture commissioner. During his time in office, he advocated for Taizhou to become a \\"prefecture- level city\\" and Huang earned the title of \\"Mayor\\". Taizhou's economy developed rapidly during Huang's term. It became one of the most affluent cities in the Yangtze River Delta. He was appointed to be the secretary-general of the Zhejiang provincial government. In January 1998, he was named vice governor of Zhejiang Province, then became the party chief of the city of Ningbo. During this time he also entered the ranks of the provincial party leadership, with a seat on the provincial Party Standing Committee, working directly under then- Zhejiang Party Secretary Zhang Dejiang and then, in 2002, under Xi Jinping, who later became party General Secretary. In November 2003 Huang was transferred to work in the coastal city of Tianjin as vice mayor.  Tianjin  In November 2003, Huang became the executive vice mayor of Tianjin, overseeing the economy and statistics collection. During his term as vice mayor, he was known for his cooperation with other city departments. In December 2007, he was named acting mayor of Tianjin, and confirmed a few months later by the municipal People's Congress, replacing Dai Xianglong. In 2009, Huang oversaw the transformation of the districts of the Binhai region into the Binhai New Area. In December 2014, Huang, after serving as mayor for some seven years, became the acting party chief of Tianjin, replacing Sun Chunlan, who was transferred to work as head of the United Front Work Department in Beijing. However, Huang was not confirmed as official party chief for unknown reasons. Under Huang, on April 21, 2015, Tianjin's first free trade experimental zone opened. Huang attended its inauguration. The trial of Zhou Yongkang, the highest-ranked official to go on trial since the Cultural Revolution, also took place in Tianjin between April and May, 2015, under Huang's watch. The 2015 Tianjin explosions took place during Huang's tenure. Several days after the explosion, Huang was named head of the response committee. He told journalists that he \\"takes inescapable responsibility\\" for the incident as he was the main official in charge of Tianjin. He was among the finalists for the 2010 World Mayor prize.  Investigation  On September 10, 2016, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection announced that Huang was undergoing investigation for \\"serious violations of regulations\\". The announcement was shocking to political observers, as Huang had maintained a positive reputation throughout his career and was not widely known to be subject to any kind of controversy. In addition, Huang had been named by some observers as a political ally of Xi Jinping. Huang himself apparently did not anticipate his sudden downfall; on state television footage, Huang said that when CCDI officers came to Tianjin for a \\"second look\\" (huitoukan) at the city's progress in combating corruption, he thought it was a routine exercise. In fact, Huang's troubles seem to have begun long prior - during the 2014 inspection of the city's party organization by central inspection teams, and the \\"second look\\" confirmed the seriousness of Huang's \\"political and economic problems\\". The inspection authorities alleged that Huang had not taken the correct political stance on major issues, superficially adhering to the policies of the party's central authorities but in fact carrying out a different direction. On certain issues, he was said to have substantially altered major policies decided upon by the party's central authorities. In addition, he was said to have perpetuated a culture of cronyism, trusting and showing favoritism to those from his home province. The removal of Huang from the posts of mayor and acting party chief meant that, remarkably, both party and government leadership positions in Tianjin, considered a highly political important municipality, fell vacant - the first time this has happened in a direct-controlled municipality since the end of the Cultural Revolution. Immediately after the announcement, Tianjin deputy party chief Wang Dongfeng convened the local party organization to declare fealty to the decision and make other obligatory political pronouncements to stabilize the situation. Huang was the first sitting mayor of a direct-controlled municipality to be investigated by the CCDI since the 18th Party Congress, and the longest \\"acting\\" Party Secretary since Chinese economic reform in 1978, having held the position for 21 months without assuming the post in an official capacity. Wang Dongfeng would eventually take over as mayor, while Li Hongzhong would assume the Tianjin party secretaryship in an official capacity in September. Trial and sentencing At the conclusion of the internal investigation, the party assigned Huang with a litany of offenses, accusing him of \\"violating political discipline and political rules, trivializing the directives of the central government, undermining party unity, paid lip service to party policy but did not actually adhere,\\" obstructed the investigation into his own wrongdoing, improperly assisted associates in the promotion evaluation process, let his son take advantage of his position to seek economic gain, did not carry out proper \\"supervision of his staff\\". The party said that Huang's \\"egregious behavior led to very bad influence\\" to those around him and \\"poisoned the Tianjin political environment\\". Huang was summarily expelled from the Communist Party on January 4, 2017 and sent to judicial authorities for processing. On September 25, 2017, Huang was convicted on charges of bribery by the People's Intermediate Court in Shijiazhuang, and sentenced to 12 years in prison. He was additionally fined three million yuan. Court documents showed that he had taken bribes amounting to some 40.03 million yuan, which began during his term as party chief of Taizhou. The court noted Huang's cooperative attitude during the judicial process.

Early life Woodbury was born in Los Angeles, California on December 17, 1915. Her father was Elmer Franklin Woodbury, and her mother was born Joan Meta Hadenfeldt, whose father Charles Hadenfeldt had emigrated to the US from Germany. Elmer owned various hotels, including the La Casa Grande and Maryland hotels in Pasadena, and the Hotel Richelieu in downtown Los Angeles. Her mother had been six times 'Rose Queen' at Pasadena's Tournament of Roses, and had been in vaudeville. When she was five years old, she and her mother appeared in Oliver Morosco's The Half Breed. When she was four years old, Joan had an 18-year-old live-in governess, Marie Sandow. In 1922, when she was six, she was selected for the leading role in a series of children's fairy story films; an article about this in the San Francisco Chronicle commented, \\"Joan Woodbury has been known for some time as America's 100 Per Cent Child, and has been photographed, sketched and painted by many artists.\\" She first studied for seven years in a convent, later trained in dance, and eventually graduated from Hollywood High School. Woodbury began dancing for the Agua Caliente dance company, and at 19 decided to attempt a career in acting. She moved to Hollywood and that same year received her first acting role in the 1934 film Eight Girls in a Boat, which was uncredited. Another uncredited role followed, with her first credited role being in the 1934 film One Exciting Adventure, which starred Binnie Barnes. Her first major role, billed as Nana Martinez, was in a Hopalong Cassidy movie The Eagle's Brood. Woodbury appeared in 15 films from 1934 through 1935, of which 10 were uncredited. Career rise Joan Woodbury performing 'Toreador' dance, from 'There Goes My Girl', ca. 1930, Sam Hood In 1936, her career began to become more successful, with appearances in eight films that year, of which five were uncredited. However, of the three roles that were credited, Woodbury made an impact, and caught the attention of studios. Her mixture of Danish, British, and Native American heritage gave her an exotic appearance, and allowed her to be cast in many different ethnicities, from Hispanic to French and Asian. By 1937, her career had taken off, mostly in B-movies such as Living on Love and Bulldog Courage, but also with her receiving many credited roles. In 1937, Woodbury starred in her first of several credited Charlie Chan films, titled Charlie Chan on Broadway. She also began appearing in numerous Westerns, portraying the heroine opposite some of the 1930s' biggest cowboy actors, to include William Boyd of Hopalong Cassidy fame, Roy Rogers, and Johnny Mack Brown. Woodbury appeared in 50 films from 1937 to 1945, almost all of which were credited. Her most memorable of that period was her lead role in the serial Brenda Starr, Reporter, in 1945. Personal life On December 17, 1938, Woodbury married actor and producer Henry Wilcoxon, with whom she had three daughters: Wendy Joan Robert (born 1939),On 21 June 1940, at St. Thomas Episcopal Church in Hollywood, Joan and Henry's daughter, first named Wendy Joan Wilcoxon, was christened Wendy Joan Robert Wilcoxon in memory of Henry's brother Robert Owen Wilcoxon who had been killed at the Dunkirk Evacuation three weeks earlier Heather Ann (born 1947, named after Heather Angel), and Cecilia Dawn \\"CiCi\\" (1950, named after Cecil B.

The New Captain George's Whizzbang #13 (1971), pp. 2-7 She married actor Ray Mitchell in 1971, and they remained together until her death. Founding of the Valley Players Guild and retirement From 1946, her career declined, more due to her desire to spend more time with her family than her not having acting offers. She founded the company Valley Players Guild in Palm Springs, California with her husband Ray Mitchell. The Valley Players Guild staged plays featuring veteran actors and actresses. In addition to managing their company, she continued to act on occasion, with her biggest role after 1946 being a credited part in the 1956 epic The Ten Commandments, starring Charlton Heston, Yul Brynner, and Anne Baxter. Her last film appearance was a supporting role in the movie The Time Travelers (1964). In 1963-1964, Woodbury was on the television program Adventure in Art on KCHU-TV, a UHF station in San Bernardino, California. The program consisted of \\"26 dramatized and illustrated series of exciting adventures in the world of art.\\" When Woodbury retired, she had appeared in 81 films, though a newspaper article published in 1963 reported that she had appeared in more than 300 films. Woodbury eventually settled in Desert Hot Springs, California, where she was residing at the time of her death at the age of 73.\\"Woodbury, Joan (1915–1989)\\", Dictionary of Women Worldwide: 25,000 Women Through the Ages.

It has a population of 1,312 (2008) and an area of 19,03 km2. It lies in the historical region of Cieszyn Silesia. The name is of topographic origin and literally means [a place] behind a mud (Polish: za błotem, whereas błoto means mud). History The village was first mentioned in 1486. It was later mentioned as Zablaty (1504), Zablatie (1515), Zablati (1621) and so on. Politically the village belonged then to the Duchy of Teschen, a fee of the Kingdom of Bohemia, which after 1526 became part of the Habsburg Monarchy. In years 1573/1577–1594 it belonged to Skoczów-Strumień state country that was split from the Duchy of Teschen but was later purchased back. Later it also belonged to Teschener Kammer. After Revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire a modern municipal division was introduced in the re- established Austrian Silesia. The village as a municipality was subscribed to the political district of Bielsko and the legal district of Strumień. According to the censuses conducted in 1880, 1890, 1900 and 1910 the population of the municipality grew from 763 in 1880 to 917 in 1910 with a majority being native Polish-speakers (98.5%-99%) accompanied by a small German-speaking minority (at most 11 or 1.5% in 1880) and Czech-speaking (at most 5 or 0.6% in 1890), in terms of religion in 1910 majority were Roman Catholics (98.5%), followed by 8 Jews and 6 Protestants. After World War I, fall of Austria-Hungary, Polish–Czechoslovak War and the division of Cieszyn Silesia in 1920, it became a part of Poland. It was then annexed by Nazi Germany at the beginning of World War II. After the war it was restored to Poland.

The hunting of these bird species for food led to their rapid extinction. In New Caledonia, the giant megapode might have survived into historic times. William Anderson, a naturalist and surgeon's mate aboard during James Cook's second South Sea voyage, described a bird from New Caledonia with bare legs, which he named Tetrao australis.

It achieved notoriety by killing its crew when its boiler exploded during unsuccessful trials in the early days of the Lickey Incline. Built by William Church, who is mainly remembered for his typesetting machine, although he also experimented with locomotives, it was an 0-2-2 well tank locomotive with horizontal outside cylinders at the rear. Dr Church had invented an expanding mandrel for fixing boiler tubes, and it was the first tank engine to have a multitube boiler. It used piston valves and eccentric motion. The Surprise (named Victoria at the time) began trial runs as a ballast locomotive on the London and Birmingham Railway in January 1838, then transferred to the Grand Junction Railway. Notwithstanding its having reportedly achieved a speed of , it was never particularly successful. On 10 November 1840, when the Birmingham and Gloucester Railway was looking for engines to work the Lickey Incline, the locomotive, now called Surprise, was brought in, and its boiler exploded at Bromsgrove Station. Both crewmen, Thomas Scaife and John Rutherford, were killed and several people were injured. Their monuments are in Bromsgrove churchyard, though the depiction of a locomotive on the tombstone is of one of the Norris Locomotives. A new boiler was later fitted and the locomotive was renamed Eclipse. In 1850, it was seen at Camp Hill railway station. By the late 1850s, it had been rebuilt as a six coupled engine on the Swansea Vale Railway.

It is Israel's third largest winery. In 2012, Golan Heights Winery was named New World Winery of the Year by Wine Enthusiast Magazine.Israel through the wine glass: The history lesson of the Gold Heights Winery, Haaretz History The Golan Heights Winery is jointly owned by eight Israeli settlements—moshavim and kibbutzim, which also supply the grapes. Its first vintage was released in 1984. Production in 2008 reached 6 million bottles a year, 30% of which was exported. The Golan Heights winery markets brands under the Golan, Yarden and Gamla labels and is the parent company of Galilee's Galil Mountain Winery. Golan sources its grapes from sixteen vineyards in the Golan Heights and one vineyard in the Upper Galilee. The chief winemaker is Napa native Victor Schoenfeld. Golan Heights WineryThe winery employs 110 people and incorporates sophisticated technology using pneumatic membrane presses, must chiller and computer-controlled cooling of stainless steel tanks. The winery also has an elaborate \\"experimental winery\\" for research and quality control of new wines and improvement of existing lines. Traditional vinification techniques include barrel-fermented Chardonnay, Methode traditionelle sparkling wines, carbonic maceration for light reds and maturation in French and American oak barrels for premium red and white wines. The Golan Heights Winery is credited with starting the \\"quality revolution\\" in Israeli wine, creating a brand identity for the country's vintages, spurring the creation of new wineries and motivating existing wineries to improve the quality of their wines. Michal Neeman, director of the Israel Export & International Cooperation Institute's food and beverage division, describes the role of the winery as crucial: \\"Everyone agrees that they were the first winery to produce excellent wine. Then came the boutique wineries, then the medium-sized, and then the large ones. There were a lot of other factors as well, but when you pinpoint the revolution, it started at Golan Heights.\\" Swedish labeling dispute Golan Heights visitors center A number of Golan Heights wines were marketed by Systembolaget, Sweden's state-owned monopoly alcohol retailer, as \\"Made in Israel\\" on shelves and in the sales catalog. Following customer complaints and consultation with Sweden's foreign ministry, Systembolaget changed the shelf labeling to read, \\"Made in Israeli-occupied Syrian territories.\\" However this prompted complaints from Annelie Enochson and officials in Israel. Systembolaget's solution was to remove all reference to the product's country of origin on shelves and in catalogs, classifying the wine as of \\"other origins.\\" Awards The winery has won worldwide acclaim and awards at the most prestigious festivals, including wine shows in France. Golan Heights Winery was named Best Foreign Winery at the Prague Trophy 2008 international wine competition. At a ceremony on January 16, 2009, the winery received the award after winning seven medals at the competition. In 2011, Golan Heights Winery won the Gran Vinitaly Special Award as the best wine producer at the 19th International Vinitaly Wine Competition in Italy.

One of few female members of the American Society of Cinematographers, she is a pioneer best known for her work in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004). She has collaborated with directors such as Michel Gondry, Spike Lee, Sam Mendes, Jim Jarmusch, Rebecca Miller, Martin Scorsese and more. She is the three-time winner of the Award for Excellence in Dramatic Cinematography at the Sundance Film Festival, for her films Personal Velocity: Three Portraits, Angela and Swoon, which was her first dramatic feature after getting her start in political documentaries. In 2008, she released her directorial debut, The Betrayal (Nerakhoon), which she co-directed, co-wrote, co-produced and shot. It was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature in 2009. In 2010, she won a Primetime Emmy Award for Exceptional Merit in Non-Fiction Filmmaking for the film. Early life and education Kuras grew up in Cedar Grove, New Jersey. After earning a double degree in anthropology and semiotics at Brown University, she studied photography at RISD and 8mm filmmaking in New York, with the plan to become a documentary filmmaker. In the early 1980s, Kuras planned to study on a Fulbright grant at a film school in Poland but was unable to go due to the introduction of martial law. She is of Polish descent on her father's side and the family surname was originally Kuraś. Career Kuras began her film career in 1987, shooting Ellen Bruno’s Samsara: Death and Rebirth in Cambodia, the first US movie filmed in Cambodia after the Vietnam War. In 1990 she won the Eastman Kodak Best Cinematography Focus Award for her work on Samsara. The film garnered accolades from the Student Academy Awards and the Sundance Film Festival where it received a Special Jury Recognition. That same year, she was asked by producer Christine Vachon to shoot her first dramatic film (Swoon) for director Tom Kalin. The film won her the Sundance Award for Excellence in Cinematography in 1992. This collaboration was the start of a prolific working relationship with Killer Films, which includes projects like Postcards From America and I Shot Andy Warhol. From that point she became one of the first women to establish an extensive career in cinematography, a department historically dominated by men. Like some of the best cinematographers in the business, she has focused her craft on sculpting light and creating powerful images that enhance story and character, while searching for \\"alternative ways of seeing the world\\". Though she started in political documentaries, she quickly branched out to work in every possible genre of film and TV, shooting big budget movies (Blow, Analyze That), independent films (Angela, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind), documentaries (Unzipped, 4 Little Girls), concert films (Lou Reed's Berlin, Shine A Light), successful TV movies (If These Walls Could Talk), national and international commercials and music videos for musicians like Bjørk, The White Stripes and more. In 1999, she was invited to join the American Society of Cinematographers, thus becoming the fifth female member to join more than 400 male peers. Over the course of her career, she has received many accolades including the Women in Film Kodak Vision Award in 1999 and was honored at the 2006 Gotham Award for her entire body of work. In 2003 she was the first film technician to receive the prestigious NY Women In Film and TV Muse Award, which traditionally is given to actresses. In 2009 she was a special Honoree at the Santa Fe Film Festival for her leadership and work in the field of cinematography. She has served on the juries of several important film festivals around the world. In 1997 she was invited to be on the jury of the Sundance Film Festival. In 2013, she was a member of the jury at the 63rd Berlin International Film Festival. In 2015 she was on the Jury of the Belgrade Film Festival and the Camerimage. Always eager to share her vast knowledge and professional insight, she has guest-lectured at many film schools and festival panels, including SVA, NYU, BU University of Texas at Austin, Walker Art Center, Hamptons International Film Festival, Camerimage, Berlinale and Woodstock Film Festival, among others.

PAH is completely removed from blood that passes through the kidneys (PAH undergoes both glomerular filtration and tubular secretion), and therefore the rate at which the kidneys can clear PAH from the blood reflects total renal plasma flow. The concentration of PAH is measured in one arterial blood sample (PPAH) and one urine sample(UPAH). The urine flow (V) is also measured. Renal perfusion flow is then calculated by: :RPF = \\\\frac{U_{PAH}}{P_{PAH}} V What is calculated is the effective renal plasma flow (eRPF). However, since the renal extraction ratio of PAH almost equals 1, then eRPF almost equals RPF. Precision The renal extraction ratio of PAH in a normal individual is approximately 0.92, and thus not exactly 1.0. Thus, this method usually underestimates RPF by approximately 10%. This margin of error is generally acceptable considering the ease with which eRPF is measured.

It was founded in 1977 by Rabbis Haim Sabato and Yitzchak Sheilat, then two young rabbis from Yeshivat HaKotel, in Jerusalem. For the first nine years since its inception it was situated in temporary structures the Maale Adumim's industrial zone Mishor Adumim, before moving to its current campus and location in Mitzpeh Nevo. Due to the founder rabbis' young age at the time, they refused the title rosh yeshiva; and so in 1983, they were joined by Rabbi Nahum Rabinovich Zt”l, who has acted as the rosh yeshiva until his petira on May 6th, 2020. The Yeshiva is known for its style of learning, which emphasizes at one and the same time the precise and incisive analysis of written text, particularly the Talmud and the Rambam, as well as the quest for common-sense understanding of the logic of the sages and its reflection in halacha. Rabbi Haim Sabato teaches the introductory class for first-year students, in which he emphasizes the skill of precise and perceptive reading of text. More advanced students used to learn from Rabbi Rabinovitch when he was alive, to study the Rambam with care and precision. The yeshiva encourages advanced students undertake independent scholarly work, such as Rabbi Baruch Brener's edition of the commentary of the Malbim on Torah or Rabbi Yehuda Fris' comprehensive guide to family law, which follows the halachic tradition up to and including current practice in Israel's rabbinical courts. The Yeshiva teaches all its students that a primary quality of a talmid chacham is to take personal responsibility, for his learning, for his lifestyle, and for decisions he must take on behalf of others. One must learn enough to acquire the ability to take decisions independently (as well as to know when one must consult with those wiser and more knowledgeable than oneself). Taking responsibility, and not habituating oneself to psychological dependence on others, is one's duty before Heaven. This point of view is controversial in today's yeshiva world, but the leaders of Birkat Moshe accept responsibility for it. Other prominent personalities in the Yeshiva are Rabbi Elisha Aviner, head of the advanced study section which prepares students for the Israeli Rabbinate's ordination exams, Rabbi Eliahu Lifshitz who specializes in the analytical works of Aharonim, and Rabbi Tzvi Shimshoni, who undertook a special study of the laws concerning interest in contemporary society. The Yeshiva is known for its emphasis on the Rambam, which is very much in line with the late rosh yeshiva's personal studies; he was the author of a comprehensive commentary and elucidation of the Rambam's major work the Mishne Torah, called Yad Peshuta. The yeshiva has a wide range of students; due to its wide range of rabbis from within the Religious Zionist community, and its wide curriculum in Jewish studies: Tanakh and philosophy as well as Gemara. Rabbi Sabato is a noted Israeli novelist, whose book Te'um Kavvanot (\\"Adjusting Sights\\"), an autobiographical account of the Yom Kippur War written in lyrical Hebrew that recalls the style of S. Y. Agnon, won the Sapir Prize for modern Hebrew literature. Today the Yeshiva has approximately 300 students and 2,000 alumni.

It generalises the computer graphics clipping problem of intersecting polygons with polygons. The first release of GPC was designed and implemented in 1997 by Alan Murta. the current GPC release was version 2.32. The core GPC library is written in the C programming language but the library has also been ported to work with several other languages. GPC is free for non-commercial use, and its author encourages the free use of GPC to support research, teaching and academic applications. To use GPC in support of commercial applications, a Licence is required. As of August 2020, GPC is no longer distributed or available. Features of GPC The following summarises the features and operations on polygons supported by GPC: GPC can compute the following clip operations: difference, intersection, exclusive-or and union. Polygons may comprise multiple disjoint contours. Contour vertices may be specified as clockwise or anticlockwise. Contours may be convex, concave or self- intersecting. Contours may be nested. In other words, polygons may have holes. The clip operation output from GPC is a set of polygon contours or tristrips. Holes and external contours are differentiated in GPC's output. Coincident edges and degenerate regions are handled correctly. Examples of GPC operations on sets of polygons The following four images show examples of GPC computing operations between two polygon sets. The first polygon set comprises outlines of the United Kingdom and Ireland. The second polygon set comprises the four large inward-pointing arrows. In each example, the areas resulting from the GPC operation between the two sets of polygons are rendered in colour. This example shows difference between the two sets: Example of GPC Difference This example shows intersection between the two sets: Example of GPC Intersection This example shows union between the two sets: Example of GPC Union This example shows exclusive-or between the two sets: Example of GPC Exclusive-or Ports and language bindings The core GPC code is written in C, but the GPC user community has contributed a number of ports and bindings (or wrappers) for various other languages (Action Script 3, Borland Delphi, C#, GNU Octave, Haxe, Haskell, Java, Lua, Pascal, Perl, Python, VB.Net). All of these ports and bindings are freely available. Licensing arrangements GPC code—along with its associated language ports, bindings, and example software—are distributed as being free to download and intended for time- unlimited evaluation by any individual or company. Following evaluation, arrangements for using GPC for a project depend on whether the project is non- commercial, or commercial basis, as follows: * Non-commercial use: GPC may be used free of charge, without a licence, in any application which is strictly non-commercial (examples: hobbyist, academic research or teaching). * Commercial use: To use GPC in support of for-profit commercial activity (example: product research & development), users must obtain an official GPC Commercial Use Licence.

Politically the village belonged then to the Duchy of Teschen, formed in 1290 in the process of feudal fragmentation of Poland and was ruled by a local branch of Piast dynasty. In 1327 the duchy became a fee of the Kingdom of Bohemia, which after 1526 became part of the Habsburg Monarchy. After the 1540s Protestant Reformation prevailed in the Duchy of Teschen and a local Catholic church was taken over by Lutherans. It was taken from them (as one from around fifty buildings in the region) by a special commission and given back to the Roman Catholic Church on 15 April 1654. After Revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire a modern municipal division was introduced in the re-established Austrian Silesia.

The lake and the surrounding area make up the Lake Gregory Regional Park adjacent to Crestline, California. The area, originally known as Houston Flat, was developed by and named for its developer, Redlands citrus grower Arthur Gregory, Sr. Gregory bought and developed land in an area known today as Valley of the Moon. He erected a sawmill at Valley of the Moon to cut wood for crating his \\"Orange Blossom\\" brand of citrus fruit. Gregory was also instrumental in creating the Crest Forest County Water District (CFCWD), which, in turn, was necessary to acquire federal aid in order to develop the area. Although the lake is in Crestline proper, Crestline is not a part of the Crest Forest District, but rather the Crestline Water District, which purchases water from CFCWD. Work began in 1937 under a Works Progress Administration (WPA) grant to dam the east and west forks of Houston Creek, whose waters drained into tributaries of the Mojave River, thereby \\"going to waste\\". The project was nearly completed by March 1938, but federal funds had run out. Gregory financed the completion of the project, lending money to the district for the completion. The eventual cost was US$225,000, of which US$160,000 came from the federal government, with the balance funded by the water district. Heavy rains that March put the dam to its first test. It had been estimated that it would take three years to fill the lake. So heavy were the rains that the lake filled in only three days. An unconfirmed, but plausible urban legend claims that the construction equipment left on the lake bed in 1938 during the rains remains at the bottom of the lake today. A road built over the dam (present-day Lake Drive) completed the project in January 1939. Today, the Lake Gregory Recreational Park with swimming and water slides is at the west end of the lake and a walking trail encircles the lake. The south shore of the lake is a popular fishing destination. The regional park is the site of Crestline's Independence Day celebration. The southeast shore is the site of the private beach and Tyrolean-styled clubhouse of the San Moritz Lodge, once known as Club San Moritz. The original club was built in the Valley of the Moon in 1926 along the shore of now-drained Moon Lake, today the site of Lake Gregory Community Church. A fire of suspicious origin destroyed the building in 1950 and the lake was drained in the early 1960s over increasing problems with mosquitoes. The new club, built along Lake Gregory in 1950, was intended to be a members- only resort and club for property owners in the area. Today, the only remaining buildings are the restaurant, used as the site of special events such as weddings, and a bathhouse, now used as a senior center. Private vessels and power boats are not allowed on Lake Gregory, although rowboats, paddle boards, pedal-powered \\"water trikes\\" and paddle boats are available for rental. The rowboats may be affixed with the renter's own electric trolling motor. From 2011 to 2013, the park experienced operating losses of $1.4 million. In 2014, the San Bernardino County partnered with The California Parks Company, now named Basecamp Hospitality, after six years of decline due to the flagging economy. In 2018, San Bernardino County put the concessionaire contract up for bid to find a new managing company for Lake Gregory. Basecamp Hospitality won the bid as the only concessionaire applying, but struggled to come to financial terms with the longterm contract and renewed a two-year agreement instead.

History The village was first mentioned in 1416 in the document of Bolesław of Cieszyn. Politically it belonged then to the Duchy of Teschen, a fee of the Kingdom of Bohemia, which after 1526 became part of the Habsburg Monarchy. The history of the village was strongly twined with the history of Nierodzim where the noble owners of them both resided. Later the distinction between two parts of the village developed: Dolne (lit. Lower) and Górne (Upper). Bładnice Górne were then absorbed by Nierodzim. In the late 19th century they both became part of the Teschener Kammer. After Revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire a modern municipal division was introduced in the re-established Austrian Silesia. Bładnice Dolne as a municipality was subscribed to the political district of Bielsko and the legal district of Skotschau. According to the censuses conducted in 1880, 1890, 1900 and 1910 the population of the municipality dropped from 211 in 1880 to 204 in 1910, with all of the inhabitants being native Polish-speakers of mostly Protestants faith (143, 70.1% in 1910), followed by Roman Catholics (61, 29.9%).

The events were the subject of two acclaimed works, both titled Murder in Coweta County: a 1976 book by Margaret Anne Barnes and a 1983 television movie on CBS starring Johnny Cash and Andy Griffith. History John Wallace, a wealthy landowner, had virtually unlimited power in Meriwether County, Georgia. Even the sheriff, Hardy Collier, was under his control. Wilson Turner, a sharecropper tenant, attempted to do extra bootlegging work without Wallace's permission and was fired as a result. Turner retaliated by stealing two of Wallace's cows. Turner was found and arrested in Carrollton, Georgia, by Chief of Police Threadgill but was transferred from the Carrollton Jail to the Meriwether County jail in Greenville. Turner was later released from jail, purportedly because of a lack of evidence. As he left the jail, he discovered John Wallace waiting outside with his men. Realizing that he had been set up, Turner attempted to escape in his truck, with Wallace and his group in pursuit, two men each in two cars. Turner's truck, drained of its fuel earlier, ran out of gas just past the county line at the Sunset Tourist camp in Moreland, Coweta County, Georgia. Multiple witnesses reported seeing Wallace pistol-whip Turner so hard that the gun discharged, then Turner going limp and being put in one of the cars. The group then returned to Meriwether County, where Turner's body was first hidden on Wallace's property, then burned in a pit, the ashes and bone fragments scattered in a nearby stream. Wallace forced two black field workers, Albert Brooks and Robert Lee Gates, to assist him in destroying the victim's body. Because the act of murder, as witnesses testified, took place in Coweta County, the crime was under the jurisdiction of the Coweta County sheriff, Lamar Potts. Potts and his deputies searched for days and then an informant told them of Wallace burning the body and revealed the names of Brooks and Gates. Potts persuaded the two men to take him to the burn site. There were bone fragments found that the crime lab identified as human. Brooks and Gates also took the sheriff to the well where Turner's body had originally been deposited. Ruptured brain tissue was found that was also identified as coming from a human being. Wallace's trial received wide press coverage in the rural community. It was reported that Wallace's eccentric testimony led to his conviction. After several appeals, John Wallace was executed in the electric chair in 1950. His case was unusual, because he was one of the richest men to ever be given the death penalty and his case was the first in Georgia where a white man was given the death sentence upon the testimony of two black men. Mayhayley Lancaster, a lawyer from nearby Heard County, also testified against Wallace. Book Murder in Coweta County (original ; re-issued in 1983 and 2004) was a 1976 book by Margaret Anne Barnes, originally published by Simon & Schuster in 1977. Though the book is generally considered accurate, Barnes' website has quoted the El Paso Times as calling it \\"the new fictionalized style of recording historic events\\". No Remorse: The Rise and Fall of John Wallace (hardcover ), by Dot Moore, explores not only the fateful murder but also the events that brought Wallace to that point—the death of his father and his early exposure to making moonshine, among other events. Includes actual letters to and from Wallace in prison. Film Murder in Coweta County was a 1983 television movie produced by Dick Atkins and Michael Lepiner, directed by Gary Nelson, and written by Dennis Nemec based on Barnes' book. Andy Griffith played landowner John Wallace and Johnny Cash played Sheriff Lamar Potts of Coweta County. Cash's wife, June Carter is particularly memorable as the local seer, Mayhayley Lancaster. Noted Watergate-era attorney James F. Neal played one of the lawyers during the trial.

It is located in the heart of the city of Sialkot in Punjab province of Pakistan.Iqbal Manzil renovated - Dawn Pakistan  History  Iqbal Manzil was purchased in 1861 by Mohammad Rafique, the great-grandfather of Allama Iqbal. The house was originally very small, but each successor kept adding to it and the building grew in size. After the death of his father Noor Muhammad, Iqbal's his elder brother, Ata Mohammad, was named the owner of the Iqbal Manzil. Ata Mohammed's sons after his death, left the house and took up residences in Karachi and Lahore. Allama Iqbal's son Javed Iqbal was born in the Iqbal Manzil on 5 October 1924. Javed Iqbal spent his childhood in Lahore but never entered Iqbal Manzil again. Allama Iqbal's other son Aftab Iqbal resided in Karachi for the better part of his life. Allama Iqbal also had a daughter named Munira Iqbal. Since 1986, Riaz Hussain Naqvi has been the curator at Iqbal Manzil.  Restoration work  The Government of Pakistan bought Iqbal Manzil for its restoration in 1971 and handed it over to the Archaeology Department, which aptly accorded it the status of a cultural heritage. = Negligence = However, in the early 2000s the Iqbal Manzil became a victim of negligence of the authorities who were responsible for preserving this national heritage. Cracks appeared in several walls of the decades-old building, the doors creaked. The building was in shambles. The number of visitors went from 300 in one day to only a few dozen. The back part of the building was in a dilapidated condition and mostly ignored. = Renovation = The Sialkot District Government renovated the Iqbal Manzil to save it from collapsing. The walls were repaired and whitewashed. The roof was painted. Old curtains were replaced and the second storey was carpeted. After renovation, the number of visitors shot up to about 200 per day. The Government released Rs.14 million for restoring the building. For few decades approx from 1988 , Riaz Hussain Naqvi, the curator of Iqbal Manzil, has been actively involved in the restoration of this historic building and has been successful to quite some extent and has been nominated for the pride of performance.  Inside the Iqbal Manzil  Many tourists come to Sialkot especially to visit the Iqbal Manzil. It is the place where he lived and wrote poetry that would later stimulate the creation of the Pakistan Movement. After renovation, Iqbal Manzil was converted into a library-cum-museum. The museum was inaugurated in 1977. It consists of a guided tour through the rooms of the mansion spread out on three storeys. On display is the furniture and many other objects used by Allama Iqbal and his family decades ago. Moreover, several rare pictures of Allama Iqbal with his family, teachers, class fellows and leaders of the All India Muslim League adorn the walls of the building. Many of these hold autographs of Allama Iqbal. Iqbal's poetry written in his own handwriting is also on display. A pen and ink pot used by him are also on display. = Library = The library at the Iqbal Manzil holds over 4000 books, 2000 on Iqbaliyat alone, all of which were donated by visitors. Visitors can sit in the library free of cost and peruse the scholarly works at their own leisure. The library has facilitated 5 students in attaining their Ph.D on the works of Iqbal. The Punjab Government has announced to establish an advance research centre at the Iqbal Manzil which would facilitate research being conducted on Iqbal and his works. The research centre has not yet been established despite more than two years have passed since the project was approved.  Visitors  Since its renovation, Iqbal Manzil has enjoyed a host of visitors who have reveled in its historic significance. Some notable visitors include the Ambassador of Tajikistan to Pakistan Mr. Sherali S. Jononov. A Japanese delegation from Osaka University, Japan also paid a visit to Iqbal Mazil and enjoyed the traditional breakfast of Hulwa Puri there.

During Emperor Zhongzong's reign, he became aligned with Emperor Zhongzong's powerful wife Empress Wei, and after Emperor Zhongzong's death in 710 and a coup led by Emperor Zhongzong's sister Princess Taiping and Emperor Zhongzong's nephew Li Longji the Prince of Linzi killed Empress Wei, Wei Juyuan was also killed.  Background  Wei Juyuan was born in 631, during the reign of Emperor Taizong. He was a fourth generation descendant of the great Western Wei and Northern Zhou general Wei Xiaokuan, and his grandfather Wei Kuangbo (韋匡伯) was a duke during Tang Dynasty's predecessor and Northern Zhou's successor Sui Dynasty, based on Wei Xiaokuan's achievements. Wei Juyuan's father Wei Siren (韋思仁) was an imperial attendant during Tang.New Book of Tang, vol. 74, part 1.  During Wu Zetian's reign  Wei Juyuan himself had become deputy minister of vassal affairs (司賓少卿) during the reign of Emperor Taizong's daughter-in-law (and one- time concubine) Wu Zetian. As of 693, he was serving as Wenchang Zuo Cheng (文昌左丞), one of the secretaries general of the executive bureau of government (文昌臺, Wenchang Tai), when Wu Zetian gave him the designation Tong Fengge Luantai Pingzhangshi (同鳳閣鸞臺平章事), making him a chancellor de facto. In 694, he was made the assistant minister of defense (夏官侍郎, Xiaguan Shilang) and still chancellor with the Tong Fengge Luantai Pingzhangshi designation. He was said to be meticulous in matters of reviewing subordinates' actions and correcting them that his subordinates complained, but he was able to correct a number of problems that they were having. In late 694, Wu Zetian, displeased with the powerful chancellor Li Zhaode, exiled Li, and fellow chancellor Zhou Yunyuan and the assistant chief judge of the supreme court, Huangfu Wenbei (皇甫文備), then submitted articles of impeachment against Wei and several fellow chancellors -- Doulu Qinwang, Du Jingjian, Su Weidao, and Lu Yuanfang—for not being able to curb Li Zhaode's power. The five chancellors so accused were all demoted to be prefectural prefect—in Wei's case, to be the prefect of Fu Prefecture (鄜州, roughly modern Yan'an, Shaanxi). However, he was soon recalled to be the minister of treasury (地官尚書, Diguan Shangshu). By 700, he was again Wenchang Zuo Cheng, when he was made Nayan (納言), the head of the examination bureau (鳳閣, Fengge) and a post considered one for a chancellor. In 701, he was removed from that post, as his clansman Wei Anshi was becoming a chancellor at the time, and Wu Zetian did not like having multiple members of the same clan serving together as chancellors. He was subsequently put in charge of the capital Luoyang when Wu Zetian visited the western capital Chang'an, apparently to oversee a construction project at her mother Lady Yang's tomb. While she was still at Chang'an, in 702, she summoned Wei Juyuan to Chang'an and had his deputy Li Jiao put in charge of Luoyang. Subsequently, when she returned to Luoyang, he was put in charge of Chang'an.  During Emperor Zhongzong's reign  In 705, Wu Zetian was overthrown in a coup, and her son Li Xian, who had previously been briefly emperor in 684, was restored to the throne (as Emperor Zhongzong). Wei Juyuan was made the minister of public works (工部尚書, Gongbu Shangshu) and created the Viscount of Tong'an. In the fall of that year, Wei Juyuan was given the designation Tong Zhongshu Menxia Sanpin (同中書門下三品), again making him a chancellor de facto; he was also created the Count of Xun. However, he was soon made the minister of rites (禮部尚書, Libu Shangshu) and no longer chancellor, as Wei Anshi was still chancellor at the time. In 706, Wei Juyuan was the minister of justice (刑部尚書, Xingbu Shangshu), when he was again given the Tong Zhongshu Menxia Sanpin designation—and further, Emperor Zhongzong had Wei Juyuan formally considered part of the clan of his wife Empress Wei. He was created the Duke of Shu. He thereafter appeared to become part of Empress Wei's faction at court. When Emperor Zhongzong's son-in-law Wang Tongjiao (王同皎) was accused of a treasonous plot with Zhang Zhongzhi (張仲之), Zu Yanqing (祖延慶), and Zhou Jing (周璟), in 706, of plotting to kill Empress Wei's lover Wu Sansi the Prince of Dejing (Wu Zetian's nephew) and then depose her, Zhang, while being interrogated, openly accused Empress Wei and Wu Sansi of adultery. Wei Juyuan and another chancellor aligned with Empress Wei, Yang Zaisi, who were conducting the interrogation, were said to have simply ignored the accusations as if they did not hear them. In 707, Wei Juyuan was again the head of the examination bureau (now renamed Menxia Sheng (門下省)), now with the title Shizhong (侍中). In spring 708, when there were rumors coming out of the palace that there was a five- colored cloud—a sign of holiness—that was coming out of Empress Wei's skirt, Wei advocated that this incident be publicized, and Emperor Zhongzong agreed. In 709, Wei Juyuan and Yang were both was made Pushe (僕射), heads of the executive bureau (now renamed Shangshu Sheng (尚書省)), and they both continued to serve as chancellor with the Tong Zhongshu Menxia Sanpin designation. Later that year, when Emperor Zhongzong was set to make sacrifices to heaven to the south of Chang'an (now capital again), Zhu Qinming the principal of the imperial university and Zhu's deputy Guo Shanyun (郭山惲), in order to flatter Empress Wei, suggested that she be allowed to serve as the second-stage sacrificer after Emperor Zhongzong, against the opposition of several other scholars, Tang Shao (唐紹), Jiang Qinxu (蔣欽緒), and Chu Wuliang (褚無量). Wei Juyuan ruled that Zhu's proposal be accepted, and so Empress Wei served as the second sacrificer. Zhu initially proposed that Emperor Zhongzong's powerful daughter Li Guo'er the Princess Anle be made the third sacrificer, but Tang and Jiang sternly opposed it, and so Emperor Zhongzong had Wei Juyuan serve as the third sacrificer. In spring 710, there was an occasion when Emperor Zhongzong had the high level officials play games of cuju and tug of war. It was said that Wei Juyuan and fellow chancellor Tang Xiujing, due to their old age, fell and could not get up, drawing much laughs from the imperial household.  During Emperor Shang's reign  In summer 710, Emperor Zhongzong suddenly died—a death that traditional historians believe to be a poisoning by Empress Wei and Li Guo'er, so that Empress Wei could eventually become emperor like Wu Zetian and Li Guo'er could be crown princess. Empress Wei made Emperor Zhongzong's son, by a concubine, Li Chongmao the Prince of Wen emperor (as Emperor Shang), but retained actual power as empress dowager and regent. Less than month later, Emperor Zhongzong's sister Princess Taiping and nephew Li Longji the Prince of Linzi led a coup that killed Empress Dowager Wei and Li Guo'er. When the news of the coup broke, Wei Juyuan's family members advised him to hide due to his connections with Empress Dowager Wei. Wei Juyuan responded, \\"I am an important official. How can I stay away when the government is suffering such disaster?\\" He set out to go to the imperial government buildings, but on the way was intercepted by the troops participating in the coup, and he was killed. Soon thereafter, Li Longji's father Li Dan the Prince of Xiang, himself a former emperor, displaced Emperor Shang and retook the throne (as Emperor Ruizong). He awarded Wei Juyuan posthumous honors, and initially the imperial scholar Li Chuzhi (李處直) proposed that Wei Juyuan be given the posthumous name Zhao (昭, \\"accomplished\\"). Another official, Li Yong (李邕), vehemently opposed, stating: Li Yong later submitted a lengthy written opposition to the \\"Zhao\\" posthumous name, which popular opinion agreed was good argument, but Emperor Ruizong still bestowed the posthumous name of Zhao.

Some sources claim that the name is connected with the Vistulans tribe, however the village is too young to have existed in the tribal era. The name was mostly Germanised as Wislitz.

Jordan was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, grew up in St. Louis, Missouri, and received musical training at the Lincoln Institute (now Lincoln University) in Jefferson City, Missouri. Early life In 1900, young Joe performed as fiddler and percussionist with the Taborian Band of St. Louis. He also appeared with Tom Turpin, Sam Patterson, and Louis Chauvin in a singing four piano act. In 1902, he went to New York City to collaborate with Ernest Hogan, known in show business as \\"The Unbleached American\\". At the beginning of the 20th century, much of the entertainment industry was founded upon the exploitation of ethnic stereotypes. Hogan's big hit was called \\"All Coons Look Alike to Me\\", and the stage show that he and Jordan cooked up was \\"Rufus Rastus\\". Another example of the prevalent racial thematic was \\"Dandy Coon\\", created by Chauvin and Patterson in 1903. Jordan stage-managed and directed the music for this bit of minstrelsy, which toured with a cast of thirty including a \\"beautiful octoroon chorus\\". When the show disbanded in Des Moines, Iowa, Jordan left for Chicago. He began performing at the Pekin, a former casino/saloon at 27th and State that had been converted into a beer garden by Robert T. Motts. This location became the \\"Pekin Theater Stock Company\\" featuring many African American performers. The \\"Pekin Theater Stock Company\\" Jordan commemorated this hot spot with the \\"Pekin Rag\\", published in 1904. He briefly returned to St. Louis in order to play the Faust Restaurant at the 1904 St. Louis World's Fair. Now known as an expert at rapid orchestration on demand, Jordan returned to New York in 1905 to work with Ernest Hogan and James Reese Europe at organizing and directing the Memphis Students, a group of seventeen African-American men and women who were not students, nor were they from Memphis. In the spring of 1905, they premiered at Proctor's 23rd Street Theater. James Weldon Johnson said that this \\"playing- singing-dancing orchestra\\" was \\"the first modern jazz band ever heard on a New York stage\\". Instrumentally, the ensemble contained saxophones, brass, banjos, guitars, mandolins, piano and drums. Later in 1905, they played Paris, London, and other major European cities. Jordan composed \\"Rise and Shine\\", \\"Oh, Liza Lady\\", \\"Goin' To Exit\\", and \\"Dixie Land\\" for this group. He also wrote the \\"J.J.J. Rag\\". Back in Chicago, Motts' establishment was developing into an all-purpose entertainment center, known locally as the Pekin Temple of Music. In 1906 Motts expanded his operation by erecting the Pekin Theatre right on top of the existing \\"Temple\\". With the opening of the enlarged Pekin (one of America's first African-American-owned theatres) on March 31, 1906, the South Side of Chicago began to transform itself into a launching pad for the jazz explosion of 1915-1925. Jordan conducted the 16-piece house orchestra and served as composer and musical director, all for a weekly salary of $25. In New York, Jordan wrote a couple of songs for Ada Overton Walker, first \\"Salome's Dance\\" and then in 1909 \\"That Teasin' Rag\\". Its main theme was used by The Original Dixieland Jazz Band on their 1917 recording the \\"Original Dixieland One Step\\". When Jordan heard the record, he filed suit. All copies of the records were recalled, and the label was changed to include the phrase \\"introducing ‘That Teasin' Rag' by Joe Jordan\\".  The Red Moon with Cole and Johnson  Also in 1909, Jordan collaborated with Bob Cole and J. Rosamond Johnson on The Red Moon, a Broadway operetta which broke Jim Crow convention by having persons of color perform serious romantic songs, expressing realistic human emotion. This was something apparently not permitted, especially outside of New York City. In 1910, Jordan wrote \\"Lovie Joe\\" (no) for Fanny Brice. Barred as a black man from entering the theater where Brice premiered the song, Jordan was forced to stand outside on the pavement and heard the public demanding eight encores. European Tours and Keep Shufflin' Jordan went to Germany in 1911 with King and Bailey's Chocolate Drops. On his way back he performed his way through England. Landing at the Pekin in Chicago once again, he resumed his duties there for about three years. His songs dating from this period include \\"Dat's Ma Honey Sho's Yo' Born\\", \\"Oh Say Wouldn't It Be a Dream\\" and \\"Brother-In-Law Dan\\". He did very well in Chicago's real estate market. In 1917, he built the J. Jordan Building Bronzeville neighborhood at 3529–49 South State Street, at the corner of 36th Street – described as the city's first major commercial building by a black developer. In 1918-19, he was assistant director and financial advisor for Will Marion Cook's New York Syncopated Orchestra. In 1928, Jordan conducted a band made up of Jabbo Smith, Garvin Bushell, James P. Johnson, and Thomas \\"Fats\\" Waller in the musical revue Keep Shufflin'. Jordan's touring band was called the Ten Sharps and Flats. He conducted the Federal Theatre Project's Negro Unit Orchestra in New York during the 1930s. From April 14 to June 20, 1936, Jordan worked with Johnson, Porter Grainger, and Asadata Dafora providing music for the Federal Theatre Project production of Shakespeare's Macbeth directed by Orson Welles at the New Lafayette Theatre. In 1939, Jordan led a symphony orchestra augmented by a 350-voice chorus at Carnegie Hall. He composed songs in collaboration with W. C. Handy, led military bands during World War II and ran a successful real estate business in Tacoma, Washington, where he died on September 11, 1971.  Selected works  Nappy Lee was a nickname for a low brass player that sported unkempt albeit likable hair who once performed with Wilbur Sweatman's Orchestra. Jordan composed in 1904 a song titled \\"Nappy Lee\\" (©1904), a slow drag, for mandolin orchestra in commemoration of Nappy Lee. However, Jordan sold it to a Des Moines publisher, J.E. Agnew (Joseph Erskine Agnew; 1868–1949). \\"Nappy Lee,\\" recorded December 15, 1903, was Jordan's first recording of a rag.

It was founded by Josephine Potel in 1824, in Paris, France.

Reflecting their name (\\"bon secours\\" means \\"good help\\" in French), the congregation's motto is \\"Good Help to Those in Need.\\" Initially active in France, the sisters tended the wounded during the Revolution of 1848 and 1870 Franco-Prussian War, and the sick during the 1893 cholera epidemic in Boulogne-Sur-Mer. In 1832, at the request of the Archbishop of Boulogne, they took charge of an orphanage. Their work expanded to both other countries and other areas of service. The order expanded to Ireland (1861), England (1870), the United States (1881), Scotland (1948), Chad (1957), Tanzania (2006), and Peru (2017).

Examination of the remains found that they dated from the late 1930s through to the 1950s. Data from the National Archives from 1947 showed that during the preceding twelve months, the death rate of children in Bon Secours was almost twice that of some other mother and baby homes. History =The foundress= The congregation's foundress, Josephine Potel, was born on March 14, 1799 in the small rural village of Bécordel in Northern France. At the age of 22, she traveled to Paris and was moved to pity by the suffering she observed. At that time, France had been shaken by centuries of political, social, and religious upheaval — including, most recently, the French Revolution. The violence of the Revolution — particularly the Reign of Terror – had taken many lives and destroyed lives the very fabric of society.\\"Our Foundation\\", Sisters of Bon Secours, USA With rampant poverty among France's lower class, healthcare for the poor was scarce and low-quality. When people fell ill or were injured, they avoided the hospitals, which were seen as death traps and often had filthy, prison-like conditions. Care, if available at all, was usually provided by a family member with little or no experience caring for the sick. With overcrowding and a lack of sanitation, diseases spread quickly through city streets, afflicting rich and poor alike. Saint-Sulpice, Paris Potel and eleven other women formed the group that would become the Sisters of Bon Secours. They chose Potel (Sister Marie-Joseph) as their leader, for her dedication to the seemingly endless work, and her ability to encourage and guide others. Contemporary norms held that nuns were supposed to either remain in the convent or at least return by nightfall if they ventured out into the world. Consequently, when the Sisters applied for acceptance of their new congregation, Archbishop de Quélen of Paris was skeptical. After persistent efforts by Sister Marie-Joseph, the Archbishop eventually granted the Sisters a one-year probationary period. According to their founding constitution, \\"...the principal aim of this pious society is the care of the sick in their own homes\\". Meehan, Thomas. \\"Institutes of Bon Secours.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 2. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1907. 13 August 2019 The group was formally approved by Pope Pius IX in 1875. Our Lady Help of Christians is their patron.Mays, Deirdre C., \\"Bon Secours sisters celebrate 75 years of good health\\", The Catholic Miscellany, Diocese of Charleston, March 4, 1999 =Early days= Although its patients were expected to pay as much as they could afford, the congregation provided nursing free of charge to the poor. Despite the divisions between social classes in French society at the time, the Sisters cared for rich patients in large estates as well as the poor, avoiding distinctions based on socioeconomic status. In addition to providing care to the sick, the Sisters would also share their food with patients' hungry family members, striving to help bring health to everyone in their patients' homes, not just the actively ill. Furthermore, among the ill, the Sisters at that time took a holistic view, considering not just the body but also the mind and spirit of each patient, and aiming to bring healing to the whole person. Another radical view at the time, this approach, along with the group's extension of care to the patient's family, distinguished them from traditional religious congregations operating at the time. Word of the Sisters' work spread quickly throughout Paris and the surrounding countryside, and the Sisters were sought out by other women who, inspired by their work, wanted to join the institute. By the end of its first year, eighteen new members had joined, bringing the number to thirty. On January 24, 1824, Monsignor de Quelen, accepted their vows and gave them the name of the Bon Secours Sisters of Paris.\\"Sisters of Bon Secours in France\\", bonsecours.org On May 6, 1826, Mother Josephine died. Three days later, on May 9, Angelique Geay was appointed Superior General, taking her predecessor's name, Mother Mary Joseph. =Growth of the congregation's mission in France= The Sisters reached a major milestone in 1827, when the French Bourbon government legally recognized them as the first association of nursing religious individuals in the country. Following this milestone, the demand for the organization's services continued to grow. In 1829, Mere Geay established a new group of twelve sisters in Lille, and the following year the Sisters began a ministry in Boulogne. Three years later, at the Archbishop's request, the congregation took over an orphanage in Paris. As the Sisters’ numbers continued to grow, they moved in 1833 into a larger home in Paris. Meanwhile, France continued to be subject to epidemics, wars, and social upheaval. After the King of France was exiled during the Revolution of 1848, the former King's palace became a hospital where the Sisters cared for the wounded; they also tended to the injured on the streets of Paris. Similarly, during the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, the Sisters cared for the wounded and dying on the battlefield and brought them into their convents to convalesce. Although the sisters had been requested to take over care for the sick during the 1893 cholera epidemic in Boulogne-Sur-Mer, the congregation subsequently became a target of anti- clerical governments during the early 20th century. =Europe= In addition to extending their work around France, the Sisters of Bon Secours began to expand beyond the country's borders due to international demand for their services. In 1861, Dublin, Ireland became the Sisters' first foreign foundation. From their original convent on Granville Street, they provided visiting nurse services. Nine years later, the congregation was invited to establish themselves in London.\\"Our History\\", Bon Secours Health System The Sisters expanded to Scotland in 1948, opening a home nursing service, and also opening a home for the elderly in Glasgow. The independent Bon Secours Health System, one of largest hospital groups in Ireland, developed from the initial Bon Secours hospitals.\\"about\\", Bon Secours Health SystemUPMC \\"Bon Secours chooses IMS MAXIMS for first of its kind order comms roll-out in Ireland\\", IMS Maxims, November 29, 2018 It later merged with Bon Secours Mercy Health of Cincinnati, Ohio. In 2015, the for-profit Bon Secours Health System had about 2,700 staff who worked with 350 medical consultants and saw more than 200,000 patients, making €2.5 million in profit after paying €3 million to the order in rent. =North America= The Sisters of Bon Secours' arrival in America came about because of a honeymoon gone awry in the late 1800s. A newlywed couple, the Whedbys, were on their wedding trip in Paris when the bride fell ill. An English-speaking Bon Secours Sister nursed her back to health, and the couple was impressed with the care she provided. Upon returning to the States, the couple spoke to some prominent area physicians, who contacted Archbishop Gibbons of Baltimore to request that the Sisters be asked to practice their ministry in the United States. Approving of the request, while on his way to Rome to become a cardinal, Archbishop Gibbons stopped in Paris to ask the Sisters if they would be willing to provide their home care services in Baltimore. In 1881, three Sisters sailed to the United States, and in the following year they opened a convent in Baltimore on the site of the present Grace Medical Center. The Bon Secours established the first day care facility in Baltimore in 1907 to help working mothers whose only alternative was to place their children in orphanages. They came to Washington, D.C. in 1905 to provide healthcare during a typhoid epidemic. They're assistance was particularly beneficial during a Spanish flu outbreak after World War I. As hospitals became the preferred place of treatment, the Sisters broadened where they cared for the sick and dying. Soon the Sisters were building their own health care facilities. By 1916 the Sisters were staffing a home for crippled children in Philadelphia. In 1958 the Congregation of Bon Secours in the United States became a separate Province. As the twentieth century progressed, the sisters responded to people's changing needs, opening convalescent homes, running clinics and mobile health care vans, caring for the sick in rural areas and those struggling with addictions in inner cities. Bon Secours Health System was established in 1983 to coordinate the administration and management of the various healthcare facilities. The congregation hosts a Retreat & Conference Center in Marriottsville, Maryland.Bon Secours Retreat & Conference Center =Africa= The Sisters began to expand into the developing world, with work in South America and Africa. In 1957, the Sisters opened a home for sick children in Chad, working also to educate mothers and reduce the infant mortality rate. In 2006, they began to work in Tanzania.\\"Sisters of Bon Secours - Our History\\", BSHS =South America= The Irish Sisters of Bon Secours began the institute's first work in South America, after the Bishop of Cork and Ross took responsibility for a shantytown on the Peruvian coastline and invited the Sisters to minister to the populace there. About forty Bon Secours sisters responded to provide emergency assistance during the 2017 floods in Peru.Salgado, Soli. \\"Sisters on the ground in flood-ravaged Peru provide medical aid to residents\\", Global Sisters Report, April 20, 2017 Present day The Congregation of Bon Secours is headquartered in Marriottsville, Maryland.

In 1919, the Sisters opened the Bon Secours Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland, their first hospital in the U.S. They began formally training young women at the Bon Secours School of Nursing in 1921. Many more hospitals were established, as well as community health clinics, nursing care facilities for the elderly, alcohol and drug abuse rehabilitation centers and convalescent homes. Bon Secours Health System was established in 1983 to coordinate the administration and management of the various healthcare facilities in the United States.\\"History\\", Sisters of Bon Secours, USA On September 1, 2018, Bon Secours and Mercy Health combined to become the United States’ fifth largest Catholic health care ministry and one of the nation's 20 largest health care systems. Bon Secours Hospital, Galway Around 1861, the Sisters were invited to come to Ireland, and founded a house in Dublin. Bon Secours Hospital, Cork was established in 1915. This was a significant departure from there practice of home care. With 300 beds, it is the largest private hospital in Ireland; and is a teaching hospital affiliated with UCC (University College Cork). Other hospitals followed. A separate Bon Secours Health System was formed in 1993 to coordinate the health care facilities under one limited company. As of April 2019, Bon Secours Health System had five acute-care hospitals in Cork, Galway, Limerick, Tralee and Dublin as well as a long-term care facility in Cork.Kacik, Alex. \\"Bon Secours Mercy Health charts Ireland expansion\\", Modern Healthcare, April 30, 2019 In 2019 Bon Secours Health System of Dublin merged with Bon Secours Mercy Health of Cincinnati, Ohio. \\"Together, the health systems have 60,000 employees serving more than 10.5 million people through nearly 50 hospitals, more than 50 home health agencies and senior health and housing facilities.\\" Tuam Children's Home controversy Between 1925 and 1961, the congregation operated the Bon Secours Mother and Baby Home, also known as \\"The Children's Home\\" in Tuam, Ireland. In 2014, news media reported that the bodies of 796 children and babies who died of malnutrition (including marasmus-related malnutrition) and disease were suspected to have been buried in a former septic tank on the site of the home. The child mortality rate at the home during certain local epidemics had averaged up to two a week. Medical reports at the time listed the cause of death as disease or disease-induced effects. Catherine Corless, an amateur historian, had obtained death records for 796 children who had died of various diseases and malnutrition (including marasmus-related malnutrition) at the home — an overall rate of 22.1 per year between 1925 and 1961, and finding no trace of their burial in any of the local graveyards, she inferred that they probably were buried on the property. In 1975, two local boys had lifted a concrete slab and seen the skeletons of \\"maybe twenty\\" babies. While Corless speculates that the pit in which the skeletons lay may have been part of the sewage tank installed by the workhouse in 1840, eighty-five years before the Bon Secours sisters took it over, she told the Irish Times, \\"I never used that word, 'dumped'. I never said to anyone that 800 bodies were 'dumped' in a septic tank. That did not come from me at any point. They are not my words. ... I just wanted those children to be remembered and for their names to go up on a plaque. That was why I did this project, and now it has taken [on] a life of its own.\\" Still, figures for 1947 from the National Archives showed that the death rate of children in Bon Secours, during the preceding twelve months, was almost twice that of other mother and baby homes. The death records obtained by Corless had established the identities of those who died in the home. She concluded that their bodies had been buried on the St. Mary's property, and she set up a fund to build a memorial for the site.Boland (2014). Bon Secours sisters are said to have donated money for this purpose. The area is labeled as a septic tank when overlaid with maps from the earlier workhouse era, and had been decommissioned in the 1930s. A judicial Commission of Investigation commissioned an Expert Technical Group which found that \\"The human remains found by the Commission are not in a sewage tank but in a second structure with 20 chambers which was built within the decommissioned large sewage tank. The precise purpose of the chamber structure has not been established but it is likely to be related to the treatment/containment of sewage and/or waste water.\\" \\"The Commission has also not yet determined if it was ever used for this purpose.\\" Carbon dating confirmed that the remains date from the timeframe relevant to the operation of the Mother and Baby Home by the Bon Secours order. The Commission stated that it was shocked by the discovery and that it is continuing its investigation into who was responsible for the disposal of human remains in this way. =Mother and baby homes commission of investigation= On 4 June 2014, the Irish government announced it was forming a panel of representatives from a number of government departments to investigate the deaths at the home and propose a course of action for the government to take in addressing the issues. Charles Flanagan, the then children's minister, said the inquiry would be charged with investigating burial practices, high mortality rates, forced adoptions and clinical trials of drugs on children in the home in Tuam and three other suspect homes. On 3 June 2015, the Irish Examiner published a special report which stated that the Irish Health Services Executive had voiced concerns in 2012 that up to 1,000 children may have been trafficked from the Home, and recommending that the then health minister be informed so that \\"a fully fledged, fully resourced forensic investigation and State inquiry\\" could be launched. The issue had arisen within the HSE when a principal social worker responsible for adoption discovered \\"a large archive of photographs, documentation and correspondence relating to children sent for adoption to the USA\\" and \\"documentation in relation to discharges and admissions to psychiatric institutions in the Western area.\\" The HSE noted that there were letters from the Home to parents asking for money for the upkeep of their children and notes that the duration of stay for children may have been prolonged by the order for financial reasons. It also uncovered letters to parents asking for money for the upkeep of some children who had already been discharged or had died. The social worker had compiled a list of \\"up to 1,000 names.\\" HSE reports mentioned the possibility that children had been trafficked for adoption with one speculating that it was possible that death certificates were falsified so children could be \\"brokered\\" for adoption. On 3 March 2017, the Mother and Baby Homes Commission of Investigation announced that human remains had been found during a test excavation carried out between November 2016 and February 2017 at the site. Tests conducted on some of the remains indicated they had been aged between 35 foetal weeks and 2–3 years. The announcement confirmed that the deceased died during the period of time that the property was used by the Tuam Children's Home, not from an earlier period, with most of the bodies dated to the 1950s. The remains were found in an \\"underground structure divided into 20 chambers\\", later determined to be a sewage tank. The Commission stated that it was continuing its investigation into who was responsible for the disposal of human remains in this way, that it has also asked the relevant State authorities to take responsibility for the appropriate treatment of the remains, and that it has notified the coroner. Minister for Children, Katherine Zappone said that the coroner's results would determine the direction of the investigation and that the commission will determine if other sites need to be excavated, including another part of the Tuam site. The (Irish prime minister), Enda Kenny, described the find as \\"truly appalling\\", saying \\"the babies of single mothers involved had been treated like some kind of sub-species.\\" Speaking on the find in Dáil Éireann, in response to requests to widen the terms of reference of the Commission, he described the Mother and Baby Home as \\"a chamber of horrors.\\" In the same debate, AAA-PBP T.D. Bríd Smith called for the Bon Secours order of nuns to be disbanded. She said \\"its hospital empire, the biggest private hospital group in the [Irish] State, was built on the bones of the dead Tuam babies.\\" Smith said \\"everyone was not responsible for what happened in Tuam. It was paid for by the State, which knew exactly what was going on, and there were 'headage payments' of up to $3,000 for each child sent to the United States.\\" The Roman Catholic Archbishop of Tuam, Michael Neary, said that he was horrified by the confirmation that significant quantities of human remains were buried on the site. He said he had been \\"greatly shocked to learn of the scale of the practice during the time in which the Bon Secours ran the mother and baby home in Tuam.\\" The Irish Roman Catholic Bishops' Conference apologised for the hurt caused by its part in the system, which they said also involved adoptions. They said that \\"the appalling story of life, death and adoptions related to the Mother and Baby Homes has shocked everyone in Ireland and beyond.\\" The President of Ireland, Michael D. Higgins, said \\"there are dark shadows that hang over our meeting, shadows that require us all to summon up yet again a light that might dispel the darkness to which so many women and their children were condemned, and the questions left unanswered as we moved on.\\" President Higgins described Catherine Corless' work as \\"another necessary step in blowing open the locked doors of a hidden Ireland.\\" =Grove Hospital= Some Tuam residents also called for an investigation into the town's Grove Hospital, which had also been run by the Bon Secours order. Several people stated that their children or siblings had been buried on the site between the 1950s and the late 1970s, although the order denied that there was a graveyard on the site. The Galway County Council required an archaeologist to monitor excavation work in order to preserve any remains which may be buried there.

Biography  Maclet was born the son of a gardener and a laundress at Lihons in the Santerre region in Picardy. His family was poor and he began work very young as an assistant to his father. Picardy is renowned for its roses, and Maclet used to say that he was born among cabbages and roses. His artistic talent became evident very early. His father was also the sexton of the local parish church, where Maclet became a choirboy. The parish priest, Father Delval, was also an amateur painter, and often on fine Sundays he took the boy out to sketch and paint in the countryside. The artist Puvis de Chavannes found the same scenes a source of inspiration, and on an April Sunday in 1892 happened to see some of the 12-year-old boy's work. The artist was so impressed that he asked Maclet's father to allow his son to study with him, but the father refused. In spite of paternal opposition, a few years later Maclet gave up gardening for art and moved to Montmartre, where while painting he supported himself with a variety of casual work (varnishing iron bedsteads, decorating the floats for the gala nights at the Moulin Rouge, washed dishes or opening oysters in restaurants). For several months he served as a cook on board a ship sailing from Marseilles to Indochina. When he finally returned to Paris, he painted dolls in crinolines and exhibited them at the Salon des Humoristes. But in spite of all these occupations, he found time to paint. When Maclet arrived in Montmartre, much of the country charm of the area still existed and he put it on canvas, even before Utrillo did so. Biographers have rather tended to pass over in silence the services Maclet rendered to Utrillo. Maclet knew practically all the future great painters of his time, Utrillo among them, and it is certain that he helped him, though his own reluctance to have people write about him may account for the fact that it is known only through oblique remarks in the records of the time. Maclet painted the Lapin Agile, the Moulin de la Galette, and the Maison de Mimi Pinson several years before Utrillo painted them. He painted most often in winter in this period, skilfully suggesting snow by leaving bare white spaces in his canvas or paper. In a short time Maclet won a circle of sincere admirers. The art dealer Dosbourg bought his work, which gave him a fairly reliable source of income and enabled him to devote more time than ever to his painting. From Montmartre he launched out into the suburbs of Paris, painting them with the same affection with which he treated the scenes of Montmartre. When war broke out in 1914, Maclet served as a medical attendant in a temporary hospital run by the Little Sisters of the Poor. That allowed him to spend his periods of leave back in Montmartre, where he stayed at the Lapin Agile thanks to the hospitality of his friend Père Frédé. Maclet slept in the cabaret hall and paid for his food by washing dishes and polishing the copper pots. While on one of these periods of leave, he painted two small pictures of the Sacré- Coeur and the Moulin de la Galette which he sold to a M. Deibler, who combined his profession of official executioner with a love of the fine arts. Francis Carco, the painter and poet, was also an admirer of his work and became a patron. When the war ended in 1918, Maclet returned to Montmartre. Carco, feeling that the painter needed to widen his horizons, sent him to stay in Dieppe, and the sea coast soon featured in Maclet's paintings. In the following year he came back to Montmartre and to his former subjects. Montmartre was now changing: new apartment buildings were going up, taking the place of the green spaces, and under a huge reconstruction the picturesqueness of the Ourcq Canal was soon to disappear, as were the laundry boats on the Seine. Maclet captured these things in his canvases. His views of Paris were now earning him increasing recognition and success. Besides Carco, he found great supporters in the famous writer Colette and the American art dealer Hugo Perlsall, who regarded him as the equal of other great painters of the period. Max Jacob wrote about him. Famous dealers of the time, such as Pierre Menant and Matho Kleimann-Boch, hung Maclet's work beside the paintings of Van Gogh and Picasso in their galleries. In 1923 Maclet entered into a contract with a wealthy Austrian manufacturer, Baron von Frey, a condition of which was that he should leave Paris for the south of France, as the Baron sensed that Maclet would know how to handle the brilliant light and intense colors of the Midi. The Baron's judgment was vindicated only a few hours after Maclet's arrival in Arles, when the son of an old and famous friend of Van Gogh's said to him, \\"Not since Van Gogh have I seen a painter use such pure color as you do.\\" Maclet stayed in the region from 1924 to 1928. He painted in Orange, Vaison- la-Romaine, La Ciotat, Cassis, Golfe-Juan, Antibes, Cagnes, Saint-Paul-de- Vence, Villefranche, Nice, Menton, and (in Italy) San Remo, sending back to Frey glowing landscapes and glorious floral still lifes. Von Frey reserved for himself almost the total output of this period and sent most of the paintings to America, where wealthy collectors vied to buy them at high prices. Many magazines devoted articles to Maclet, and an exhibition of his work was presented in Paris in 1928. Frey also had the satisfaction of seeing paintings by Maclet purchased by important museums in Lyons, Grenoble, and Monte Carlo. At the end of 1928, Maclet went to paint in Corsica. He spent 1929 and 1930 in Brittany and then went back to his native Picardy to paint. In the middle of 1933 he suffered the onset of a serious mental illness, from which he never entirely recovered, and was institutionalised for several months. After 1935 he resumed his studies of Paris and in 1945 presented a large exhibition of his work under the title Autour du Moulin (\\"Around the Moulin\\") which elicited from André Warnod the following glowing tribute: \\"What a happy spectacle to see Maclet paint. He begins by covering the top of his canvas with paint, the sky, the clouds. Then he attacks the chimneys and then the roofs, and then, floor by floor, he arrives at the street level of the houses... Under his brush, all becomes miraculously organized; he places the figures where they should be, and when he has painted the last paving block at the very bottom of the canvas, then he signs it. And the painting is finished; a happy painting expressing the joy of living.\\" In 1957 a Parisian gallery organized a retrospective exhibition of Maclet's work, and the solid rise in the prices of his paintings dates from that retrospective exhibition. When he made sporadic visits to Paris during his years in the south of France, the painters of Montmartre and Montparnasse considered him a painter on the rise; the canvases he had produced while he was in the south of France showed that the peasant from Picardy had become a master. But the general public in France did not grasp his importance and value until 1957. Five years of life remained to the painter, years beautifully described by Marcel Guicheteau and Jean Cottel in these words: \\"Maclet had returned to his first loves, to his first poems; but it was with all his experience, all his wisdom that the old man now bent over the familiar motifs; his minor song had become a song full of light. In the evening of his life he could repeat himself without copying himself; explain himself without humiliating himself; remember himself without destroying himself. He had brought his work to such a degree of perfection that each painting from then on justified itself by references to earlier work and conferred, in a sense, a retroactive value on those works of a far-off past. The artist had reached the state wherein his work soundly established, across the years, its various pictorial values like echoes answering each other at intervals of ten, fifteen, twenty years, all singing the same harmony.\\" He died in the Lariboisière Hospital in Paris on 23 April 1962 and is buried in the cemetery at Lihons next to his parents.

It carried minerals from numerous iron ore mines along its route to the River Tees for shipment to Tyneside and elsewhere. The line was jointly proposed by the West Hartlepool Harbour and Railway (WHH&R;), who provided half its capital, together with various landowners. The WHH&R; lay on the north bank of the Tees, to which it had a cross-river connection via a jetty at Normanby. The Cleveland Railway was built as a freight railway and provided no passenger services during its brief existence as an independently owned railway. It was built in a number of stages, bypassing the centre of Guisborough, and opened in November 1861. Its construction was repeatedly held up by disputes with its main rival, the Stockton and Darlington Railway, which attempted unsuccessfully to use all means at its disposal to maintain its rail monopoly south of the Tees. However, the Cleveland Railway remained independent only until 1865, when the company and its rivals were bought out by the North Eastern Railway (NER). The new management linked the line with an existing coastal railway via Saltburn, running north of the Eston Hills, and closed the line west of Guisborough in 1873 after only twelve years of service, though part of the line continued in service until 1966 as a freight route for a brickworks and carried passengers to Eston between 1902 and 1929. The NER constructed four passenger stations at the eastern end of the line in the 1870s.K. Hoole, Jack Simmons. Rail 150: the Stockton & Darlington Railway and what followed, pp. 33–34. Taylor & Francis, 1975. These were closed between 1958–1964 along with the section of the line from Guisborough to Brotton, but the easternmost part of the line is still in use today as a mineral railway. History =Origins of the line= Map of the Cleveland Railway and its connections, 1863. The West Hartlepool Harbour and Railway ran north of the Tees, with a river connection to the Cleveland Railway south of the river. The construction of the line was prompted by the need of mine owners around Guisborough and East Cleveland to transport their iron ore to the River Tees. Guisborough was already served by the Middlesbrough and Guisborough Railway (M&GR;), a subsidiary of the Stockton and Darlington (S&D;), which had built a line (opened in 1854) running along the south of the valley in which Guisborough sits. However, the line was an inconveniently long distance from the lucrative iron ore mines in the north of the valley, along the south flank of the Eston Hills, and provided no connection at all for mines east of Guisborough. The M&GR; had been built by a group of industrialists based in Stockton and Darlington who used it to service their own mines, deliberately avoiding the estates of their rivals. It only provided a minimal passenger service to Middlesbrough – one train a day each way – and the line had originally not even been planned to have a passenger station in Guisborough. The M&GR; was unpopular with local people and mine owners who saw it as a would-be monopolist that served narrow commercial interests rather than the wider public good. During Parliamentary discussions into the Cleveland Railway's proposed route, a Select Committee of the House of Commons was told that the M&GR; was \\"unwilling to give facility for people carrying traffic not connected with the furnaces with which they are connected.\\" The M&GR;'s attitude aroused strong local resentment. When one of those testifying to the Select Committee was asked what the local landowners would think of a new railway independent of the S&D;, he replied that \\"they would all jump at having such a proposal made to them.\\"B.J.D. Harrison, G. Dixon (eds.) Guisborough Before 1900, p. 199. G. Dixon, 1981. The West Hartlepool Harbour and Railway (WHH&R;) and a number of landowners struck an agreement to construct a line from the Tees at Cargo Fleet via Normanby, Upsall and Guisborough to Skinningrove, with connecting links and branches to Staithes and Skelton-in-Cleveland. The line would connect to the WHH&R;'s own route north of the river via a crossing of the Tees. Several local landowners through which the proposed line ran were key to the scheme – Captain Thomas Chaloner of Guisborough, J.T. Wharton of Skelton Castle, Anthony Lax Maynard of Skinningrove and Ralph Ward Jackson of Greatham Hall, Normanby. Ward Jackson, who was the chairman of the WHH&R;, was the driving force behind the project and envisaged making West Hartlepool into the industrial heart of Teesside.Harrison & Dixon, p. 198 The construction of the line was strongly opposed by the S&D;, which put forward a rival proposal that led to a Parliamentary enquiry. The two companies each had part of their schemes accepted and part rejected. The Ward Jackson group was allowed to build a railway east from Guisborough to Skinningrove with a branch at Slapewath to reach the mine at Skelton. They were not permitted to build their own separate line to Middlesbrough and had to rely instead on the M&GR; for their connection to the Tees. The S&D; was allowed to build an extension from Redcar to Saltburn but was not allowed to build a new bridge across the Tees. An Act permitting the construction of the railway was passed in July 1858. The company was capitalised with £120,000, half of which came from the WHH&R;, with Ward Jackson as its first chairman.Harrison & Dixon, pp. 200–201 =Extension of the line to Normanby= Waterfall Viaduct at Slapewath – a surviving remnant of the Cleveland Railway's route between Brotton and Guisborough The route of the Cleveland Railway, as initially built Ward Jackson continued to seek independence from the M&GR; and put forward a fresh proposal in 1859 to extend the line from Guisborough to the Tees at Cargo Fleet, so that the increasing demand for iron ore shipments to Tyneside could more easily be met. The S&D; again opposed it. Although the House of Commons unanimously approved the Cleveland Extension Bill, it was rejected by the House of Lords. However, this left the door open for a private railway on the lands owned by Ward Jackson and his supporters. They began to construct it in 1860 under the auspices of the \\"Upsall, Normanby and Ormesby Railway\\". Once again, the S&D; opposed it, this time on the grounds that the new line had to cross the S&D;'s Redcar branch line, but it eventually gave permission for the construction of a bridge to cross its line.Harrison & Dixon, pp. 201–202 A more serious problem was raised by the need to construct a new river crossing at the end of the line in Normanby. The WHH&R; had sought to build a bridge across the Tees at that point but had been blocked by the Tees Conservancy Commission, at the prompting of the S&D.; The WHH&R; instead resolved to build a jetty that would enable loaded iron ore wagons to be transported across the river on barges.Kirby, Maurice W. The Origins of Railway Enterprise: The Stockton and Darlington Railway 1821–1863, p. 167. Cambridge University Press, 2002. The S&D; used its influence with the Commissioners to stop the jetty as well. They undertook legal action in the Court of Chancery to stop it but construction proceeded regardless. The dispute led to violent clashes between the two sides on 10 September 1860 in an event dubbed the \\"Battle of the Tees\\", when Tees Conservancy barges sent to blockade the jetty were forcibly removed by West Hartlepool steam tugs. The police had to intervene to restore order. The WHH&R; was the clear winner of the confrontation and was able to complete its jetty.Harrison & Dixon, p. 203 The line was substantially completed by the spring of 1861. It consisted of two linked private railways running through the estates of Ward Jackson and Captain Chaloner of Guisborough. A bridge was constructed in March 1861 to carry Chaloner's section of the line over the M&GR; just outside Guisborough station, bypassing the town to connect with the Cleveland Railway's existing eastbound line to Skinningrove. A fresh Act of Parliament, the Cleveland Railway Act, was passed in July 1861 to authorise the Cleveland Railway Company to operate the new line. Although the S&D; was still vehemently opposed, Parliament had by now tired of the disputes between the companies and passed the Act over the objections of the S&D.;Harrison & Dixon, pp. 204–205 The line was opened on 23 November 1861, with a total length of running from Skelton Mine to Normanby Jetty. Crossing the gorge at Slapewath on the eight-arched Waterfall Viaduct, which still stands today, it skirted the south-west of Guisborough and crossed Chapel Beck on wooden viaducts. From there it ran on a nearly straight embankment across the fields west of Guisborough before curving northwards to Normanby through a gap in the Eston Hills. Branch lines and tramways connected the line to a number of mines along its route. It had no passenger stations and did not offer any passenger services, despite the poor connections from Guisborough that had caused so much discontent with the M&GR.; =Mergers, onward connections and closures= Steam train on the Cleveland Railway at Brotton, April 1961 Financial irregularities at the WHH&R; led in 1862 to the company suffering severe financial difficulties, resulting in the resignation of Ward Jackson from the boards of the WHH&R; and the Cleveland Railway. Parliament refused to authorise further contributions from the WHH&R; to the Cleveland Railway. Nonetheless, funds were raised to construct new extensions via Boosbeck and Loftus. The Cleveland Railway, the M&GR; and the S&D; were all taken over in 1865 by the North Eastern Railway (NER). The new management authorised the construction of a link from Saltburn (which the S&D; had reached in 1861) via Skelton to the Cleveland Railway's route at Brotton, forking south to reach Guisborough. This connection, completed in 1872, provided a new connection between Teesside and the East Cleveland mines, running north of the Eston Hills. Further capacity was provided by doubling the tracks on the line running east of Guisborough. This made the former Cleveland Railway's line west of Guisborough redundant and it was closed in 1873 after only twelve years of service, though the parallel MG&R; line to Middlesbrough remained open for a further 90 years.Harrison & Dixon, pp. 205–206 Although the old Cleveland Railway had not provided any passenger services, during the 1870s the NER built a number of stations at the eastern end of the line. Passenger services began from Brotton, Skinningrove and Loftus in 1875, plus Boosbeck in 1878. The tortuous history of the Cleveland Railway had a lasting effect on the provision of rail services to Guisborough. It did not at any time offer a passenger service to the town, leaving that instead to the M&GR;, which provided only a single-platform station at the end of its line into the town. This line was bypassed by the Cleveland Railway en route to Skinningrove. After the westbound Cleveland Railway was closed, the eastbound line was joined with the M&GR; line, leaving Guisborough railway station at the end of a spur. Trains thus had to reverse out of the station before continuing along the line to Loftus. It remained this way until the line was closed in 1964. Cleveland Railway today The east end of the Cleveland Railway, from Loftus to Brotton plus the connection to the Tees Valley Line west of Saltburn, is still in use as a mineral railway serving Boulby Mine. There are no passenger services. The short connection from the Tees Valley Line to Normanby Jetty survived until 1966 as the Normanby Branch of the Tees Valley Line, serving the Normanby brickworks and Eston railway station. It is now a public footpath, the South Bank Walkway, which links Flatts Lane Country Park to South Bank. The middle section of the line from Normanby to Guisborough is in private ownership or has been built on, though the former railway's embankment can still be clearly seen running alongside the A171 Middlesbrough Road. The section from Guisborough to Slapewath has been converted into a public footpath, the Guisborough Branch Walkway.

She was the first frigate to be built at Chatham (the term 'frigate' during this period referred to a vessel designed for fast sailing, with a low superstructure, rather than a role which did not develop until the following century). Service history Her first commission was in the Irish Sea where she served from 1647 to 1650. She took part in the First Anglo-Dutch War from 1652-4 and was engaged in the naval battles of Dungeness, Portland, the Gabbard, and Texel. From June 1655 to July 1656, Dragon served in the Mediterranean Fleet, and then in the English Channel. In the Second Anglo- Dutch War, she took part in the Battle of Lowestoft and then in the Four Days' Battle. Following the end of the War, she is known to served in the Mediterranean once more, from 1669-1672. In May 1672 she took part in an engagement with Algerine pirates. The Third Anglo-Dutch War saw Dragon back in home waters, engaging two Dutch ships off Bury Head at some time during this period. In 1674-7 1682-7, and 1686-9 she is again known to have been in the Mediterranean, on the last occasion serving as flagship for Henry Killigrew. By 1677 her armament had been increased to 46 guns. In 1690, during the Nine Years' War, Dragon was rebuilt at Deptford Dockyard by Fisher Harding as a 46-gun fourth rate ship of the line. In 1691 and 1692 she is recorded in the Irish Sea and the Channel, and went to the West Indies in 1693. On 12 May 1694 she captured the French ship Diligente. Later in the Nine Years' War, she served in the Mediterranean (1696) and at Dunkirk (1697). The War of the Spanish Succession also involved Dragon, the ship seeing action in 1702 as part of a fleet under Cloudesley Shovell, then serving in the Channel Fleet from 1703-6. She was rebuilt for a second time in 1707 at the Nelson Dock as a fourth rate of 46-54 guns. She went on to serve on the Dutch Coast in 1708, and Newfoundland in 1709. Wreck Dragon was wrecked on 15 March 1712 on Les Casquets, rocks to the west of Alderney.

It is a Grade I listed building. History The original manor house was commissioned by Sir Henry Swinnerton early in the 14th century. In 1547 the marriage of Margaret Swynnerton to Henry Vernon of Sudbury, Derbyshire took place: both were members of an important recusant families. The house and estate were inherited by Margaret in 1562, on the death of her father Humphrey Swynnerton, the deed being dated 8 May 1564, and incorporated into the Vernon estates on her death in 1587. The house was altered, in early Georgian style, in the early 1720s by Henry Vernon, High Sheriff of Staffordshire. It was substantially extended in the early 1830s, when a third storey was added to the main building, skilfully replicating the Georgian design and raising the 1720s' pediment with its coat of arms to the higher level; the moat was partly filled in and a lower extension created at the rear of the main house for kitchens and service facilities. The main block has giant corner pilasters capped by urns. The Vernon family erected an unusual hexagonal tower in the grounds, which they dedicated to the memory of Admiral Edward Vernon and his capture of Portobello, Panama from the Spanish in 1739. The monument is Grade II listed. The family sold the estate to the nuns of the Order of St Joseph of Bordeaux for use as a convent in 1955. Between 1986 and 1999 it was occupied by Tarmac plc as a corporate headquarters. It is now a commercial office and business centre.

Career George Janssen started his career as a lawyer and also built an academic career, as from 1928 he was a professor in the Law Faculty of the Free University of Brussels. His father, Camille Janssen, had been the Governor-General of the Congo Free State. George also worked as an administrator at the Mutuelle Solvay (1928) and the Société Belge de Banque (1932). When in 1935 the Banking Commission was established, he was appointed as its president. Georges Janssen was appointed as a director of the NBB on 13 October 1937 and one week later became its vice-governor. On the death of Louis Franck, he was appointed governor of the bank on 13 January 1938. He was criticised for combining the positions of governor of the NBB and president of the Banking Commission, which made him resign in September 1938 from the Banking Commission. In 1938 heavily speculative attacks were launched against the belgian franc, which he had to ward off in order to protect the Belgian currency. He succeeded in establishing the leadership of the National Bank in monetary matters. During his term as governor, arrangements were made to safeguard the Belgian gold reserves by transferring them abroad before the outbreak of World War II. When the war broke out in May 1940, he followed the Belgian government to France but returned to Belgium, with the approval of Camille Gutt, after the Franco-German armistice in June 1940. Although he resumed his post as governor of the National Bank, he almost immediately came into conflict with the Nazis who occupied Belgium. The conflict centered on such matters as payment for the occupation costs, the circulation of banknotes and the Bank’s gold, which had been transferred to the United Kingdom. In addition, he also came into conflict on the situation of the Université Libre de Bruxelles. The mounting conflicts with the occupying forces and his deteriorating health would lead to his death on 9 June 1941.

Opening narration Plot A vacationing leprechaun is captured by three boys (Buddy, JP, Richie) who take him to their clubhouse. The leprechaun is annoyed to have his vacation disturbed and tells them that they may have one wish each. They flip a coin to see who gets the first wish. Buddy wins the coin toss and makes a wish for X-ray vision. The next morning, Buddy tries his new power and begins to see beneath the local girls' clothing but then finds out that he is unable to control the intensity of his powers. He sees internal organs and skulls instead of just underneath their clothing. Seeing that Buddy has learned his lesson, the leprechaun reverses the wish. JP makes his wish, and wishes that his parents and friends do \\"exactly what they tell them to do.\\" However, JP's wish is too literal, and the boys find that they must tell their parents to make every single step in exact detail. This is shown when JP tells his mother to cook them a frozen pizza, only to have to guide his mom step by step on every aspect of preparation. Seeing as how the wish was taken too literally, it is also reversed. After seeing what happened to his friends, Richie makes the third and final wish and claims that his will not have the same literal mistakes of Buddy and J.P.'s. He asks for a fast car, a \\"really hot\\" car, unlimited gasoline, and a driver with a mind of his own. They find a limo and driver waiting (and a vanity license plate: \\"Third Wish\\"). While riding in the limo, the driver never slows down and ignores street signs and crosswalks. Soon the police try to stop them for speeding, and the boys tell the driver to pull over. However, the driver shows that he has \\"a mind of his own\\" and tries to outrace the police. The limo is finally forced to stop by road construction and a vehicle coming the other direction. However, when the policeman approaches the driver, he is surprised to see an empty seat and the boys learn the limo was indeed \\"hot\\" as in \\"stolen.\\" The boys are taken into custody for auto theft, and the leprechaun appears at the police station. He reverses the third wish and the police now have no knowledge of their crime. The leprechaun says he enjoyed his time with the boys and he tells them to take care of themselves. When the arresting officer asks why the boys are now here, they simply reply they wanted to say hello and to support their local police. Glad that they learned their lessons, the boys gladly go home.

The term 'frigate' during the period of this ship referred to a method of construction, rather than a role which did not develop until the following century. As completed she was established with a peacetime 32 guns, but by 1652 carried 38 guns as a wartime establishment. She was enlarged during her life and by the 1660s was measured at 556 tons. Phoenix was captured by the Dutch ship Eendracht off Elba in the Mediterranean during the Battle of Elba, 28-8-1652 (O.S.)/6-9-1652 (N.S.), an action between the English squadron commanded by Richard Badiley and a Dutch squadron under Jan van Galen. She was retaken on 20 November 1652 by an attack by English small boats at Leghorn. She was finally wrecked on 3 December 1664 during a storm in Gibraltar Bay while attempting to pass through the Straits of Gibraltar.

It has a population of 600 (2008). It lies in the historical region of Cieszyn Silesia.  History  The beginnings of the village are connected with a folwark Fröhlichhof founded here by Teschener Kammer around 1698.W. Kiełkowski, 2009, p. 60. The settlement that emerged to accommodate its workers grew to become a small but separate village. Politically it belonged to the Duchy of Teschen, a fee of the Kingdom of Bohemia and also a part of the Habsburg Monarchy. After Revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire a modern municipal division was introduced in the re- established Austrian Silesia. The village as a municipality was subscribed to the political district of Bielsko and the legal district of Strumień. According to the censuses conducted in 1880, 1890, 1900 and 1910 the population of the municipality grew from 258 in 1880 to 294 in 1910 with a majority being native Polish-speakers (least 89.1 in 1900, most 96.5 in 1880) followed by a small German-speaking minority (at most 31 or 10.6% in 1900), in terms of religion in 1910 majority were Roman Catholics (267 or 90.8%), followed by Protestants (18 or 6.1%) and Jews (9 or 3.1%). The village was also traditionally inhabited by Cieszyn Vlachs, speaking Cieszyn Silesian dialect. After World War I, fall of Austria-Hungary, Polish–Czechoslovak War and the division of Cieszyn Silesia in 1920, it became a part of Poland. It was then annexed by Nazi Germany at the beginning of World War II. After the war it was restored to Poland.

His works were exhibited at Ca' Pesaro between 1912 and 1920 and at the International Exposition of Paris (1937). Life He was born in Pavia di Udine of Friuli origins on his father's side and Carnia origins on his mother's side. He artistically grew up in Venice. Starting from the representation of a living room world of liberty taste, also through the irony of caricature, he was sensible to the avant-garde movements of the beginning of the twentieth century, from Futurism to Expressionism, from the movement of Pont-Aven to the Secessions in Vienna and Munich. He artistically formed in the unrepeatable melting pot of styles and newness of the Barbantini's Ca' Pesaro of the 1910s. Among his friends were Boccioni, Gino Rossi, Arturo Martini, Mauroner, Pellis, and Pomi. His career was interrupted in 1919 when, at the age of 32 years, he decided to stop painting. He got married and had six children, and made his living by managing his properties. He was Mayor of Oderzo from 1925 to 1927. He went back to painting in 1931 for personal pleasure and finally stopped in 1937. When he died in Venice in 1955, his early paintings were found in a locked chest. Only by chance his son Angelo found his name in a list of exhibitors of Ca' Pesaro and in 1992 Luigi De Guidici started to be studied.

The Mayor of Winchester thus stands second only to the Lord Mayor of the City of London in the order of precedence of civic heads. Winchester is one of just five local authorities in England to have an official residence for its Mayor. Abbey House was built in about 1700 and sited in the Abbey Gardens just off The Broadway in Winchester. It was acquired by the City Council in 1889. The house stands on the site of a monastic establishment known as Nunnaminster and later as St Mary's Abbey, which was founded around AD900 by Alfred's Queen Ealhswith. The Abbey survived until the late 1530s when it was formally surrendered to the Crown as part of the Dissolution of the Monasteries. History The exact date of the conferment of full mayoral rights is not known, since the original charter cannot be traced. When London petitioned the King for a grant of mayoralty in 1190, Winchester was not cited as precedent (as were certain French cities), but by 1200 there was reference to the mayoralty as an existing office. It is, therefore, safe to say that the office dates back to the 1190s. The incumbent for 2019-20 is described as the town's 820th mayor. The earliest Mayors sometimes held the office for several years in succession, but from the 13th century to the present day, the Mayor has been chosen annually. Until the 16th century, the Mayor-elect was required to travel to Westminster to receive the royal assent.

Background The Continuation War began in the summer of 1941. The Finns, who had operated naval units on Lake Ladoga before World War II, began reestablishing a flotilla on the lake as soon as their troops reached its shores early on in the war. The headquarters was formed in Läskelä on 2 August 1941 and by 6 August, 150 motorboats, two tugs (used as minelayers) and four steam ferries had been transferred there. The tugs and ferries were equipped with 47 mm guns and machine guns. The Finns also established a number of coastal batteries on the shores and islands of Lake Ladoga. The only \\"true\\" Finnish warship on Lake Ladoga at that time was the obsolete ex-motor torpedo boat Sisu. As the Finnish land forces advanced, new headquarters were established in the captured towns along the shores of Ladoga. The Ladoga flotilla's headquarters was eventually moved to Sortavala and the harbour at Lahdenpohja became its primary base of operations. Formation Lieutenant- colonel Fritz Siebel of the Luftwaffe and Colonel Eino Järvinen of the Finnish Army. Already during the spring Finnish Lieutenant General Paavo Talvela and Colonel Järvinen who was commanding the Laatokka Coastal Brigade came up with an idea that the boat traffic providing supplies to the Leningrad needed to be disrupted. Talvela then presented this idea to the Germans on his own behalf going past both Finnish Navy HQ and General HQ. Germans responded positively to the proposition and informed the slightly surprised Finns—who apart from Talvela had very little knowledge of the proposition—that transport of the equipment for the Ladoga operation was already arranged. Both the Germans and Italians sent naval units to Lake Ladoga to assist the Finns with coastal defence of the lake and to enforce the ongoing siege of Leningrad. A combined Finnish-German-Italian unit, the Laivasto-osasto K (LOs.K., Naval Detachment K) was formed on 17 May 1942, consisting of the four Italian MAS boats, four German KM minelayers and the Finnish motor torpedo boat Sisu. The German and Italian vessels were grouped into two units under Finnish command. First to arrive was the Italian unit XII Squadriglia MAS on 22 June, consisting of four MAS torpedo boats (MAS 526, 527, 528, and 529). Five days later, four German KM-minelayers also arrived. However, the German minelayers suffered from inexperienced crews and unreliable engines and it took until 10 August before all German boats were repaired and deemed operational. Also operating on the lake were the Finnish Ladoga Naval Detachment, composed mainly of fishing vessels and small motor boats, and the German Eastern Ferry Unit, a Luftwaffe formation of armed Siebel ferries. Operations The Italian torpedo boat MAS 528 on Lake Ladoga in June 1942, during the Siege of Leningrad Naval Detachment K's primary task was harassing Soviet supply lines to Leningrad on southern Ladoga, where British and American food and munitions were delivered to the besieged residents of Leningrad. The unit also staged attacks on enemy bases and conducted limited landing operations on the shores of Lake Ladoga.Finland and Siege of Leningrad 1941–1944. By Dr. Nikolai Baryshnikov. Russian: \\"Блокада Ленинграда и Финляндия 1941–44\\" Институт Йохана Бекмана. 2003. Russian fragment: Some smaller Soviet patrol boats and several barges delivering food to besieged Leningrad were attacked and sunk during 1942 and 1943. EFO also undertook offensive operations on the lake, such as the assault on Sukho island, but this was unsuccessful. The Finnish Ladoga Flotilla also had clashed with the Soviet Ladoga Flotilla, and operated in Lake Ladoga from June 25, 1941, through November 4, 1944.Дважды Краснознаменный Балтийский Флот, Гречанюк Н. М., Дмитриев В. И., Корниенко А. И. и др., М., Воениздат. 1990. с. 195.Доценко В. Д., Флот. Война. Победа. С.-Пб, Судостроение. 1995 с 238 Analysis The operations of the international flotilla were a failure. Torpedoes proved useless in the shallow waters of southern Lake Ladoga, where they frequently struck the bottom. Nor did their magnetic detonators work well against the wooden hulls of Soviet barges and patrol boats. The secondary armament of the MTBs also proved too light to seriously threaten Soviet gunboats. German mineboats turned out to have extremely unreliable engines, keeping them docked in port far longer than they spent on actual operations nor were their influence mines especially useful against mainly wooden hulled Soviet vessels. Dissolving the detachment The MAS leaves Lake Ladoga. Naval Detachment K was dissolved in the winter of 1942/43. The Italian torpedo vessels were relocated from Lake Ladoga to Tallinn at the end of October 1942 and would eventually be absorbed into the Finnish Navy. Likewise, the Germans withdrew most of their vessels, leaving two ferries and four infantry boats which Finns had bought. In January 1943, the Soviet Red Army launched Operation Spark, to open up a land connection to Leningrad and break the siege. Axis forces were pushed back 80 km and the Road of Life no longer had its previous significance. Neither German nor Italian units returned to Lake Ladoga, although smaller Finnish units continued to operate in the lake against the Soviets during 1943 and 1944.

The Rosedale Railway was an goods-only railway line running from Battersby Junction across the heights of the North York Moors in North Yorkshire, England to reach iron ore deposits in the remote hills of the Rosedale valley. It opened in 1861 and closed in 1929.  Overview  The first construction of a recognisable railway along this route was in 1858 when The Ingleby Ironstone & Freestone Mining Company constructed a narrow gauge line to link existing mining operations with the North Yorkshire and Cleveland Railway at Battersby (then known as Ingleby Junction). Because of the difference in height between the junction at Battersby railway station and the moorland location of the workings, a steep 1 in 5 (20%) incline was located at Ingleby, where trucks would be hauled up the slope to a height of above sea level using the weight of descending full wagons. The length of the incline was and the wagons descended at an average speed of which resulted in a journey time of 3 minutes from top to bottom. When the NY&CR; had been absorbed into the NER, the NER decided to convert the line to standard gauge operations and extend the track from the top of the incline to mine workings at Rosedale run by the Rosedale Ironstone Mining Company, whom the NER had interests in. This line opened to the west side of Rosedale on 27 March 1861. Within a few years mining also began on the east side of the valley, and an additional branch line was run from Blakey Junction around the head of the valley to reach the new workings. The workings reached a peak production of over in 1873. The route across the moors was very inhospitable during winter months. During a severe winter of 1916–17 the line was blocked for five weeks.  Closure and legacy Because of increased costs and a fall in the price of iron, the mines closed in 1925. Operations continued for a few years extracting the valuable calcine dust from the slag heaps but traffic on the line finally ceased in 1929. The original kilns at Rosedale West are still visible, whilst the nearby engine shed was dismantled with the stone being used for the construction of the village hall at Hutton-le-Hole, further down the valley. The incline and the trackbed from the incline to Blakey Junction is now a public bridleway, part of which is followed by the Coast to Coast Walk and the Esk Valley Walk.

It has a population of 3,569 (2008). It lies in the historical region of Cieszyn Silesia.  History  The village was founded in late 16th when the area belonged to Skoczów-Strumień state country that was in 1594 purchased back into the Duchy of Teschen. It was first mentioned in 1621 as Mnich. The name most probably was borrowed from the older local fish pond called Mnich Sswczyny or Mnich Sworczyński.W. Kiełkowski, 2009, p. 36. Politically the Duchy of Teschen was then a fee of the Kingdom of Bohemia, which was also a part of the Habsburg Monarchy. After Revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire a modern municipal division was introduced in the re- established Austrian Silesia. The village as a municipality was subscribed to the political district of Bielsko and the legal district of Strumień. According to the censuses conducted in 1880, 1890, 1900 and 1910 the population of the municipality grew from 821 in 1880 to 1010 in 1910 with a majority being native Polish-speakers (98.3%-99%) accompanied by a small German-speaking minority (at most 10 or 1.2% in 1880) and Czech-speaking (at most 40 or 1.1% in 1890), in terms of religion in 1910 majority were Roman Catholics (93.3%), followed by Protestants (6%), Jews (7 people) and 1 person adhering to yet another faith. The village was also traditionally inhabited by Cieszyn Vlachs, speaking Cieszyn Silesian dialect. After World War I, fall of Austria-Hungary, Polish–Czechoslovak War and the division of Cieszyn Silesia in 1920, it became a part of Poland. It was then annexed by Nazi Germany at the beginning of World War II. After the war it was restored to Poland.

Playbox provide training for children and young people aged 3-25 in various different areas, including theatre training, musical theatre, circus, voice and Shakespeare. Based at their purpose built theatre in Warwick, The Dream Factory, Playbox also run training sessions at various outlying centres including Leamington, Stratford-upon-Avon, Kenilworth, Solihull and Banbury. As well as providing training, Playbox also put on a number of productions throughout the year at The Dream Factory, in addition to international tours.  History  The company was founded in 1986 by Mary King, the current Executive Director of Playbox Theatre. The company began life in a hotel room in 1986. That year they invited English theatre director Michael Bogdanov to be their patron and he accepted. By 1988 the company were performing in two theatres in Warwick and Kenilworth and a year later they added Balsall Common to their schedule. In 1989 Stewart McGill, husband of Mary King, joined Playbox as a director. In 1991 and 1992, Stratford upon Avon, Rugby, and Leamington Spa added to the list. In 1993 the company produced its first work for national television. In 1994 Playbox reached out further to Coventry and have since moved into buildings in Bristol and York. Today, Playbox Theatre are running sessions in Warwick, Leamington, Stratford- upon-Avon, Kenilworth, Solihull and Banbury. In 1999, Playbox's own theatre, The Dream Factory, opened in Warwick following a £2.7 million grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund. The theatre has a varying capacity as it is essentially a black box theatre but for safety the maximum is 250. There are 184 seats in the main auditorium, although these are flexible and can be altered for performances on a thrust stage, or in the round.  On tour  The company has performed throughout the country and further afield. In 1989 they played at the regionally well known Warwick Arts Centre and the world famous Edinburgh Festival. After Kraków City Council invited them to their city the company visited them. A year later a tour of the United States was staged. Further tours have been taken to these locations, as well as one to Germany, in the years since. Playbox has also taken Treasure Island to Cannizaro Park festival, playing on the same stage as Amy Winehouse. Playbox also added Tokyo to their resume in 2007. They visit Santa Monica every two years, in 2008 taking a tour of 'Monkey'.

He describes himself as a brother of the Order of Hermits of St. Augustine, and a lector in sacred theology in the Province of Saxony. From his description of facts it appears that Vrie must have been an eyewitness to the events he records. The history is brought down to the election and consecration of Pope Martin V, 21 Nov., 1417. Vrie was still living in the sumer of 1425, when a general chapter of his order at Rome authorized the republication of his work. Vrie's work is modelled on the De consolatione philosophiæ of Boethius; this also is its original title. It presents a picture of the facts and disorders of the time, pointing out their source, and the remedy under the form of a series of dialogues in prose and metre between Christ and the Church Militant. The \\"De consolatione\\" of Vrie was printed in Cologne in 1484 with the works of Jean Gerson (fourth volume), but was not repeated in the Strasbourg edition of Gerson in 1494. It was printed again with a short life of the author in von der-Hardt (see below).

It has a population of 1,005 (2008). It lies in the historical region of Cieszyn Silesia. The name is of topographic origin and literally means [a place] behind a bór (bór is a Polish name for temperate coniferous forest). In the 17th century it was known as Podpierściec (see a nearby village of Pierściec).  History  It was first mentioned in a written document in 1574. Originally called Podpierściec as it lay close to Pierściec.W. Kiełkowski, 2009, p. 38. Politically the village belonged then to the Duchy of Teschen, a fee of the Kingdom of Bohemia, which after 1526 became part of the Habsburg Monarchy. After Revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire a modern municipal division was introduced in the re-established Austrian Silesia. The village as a municipality was subscribed to the political district of Bielsko and the legal district of Strumień. According to the censuses conducted in 1880, 1890, 1900 and 1910 the population of the municipality grew from 410 in 1880 to 450 in 1910 with a majority being native Polish-speakers (between 95.5%-99.6%) accompanied by a small German-speaking minority (at most 19 or 4.5% in 1890), in terms of religion in 1910 majority were Roman Catholics (64.3%), followed Protestants (35%) and 4 Jews. The village was also traditionally inhabited by Cieszyn Vlachs, speaking Cieszyn Silesian dialect. After World War I, fall of Austria-Hungary, Polish–Czechoslovak War and the division of Cieszyn Silesia in 1920, it became a part of Poland. It was then annexed by Nazi Germany at the beginning of World War II. After the war it was restored to Poland.

He was a colonel in the Royal Irish Rifles, seeing action on the Western Front the First World War and in Karelia where he raised and led a local regiment during the Allied Intervention North Russia Russia. In Belfast he worked as a textile designer. Early years Woods was educated at the Royal Belfast Academical Institution and at the Belfast School of Art. For four years he was employed as a textile designer in a firm of linen manufacturer in Belfast. Under age for regular enlistment in the South African War, he joined Baden Powell's South African Constabulary, serving nearly two years before returning to Belfast and his pervious employment. In the Home Rule Crisis he joined the Ulster Volunteers and was involved in the gun- running that armed the force with German munitions. Military career On the outbreak of the First World War he joined the Royal Irish Rifles (RIR) as part of the 36th (Ulster) Division and, during the 1916 Battle of the Somme, was active in the Thiepval Wood section when it suffered heavy losses achieving its objectives. In 1917 Woods led the 9th (West Belfast) Battalion of the RIR until it was amalgamated with 8th Bn to form 8/9th Bn. on 9 August 1917. This leadership included action in the Battle of Messines. In June 1918, he went as part of the Murmansk force involved in the Allied intervention to Russia. Its task was to obstruct the Viena expedition by German-officered White Finn forces threatening East Karelia and the Murmansk-Petrograd railway. Operating out of Kem on the White Sea, he established a Karelian Regiment, supplied and officered by the British. The \\"Irish Karelians\\", as they were known, adopted a regimental badge, designed by Woods and consisting of a green shamrock on an orange field. With this force he was able to push the Germans and Finns established in Uhtua out of White Karelia (Vienan Karjala) in 1918. His success with the Karelians fostered unrealistic hopes of national self- determination which were ultimately unfulfilled, caught as they were between the Finns and Russians. The formation melted away as a transfer to White Russian command was attempted and Woods was evacuated in October 1919 with the rest of the British forces. In 1919-1920 he served with a group of British officers organising the nascent Lithuanian Army, defending it against various German Freikorps and Polish threats. Arguments over their agreed British Army rates of pay led to the group eventually leaving Lithuania. Political career Standing as the Fighting Colonel he was first elected in a by- election held on 2 May 1923 for Belfast West, following the assassination of William Twaddell, the sitting MP. He stood in 1925 in both Belfast West and Belfast South, winning both seats, but opting to sit for Belfast West. Woods campaigned in the Parliament for ex-servicemen and on economic and social issues. As the only MP without party affiliations before the Nationalists took their seats, he operated as a lone opposition voice to the dominant Ulster Unionist Party government. He unsuccessfully contested the 1929 election in Belfast St Anne's. His loss can, in large part, be attributed to the abolition of proportional representation in February 1929, its replacement with a first- past-the-post system and the establishment of new electoral constituencies which divided his support base. Lacking a party machine, he also lost the Westminster election in Belfast South held eight days later. Later life After his political career in Northern Ireland had ended, Woods moved to England in the 1930s and re-married, living in Long Crendon, Buckinghamshire. He was incidentally an employer of William Joyce at this time, but had no direct links with the British Union of Fascists. During the Second World War he fund-raised in Yorkshire for the war effort. =Sources= * Baron, Nick. The King of Karelia: Col P.J. Woods and the British Intervention in North Russia 1918-1919.

He competed in the Motocross World Championships from 1979 to 1997. Martens is notable for winning the 1993 F.I.M. 500cc motocross world championship.Jacky Martens career profile Racing career Born in Lommel, Belgium, Martens' first motocross race was in 1979, and by the mid 1980s he made the breakthrough into Grand Prix motocross, originally on a privately entered Honda, before a switch to the KTM factory racing team, culminating in a best result of second in the 500cc motocross world championship in 1991. For 1992 Martens switched to the Husqvarna factory team, riding the fearsome Husqvarna 610 four-stroke machine. Many felt this was a backward step for Martens, as unlike today, four-stroke machines were seen as slow, bulky and uncompetitive compared to the two-stroke machines. At times Martens had a difficult 1992, but some encouraging results later in the year saw him finish 11th in the series. However, 1993 was a different start. After a steady start to the series at Hawkstone Park, Martens quickly proved himself and his machine, rising to the top of the 500cc world championship standings, with Swede Jorgen Nilsson. The championship was contested until the very final round, where Martens clinched the title to become the first rider to win the premier 500cc class on a four-stroke since Jeff Smith accomplished the feat in 1965.Martens, Albertyn, Tragter take MX titles, Cycle World Magazine, January 1994, Vol. 33, No. 1, 1994 saw Martens once again challenge for the title, his main rival being another Swede, Marcus Hansson. Once again the title was decided on the very final round, but a fall in the final round cost Martens the title, as he narrowly took second overall. 1995 and 1996 were blighted by injury, and Martens final season as a rider was in 1997. By this time, Martens was seen as something of an also-ran, but he managed to upset the form book and produce some impressive results, including a moto win at the British Grand Prix at Hawkstone Park, which was popular with Martens' large contingent of British fans. Post-racing career After retiring, Martens became the team manager for the JM Racing KTM team, helping to guide Sven Breugelmans to the MX3 world championship. He managed the Husqvarna factory racing team in the MX2 class from 2014 to 2019. In 2020. Martens started the JM Honda Racing team to compete in the MXGP class.

Tarquini entered the Society of Jesus on August 27, 1837. Prior to his entrance, Tarquini had published a thesis for his doctorate on canon law: Institutionum juris canonici tabulae synopticae juxta ordinem habitum a Joanne Devote (Rome, 1835). As a professor, Tarquini held the chair of canon law at the Roman College, and he attracted notice by his explanations of sacred scripture at the Gesu. Besides his published works, he contributed many articles to reviews, notably to the Civiltà Cattolica. It is principally as a canonist that he achieved fame. His first work on the law of the Church to bring him into international celebrity was that on the Regium Placet, or Exequatur, for Papal Bulls (Rome, 1851), which was translated into German, Spanish, and French. This treatise has generally been published as an appendix to his main work on canon law: Juris ecclesiastici publici institutiones (Rome, 1862), which has gone through many editions. The work was translated into French (Brussels, 1868). Other works on canon law are his treatise on the French Concordat of 1801 (Rome, 1871), and a disquisition on the Pauline privilege (published posthumously in 1888). Though best known as a canonist, Tarquini was also an archaeologist of no mean repute, especially on matters relating to the ancient Etruscans. His earliest archaeological treatise is Breve commento di antiche iscrizioni appartenenti alla citta di Fermo (1847). He began the Etruscan series of his works specifically with Dichiarazione dell' epigrafe del lampadario di Cortona (1862), which was soon followed by a more general treatise: Dizzertazioni intorno ad alcuni monumenti etruschi (Rome, 1862). The Civilta Cattolica of 1857 and 1858 contains many of Tarquini's articles on Etruscan antiquities, the most noted being: Origini italiche e principalmente etruschi rivelate dei nomi geografici (Ser. 3, Vol. VI); I misteri della lingua etrusca (Vol. VIII); Iscrizioni etrusche in monumenti autofoni (Vol. IX); Di vasi etruschi divinatorii (Vol. X); Iscrizione etrusca di Perugia (Vol. XI); and Sopra il semitismo della lingua etrusca (Ser. 4, Vol. VII). He also wrote an Etruscan grammar and a dictionary of the Etruscan language. Other archaeological treatises are Della iscrizione della cattedra Alessandrina di San Marco (1868), and De L'origine des pheniciens et leur identite avec les Pasteurs qui envahirent l'Egypte (1870). Tarquini was a member of the Roman Pontifical Academy of Archaeology and of the Imperial and Royal Academy of Science of Lucca. He was also president of the historical and archaeological sections of the Accademia dei' Quiriti. He was raised to the cardinalate by Pius IX with the diaconal title of St. Nicholas at the Tullian Prison on 22 Dec., 1873, only a few months before his death.

Dr. Gerson was born in Hamburg. He came from a family of doctors who had been living and working in Hamburg and Altona since the 17th century. His grandfather was the principal of the Jewish hospital in Altona, his father and elder brothers were also medical doctors. After his education at home, he visited the secondary grammar school (Gymnasium) and specialised in the classical languages and natural sciences (especially in botany). He studied from 1805 at the university of Berlin and from 1809 at the university of Göttingen. Here he got his medical doctorate on 7 April 1810. He habilitated in Hamburg in 1811 and then joined the King's German Legion as hospital mate. Military career Uniform of Dr.Gerson As soon as 12 August 1811 he was proposed for the position of Assistant Surgeon and received this commission on 6 September 1811 for the 5th Line Battalion, King's German Legion. He saw action in the Peninsula, in Southern France, the Lowlands and at the Battle of Waterloo. A rare eagerness was seen in the assistant surgeon Gerson of this 5th line battalion, who not only stayed in the carree during the fiercest of fighting, dressing with fervour and skill the wounded of his battalion, but also caring for those of the neighbouring Hanoverian troops. In this way he saved the live of many brave men, voluntary exposing his own life, he rightly gained the admiration of every eyewitness, and Colonel von Ompteda, commander of the brigade, shortly before the charge which cost his life, expressed his great appreciation publicly. Beamish: Geschichte der Königlich deutschen Legion, 2. Band S.387 (translation of the German version. Not included in the English original.) After the battle Gerson was in charge of the Hôpital de la Gendàmerie in Brussels. Civilian career Detail of the memorial to Dr.Gerson After the legion was dissolved in 1816 he returned to Hamburg and was in the beginning mainly working as an author, but his surgery was expanding quickly and he gained a reputation as doctor and surgeon. In 1833 he was appointed as teacher for anatomy at the medical-surgery school and worked also from time to time as chief surgeon at the Allgemeine Krankenhaus. In 1839 he became sick with a chronic disease which led to his sudden death on 3 December 1844 in Hamburg. His graveside was in the Jewish cemetery the Grindelfriedhof. In the time of the Third Reich the cemetery was dissolved and the dead were reburied with their gravestones in the Jewish Cemetery Ohlsdorf. There his memorial can still be seen today. The inscription on one side reads: Mitissimus Aggressor -- Acerrimus Defensor (a mild aggressor -- a sharp defender). His uniform jacket, that he (presumably) wore at the battle of Waterloo is in the Hamburg Museum, the Museum für Hamburgische Geschichte (Museum for the History of Hamburg).It is believed to be the only jacket of a surgeon of the British/allied forces from the Napoleonic times, still in existence.

It has a population of 313 (2008). It lies on the right southern bank of the Goczałkowice Reservoir on the river Vistula. Contemporary territory covers only a small part of the former village existing since the 13th century, as it was inundated during the creation of Goczałkowice Reservoir in the 1950s. The name is of topographic origin and literally means [a place] behind a river (Polish: za rzeką, whereas rzeka means a river).  History  It is one of the oldest villages in Cieszyn Silesia. It was first mentioned in a document of Bishop of Wrocław issued on 23 May 1223 for Norbertine Sisters in Rybnik among villages paying them a tithe, as Zasere. The name (Zarzecze, [a place] behind a river, indicates that the primordial settlers came from the northern bank of the Vistula river (most probably from the village of Wisła, contemporary Wisła Wielka and Wisła Mała), and it could have been a part of the land that was ceded by Duke Casimir II the Just to Mieszko I Tanglefoot around 1177. Subsequently it belonged then to the Duchy of Opole and Racibórz and the Castellany of Cieszyn, which was in 1290 formed in the process of feudal fragmentation of Poland into the Duchy of Teschen, ruled by a local branch of Silesian Piast dynasty. In 1327 the duchy became a fee of the Kingdom of Bohemia, which after 1526 became a part of the Habsburg Monarchy. In years 1573/1577–1594 it belonged to Skoczów-Strumień state country that was split from the Duchy of Teschen but was later purchased back. After Revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire a modern municipal division was introduced in the re-established Austrian Silesia. The village as a municipality was subscribed to the political district of Bielsko and the legal district of Strumień. According to the censuses conducted in 1880, 1890, 1900 and 1910 the population of the municipality grew from 2121 in 1880 to 2529 in 1910 with a majority being native Polish-speakers (between 98.6% and 99.6%) accompanied by a small German-speaking minority (at most 33 or 1.4% in 1900), in terms of religion in 1910 majority were Roman Catholics (99.2%), followed by 15 Jews and 2 Protestants. After World War I, fall of Austria-Hungary, Polish–Czechoslovak War and the division of Cieszyn Silesia in 1920, it became a part of Poland. It was then annexed by Nazi Germany at the beginning of World War II. After the war it was restored to Poland.

She graduated from the University of California, Berkeley, went on to do graduate work in psychology at Washington University, and later received her PhD from Kansas University where she also became a professor at the Lifespan Institute.http://archive.news.ku.edu/2012/september/28/condolences.shtml In 1995 she and her former graduate adviser Todd Risley published the book Meaningful Differences in the Everyday Experience of Young American Children, based on a longitudinal study of parent-child interactions in 42 families of varying socio-economic class. They argued that educational outcomes were significantly affected by parenting practices, particularly the daily time parents spend talking to their children in early childhood. The book argued that parents from low-income families spoke less to their children than high income parents, leading to a disparity in which, at age four, low income children had heard on the average 32 million words fewer than their high income peers. The study concerned not only the quantity, but also the nature, of the verbal interactions between children and parents. Factors they considered important included the ratio of encouragements to prohibitions in the input to the child, and the extent to which parents followed up on topics initiated by the child. The child with the largest vocabulary in their study was a lower socio-economic class child from a family with a highly interactive conversational style. The importance of social factors in language learning was elaborated in their 1999 book The Social World of Children Learning to Talk. Differences in early language experience were argued to be an important factor in lower educational achievement and the perpetuation of socio-economic disparities between generations.

The two main dry lubricants are graphite and molybdenum disulfide. They offer lubrication at temperatures higher than liquid and oil-based lubricants operate. Dry lubricants are often used in applications such as locks or dry lubricated bearings. Such materials can operate up to 350 °C (662 °F) in oxidizing environments and even higher in reducing / non-oxidizing environments (molybdenum disulfide up to 1100 °C, 2012 °F). The low-friction characteristics of most dry lubricants are attributed to a layered structure on the molecular level with weak bonding between layers. Such layers are able to slide relative to each other with minimal applied force, thus giving them their low friction properties. However, a layered crystal structure alone is not necessarily sufficient for lubrication. In fact, there are some solids with non-lamellar structures that function well as dry lubricants in some applications. These include certain soft metals (indium, lead, silver, tin), polytetrafluroethylene, some solid oxides, rare-earth fluorides, and even diamond. Limited interest has been shown in low friction properties of compacted oxide glaze layers formed at several hundred degrees Celsius in metallic sliding systems. However, practical use is still many years away due to their physically unstable nature. The four most commonly used solid lubricants are: # Graphite. Used in air compressors, food industry, railway track joints, brass instrument valves, piano actions, open gear, ball bearings, machine-shop works, etc. It is also very common for lubricating locks, since a liquid lubricant allows particles to get stuck in the lock worsening the problem. It is often used to lubricate the internal moving parts of firearms in sandy environments. # Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2). Used in CV joints and space vehicles. Does lubricate in vacuum. # Hexagonal boron nitride. Used in space vehicles. Also called \\"white graphite.\\" # Tungsten disulfide. Similar usage as molybdenum disulfide, but due to the high cost only found in some dry lubricated bearings. Graphite and molybdenum disulfide are the predominant materials used as dry lubricants. Structure-function relationship The lubricity of many solids is attributable to a lamellar structure. The lamellae orient parallel to the surface in the direction of motion and slide easily over each other resulting in low friction and preventing contact between sliding components even under high loads. Large particles perform best on rough surfaces at low speed, finer particles on smoother surfaces and at higher speeds. These materials may be added in the form of dry powder to liquid lubricants to modify or enhance their properties. Other components that are useful solid lubricants include boron nitride, polytetrafluorethylene (PTFE), talc, calcium fluoride, cerium fluoride, and tungsten disulfide.  Applications  Solid lubricants are useful for conditions when conventional lubricants are inadequate, such as: * Reciprocating motion. A typical application is a sliding or reciprocating motion that requires lubrication to minimize wear, as, for example, in gear and chain lubrication. Liquid lubricants will squeeze out while solid lubricants do not escape, preventing fretting, corrosion, and galling. * Ceramics. Another application is for cases where chemically active lubricant additives have not been found for a particular surface, such as polymers and ceramics. * High temperature. Graphite and MoS2 act as lubricants at high temperature and in oxidizing atmosphere environments, where liquid lubricants typically will not survive. A typical application involves fasteners that are easily tightened and unscrewed after a long stay at high temperatures. * Extreme contact pressures. The lamellar structure orients parallel to the sliding surface, resulting in high bearing-load combined with a low shear stress. Most applications in metal forming that involve plastic deformation use solid lubricants. = Graphite = Graphite is structurally composed of planes of polycyclic carbon atoms that are hexagonal in orientation. The distance of carbon atoms between planes is longer and, therefore, the bonding is weaker. Graphite is best suited for lubrication in air. Water vapor is a necessary component for graphite lubrication. The adsorption of water reduces the bonding energy between the hexagonal planes of the graphite to a lower level than the adhesion energy between a substrate and the graphite. Because water vapor is a requirement for lubrication, graphite is not effective in vacuum. Because it is electrically conductive, graphite can promote galvanic corrosion. In an oxidative atmosphere, graphite is effective at high temperatures up to 450 °C continuously and can withstand much higher temperature peaks. Graphite is characterized by two main groups: natural and synthetic. * Synthetic graphite is a high temperature sintered product and is characterized by its high purity of carbon (99.5−99.9%). Primary grade synthetic graphite can approach the good lubricity of quality natural graphite. * Natural graphite is derived from mining. The quality of natural graphite varies as a result of the ore quality and its post-mining processing. The end product is graphite with a content of carbon (high grade graphite 96−98% carbon), sulfur, SiO2, and ash. The higher the carbon content and the degree of graphitization (high crystalline) the better the lubricity and resistance to oxidation. For applications where only a minor lubricity is needed and a more thermally insulating coating is required, then amorphous graphite would be chosen (80% carbon). = Molybdenum disulfide = MoS2 is mined from some sulfide-rich deposits and refined to achieve a purity suitable for lubricants. Like graphite, MoS2 has a hexagonal crystal structure with the intrinsic property of easy shear. MoS2 lubrication performance often exceeds that of graphite and is effective in vacuum as well, whereas graphite is not. The temperature limitation of MoS2 at 400 °C is restricted by oxidation. Particle size and film thickness are important parameters that should be matched to the surface roughness of the substrate. Large particles may result in excessive wear by abrasion caused by impurities in the MoS2, and small particles may result in accelerated oxidation. = Boron nitride = Hexagonal boron nitride is a ceramic powder lubricant. The most interesting lubricant feature is its high temperature resistance of 1200 °C service temperature in an oxidizing atmosphere. Furthermore, boron nitride has a high thermal conductivity. (Cubic boron nitride is very hard and used as an abrasive and cutting tool component.) = Polytetrafluorethylene = Polytetrafluorethylene (PTFE) is widely used as an additive in lubricating oils and greases. Due to the low surface energy of PTFE, stable unflocculated dispersions of PTFE in oil or water can be produced. Contrary to the other solid lubricants discussed, PTFE does not have a layered structure. The macro molecules of PTFE slip easily along each other, similar to lamellar structures. PTFE shows one of the smallest coefficients of static and dynamic friction, down to 0.04. Operating temperatures are limited to about 260 °C.  Application methods  = Spraying/dipping/brushing = Dispersion of solid lubricant as an additive in oil, water, or grease is most commonly used. For parts that are inaccessible for lubrication after assembly, a dry film lubricant can be sprayed. After the solvent evaporates, the coating cures at room temperature to form a solid lubricant. Pastes are grease-like lubricants containing a high percentage of solid lubricants used for assembly and lubrication of highly loaded, slow-moving parts. Black pastes generally contain MoS2. For high temperatures above 500 °C, pastes are composed on the basis of metal powders to protect metal parts from oxidation necessary to facilitate disassembly of threaded connections and other assemblies. = Free powders = Dry-powder tumbling is an effective application method. The bonding can be improved by prior phosphating of the substrate. Use of free powders has its limitations, since adhesion of the solid particles to the substrate is usually insufficient to provide any service life in continuous applications. However, to improve running-in conditions or in metal-forming processes, a short duration of the improved slide conditions may suffice. = Anti-friction coatings = Anti- friction (AF) coatings are \\"lubricating paints\\" consisting of fine particles of lubricating pigments, such as molydisulfide, PTFE or graphite, blended with a binder. After application and proper curing, these \\"slippery\\" or dry lubricants bond to the metal surface and form a dark gray solid film. Many dry film lubricants contain special rust inhibitors which offer exceptional corrosion protection. Most long-wearing films are of the bonded type but are still restricted to applications where sliding distances are not too long. AF coatings are applied where fretting and galling is a problem (such as splines, universal joints and keyed bearings), where operating pressures exceed the load-bearing capacities of ordinary oils and greases, where smooth running in is desired (piston, camshaft), where clean operation is desired (AF coatings will not collect dirt and debris like greases and oils), and where parts may be stored for long periods. = Composites = Self-lubricating composites: Solid lubricants such as PTFE, graphite, MoS2 and some other anti-friction and anti-wear additives are often compounded in polymers and all kind of sintered materials. MoS2, for example, is compounded in materials for sleeve bearings, elastomer O-rings, carbon brushes, etc. Solid lubricants are compounded in plastics to form a \\"self-lubricating\\" or \\"internally lubricated\\" thermoplastic composite. For example, PTFE particles compounded in the plastic form a PTFE film over the mating surface, resulting in a reduction of friction and wear. MoS2 compounded in nylon reduces wear, friction and stick-slip. Furthermore, it acts as a nucleating agent effecting in a very fine crystalline structure. The primary use of graphite lubricated thermoplastics is in applications operating in aqueous environments.

Early life Joseph Stevenson was born on 27 November 1806 in Berwick-on-Tweed, the eldest son of Robert Stevenson, surgeon, and his wife, Elizabeth Wilson. His parents were Presbyterians. Growing up, he occasionally accompanied an uncle on smuggling expeditions across the border. He was educated first at Witton-le-Wear (County Durham), and then at Durham School, under James Raine; where he was usually near the bottom of his class and at one time kept a loaded pistol among his effects which went off in the hands of a servant with dramatic although not deadly consequences. Afterwards he studied Latin and Greek at the University of Glasgow but made little progress and eventually returned to Berwick to pursue a vocation with the Church of Scotland. Career Moving to London, Stevenson found work in 1831 at the British Museum, which had just acquired the Arundel collection and needed competent assistants to sort and classify. He briefly went to Glasgow to claim a bride, Mary Ann, daughter of John Craig of Mount Florida, whom he married that September. A son, Robert, was born in August 1832; two daughters came later. From this time Stevenson established contact with many notable British historians including Patrick Fraser Tytler, and joined various learned societies. In 1834 he was appointed a subcommissioner of the public records and began work on a proposed new edition of Thomas Rymer's Foedera. While in London he transferred his allegiance from the kirk to the Church of England, in which Robert and the two daughters were baptized. =Return to Durham= The death of his son Robert in 1839 prompted him to reconsider his life. He resigned from the record commission and went to Durham to enter the city's university and study Theology, completing his licentiate in Easter 1841, with one of his classmates being the future antiquarian George Ornsby. He became librarian at Durham Cathedral. He spent the next seven years cataloging the charters and deeds in the treasury. During this time he was close to the cleric and author George Townsend, who would later travel to Rome on an unsuccessful mission to covert Pope Pius IX to Protestantism. Townsend appointed Stevenson as curate at St Margaret's Church. All this time he was constantly editing ancient texts: for the Maitland Club, Glasgow, eight volumes (1833–42) (including The Life and Death of King James the First of Scotland (1837), which contains the text of The Dethe of the Kynge of Scotis); for the English Historical Society, five volumes (1838–41); for the Roxburghe Club, four volumes; for the Surtees Society, seven volumes, with eight volumes of The Church Historians of England. =Archivist to the British Government= In 1849 he became Vicar of Leighton Buzzard in Bedfordshire, where he would remain until 1862. By contrast with his comfortable Durham living, here he had to manage on £120 per annum, and to live in a vicarage so decayed as to be uninhabitable. He stayed until 1862, somehow finding the money to fund a curate, rebuild the vicarage, and restore the church after it was struck by lightning. 1856 the British Government was making plans for dealing with the national records on a large scale. Stevenson was one of those appointed to report on the subject, and when the new Public Record Office was opened in 1857, he was one of the first editors engaged. He now edited seven volumes for the Rolls Series, seven volumes of Calendars, Foreign Series, and two of the Scottish Series. Ironically, given his later conversion to the Catholic faith, one of his predecessors at the Office, William Barclay Turnbull, had been pressured to resign because of his own Catholicism. =Conversion to Catholicism= He converted to Catholicism on 24 June 1863, and following the death of his wife in 1869 he entered the seminary of St Mary's College, Oscott, and in 1872 was ordained priest by Bishop Ullathorne. Next year he was in Rome searching for documents concerning English history from the Vatican archives, being employed by the British Government to begin the series of \\"Roman Transcripts\\" for the Record Office - his status as a Catholic allowing him this privileged access. He also wrote many reports for the Historical Manuscripts Commission. In 1877, aged nearly 72, he gave up these occupations to enter the Society of Jesus. However, after his novitiate he returned again to historical research, and continued his studies until his death. His chief work of this period was the discovery and publication of Claude Nau's Life of Mary Queen of Scots (Edinburgh, 1883). In 1892 he received the honorary degree of Doctor of Laws from the University of St Andrews. Death Stevenson died in London on 8 February 1895 at the House of the Society of Jesus on Mount Street.

His first appearance was in Sunfire & Big Hero 6 #1 and was created by Steven T. Seagle and Duncan Rouleau. The character is known as Hiro Hamada voiced by Ryan Potter in the Big Hero 6 film and television series and related media. He is a young robotics prodigy who helps form the superhero group Big Hero 6 to protect the city. The character is also changed to half Japanese and half Caucasian. Hamada also wears a suit for protection when he is flying on Baymax. Publication history Created by Steven T. Seagle and Duncan Rouleau in their spare time while working on another project, Hiro was first intended to appear with the rest of Big Hero 6 in Alpha Flight #17 (December 1998). However, the team first appeared in their own self-titled three-issue miniseries by writer Scott Lobdell and artist Gus Vasquez, which due to scheduling issues, was published before Alpha Flight #17.Big Hero 6 banks on a huggable robot to draw in audiences The character appeared with the team in a subsequent five-issue miniseries which was launched by Marvel Comics in September 2008. Fictional character biography Born to wealthy industrialist Tomeo Takachiho and Maemi Takachiho, Hiro was raised in the affluent Tokyo suburb of Yoga, City of Setagaya. His parents noticed his intellectual brilliance at an early age, and he was placed in pre- school at age 2. He was eventually recognized as one of the world's most brilliant child prodigies and was accepted into the prestigious private Tesuka Advanced Science Institute. It was at the Tesuka Institute that young Hiro's proficiency for invention and innovation was discovered. He created his first and greatest invention to date, the robotic synthformer known as Monster Baymax, as a project for the Institute's science fair.Big Hero 6 #1 (2008) At age 13, Hiro was targeted by the Giri, a top-secret consortium of Japanese politicians and business entities that was established to recruit and train potential operatives for a Japanese super-team, Big Hero 6. Silver Samurai (Kenuichio Harada), Big Hero 6's initial field leader, first approached Hiro's mother for permission to have him join the team, but she refused as she wanted her child to live a normal life. Silver Samurai then approached Hiro directly, but the boy was less than impressed with Big Hero 6. However, after his mother was abducted by the Everwraith, the astral embodiment of all those killed in the 1945 nuclear attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Hiro was forced to turn to Big Hero 6 for assistance. After joining forces with the team, which also included his idol, the Japanese hero Sunfire, Hiro opted to join the team.Sunfire and Big Hero 6 #1-3 (1998) In fact, when Silver Samurai and Sunfire left the Big Hero 6, Hiro was appointed to serve as the team's field leader.Alpha Flight Vol. 3 #9 (2005) He continues to maintain a civilian life and attend classes at the Tesuka Institute, although his teachers and classmates are unaware that he moonlights as a secret agent. Hiro idolizes Sunfire and has a crush on Honey Lemon. Powers and abilities Hiro is a brilliant child prodigy, proficient in many fields of science and technology, with a focus on biology, physics, and robotics. Although he is only an adolescent, he is a visionary theoretician and accomplished machinesmith who has already made several breakthroughs in fields such as robotics, computer science, synthetic polymers, geology, biology, and communications. He is also a gifted tactician and strategist. Hiro has constructed several robots, his first and most advanced creation being Monster Baymax, a water-powered synthformer whose artificial intelligence is based on the thoughts and memories of his departed father. Other notable inventions include: the Bio- Atomic Parcel Detector (B-APD), a device capable of pinpointing the location of human-sized nuclear reactors; a jet-pack-propelled flight suit that grants its user limited firepower capabilities; a holographic virtual reality projector that can produce a comprehensive recreation of previous events by amassing information from various data streams; and eyeglasses with a cybernetic video display that can connect to an assortment of computer networks. Many of Hiro's inventions (including Monster Baymax) are connected to his Core Cyber Network (CCN), a mobile personal area computer network used for communication among his various mechanical devices. In other media =Film= In the film adaptation, Hiro, with his last name changed to Hamada and his ethnicity changed to being half White, half East Asian, appears in the 2014 Disney animated feature Big Hero 6, voiced by Ryan Potter. Speaking of the character, co-director Don Hall said \\"Hiro is transitioning from boy to man, it's a tough time for a kid and some teenagers develop that inevitable snarkiness and jaded attitude. Luckily Ryan is a very likeable kid. So no matter what he did, he was able to take edge off the character in a way that made him authentic, but appealing.\\" Hiro is a 14-year-old robotics prodigy whose battle robot dominates the underground bot fights of San Fransokyo. His older brother Tadashi, a student at the San Fransokyo Institute of Technology, inspires him to redirect his efforts toward gaining acceptance to its research program. After Tadashi is killed in a fire and explosion on the campus, Hiro becomes withdrawn and depressed. He later forms the Big Hero 6 team with Tadashi's fellow researchers and Baymax, an inflatable healthcare robot built by Tadashi, to stop Yokai, the villain who killed Tadashi by causing the fire. Hiro initially lacks a social life and appears to suffer from intellectual boredom. After Tadashi's urging and meeting with his friends, he becomes more open and accepting to those around him and tries to be friendly. He also decides to be a hero out of necessity as opposed to being unwillingly forced into the occupation. He also wears bluish–purple armor that, by itself, serves absolutely no function besides protection. However, when paired with Baymax, the suit magnetizes to his back and allows Hiro to control him while flying. =Television= Hiro appears in Big Hero 6: The Series with Potter reprising the role. The first episode, \\"Baymax Returns\\" takes place during the last part of the movie where Hiro rebuilds Baymax. He suddenly gets embroiled in a plot involving his new professor's paperweight and his previous arch enemy, Yama. He is later given Tadashi's old lab room so that he can have a familiar environment to focus in. In the episode \\"Issue 188\\", it is revealed that despite having a see through visor that reveals his face, some people still cannot tell that he is part of Big Hero 6, specifically Karmi, a fellow student who despises Hiro, but has a crush on his alter ego. Fred informs Hiro that the reason for this is simply that she \\"chooses\\" to see his alter ego as a hero and himself as an academic rival. Additionally, Aunt Cass is also unaware of his heroic endeavors and at one point thought that Hiro had returned to bot fighting when she saw through his lie of where he was. In the episode \\"Muirahara Woods\\", Hiro is shown to be slightly agoraphobic admitting to Fred that he has never been outside of San Fransokyo. Furthermore, he is uncomfortable around nature and is afraid of bugs and insects. Out of all of his teammates, he has the least in common with Wasabi whom he had difficulty with due to his cleanliness. By the end of \\"Killer App\\", the two become closer. Hiro is also shown to have updated his costume. His gloves now have the ability to magnetize and propel objects making him much more useful in a fight. In the episode \\"Kentucky Kaiju\\", he briefly invented a suit that granted him super strength called Nano-Dex, but he got rid of it when it became a hassle to use. In the same episode, Hiro is shown to possibly suffer from a variation of little man's syndrome as he hates constantly having to be saved by his older and more capable teammates. In season two, it is revealed that Hiro somewhat envies other kids who grew up with normal childhoods. He befriends a girl named Megan Cruz who begins to treat him to common teenage outings; opening his eyes to new experiences. At the end of the season, he graduates SFIT and accepts Tadashi's diploma on his behalf. =Video games= Hiro appears in Disney Infinity: Marvel Super Heroes and Disney Infinity 3.0, based on his 2014 film appearance.

Situated near the border with County Kilkenny, the mines are now disused and have flooded. Other nearby centres of population are Killenaule and New Birmingham.  Geology  The type of coal mined here was anthracite, a hard, virtually smokeless fuel with a high calorific value and relatively low ash content. The coalfield is situated in the Slievardagh range of hills and is an extension of the Leinster coalfields, being separated by a narrow band of Carboniferous limestone. The deposits, which are highly faulted, consist of three strata, the lowest averaging nine inches in thickness and the others being approximately two feet thick. Due to the inclined coal layer acting as a slippage plane, substantial amounts of the deposits have been crushed and blended with the upper and lower boundary shale. This has resulted in a less commercially attractive material known locally as culm. Due to its high elevation, melting snow in the Slievardagh region intermittently resulted in large volumes of flood-water with a short 'Time of Concentration'. This sometimes threatened to overwhelm the mines ordinary pumping capacity.  19th and early 20th century  From 1826, the main commercial enterprise was the Mining Company of Ireland which ended operations in 1926.Second Report of the Commissioners (on) Railway Communications (in) Ireland By Irish Railway Commission W. Clowes, 1838 p45 In the 1840s, 50,000 tons per year were extracted here.The Industrial Resources of Ireland Robert Kane : Edition: 2 : Hodges and Smith : 1845 The mines featured significantly during the Young Irelander Rebellion of 1848. By 1866, twelve pits were being worked locally while three had recently been abandoned.Mineral Statistics of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland By Geological Survey of Great Britain, Robert Hunt, 1866 p209 From 1942 until 1950, the mines were managed by the government under the name Mianrai Teo. According to the 1837 Topographical Dictionary of Ireland,  Gurteen  In 1953, the mining lease for the area was purchased from the government by Tommy O'Brien for £50,000. O'Brien, originally from County Mayo, returned from Lancashire in England and soon many locals who had also emigrated from the area returned to work the mines. Three years later, 330 men were employed there and future employment prospects were good, with the new pit at Gurteen having been recently opened and \\"British coal up another 30 shillings a ton in the Dublin area\\". Wages varied between £15 and £25 per week, depending on quantity mined.Irish Times p5 23 June 1956 (with photo montage of Gurteen miners) By the early 1970s, the mines were in financial difficulties and management were seeking government intervention.Irish Times p1 20 April 1971 In 1971, 100 workers were made redundant and the following year the mines went into receivership resulting in the redundancy of another 150 men, just before the first oil crisis.Dick Walsh, Irish Times p1 11 Sept. 1972 Maintenance of the mines was continued for a period, and disaster was narrowly averted in 1973 when an underground fire threatened the lives of 17 workers.Irish Times 7 February 1973 Despite these efforts the mines closed, and with the pumps disconnected the pits flooded. The second oil crisis resulted in soaring fuel prices, and it appeared the mines would once again be seen as a viable enterprise.  Lickfinn  In 1978, Kealy Mines commenced explorations in the area. The name derived from the surnames of its two principals, Patrick Keating, a civil engineer originally from Ballylooby in Tipperary and Gilbert Howley, a native of Co. Mayo. As a student, Keating had worked for O'Brien at the Gurteen pit before emigrating to work on the M1 motorway in England. He returned to Ireland in the early sixties and later became involved with Howley in the latter's civil engineering and excavation business. They reopened workings at Lickfinn, near the village of New Birmingham, which accessed the coal by slope mining. Initially the mines employed 34 miners and the Electricity Supply Board expressed an interest in using Ballingarry coal for the generation of power and so reduce its dependence on imported oil.Irish Times pp 1 and 10 26 July 1979 (with photo montage of Lickfinn miners) However, in preliminary testing at a power station designed to burn peat, the high temperatures produced by the anthracite caused its fire-grates to overheat. Coal dust was supplied to the Irish Sugar processing plant at Thurles and they became an important customer. Financing also proved a difficulty for Kealy Mines, and it was acquired by a Canadian consortium in 1982. Flair Resources Ltd., trading as Tipperary Anthracite was headed by John Young, a Tipperary emigrant to Canada. The new company expanded the workforce to 80 and transferred surface processing such as washing, screening and bagging to the old pithead at Gurteen. It also opened a second underground 'cutting' and investigated exploiting the more marginal No. 1 seam. An electrically powered coal-cutter was employed and investment allowed some further modernisation of plant. Extraction concentrated on the No. 2 seam, with its reserves estimated at that time to be 3 million tonnes. By 1985, Tipperary Anthracite was also in receivership. Financial irregularities regarding IDA grants were investigated by the Gardaí and highlighted on RTÉ current affairs programme 'Today Tonight'. In 1989, Emereld Resources was granted a licence to reopen the mines and for a while sporadic work continued at Lickfinn-Earl's Hill.  Legacy  Mining on a reduced scale progressed for some time before the pit again closed. As part of a local initiative, the Old School at the Commons was renovated by Slieveardagh Rural Development. It displays numerous artifacts relating to the mining heritage of the Slieve Ardagh region and is also intended as a social centre for former miners and their families.  Colloquial mining terms used at Ballingarry  *'Banshee', a compressed-air rock drill with an extending mono-pod, used to bore holes for explosives. *'Puncheon', a round timber strut (approx. 4 inches diameter) to support overburden in areas where coal was extracted. *'Chock', lengths of pine-trunk 3 feet long and from 9 to 12 inches in diameter and roughly sawn to give two flat surfaces. They were used on the flat to construct square supports if more substantial support than puncheons was required. *'Bogey', rail car for transporting support-timbers (and occasionally miners). *'Tub', rail car for transporting coal and shale. *'Cane', stick of gelignite. *'Pit bottom', limit of main road sloping from surface (at approx. 25 degrees) and where the largest pumps were positioned. Miners walked down the pit at Lickfinn, on rough-cut steps beside the single narrow-gauge rail. At the pit bottom, horizontal roads (also with a single rail-track), branched left and right. As the branch roads progressed, switched sidings were extended to 'park' tubs near the work area. *'Topple', a sloping drift off the branch road and following the coal seam upwards. It was excavated only to the depth of the coal. This was where most of the coal was extracted by miners lying flat in the two feet headroom. *'Chute', a metal bin fixed at the end of a topple and extending over the branch road. A trap-door was opened and closed to progressively fill a series of tubs on the road. Galvanised sheets extending from the chute up to the 'coal face' allowed the miners to fill the chute assisted by gravity. The full tubs were then winched or pushed to the pit bottom. There they were attached to the main winch for hoisting to the surface, tipped, and the empties returned. *'Shining ball', form of culm or duff, high in clay content. *'Jigger', pneumatic pick. *'Tally', a brass token with a stamped number threaded on a string and carried by the miner around his neck. It was placed by the 'Hurrier' in the full tub to indicate which team had mined it. Tallies were used to calculate production-based bonuses. *'Fireman', the foreman responsible for detonating explosives at the end of a shift.

Her first appearance was in Sunfire & Big Hero 6 #1 and was created by Steven T. Seagle and Duncan Rouleau. Go Go appears in the 2014 Disney animated film Big Hero 6 and television series, voiced by Jamie Chung and in the video game Kingdom Hearts III. She is shown as an athletic adrenaline junkie who does not talk much. She possesses electromagnetic disks that can be used as skates and also has smaller disks within them that can be thrown as projectiles. Publication history Created by Steven T. Seagle and Duncan Rouleau in their spare time while working on another project, GoGo Tomago was first intended to appear with the rest of Big Hero 6 in Alpha Flight #17 (December 1998). However, the team first appeared in their own self-titled three-issue miniseries by writer Scott Lobdell and artist Gus Vasquez, which due to scheduling issues, was published before Alpha Flight #17.Big Hero 6 banks on a huggable robot to draw in audiences The character appeared with the team in a subsequent five-issue miniseries which was launched by Marvel Comics in September 2008. Fictional character biography Raised on the streets of Utsunomiya, Tochigi Prefecture, young street urchin Leiko Tanaka fell in with the Shikei-otaku, one of the many youth-based motorcycle gangs (bōsōzoku) involved in Yakuza activities. At age 18, she was arrested during a botched robbery of the Kiyohara Industrial Complex and sentenced to a term of five years in Tochigi Prison. However, before serving her full sentence, engineers from Japan's Ministry of Defense came to her with a deal: secure an early release from prison in exchange for test piloting an experimental exosuit. Tanaka, who was chosen as a test subject based on her good behavior in prison and her high-speed motorcycling skills, accepted the government's terms and soon found herself in the \\"Go-Go Tomago\\" exosuit, named for the sphere-like shape the armor takes when propelling through the air at high velocities (\\"tomago\\" being a corruption of \\"tamago\\", the Japanese word for \\"egg\\").Big Hero 6 #1 (2008) When the top- secret consortium of Japanese politicians and business entities known as the Giri was formed to recruit and train potential superhuman operatives for Big Hero 6, Go-Go Tomago was chosen to be a founding member of the team due to her proficiency with the exosuit and the belief that her fear of being sent back to prison would make it easy for the Giri to control her. Impulsive and hotheaded, Go-Go initially clashed with virtually every member of her new team. She refused to take orders from the team's initial field leader, Silver Samurai (Kenuichio Harada), and was insanely jealous of teammate Honey Lemon (Aiko Miyazaki). However, once becoming acclimated to the team, her grudging respect for her teammates evolved into true kinship. Powers and abilities The Go-Go Tomago battle suit is a voice-activated device that absorbs and amplifies kinetic energy, enabling its wearer to temporarily transubstantiate his or her body mass into thermochemical energy simply by uttering the trigger words \\"Go-Go Tomago\\". This transformation can be either partial or total. During a partial transformation, the wearer's body is surrounded by a half- inch thick thermochemical aura that grants the wearer limited invulnerability, flight and energy projection capabilities. During a total transformation, the wearer's entire body transubstantiates into a high-speed, high-impact spherical \\"powerball\\", which builds up greater speed and force with every additional ricochet impact while in motion. After a series of sufficiently numerous and forceful ricochets to build up power, the wearer can hurl him or herself into a given target with tremendous explosive impact. Go-Go Tomago is apparently unlimited by the amount of time that she can remain in the thermochemical powerball form, although her body becomes fatigued after extended periods of ricocheting at high speeds. She has been timed at speeds of up to 185 miles per hour. The Go-Go Tomago helmet is made entirely from carbon fiber and is extremely durable and lightweight. Go-Go Tomago is also a skilled motorcyclist and an accomplished racer and stunt driver. She also has several contacts in Japan's criminal underworld, as many of her former bōsōzoku associates are unaware that she secretly serves as a member of Japan's premiere super-hero team. In other media =Film= In the film adaptation, GoGo, renamed as Go Go Tomago, appears in the 2014 Disney animated film Big Hero 6, voiced by Jamie Chung. In the film, Go Go is depicted as a tough, athletic, not very talkative adrenaline junkie who is developing electromagnetic wheel axles at the San Fransokyo Institute of Technology. Co- director Don Hall said \\"She's definitely a woman of few words...We looked at bicycle messengers as inspiration for her character.\\" Her name is a nickname that was thought of by Fred with her real name, which is never said in the film, being something \\"non threatening\\", with Chung settling on Ethel due to it being a reference to ethanol. This version of Go Go studies electromagnets and has a tough and competitive personality, although she does show a softer and caring side and sticks up for her team, specifically Hiro whom she feels close to. She also has a habit of chewing and popping gum and will remove it from her mouth and place it somewhere when she gets more active. Go Go wears a yellow armored suit that was built by Hiro with large electromagnetic disks that can be used as inline skates and contain smaller disks that can be thrown as projectiles. =Television= Go Go appears in Big Hero 6: The Series with Chung reprising the role. In the first episode, \\"Baymax Returns\\", Go Go is the most reluctant to return to fighting crime, but changes her mind by then, mostly so as to keep her friends out of trouble. Go Go is shown to be almost incapable of giving optimistic insight until \\"Big Roommates\\" when Honey Lemon became disillusioned with her outlook and she was forced to prep her. She also finds pleasure in beating up anything with Fred's face on it. Despite her adrenaline junkie lifestyle, Go Go will head into the woods to go bird watching from time to time and refuses to have anyone go with her.

The character is commonly associated with the Japanese team known as Big Hero 6. She was created by Steven T. Seagle and Duncan Rouleau, and first appeared in Sunfire & Big Hero 6 #1 (September 1998). She also appeared in the 2014 film adaptation of the comics. Honey Lemon appears as a young American woman in the 2014 Disney animated film Big Hero 6 and television series, voiced by Genesis Rodriguez and in the video game Kingdom Hearts III. She is a quirky chemistry whiz who has a kind heart and tries to find the good in everything. She has a purse that can mix different chemical elements, allowing her to create balls that she uses as explosives or traps. Publication history Created by Steven T. Seagle and Duncan Rouleau in their spare time while working on another project, Honey Lemon was first intended to appear with the rest of Big Hero 6 in Alpha Flight #17 (December 1998). However, the team first appeared in their own self-titled three-issue miniseries by writer Scott Lobdell and artist Gus Vasquez, which due to scheduling issues, was published before Alpha Flight #17. The character appeared with the team in a subsequent five-issue miniseries which was launched by Marvel Comics in September 2008. Fictional character biography Aiko Miyazaki was enrolled in the graduate program at the Tokyo University of Science when she was recruited by Naikaku Jōhō Chōsashitsu (Naichō), Japan's premiere intelligence agency. Miyazaki's sharp intellect and stunning looks made her a prime candidate for secret agent status, and she was promptly placed on a research and development team consisting of Naichō's top physicists, chemists, and mechanical engineers and put to work creating new technology for the government. Although Miyazaki's team was responsible for several innovations in surveillance technology, by far their most significant invention was a cluster of artificial, miniature wormholes—tiny warps and distortions in the fabric of space-time. At Miyazaki's suggestion, the wormholes were contained within an innocuous woman's purse so they could be applied in the field without attracting undue attention. It was soon discovered that the wormholes, in conjunction with Pym Particles and cutting- edge nanotechnology, served as ideal storage devices in the field—virtually any object, no matter how large, could be stored in Miyazaki's aptly-named \\"Power Purse\\" for later use.Big Hero 6 #1 (2008) Soon after, the top-secret consortium of Japanese politicians and business entities known as the Giri began recruiting candidates for Big Hero 6, which was to become Japan's premiere superhero team. Inspired by the exploits of Sunfire (Shiro Yoshida), Japan's national superhero, Miyazaki persuasively lobbied her superiors in Naichō for a spot on the team. Graduating to full-fledged \\"secret agent\\" status, Miyazaki adopted the code-name \\"Honey Lemon\\" (inspired by her favorite television program of the same name). As the most caring and compassionate member of the team, Honey Lemon quickly found herself at odds with teammate Go-Go Tomago (Leiko Tanaka), a tough-talking ex-convict who felt that Honey Lemon received special treatment because of her looks and intellect. However, after several heated squabbles, the two eventually learned to appreciate one another and became good friends. She seemingly became attracted to the team's newest potential recruit, Hiro Takachiho, as she kept smiling at him in a flirtatious way. Later, Honey helped overthrow a menace called Everwraith and saved Japan from destruction. She was only briefly seen afterwards, helping Sunfire out in Canada. Sometime later, a mysterious individual used a machine to mind-control the entire team of Big Hero Six and they were sent to Canada once again, where they fought the newest incarnation of Alpha Flight until Sasquatch discovered the plot. Honey Lemon was, along with the rest of the team, brought back to normal, and they all returned to Japan to try to discover who mind-controlled them.Alpha Flight #17 (1989) Powers and abilities Honey Lemon's Power Purse (also known as the \\"Nano-Purse\\") contains a series of miniature, artificial, inter-universe wormholes, granting her limited access to an indeterminate number of worlds and dimensions. The unstable, fluctuating nature of the wormholes makes accurate long-term mapping of them difficult. Before deploying in the field, Honey Lemon typically gathers a large arsenal of supplies, shrinks them to microscopic size using a combination of Pym Particles and cutting-edge nanotechnology, and stores them in miniature pocket universes only accessible via the Power Purse's wormholes. As such, she is able to instantaneously retrieve these items from the Power Purse and restore them to their original size while in the field. The Power Purse's wormholes also grant access to a number of full-sized, inhabited dimensions. For instance, the Microverse planet of Coronar (home world of former Big Hero 6 member Sunpyre) is accessible through the Power Purse. The total number of dimensions accessible via the Power Purse has yet to be determined. Although Honey Lemon can use the Power Purse's wormholes as a method of personal transportation, she only does so in rare instances when her life is in danger, as a trip through the Power Purse is often a very unpleasant experience for carbon-based lifeforms. Honey Lemon is a brilliant scientist who often keeps her opponents off-guard by feigning ignorance. As a secret agent of the Naichō intelligence agency, she is extensively trained in various martial arts, including aikido, judo, jujutsu, karate, Shaolin kung fu and tae kwon do. In other media =Film= Honey Lemon appears in Big Hero 6, voiced by Genesis Rodriguez. In the film, Honey Lemon is depicted as a quirky chemistry whiz at the San Fransokyo Institute of Technology. Her ethnicity has also been changed to Latin American and can be heard listening to Spanish-language music. Co-director Chris Williams said \\"She's a glass-is- half-full kind of person. But she has this mad-scientist quality with a twinkle in her eye—there's more to Honey than it seems.\\" Her name is a nickname that was thought of by Fred; her real name is unknown and has not been revealed. Honey Lemon is an excitable person who is in love with her chemistry work and loves showing off her experiments in an almost maniacal way. She is the most respectable and polite of the group and tends to dress in 60's and 70's style clothing. Honey Lemon wears bright pink armor that was built by Hiro with a mechanical purse that can mix different chemical elements, allowing her to create balls that she can use as explosives, traps, or safe exits. =Television= Honey appears in Big Hero 6: The Series with Rodriguez reprising the role. In the first episode, \\"Baymax Returns\\", Honey admits that she dislikes violence as she was regretful of using an ice ball on Yama, even though he was going to harm Hiro. In the episode \\"Big Roommates 2\\", she initially believed that people were totally incapable of being totally evil, despite prior evidence to the contrary. When she learns her chem-purse was stolen and transformed a criminal named Dibs into a monster, she became disillusioned, but was brought back to her senses by Go Go.

Created by Steven T. Seagle and Duncan Rouleau, Baymax first appeared in Sunfire & Big Hero 6 #1 (September 1998). Baymax begins his existence as Hiro Takachiho's science project. Originally designed to be a hydro-powered robotic synthformer programmed to serve as Hiro's personal bodyguard, butler and chauffeur, Baymax becomes Hiro's best friend and father figure when the young inventor programs his recently deceased father's brain engrams into Baymax's artificial intelligence. When the Giri recruits Hiro into the fledgling super-team Big Hero 6, Baymax also joins the team, where his phenomenal strength, amazing surveillance and data analysis capabilities have proven useful. Baymax is an artificial synthformer capable of synthtransing his body into various forms: a large humanoid male, \\"Battle- Dragon\\" and \\"Action-Mecha\\". The first serves as his default form, designed to be less conspicuous in public while attending to Hiro's daily needs. His other forms, significantly more powerful and imposing, are primarily used during undercover missions and other hostile operations. In all forms, Baymax has internal scanners and sensors able to detect and evaluate threats posed by nearby lifeforms. He is also programmed with fighting techniques from forms of combat including karate, tae kwon do, Western boxing and Wing Chun. Baymax appears in the 2014 Disney animated film Big Hero 6 and its extended media, voiced by Scott Adsit. He is depicted as an inflatable robot built by Tadashi, the older brother of the protagonist Hiro Hamada, to serve as a healthcare companion. When he is with Big Hero 6, Baymax wears armor that has wings allowing him to fly, while his fists can detach like rocket punches. The armor also has magnets attached to his back for Hiro to stick on while flying. Publication history Created by Steven T. Seagle and Duncan Rouleau in their spare time while working on another project, Baymax was first intended to appear with the rest of Big Hero 6 in Alpha Flight #17 (December 1998). However, the team first appeared in their own self-titled three-issue miniseries by writer Scott Lobdell and artist Gus Vasquez, which due to scheduling issues, was published before Alpha Flight #17.Palmeri, Christopher (November 3, 2014). \\"Big Hero 6 banks on a huggable robot to draw in audiences\\" . The Vancouver Sun. The character appeared with the team in a subsequent five-issue miniseries which was launched by Marvel Comics in September 2008. Fictional character biography Monster Baymax began his existence as a science project created by Hiro. He was originally designed to be a hydro-powered robotic synthformer programmed to serve as Hiro's personal bodyguard, butler, and chauffeur. However, prior to the project's completion, Hiro's father died and the young inventor programmed Baymax's artificial intelligence using the brain engrams of his recently departed father. With the thoughts and emotions of Hiro's father, Baymax became much more than a robotic bodyguard. He also functions as Hiro's best friend and father figure, and is by his side nearly every hour of every day. Baymax also feels a deep attachment to Hiro's mother; however, Hiro and Baymax decided it was not in her best interest to inform her that her departed husband's memories were used as the basis for Baymax's artificial intelligence, at least for the time being.Big Hero 6 #1 (2008) Baymax is programmed to serve and protect Hiro and therefore unable to allow his creator to be placed in possibly dangerous situations. When the Giri attempted to recruit Hiro into the fledgling super- team known as Big Hero 6, Baymax was also on their list of potential operatives. Baymax opposed the idea of Hiro being placed in harm's way but acquiesced to joining the team after the Everwraith, the astral embodiment of those killed in the 1945 nuclear attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, abducted Hiro's mother. Baymax continues to serve alongside Hiro on Big Hero 6, where his phenomenal strength, and amazing surveillance and data analysis capabilities have proven very useful. Powers and abilities Baymax is an artificial synthformer capable of synthtransing his body into various forms. His default form is a large humanoid male designed to be less conspicuous in public while attending to Hiro's daily needs. His other forms \\"Battle-Dragon\\" and \\"Action-Mecha\\", are significantly more powerful and imposing than his default humanoid form, and are primarily used during undercover missions and other hostile operations. When Baymax sustains physical injuries beyond his damage threshold, he automatically reverts to his humanoid form and becomes temporarily depowered. In all forms, Baymax is equipped with internal scanners and sensors able to detect and evaluate the threat posed by lifeforms in the immediate vicinity. He can also deploy remote monitors to record events from afar. His feet are equipped with jet engines capable of generating a thrust sufficient to propel him at speeds up to Mach 4. He can send, receive, and intercept radio transmissions, and monitors all networks maintained by the Japanese Ministry of Defense. Baymax is also directly linked to Hiro's personal Core Cyber-Network (CCN). As a result, when Baymax is not in Hiro's vicinity, he can be immediately summoned via a communication device mounted on Hiro's wrist. Baymax is also connected to Hiro's cybernetic glasses, so that everything that Hiro sees and hears while wearing the glasses is stored in Baymax's databanks for later reference and analysis. Baymax is programmed with fighting techniques from several forms of combat, including karate, tae kwon do, Western boxing, and Wing Chun. He possesses a durable, polymantium endo/exoskeleton resistant to most forms of small ballistics. Baymax uses water as his primary source of power for locomotion. His artificial intelligence system is memory-card-based and contains thoughts and emotions of Hiro's departed father, industrialist Tomeo Takachiho. In other media =Film= In Big Hero 6, Baymax is voiced by Scott Adsit. In the film, he is depicted as an inflatable robot with a carbon fiber skeleton built by Hiro Hamada's older brother Tadashi to serve as a personal healthcare provider companion. Co-director Don Hall said \\"Baymax views the world from one perspective—he just wants to help people, he sees Hiro as his patient.\\" Producer Roy Conli said \\"The fact that his character is a robot limits how you can emote, but Scott was hilarious. He took those boundaries and was able to shape the language in a way that makes you feel Baymax’s emotion and sense of humor. Scott was able to relay just how much Baymax cares.\\" The film was released under the title Baymax in Germany and Japan. Baymax's design in the film drew influence from Japanese anime and Shogun Warriors toys. Mecha designer Shigeto Koyama, who previously did design work for mecha anime such as Gunbuster 2, Eureka Seven, Gurren Lagann and Rebuild of Evangelion, worked on the concept design for Baymax in the film. Baymax is immediately activated from his charging bay at the sound of a person experiencing pain. Due to being a personal \\"healthcare companion\\" Baymax is calm and nurturing, and one of Baymax's functions is that located on his chest is a small chip port. Any chip can be inserted into it and give Baymax large amounts of knowledge. His healthcare chip instructs him with \\"10,000 different medical procedures\\". Hiro later gives him a battle chip that instructs him on numerous forms of martial arts. It is shown that when his healthcare chip is removed, Baymax becomes deadly and slightly uncontrollable. To coat his easily deflatable body, Baymax wears bright red armor with purple accents. The suit has wings that allow him to fly and his fists can detach like rockets. Baymax's armor also has small magnets attached to his back that allow Hiro to stick to him in flight. =Television= Baymax appears in Big Hero 6: The Series with Adsit reprising the role. The first episode, \\"Baymax Returns\\" takes place during the last part of the movie where Hiro rebuilds Baymax. Hiro changes his battle chip to a superhero chip so that Baymax won't turn evil like in the film. Later, Yama manages to copy his designs and creates evil versions of him though he and the Big Hero 6 destroy them. Baymax is also shown to have, slightly, developed some self-awareness capabilities as he caught on to Wasabi's implication of urinating in fear. Baymax is further shown to be versed in psychological evaluation and has even grasped the concept of emotional stress as seen in \\"Mr. Sparkles Loses His Sparkle\\". Hiro later builds two other Max's that aid the Big Hero 6. The first are introduced in \\"Mr. Sparkles Loses His Sparkle\\" called Skymaxes. They are six individually colored drones that contain and deliver the team's costumes where ever they are. The other is a miniature version of Baymax called Mini-Max (voiced by John Michael Higgins) that watches Fred whenever the rest of the team is in class. Fred himself seems to view him as a sidekick, and the team never corrects him. The episode \\"Portal Enemy\\", reveals that the original Baymax is still floating in the portal dimension. =Video games= The Disney version of Baymax, in his armored form, appears in Disney Infinity: Marvel Super Heroes, Disney Infinity 3.0 and Kingdom Hearts III. According to Square Enix and the film's producer Roy Conli, the story of Big Hero 6s world is set as an alternate sequel to the events of the film.

It was particularly influential in the 1950s–1960s, pioneering the use of concrete shell structures, and in the present day as a leader in sustainable architecture, building the UK's first net zero carbon house in 2007 as well as designing the LEED Platinum Siemens Middle East Headquarters at Masdar City, which completed in 2014. The latter project was cited as exemplifying \\"a new generation [that] has emerged [at the practice], which is balancing performance, especially of the sustainable variety, with form\\" . The practice has offices in London, Manchester and Glasgow and in the 2000s established an award-winning interior design group, ID:SR Sheppard Robson. History Sheppard Robson was founded in 1938 by Richard Sheppard, a technically skilled designer with a talent for developing new materials, who was disabled as a teenager by polio, and Jean Shufflebottom, his wife, a gifted architect in her own right. The company's first big success was the Jicwood Bungalow in 1944, which used materials from aircraft manufacture. By 1950 the company had built a reputation for large modern projects, and Richard Sheppard had a new business partner, Geoffrey Robson, who added his name to the company's. At first they specialised in schools, building more than 80 in the 1950s. In 1958 the company won a competition to design a science college and memorial to Winston Churchill – Churchill College, Cambridge. Later they branched out into other public buildings, and by the 1970s they had built a strong reputation in commercial and retail buildings. Sheppard was knighted for his work in architecture, In the 1990s and 2000s the firm entered a period of growth with often large-scale buildings like The Helicon, Toyota/Lexus HQ, MediaCityUK, the Lighthouse, Barking Riverside and Siemens HQ Middle East. Many of these were important landmarks in the development of sustainable architecture. For instance, the Lighthouse was the UK's first net zero carbon house, the Helicon was an early sustainable office/retail building, and MediaCityUK was built as a sustainable community, verified by international sustainability regulator BREEAM (the first corporate building to achieve this). The firm's recently completed and ongoing projects include the transformation of an urban block in London's Fitzrovia (Fitzroy Place), the completion of a new science building at the University of Hertfordshire, and the creation of new residential-led neighbourhoods of 1500 homes at Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park (East Wick and Sweetwater). Sustainability The Lighthouse, Britain's first zero-carbon house Sheppard Robson is known for sustainable architecture, which it helped to pioneer in the early 1990s with buildings like the Helicon and the Lighthouse, which was the UK's first net zero-carbon house. Lancaster Institute for the Contemporary Arts, completed in 2010, was the first college or university to win a BREEAM Outstanding rating for sustainability. The Helicon was an early sustainable office/shop building, and MediaCityUK was built as a sustainable community, verified by the international sustainability regulator BREEAM (the first corporate building to achieve this). Company Sheppard Robson has three offices in London, Manchester and Glasgow, and about three hundred and fifty employees, mostly architects.

It has a population of 6,195. It lies in the historical region of Cieszyn Silesia. The village has been known for its thermal qualities. As early as in 19th century waters rich in iodide-bromine salts. Every year many people suffering from respiratory illnesses visit. Presently there are three medical centers, which offer among other things specialist rehabilitation programs for individuals. There are also holiday-recreation facilities, bike and ski tracks in Jaworze. The tourist attractiveness of the commune is increased by numerous sport and cultural events presenting local folklore. The undeniable trump card of Jaworze is its heritage park, with over 15ha territory and with large number of monument trees.  Etymology  The Polish name is of topographic origins and is derived from sycamore trees (Polish: jawor. German name is a composition of a personal name Ern(st) and dorf (German: a village).  History  The village was first mentioned in a Latin document of Diocese of Wrocław called Liber fundationis episcopatus Vratislaviensis from around 1305 as item in Javorse. It meant that the village was in the process of location (the size of land to pay tithe from was not yet precised). The creation of the village was a part of a larger settlement campaign taking place in the late 13th century on the territory of what will be later known as Upper Silesia. Politically the village belonged initially to the Duchy of Teschen, formed in 1290 in the process of feudal fragmentation of Poland and was ruled by a local branch of Piast dynasty. In 1327 the duchy became a fee of Kingdom of Bohemia, which after 1526 became part of the Habsburg Monarchy. The village probably became a seat of a Catholic parish prior to the 16th century. After the 1540s Protestant Reformation prevailed in the Duchy of Teschen and a local Catholic church was taken over by Lutherans. It was taken from them (as one from around fifty buildings in the region) by a special commission and given back to the Roman Catholic Church on 16 April 1654. In spite of being bereft of place of worship many of the local inhabitants remained to be Lutherans. After issuing the Patent of Toleration in 1781 they subsequently organized a local Lutheran parish as one of over ten in the region. As a private village it had many noble owners. The most important for its development were two related aristocratic families of the Barons Laszowski, Nałęcz coat of arms (two generations), and the Counts Saint-Genois d’Anneaucourt (four generations), who were in possession of Jaworze for the period of 154 years. Many antique souvenirs of theirs have remained to the present day. Their remains rest in the local Catholic graveyard. In 1862, Maurycy Count Saint-Genois founded in Jaworze the first in the Cieszyn Silesia health resort. It has been very popular for many years, especially among Poles from Galicia for whom the freedom of speaking Polish language in the area was invaluable. However, it was due to the support and help of the Larisch family that Dr Zygmunt Czop founded hydropathic establishment after the World War I. Rooms in the castle which has been visited by many celebrities of political and cultural circles of the interwar Poland were made available to the Starost of Bielsko by the Count himself. It was an important fact in the history of Jaworze. Many well- known figures were visitors to the hydropathic establishment in Jaworze. Advanced works related to restoring the status of a health resort to Jaworze were wrecked by the outbreak of the World War II. After Revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire a modern municipal division was introduced in the re- established Austrian Silesia. The village as a municipality was subscribed to the political and legal district of Bielsko. According to the censuses conducted in 1880, 1890, 1900 and 1910 the population of the municipality grew from 2105 in 1880 to 2247 in 1910 with a dwindling majority being native Polish-speakers (from 94.6% in 1880 to 89.2% in 1910) accompanied by a growing German-speaking minority (from 108 or 5.2% in 1880 to 232 or 10.3% in 1910) and a few Czech-speaking persons (at most 14 or 0.6% in 1900), in terms of religion in 1910 the population was mixed mostly between Roman Catholics (49.8%) and Protestants (48.7%) accompanied by Jews (34 or 1.5%). The village was also traditionally inhabited by Cieszyn Vlachs, speaking Cieszyn Silesian dialect. After World War I, fall of Austria-Hungary, Polish–Czechoslovak War and the division of Cieszyn Silesia in 1920, it became a part of Poland. It was then annexed by Nazi Germany at the beginning of World War II. After the war it was restored to Poland. In the period when Jaworze functioned as a health resort, it became renowned due to the writings of Wincenty Pol who wrote words of praise about Jaworze in Kraków's newspapers. In the interwar period it was the writer Maria Dąbrowska who gave Jaworze wide publicity. She was a visitor to the hydropathic establishment in Jaworze where she wrote, among other things, part of her work „Noce i dnie” and some other less known pieces. Also Melchior Wańkowicz was writing here his piece „Dysk Olimpijski”. Destroyed during a few months of fights, after the war Jaworze has struggled for a long time to rebuild its existence and striven in vain to continue works connected with restoring the village the status of a health resort. Nevertheless, it remained a health and tourist resort with two sanatoriums and a growing number of recreation centres over the years. At the same time, entertainment and recreation facilities were being built. Depriving Jaworze of administrative independence in 1973 was the reason for stopping a planned development of the village in this direction. Because of the firm attitude of inhabitants, Jaworze became an independent commune again in 1991 after eighteen years break and is now following its development plan.  Geography  Jaworze lies in Silesian Foothills and on northern edge of Silesian Beskids. Four valleys crossing the village – of Kammienny, Wysoki, Szeroki and Jesionki streams abundant with flora enriched with protected species and frequently visited walking areas. The south border of the commune are the peaks of mountains visited in large numbers by tourists. The main street of Jaworze called Zdrojowa Street, almost 4 km long, runs from the north border of the commune at the state Cieszyn road to its south borders. One of the four hills of Jaworze visible from Zdrojowa Street is the historical Młyńska Kępa (403m) situated at the former Emperor’s track, also called the saline road (with an inn for mail horses) along which the army of Jan III Sobieski redeployed to Vienna rescue. The landmark of Jaworze center lying under Goruszka Hill (411m) is the monument for victims of fascism erected in 1946 by the efforts of the Association of Former Political Prisoners (59 victims). From there you can climb up the Goruszka constituting the only compact site of black pines in the Silesian Beskids. In 2004 these rare trees were counted and there are only 500 of them, what is worth mentioning they are not self-sown plants in out conditions. In the 19th century this hill was called “Allainzberg” (Mountain of the Allies) which was connected with the history of Napoleonic period and the fact the hitherto owners of Jaworze were Saint- Genois counts. On the top of the Goruszka there is a 200-year-gloriette which was renovated in 2003. During the conservation works under the roof of one of the columns the year 1798 engraved was discovered.  Tourism  The favourite route in Silesian Beskids is the climb or ride by cable car on the Szyndzielnia mountain and then marching or walking you may get to Klimczok and Błatnia and from there walk down to Jaworze or Nałęże or even further at the direction of Brenna or other mountain peaks. Tourism and agricultural tourism are essentially crucial to the development of the Jaworze Commune. Wooded areas of the Commune, mountain slopes and other natural values like mineral water resources are the most important factors which favour tourism development in Jaworze. In addition, the Jaworze Commune has good transport links, there are monuments of nature and interesting cultural places including monuments registered both in record of monuments and register of monuments. Hiking trails (e.g. Greenways) in the Commune and the direct proximity and cooperation with the regions of the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary are also of significance. The village offers agro-tourist households with a wide range of services, i.e. accommodation, regional cuisine, trips by horse light carriages, sleigh rides, expositions of old household appliances (heritage park), old constructions and inns, galleries of folklore artists. A highly important factor in the social and economic development of the Commune are brine springs that are present here. In accordance with the thesis presented in geological documentation prepared by the Polish Geological Institute in Warsaw, it was officially confirmed that deposits of mineral groundwater of Miocene and Devonian formations, which are present here, are of great value for curative purposes.

Built in 1886, it was enlarged in 1895 as the principal residence of Sir William Cuthbert Quilter. Requisitioned by the Devonshire Regiment during World War I and having been returned to the Quilter family after the war, it was purchased by the Air Ministry for £24,000 in 1936 to establish a new research station for developing the Chain Home RDF (radar) system. RAF Bawdsey was a base through the Cold War until the 1990s. The manor is now used for PGL holidays and courses, and has a small museum in the Radar Transmitter Block. History =Quilter period: 1886 to 1936= Bawdsey Manor was built in 1886 and enlarged in 1895 by William Quilter who was an art collector, one of the founders of the National Telephone Company, and was Liberal/Liberal Unionist Member of Parliament for Sudbury. He established a steam-powered chain ferry across the River Deben in 1894 to access the nearest railway station at Felixstowe. It was known as the Bawdsey Ferry and ran until 1931. The ferry now operates using a motor-launch at weekends during the summer. Maude Marion Quilter (born about 1868) of Bawdsey Manor, daughter of Sir William Quilter, 1st Baronet, married Frederick Denny in 1888 and later had Horwood House as her country residence. It was at Bawdsey Manor that she knew of Harry Thrower, the father of Percy Thrower, as he was a gardener there, it being his first gardening position. When Maude wanted a head gardener at Horwood House, she recruited Harry and he remained there for the rest of his life. =RAF Base: 1936 to 1990= In February 1936 research scientists, including Robert Watson-Watt moved into the Manor to begin research and development into radar for practical military use and it became known as RAF Bawdsey. Stables and outbuildings were converted into workshops and 240 ft wooden receiver towers and 360 ft steel transmitter towers were built. Bawdsey was the Air Ministry's secret radar research establishment until this moved away on the outbreak of war in 1939. Most of the key radar scientists of the day, and the first generation of RAF and WAAF radar personnel, were trained there. From 1937 Bawdsey was operational as the first of the RDF (radar) Chain Home, and during World War 2 also acquired Chain Home Low and Coast Defence/Centimetric equipment for tracking enemy ships. It continued as a radar station through most of the Cold War. Demolition of the 10 towers began in the 1960s, and all are now gone. Bawdsey Manor continued as an RAF base through the Cold War and Bloodhound Missiles were sited on the cliffs until the Bloodhound force ceased operations in 1990, when all the missiles were withdrawn to RAF West Raynham. RAF Bawdsey was closed in 1991. =Since 1990= The Manor, grounds, and associated buildings were used from 1994 to 2016 to house Alexanders College, a boarding and day school for children from ages 11 to 18. The Transmitter Block is a museum, with limited opening hours, and was featured in the BBC Restoration programme. The exhibit is known as \\"The Magic Ear\\", and is operated by the Bawdsey Radar Group. =2017= The property was sold to PGL Travel Ltd. and was opened for summer 2017.

Naples, 10 August 1728; d. Naples, November, 1772) was a canonist and archaeologist. He entered the seminary of Naples in 1744, and was ordained priest in 1752. He subsequently devoted himself to the study of history, philosophy, and the Oriental languages. He became censor of books and synodal examiner for the archdiocese of Naples, and wrote the notes for the Italian edition of the ecclesiastical history of the Lutheran historian, Johann Lorenz Mosheim.

Listed at and , Bruckbauer batted and threw right-handed. He was born in New Ulm, Minnesota. Bruckbauer was one of the better pitchers in Minnesota Golden Gophers history before making one appearance for the Minnesota Twins during the 1961 season. In two years with the Gophers, Bruckbauer posted a 16–5 record and received one of the bigger signing bonuses of its time, estimated at $50,000 ($ today), from the original Washington Senators in 1959. That year, he was named Outstanding Rookie of the Three-I League while pitching for the Fox Cities Foxes under Jack McKeon. He had a chance to play in the majors when the Senators moved to Minnesota in 1961, but a shoulder injury had robbed much of his promise. His Major League career, statistically speaking, was only slightly different than that of Eddie Gaedel or Moonlight Graham. On April 25, 1961, Bruckbauer appeared in a game against the Kansas City Athletics at Municipal Stadium. He faced four batters, allowing three runs on three hits and one walk without recording an out. Coming into the game in the fourth inning in relief of Lee Stange with the Twins already trailing 7–2, Bruckbauer allowed a double to Dick Howser, an RBI single to Jay Hankins, a walk to Jerry Lumpe, and a two-run double to Lou Klimchock. Bruckbauer then departed and his successor, Chuck Stobbs, temporarily stemmed the tide. Kansas City eventually won the contest, 20–2.1961-4-25 box score from Retrosheet When rosters were reduced from 28 to 25 players, he was sent back to the minors and never appeared in another Major League game, making him one of only 19 pitchers in MLB history with a career earned-run average of infinity. Following his baseball career, Bruckbauer worked for Deere & Company for 34 years. He died in Naples, Florida, at the age of 69.
